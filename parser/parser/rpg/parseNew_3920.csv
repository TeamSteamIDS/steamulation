												Take my starting ship and do battle with the Spanish Galleons. 8 cannons vs 40 cannons.First 10 minutes of the game and you have one of the biggest ships in the game, dance with the governor's daughter, own your own estate and declare war on the whole Spanish empire.A full game purely for the 'Pirate' genre. Not some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥wannabe.If you're not happy with any ships, pick a fight with them. Not happy because a port merchant ripped you off during trading goods, bombard the port and take it over. Governor doesn't want to let you see his daughter, control the port and change the governor. Unsatisfied because a country sunk your ship? No problem there, wipe their country off the map by conquering all their ports.This is a game where skills can beat brute strenght. Wind, ship size, upgrades, tactics and rum is all that matters. Arrrrr!One of the best, if not THE best pirate games of all time.			"

												This is hands down, no lies or embellishments made, the best game I have ever played. Perhaps my experiences are colored by a long lifetime of loving this game, but I have never found something that interests me more, that I can just sit down and play a few hours of and craft a life-story for my character, an entire persona. It's simple really, you are a pirate and the wide open world of the 1600's Carribean is yours for the plucking. The graphics are out of date, the controls are simplistic, and your crew will always get upset no matter how many famous pirates and ships you sink, steal, or scuttle. You can't win, mainly because there is no victory condition. You can save your family, you can get married, you can become the deadliest and most notorious man on the high seas, it's all up to you what you do, who you become, which beach you get marooned on, I love it, I've lived years loving it, I can't recommend this game enough. It isn't for hardcore gamers, don't come in looking to get the highest score, play to relax, it'll work, you'll love it, just, just play the damn game.			"

												I guess this game just tickled me right because I loved everything about it. It would be most accurate to describe this game as a collection of mini-games combined into a single experience. There's the land battle mini-game, the ship-combat mini-game, the dancing mini-game, and the fencing mini-game, all connected together by a sailing overworld. I hear a lot of people like the fencing and ship battles but dislike the land-battles and dancing. I liked all of it. And I don't often play musical rhythm games, either.I'll admit also that playing the whole game has a certain amount of nostalgia appeal for me as well. I played the original in the form of a demo when I was a kid, never got the chance to play the whole thing. Thus closes a previously unfinished chapter of my childhood here.			"

												If you’re an older gamer, then you are more than likely familiar with Sid Meier’s Pirates. It was one of the first games to give you truly open-ended gameplay – you were free to sail under any flag, change allegiances, be a merchant or a pirate … the Caribbean was an open sea for you to explore. The gameplay was pretty straightforward, but it had an engaging quality to it that would cause you to lose yourself in the game for hours on end. Now the game has received a much overdue update and its basic design has withstood the test of time – the game is just as much fun as it ever was, if not more so.The premise of the game is simple: you’re a young buccaneer captain out to make your fortune on the Spanish Main. You’re also out to avenge the capture of you family and rescue them from indentured servitude, but it is really up to you whether or not you want to pursue their rescue. The game will rate your performance more highly if you do, but you can certainly simply concentrate on becoming a feared pirate and leave your family to fend for themselves. The game does not oblige you to do anything.Politics plays a large role in the game as it did in the Caribbean in the 17th Century. The four nations vying for dominance in the region constantly shift allegiances and move in and out of states of war. As an enterprising captain you need to take advantage of this and always be on the look out for new opportunities.The animations are detailed and you’ll see your sails react to the wind as you tack or come about, the wake kicked up by your ship, and even dolphins who come to play in that wake. While sailing the seas you’ll encounter other ships and as you approach you’ll see the flag of their nationality and the ship’s class. Battles on deck are abstracted to a sword dual between you and the enemy captain. You can select a rapier, long sword, or cutlass with which to fight, each of which is a trade off to some degree between speed and defense. You have three attack moves to choose from and a defensive move to counter each.The cities in the game are for far more than sacking. As you sail the Caribbean you’ll see the relative size of each city and be able to tell its relative wealth from the condition of the flag that flies above the town.When in town you have several locations that you can visit. Each town also has a shipwright who can repair your battle damage, buy your captured ships, or in some cases provide upgrades to your hull, sails, or cannons to aid your ship’s performance in battle. Speaking of treasure, it wouldn’t be a pirate game without buried treasure. At the lower difficulty levels maps are always complete and well-marked and it is simply a question of going to the right location and picking up your prize. At higher levels things get a bit trickier as you often have to make do with map fragments and must search for specific landmarks like an arched rock or a clump of dead trees to find the buried booty.Overall Pirates has that hard to pinpoint addictive quality to it that will keep you coming back. Hours will disappear as you strive to complete one more raid or get your next promotion. It’s a magical quality that’s missing in most games, and one that will keep you coming back to Pirates as other games come and go.			"

												This is the best Pirate RPG I've had the pleasure of playing, and it's amazing in how it fools you desperately. You have this sort of ""drive"" to get a VERY good ship. So naturally, ""Size Matters"" kick in. You take your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sloop, attack a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ galleas and voila you think! Your ship can now house 32 cannons with a 200 man crew (I believe.) So you take your Galleas, you name it something like ""Josephine"" and drive it around. You keep your sloop with you or discard it, perhaps even sell it and you feel like Captain Jack Freaking Sparrow. Then you go into a tavern and the lovely barmaid informs you that there's a War Frigate out to kill ya, so you capture that. You now have 50 cannons, possible 400 crew, cargo hold of 128 ton and feel invincible. Then you drive your ship around and feel like the King of the World. That's how it usually is, and seems to be how most people play this game. It's the wrong way. You start out, you take your Sloop and find a War Canoe. They can be found amongst the savage natives of the Caribbean. You board it with your sloop and acquire it. The next thing you do is to go into town and sell your cannons and your sloop. And everything that's not food. You wont be needing it. You have your War Canoe. You then go to the tavern and recruit the 48 people wanting to join you. Voila, full crew. And you have your War Canoe. The War Canoe is in fact the best ship in the entire game. ""But Sir, what about when the English deploy a Ship of the Line to take me out?"" You board it. They shoot at you? Well guess what, I hope your Mother taught you how to weave, for you'll be weaving your way around the cannonfire into the Ship. You board it at once the fight starts. If it's too much for you or you take a hit or two, you're in the fastest ship in the game. Turn around, sail away. Nothing can catch up to you. Oh no you wont have cannons, who needs it? Sugar, spice, goods? With your crew of 50 whatever you plunder from the ships in gold is way more than what you'd normally be due. You take your War Canoe, which you'll name something like ""Arrow"" or ""Emma"" and ram that thing into whatever comes your way. It's the best ship. Here's why:-You can bypass ship battles. This means more gold for you. And I personally found them tedious-Boarding is more manly-Your ship is the fastest in the game. Get a quest to escort a Governor from Mexico to Florida? Takes you 4 minutes. -Hunting some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that keeps your family hostage? Like hell he can outsail you.-Smaller Crew means fewer mouths to feed, and more gold for you when you divide the plunder.-With a big ship, you'll either shoot something dead while taking damage or see them board you without difficulty. Why be the prey? 10/10 game would make my own War Canoe.			"

												I played the original Sid Meier's Pirates! on Commodore 64 in 1985.  I broke many-a-joystick trying to sail against the wind.  Good times.  This game brought back all of those memories in a massive flood.  I thoroughly enjoyed plundering all sorts of ships, I like the land combat, and the storyline gave the game something to work towards rather than just a blast-and-hack pirate game.  The nostalgia effect was strong, and for die-hard, long-time gamers such as myself, this is a must-have.  Best three bucks I ever spent.			"

												If you ever get the chance to buy this game at a reasonable price, for instance in the recent humble bundle sale or gamefly.co.uk sale, DO IT! This game is my childhood so perhaps I'm biased, but for the 2,50€ I paid for this game it's a steal.Although relatively short, you'll finish it in around 15 hours if you don't waste too much time, Sid Meier's Pirates! includes a variety of era's to play (1600-20, 20-40, ... , 80-1700) each with a different twist to it. As you progress your difficulty will be ramped up slightly if you want to, however for people who want a real challenge I dare you to try out swashbuckler without losing a ship.Good aspects:-Replayable-Variety of Ships to take-Ability to conquer cities and create your own 'world'Negative aspects:-Repetitive mechanics (Dancing, Fencing, Naval warfare)-No 'endless' mode available			"

												This game is surprisingly fun as hell. It's easy to control, easy to pick up and understand what to do and where to go. The only iffy part is that the game is mostly controlled by the numpad keys, which is weird at first, but you get used to it as you go on.The only part of the game itself that's also awkward, is the dancing segments you have to do to woo a Govenor's daughter. I would say definantly pick this up if you're itching to play a good pirate game that's been hard to find, and/or you're whetting your appetite for when Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag comes out in a few days.Seriously, go grab this right now, it's cheap as hell and worth the $10 (or rather the $3 I paid).

												Beyond the nostalgia I feel for this game, it is genuinely an incredibly well made game for its time. Open world (ocean) exploration, controll over your fleet and what kind of ships are in it, as well as multiple quest lines and missions to do (become the most notorious pirate, get with a governors daughter, save your long lost family etc). The combat is easy to get the hang of (it's basically just timed events, but with combos) but if you pick a more difficult playing mode it legitimately can be excruciatingly dificult, so you can't get bored with it really as long as you keep yourself on a game difficulty that works for you. I deeply recommend this game, especially when it's on sale.			"

												TLDR: I really liked this game, and it really surprised me. So I bought this game on a whim when it was on sale, a dollar or so. Added it to my steam queue figuring maybe I'd play it when I had nothing better to do. Fast forward a year later and lo and behold, I had nothing better to do, so I booted it up on a whim. I figured it would be a monumental waste of time. This was half right, however not the half I was expecting. This game is somewhat repetitive, sure. But it is deeply satisfying, and it took me a while to figure out why. You can play all kinds of naval war simulators, or sword battle fighting games that are much better than the mechanics of this game. But this had a depth come out of these simple mechanics that made the game a really cool experience. Moreover, this game fairly effectively makes you want to pursue non-combative game play. I'd never given much thought into wanting to dance in a video game before, but it was probably the most fun I'd had in a game, and it wasn't just the novelty. It's easy to make yourself feel like your character has a vested romantic relationship with the woman he is wooing and want to succeed in impressing her with your awesome button pressing skills. It kind of made me want to learn how to dance in real life.Also, did I mention that you get to be a pirate?			"

												Timeless game. Lighthearted fun that is still challenging.Have been a favourite game of mine since young.Amazing how it can still remain so relevant in the gaming industry despite it's first release.Has a high replay value as the outcome when you retire your pirate tends to be different.Diplomacy plays a part in this game and isn't that hard to manipulate to your advantage.And theres even a dating sim element in the game.Hope that future generations of gamers will still find this as entertaining as it is now for meMy only wish for this game is for it to allow my pirate to pass down his legacy to his kid and allow the game to continue indefinitely, but then again all good things must come to an end ( or so they say).

												It's the best pirate game I've ever played. It's also one of the very few pirate games I've ever played, so I dunno if my review will count for much. Surprisingly addicting open-world pirate game where you can go out and do random stuff, like rescue your family from this villain, go treasure hunting, attack other ships and/or settlements, acquire goods from one port and selling it at another port (trading), and even wooing (and eventually marrying) a random daughter of a govenor. There's fun mini games (although lots of people hate the dancing one) and you basically play until you grow too old to continue pirating. Keep watch of the morale of your crew at sea or they may end up deserting you!Only bad thing I found with the game is that the main character whom you play as doesn't look manly enough for my liking, and while I like the dancing mini-games, it tends to go on for too long. If it was a shorter mini-game, it would've been much better.			"

Sid Meier's Pirates! is a pirate adventure game. After a mutiny that put you at the helm of your own ship, you and your pirate crew arrive in the Caribbean to find fortune as you seek to avenge your family from those that did it wrong.Pros: Every tropes you ever saw about pirates are there: build your reputation and ranking with the four European factions, while also dealing with the clergy, the natives and the pirate community, compete against the most notorious pirates in history while using pieces of maps to find their buried treasure or the lost cities of gold, do ship-to-ship combat against raider, merchant, military or other pirate vessels, flirt with the governor's daughters by impressing her in the ballroom. The game is easy to pick up regardless of difficulty level, navigating, ship-to-ship combat and swordplay are simple. 27 different type of ships sail the sea, any of which can be captured, each with different storage and crew capacity, optimal wind angle, speed and turning speed. Ship-specific upgrades are available at various ports, capturing ships might get get you permanent specialists for your crew, a variety of items can be purchased in taverns. The graphics are bright and colorful and animations are smooth.Cons: The graphics are showing their age. Sid Meier's Pirates! borders on the casual game, as it's basically a collection of multiple mini-games: fighting, dancing, ship-to-ship combat, swordplay, city sacking, all mini-games with little depth. City conquering strategy is extremely simplified, and the game lacks any realism of the hardships of being at sea. Capturing ships will become repetitive after a few playthrough. The map is always the same, varied only by the chosen timeline or occasional city conquest of a rival European faction.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youOverall, this is a fun game, and that's all it aims to be: fun. It isn't a seafaring simulator, it isn't an action sword-fighter, it isn't a trade simulator and definitively isn't a strategy game. If you're looking for a nice, easy and fun game worth its price, then I'll recommend you give Sid Meier's Pirates! a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Freedom to betray your allies for gold and land.And when you're the most fearsome pirate in history you can still trip over dancing with a governor's daughter.			"

It's terribly addictive and fun.Sid, please give us an update to this almost perfect game!I'd like to see the map expanded a bit to include more opportunities in America, a few more mini-games and side missions, and maybe a game ending mission after you've played a perfect pirate and ready to retire. But don't change much; the gameplay is outstanding, the storyline is great, the attention to detail unmatched. Sid Meier's Pirates just might be the most entertaining game I've ever played.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is possibly the  GREATEST  game I have ever played.For a 2004 game, this game drop-dead gorgeous. The soundtrack is just unexplainably brilliant.The only thing that bothered me a little was the dialogues. It is just subtitles. No voice-acting at all.Voice-acting does not matter when you are playing a game with such wonderful gameplay.You can choose to follow the storyline of  finding your kidnapped family members  or play like I do, sail the high seas, sinking other ships, taking down notorious pirates and attacking settlements.This game is very nearly perfect and my favourite game of all-time.9.5/10			"

												Don't let the low (or non-existent) play time fool you. I sunk well over 200 hours on this game back when it first released and it's constantly on sale for 75% or more off on Steam, and it's already cheap to begin with.Unfortunately, there hasn't been a better pirate game in the past decade that can rival this, despite there being three (!!) Pirates of the Carribean movies released after Pirates! came out. Which baffles me to no end.The only complaints about the game I can give is that it gets pretty repetitive after a few play throughs and there's not much of a modding scene to make the game deeper or more varied.  In addition, the game can't be played at 1920x1080 resolution (the maximum being 1600x1200 4:3 resolution).Why Firaxis makes constant Civ sequels and not a sequel to this (or Gettysburg, or Alpha Centurai, or Sword of the Samurai or...or...or... you get the picture) is beyond me. I blame 2K Games			"

These and numerous other quests await - Ya'harr!			"

If you have never played this game, do yourself the favor and play this game immediately.  Simple but fun with a dynamic world that you influence.

												WOW. Sid Meier's Pirates! A true classic, in almost every way imagineable. I've played a lot more of this way back when.Gameplay:+Lovely fun.+The free choice of the game is awesome. Be a ruthless pirate, a mercenary, a trader, a romantic, a dueller, or all of them.+Faction system and promotions are very well done.+There's a ♥♥♥♥♥on to do, and I never feel bored.+Different ships for different playstyles.+2nd game has advanced startup.+Pretty large map.+The perfect amount of water.+Get married, own land, dance, essentially Capitalism Simulator 1660. Sort of.+-The easiest difficulty has wind always facing west.+-Non-customizable character, besides from items purchased from travellers, and that's barely customization. Mods, though.+-Sneaking into town is average.-You can't destroy enemy strongholds by sea by spamming the Spacebar.9/10Story:+It's alright, something out of a 19th century novelist or Hollywood.+Your family was captured, and, in the course of the game, you must rescue them and  find the man who wronged your family and essentially harm him.+Lots of side quests.+-Voice acting is suiting, but doesn't hit the right cords often.+-The health mechanic is interesting, but ruins a good game when you retire not fufilling a lot.7/10Graphics:+For it's time, great.+It has surprisingly aged well, for a game made 11 years ago.+The water looks nice, even on Intel graphics cards.+Intel Graphic Card friendly.-Some land spots look a bit... Meh.8/10Music/Sound:+Kickass.+There's music to dancing, swordfighting, naval combat, trading, the tavern... A whole bunch. And it's well done.+Sound is alright, too.+-Hero's voice.-The govenors sound like they're the High-Class Extrodinare, while true, somewhat annoying.7/10Concensus: I give Pirates! an 8.5/10. A gaming classic, that has truly aged well. Pick it up if you havn't.DayZ Review Gimmick: I was a bad dancer. The govenor's daughter turned me down. She laughed.

												BEST ABOUT IT:  The open ended nature, sailing around picking on ships that outclass you, and managing your fleet and supplies. WORST ABOUT IT:  The quicktime event dancing and fencing scenes are downright awful and the mere thought of them is usually enough to prevent me from playing this game.GAMEPLAY:  You start by choosing a country to side with and a small sloop in that chosen country's port.  You can get some info and supplies from that port and then you're off to sail around the Caribbian.  The ship controls feel fantastic, working with or against the wind, and there is strategy in what type of cannon shot you fire, round to damage a hull, chain to damage the sails, and grape to take out crew.  You also need to buy or raid supplies to keep your crew from a mutiny.CONTROLS:  Steering your ship and firing the cannons is very satisfying.  However the UI and map screens are clunky and seem like from an age prior to when this game was released.  The QTE cut scenes are obnoxious and repetitive but they can mostly be avoided altogether.STORY:  You play as a young pirate who is trying to rescue his family and defeat some marquis villain.  This is a sandbox game so you’ll be creating your own story for the most part.  There's no way to customise your character other than your name and some stat bonuses (1 perk at the start and others with items), but you can captain any ship you can get your hands on and deck it out with upgrades.GRAPHICS:  The main graphics look Caribbean and still mostly hold up today and are certainly functional, but the cut scenes look dated.  You have to use your imagination a bit.  The highest screen resolution is 1152 x 864 and no widescreen.  It looks ok though, and there are ways to force the resolution if you want.PERFORMANCE:  Ran smoothly for me and I didn't encounter any problems.SOUND:  Excellent.  The sounds of the waves, creaking of the wooden ships, and shouts of your crew are some of the first things that come to mind thinking of this game.  I’m not a fan of the Simlish spoken dialect though.  The music is fitting and sets the cartoony pirate mood well.REPLAYABILITY:  Replay doesn’t get any better than this game.  However I haven’t actually finished the story yet, it's just fun to sail around and do your own thing.SIMILAR TO:  I don’t know, the Sims 2 mixed with Grand Theft Auto 1 and Port Royale?RECOMMENDED PURCHASE PRICE:  I don't see this on sale often but $10 is reasonable.Sid Meier’s PiratesFiraxis Games 2004 (remake of 1987 original)RATING:  75/100			"

												I downloaded this game with the Sid Meiers humble bundle. I wasn't originially very excited for it, because I had only bought the bundle for the civ games but after playing this game for a few hours, I'm happy it was included. The game is a little confusing at first, but after playing for a little it becomes a bit easier to understand. However, I still have no idea what the main objective is besides the fact that you're a pirate looking to save his family (that much is clear from the intro). As far as I know you don't have to follow the main quests or any of that really, you can just plunder riches or charm governors daughter until retirement. After about 3.5 hours, I'm still not bored with the pirate life. I still haven't fully discovered all of the game, but the parts I have discovered are what makes this game addicting. I fully recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy or even just pirates.			"

												Yo ho ho! +Pirates+Sea Battles+Sword Fights+Hot Chicks+Raid Towns+Buried Treasure-Dancing-Ugly ChicksA great game, a true classic. Even this version is quite old now, but I remember playing Pirates! Gold for many, many hours back in the day. This version is on par with the older ones. Some aspects, such as the swordfighting, were better in the other ones. Other aspects like the overworld view and sea battles I liked better in this version. No matter which version you try it's simply one of those games you must play. It does contain a plot, but much like Skyrim it's up to you whether you follow it or not. You can choose to chase after your lost family or simply sail around looking for booty. It offers a wide selection of ways to achieve greatness, which makes it great.			"

												Do NOT be fooled by my 12 hours of gameplay. I used to play this game endlessly after it came out. If you love games that are all about player choice, then this is absolutely for you. Want to be a swashbuckling badass and go about destroying the caribbean in a hellfire of cannonshot and steel? Want to be a simple trader, escaping your past and aiming to lead a simple life of commerce? Want to be a hero, save your family, get the girl, and slap about the hapless spaniards? Do it, do it, and do it.Naval battles, sword fights, dancing, stealth, trade...it's all here and you can do whatever the b***h you like. The game's aesthetic is less ""reality"" and more ""disney cartoon"" which makes the atmosphere of the game that much more delightful to partake in however you please.Super replayable, full of player choice and a delight to both look at and immerse yourself in; this game has aged incredibly well. I want to join the throng that cries for an HD remake but...this game is a masterpiece as it is. No need for a newer version. TL;DR Player choice, high replay value, excellent and varied gameplay.

												This is a fun, casual game.  It is not, by any means, deep, but it's still enjoyable to mess around with.  You play the game as a pirate in the Caribbean pre-Johnny Depp.  You can play the game during various historical settings which basically have the effect of changing how much variety there is in terms of the different national factions.  The later you set the game, the more likely you'll see major French, Dutch, and English ports.  By contrast, in the earlier settings, it's far more Spanish-dominated.  This can have an effect on how you play the game.  With more factions, you have more ability to behave like a true pirate, sinking or taking vessels of various factions, and then doing the same to whomever they're at war with (and they're always at war with someone...).  When it's just the Spanish, you have to try playing a minigame where you sneak into the Spanish port, risking imprisonment.  Speaking of the minigames, they're generally good fun, if occasionally repetitive and annoying.  The dancing in particular can get tedious, but at least you're usually well rewarded.  As I mentioned, the game isn't particularly deep.  It's not as if you're running a wooden ship simulator.  The game's graphics are dated, but acceptable.  They were fortunately done in a ""cartoony"" style, so they age a bit better than supposedly cutting-edge visuals from the same era (2004), which now fall squarely into ""uncanny valley"" territory.  Anyway, it's a good game, and usually available on Steam for dirt cheap.  You'll definitely get your $2-5 worth out of this title.			"

-Quick Review-Sid Meier's Pirates! was developed by Firaxis Games and released Jul 11, 2005.Sid Meier's Pirates! is a part-strategy game, part-managment game, part-sailing/naval simulator game, part barbie-dance game, part RPG, part open-world-game, and even has stealth and questing elements.-Video Review-


YouTube™ Video: Sid meiers Pirates - AHOY! - Atratzu Reviews 

			Views: 442		

			AVAST! All hands on deck! Cap'n Atratzu presiding! All ye land lubber's an' scurvy dogs will be watching this here video.		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The story starts off with the protagonist (Your name goes here) as a little boy, and his family is abducted by corrupt noblemen. Then fast forward to being full grown on a ship off for adventure... Then becoming the captain of that ship.BAM!Cut scene's are over, you are now in control over what you do. Will you save your family? Will you pillage every ship you come across, will you rise in ranks with the different nations, will you hit on every Governor's daughter's (Did none of them have sons?)... the choices are up to you. Maybe you'll do all the things like I did, or maybe you'll only do one of them and retire from pirating.Controls:The whole game is controlled using number pad keys. You can use a mouse or  trackpad if you're playing on a laptop, but the game itself recommends you use your number pad keys.Gameplay: There's a lot of layers of complexity for Sid Meier's Pirates!. I actually had heard about the game while it was still rotting in my steam library waiting for the day I would actually download and play it.I actually had only heard good things about it, and after playing through, I can totally see why people praise this game so much!Lets cover what you'll probably spend most of your time doing in the game: raiding enemy boats, and dueling enemy captains. Once you set out on the high sea's, you'll notice the boat tends to move better depending on your direction and the direction the wind is blowing.If I didn't attack the enemy ship from above wind, normally they could escape me (unless I was attacking with a very small ship which could travel fast... but I did away with that strategy for reasons I'll explain in a few paragraphs)Again, mind you that the controls are with the number keys. so you turn your ship right and left with 4 and 6, you can change your sails with 8 and 2... and you can toggle between three weapons: 7, 1 and 3. lastly 9 changes your view, but I rarely found a reason to use it.While engaged in a duel you can choose between three attacks: 7, 4, 1. and Defending against the attacks: 8, 5, 2. and naturally you can taunt with 6. (if it sounds compliment, don't worry, it's really simple, 7 will do a ""chop"" attack, 4 is a thrust, 1 is a slash. 8 is a jump defense, 5 is a Parry, and 2 is a duck defense.As long as you start out on an easy difficulty the game will help you know when to defend and what to defend with... Actually I suggest you start out on an easy difficulty in general, until you learn the basics, you can always increase the difficulty whenever you destribute the spoils in a city.

My Sid Meier's Pirates! Story:I started out by sailing the SS Anne, I saved my Sister and plundered many a ship. The SS Anne, she was a small ship, the first ship I took over when I started the game. I saw no need to switch flag ships because I could just sail into enemy ships and take the fight to a duel between captians!This worked well for me until that fateful day... The day I met Captian Kidd on his Brig of War... I sailed directly into his ship and discovered quickly I had bitten off more then I could chew, but alas, it was far too late, I was locking blades with the Captian, but only with a crew of 20-30 so men to back me up... up against Kidd's 100-150 men.

A Screenshot of Sid Meier's Pirates!
By: Atratzu




You see, the reason having a big crew is important, is because as you lock blades with the enemy captain, both crews slowly tick down. If you cannot defeat the other captain fast enough you lose the dual, regardless of winning status.In summary, I lost the SS Anne that day and was stranded on a desert island and later picked up by another ship in my fleet....Later I was to come back and defeat Captain Kidd, and steal his ship. I renamed it to the SS Sucker Punch and beat the rest of the game with it. Saved the rest of the family, beat the ""boss"" evil NPC, Married and English girl from Kitts, and retired from pirating to become a Bishop. (actually I still have the save, so I could go plunder a bit more if I want a higher score and to retire as a Governor...Conclusion: I've only scratched the surface of the kind of crazy stuff on this game. Unfortunately it has a terrible case of the PlayStation2 face, and doesn't support 1920x1080 (there are probably mods which can help with that, if you look around). That's really all that I have to say negatively about the game.After upgrading my ship and getting all of the personal upgrades I was started to get bored with how easy my game had become, so next spoil distribution I kept going up in difficulties until I realized I had to chose the dueling sword, and could no longer dance with the beautiful girls because there were no helpful light up cue's in the bottom right of my screen...Basically what I'm saying is, if you think the game is too easy for you, increase the difficulty and it'll add MORE features, more strategy, and more complexity to keep you interested focused and getting more.

Sid Meier's Pirates: Exclamation Point is an action-adventure game released in 2004, as a reboot to the original 1987 game. The player character is a pirate on the hunt for his family members who were kidnapped by a Spanish nobleman. You choose a nation to align with, be it the English, Spanish, Dutch, or French, and set sail to save your family, alongside plundering and pillaging, of course.One thing this game can tout is the amount of freedom in your choices. You can go along with the main plotline, saving your family members, or you can simply be a pirate, plundering merchant ships and pillaging cities and villages. You can also choose to avoid combat, instead being a merchant and sailing from port to port, buying and selling various goods. If you decide that's not your speed, you can ally with a nation, build up a fleet, and set out to take ships and cities from enemy factions, with a simple turn-based strategy land-assault on the cities. All of this is inbetween the sword-fighting with arrogant captains of the guard, courting and eventually wedding daughters of the cities governers, and building up your ship and her crew.The individual gameplay elements are varied, if a little bit simple. Sword fighting, for instance, is a small minigame with high, middle, and low attacks and blocks, where you try and counter your opponent and push him back. Courting the daughters of governers comes down to showing up to give gifts, participate in different events, and go to ballroom dances, which consist of a simple rhythm game. Ship battles are the most fleshed out, with direct control over your ship, three different ammo types designed to take out cannons, crew, or the ship itself. The ship can be destroyed and salvaged for goods, and the crew can be killed and the ship captured, either through one of the ammo types, or boarding and fencing with the ship's captain.The pace of the gameplay can be a turn-off; it's very slow, with travel between certain cities taking months of in-game time. The story itself isn't very focused and is more of a set up for your adventures as a pirate, with the saving of family members only really contributing to a final ""point"" screen. This screen is a fun little screen to me, it shows beyond the pirating part of your character's life, giving you a sense of how they do with what they've gained during the adventure itself. If you've played Mount and Blade, you'll be reminded of the retirement screen. But apart from this screen, the decisions you make don't seem to have a lot of impact. Everything from marrying someone to saving a family member is solely rewarded with points towards the end, and a cutscene.ProsThis game couldn't have more freedom if you had a bald eagle on your shoulder instead of a parrot.Sheer gameplay varietyRetirement screen adds more replayability, especially if you're the kind to want the high-score in games.Good ship to ship combatConsSimplistic storyMinigames are pretty basic, if somewhat addicting at timesLack of impact from character actionsFinal Thoughts:It's one of my favorite adventure games, easily up there with the original Legend of Zelda. If you like pirates, ships, and the freedom to play however you want, this is easily worth the buy, but if you like an indepth and focused story, you'll have to look elsewhere.Rating: 8.5/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												One of my favorite games of all time. I played this version of the game back when it came out in 2004 and have had nostalgic memories of it since.It's a simple enough formula, you control a ship, and can sink other ships to acquire currency resources, and more ships. You can engage enemy captains in duels, dance with governor's daughters in ports, and there's some simple mechanics revolving around turn based strategy and sneaking into enemy towns at night. There's actually quite a lot of nuance to this formula as well such as rare items you can collect to improve your abilities. Dangerous criminals to track down, treasure to find, and a decent buy low-sell high in-game economy.All of this you go through with the intent of building as much wealth and prestige for yourself as you can, because eventually, you will have to retire from your life of piracy, and when you do, you want to retire with the most land, the most titles, and the prettiest wife.The downside to the game would be it's relative simplicity I guess. Although that's also part of it's appeal. In addition, if you put in more hours than I did, you may start to find the game being quite repetitive. It's a game where you have to set your own goals, and rewards players for taking that initiative.			"

												Best pirate game out there. The game is a remake of classic ""Pirates!"" and it is worth the title. While at first I had my doubts due to cartoonish graphics the game quickly won me over. It is a charming and addictive. The game consists of mutiple minigames (sword-fighting, sneaking into a city, dancing, sieging towns.) All of them are enjoyable even though they are really simple (not necessery easy though.) Your main goal is to travel around the carribean gaining wealth and prestige by acting as a coursair for 4 countries fighting over carribean. Additionally, you have famous pirates to defeat, family to rescue from cruel Baron SomethingSomething, hidden treasure to uncover and hidden inca temples to find. All added at the end in a score based system when you decide (or a forced at certain age) to retire.It is a game I return for more every once in a while.The only real problem with the game is its focus on using numpad, which you probably don't have if you play on laptop. External numpad might work but in my case (wireless logitech) it did not. You can change the keys in the ini file, but it is a rough start as you probably won't know what to bind it to without playing the game first.Also I want a sequel. Firaxis! Get right on it.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates may be the first game I ever completed to 100%, and it may be the only one where getting there didn't seem to be a chore. I genuinely wanted to continue boarding, privateering, plundering, pillaging, smuggling, fencing, collecting bounty, and just sailing around the Caribbean until my character got too old to manage a happy crew or hold a Rapier. I, personally, wanted to find Buried Treasure, Lost Cities, Lost Relatives, Infamous Pirates, Decked-Out Ships, and whatever trinkets or wenches were waiting for me at the next port's tavern, I didn't need a Quest Log to tell me where to go next.

												Full Disclosure: Used to play this game back in its hey-day long before its Steam release. Bought it again during a previous sale just to reminisce, and its just as good as it was back then.One of the classics of Sid Meier's earlier days, brought forward to 2005, as whimsical and as rewarding as it was back then as it is now, only hampered by lack of more modern-day support features like widescreen, stability on more modern OS's, etc.+ Colorful, light-hearted portrayal of the Golden Age of Piracy, with art direction that holds up to today, 2005-era warts and all.+ Still-unique controls (using the numpad keys) make it one of the more unusual yet easiest to approach and play games to date. You can play this entire game one-handed if you wish.+ A truly open seas adventure, with only the barest of poking about the overarching story involving revenge and skullduggery. Combine this freedom with solid sea battle mechanics, sword combat, and dancing to impress the local governor's daughter and you've got something unique every run.+ In classic Sid Meier's style, many options to set player difficulty, including the option to ""ante up"" at each ""dividing the loot"" point after ever expedition with a crew.+ Yar har fiddle de dee you are a pirate~!- 2005 warts and all. No widescreen support. Lack of modern OS support (with some display issues on Win7 machines). May want to play this in a window and set your expectations of graphical fidelity properly.- Bit of a conundrum if you do not own a keyboard with a numpad.- Some would argue that the seas battle mechanics are a bit shallow, the sword combat can be difficult to get into, and the dancing is nigh impossible.- In classic Sid Meier's style, game can be haphazard in difficulty gaps between the given difficulties. - Not a ninja. Or a wizard. In space.			"

												I just put 17 hours into this game straight in the last 2 days.  I had this game back in the day and picked up the remastered version like 10 years ago.  This ended up in my library a few days back and I had to play it again.  The nostalgia is strong in this one.  This is one I revisit from time to time and EVERY TIME I do I get sucked in like it's my first time playing it.  I have played and solved a lot of games (like, A LOT of games), but this one seems to be one I can revisit.  The vague maps, the different mini games, the overall joy of just being a pirate and blowing the hell out of ships is just as fun today as it was when I played it years ago.Pirates, it's been a blast.  See you in a few years when I dust you off again.  Don't change!			"

												I remember playing this on my old Xbox Original as a kid and loving the hell out of it. Now after playing it as an adult I can still say the same. However it's not without some pretty evident flaws.The graphics are dated but that's to be expected. This game came out in 1987. Some 15 from then it would be ported to the Xbox Original where it was still widely loved. And some 20 years later it would end up on Steam. Still critically acclaimed. If you've made a game that's obviously dated but still super fun and memorable, you officially made a perfect game.The combat does take a bit of reaction and timing however once you get the trick down you'll realise how basic it is. It's still made plenty fun however by the neat little details in the battle. Sometimes you can pick up stuff from the stage and smack the opponent with it. And some of the victory scenes after each battle are very satisfying to watch. You'll laugh when the opponent get's side-swiped by a box. It's not all good news however as I've noticed there is NO POINT to using any other weapon other than the rapier. The other to weapons don't matter in a battle that requires speed. Kind of a waste sadly.Travelling the world takes some amount of patience, planning ahead and a bit of luck. You need to plan your arrivals into certain ports to keep your supplies in stock, your ship healthy and your crew satisfied. And you also need to be careful about what ships your ready to battle and what factions you want to please. It's not all about ""Find the treasure, get rich, die happy."" You have objectives you could do to give yourself a much better retirement. You have to find your family who were kidnapped, you have to get married to a mayor's daughter, You have to get rich, you have to really please one of the factions cause they'll give you more land which you'll eventually use to build your mansion and retire and ofcourse you've got legendary pirates to beat to become the no.1 most infamous pirate. This may sound like way to much to handle but don't worry about it, this game does allow you to tackle these things one at a time.Overall the game is fantastic. It may not be graphically pleasing but honestly if that's what you care most about then your probably a treadmill hypocrite. And no one likes hypocrites. Despite it's shortcomings it's still a fantastic game and I truly hope it get's a sequel or even a remake one day.			"

												An entertaining and highly addictive pirate simulator. You won't believe how much fun it is.Most of the game is played in a top-down mode where you control a ship that can travel between ports buying and selling goods and engage in naval combat with other ships. Wind speed and direction play a role, but you can generally travel into the wind without the need for tacking. Your ship has up to three weapons which target the enemy ship's hull, crew, and sails. There are about 10ish ship upgrades, which you can buy at specific ports. You can capture extra ships and build a fleet, but you only ever control the flagship and the remaining ships just add extra crew and cargo.The rest of the game consists of a number of minigames and dialog trees.- There is a sword fighting minigame that plays like a very basic fighting game. You mainly play this against enemy captains to capture their ships.- There is a dancing minigame where you must react to a sequence of quicktime events in order to win the hearts of maidens. This is not much fun and is the worst part of this otherwise excellent game.- There is a buried treasure minigame where you walk about on land looking for buried treasure.You need to divvy up your loot with your crew periodically, at which point you lose your fleet and most of your gold and crew. You'll advance via the items you acquire and your quest progression, but much of the rest of your possessions will come and go over the course of the game.There is a plot about rescuing your kidnapped family, but this isn't really a story-driven game. Most of the actual gameplay is about capturing ships and searching for treasure.Yaar!View my other reviews here "

												This game is great if you've ever wanted to sail around capturing ships, being promoted, and beating other famous pirates. The different ships are quite interesting, though I haven't yet found a giant grand frigate or anything yet, it is still quite captivating. The various quests add depth into the game, and you will find yourself dueling for the win, litterally!The only drawback to all of this that I have found is the wind. You may find yourself going quickly in one direction, and slowly in another, while your crew may be near starving, or you are badly in need of repairs, or you're out of crew members. Also, some of the fights that i've done are quite annoying, as the computer will block your strike, and counter several times in a row, effectively leading to a loss. Aside from that, this game is great, and captivating for anyone who enjoys the era of being able to plunder the royal navies, or capture ports for another country. Nice job devs!			"

												Have you ever wanted to set sail in the caribbean, but you can't afford a boat.Boom!This game.In all seriousness, I love this game, because it doesn't force you into a twenty minute tutorial on how to brush your teeth. You start up the game, click twice, and BOOM! You're out on the open water, sailing a ship around. It's a true adventure game. Sure, you have a goal (your family got kidnapped or something), but the game never forces you to do anything. If you want to spend your days shipping spices to Tortuga and wooing the governer's daughter, you can!10/10 an actual adventure.			"

												While I don't have many hours clocked on steam for this game, I played hundreds of hours of it a decade ago. I basically bought it in case I ever have kids, or run into people who for some friggin reason haven't played this jewel. Aspects of it haven't exactly aged well. It's incredibly male-centric, you can't play some rockin pirate queen and romance the mayors of towns or their sons - and that's a shame. The game could use some basic mod tools to open it up for a new generation - especially since a ground-up remake is unlikely. STILL - the gameplay itself is perfect. Each aspect of the game is deep enough to mesh with the other elements, and it gets surprisingly complex at the meta level. Watch a gameplay video on youtube, if it looks delightful to you - buy it - at any price. If it looks like something you wouldn't enjoy playing, give it a pass. Regardless I consider this to be THE definitive pirate game. (as of 2015)			"

												So, I originally bought this game on sale during one of steams sales. I must say, I am very impressed by the game in a lot of different ways. Being from 2004, the game has aged well, and being a pirate on revenge in this game is still as fun from when I played on the Xbox years ago. I will go over pro's and con's of the game now:Pros:-Different countries involved in the game (English, Dutch, Spanish, and French).-Other famous pirates from history are in the game (Such as Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, Captain Kidd, etc).-Sea ship battles! (Why would this not be in a pirate game?)-Sword fighting!-Different quests (such as finding family members, finding lost cities, treasure hunting, etc).-And so many other pro's!Cons:-Daughter beauty rating (the game rates the governor's daughters off of their beauty. In my opinion, they should not be rated at all).-Crew unhappiness (this is tough to deal with in harder difficulties).-Dividing plunder (you shouldn't have to divide plunder several times throughout the game; I believe it should be a one time thing).-Getting to the city of Gran Granada (you should have to walk to get to this city. It should be accessible by water).As an overall, this game is a really great game and I highly recommend anyone who enjoys open world games and pirates to try out this game. "

												Might be one of the greatest games ever made. I enjoyed it immensely as a child and I enjoy still as an adult. The game play is simple and fun. You are a pirate sailing the Caribbean. You sail, sword fight, capture ships, woo maidens, and dig up buried treasure; all while trying to locate and save your long lost family. No two game plays are alike, and I've never encountered another pirate game quite like this one... Lord knows I tried.Because I am 6, my Pirate is the notorious captain Tite Hassole. Captain Hassole is a proud duke in the Spanish armada, until it suits him. He then raided the city Margarita about 3 times and turned it into the Dutch Port of Margarita, because reasons. Tite was also a bit of a player and while he would beat a hasty retreat from any plain governor’s daughter, at least 6 times, Tite Hassole gave all the crew's money away to get a ring for a lovely lady or two. A constant issue for me is the repetitiveness of the sword fighting, and to top it off I'm not that great at it. It becomes essential to know how to sword fight well, especially in the late game, but I never got over my ""smash slash really quick"" routine.All in all a solid game, well worth the money and real nostalgia trip for me.

												Sid Meier's Pirates! (slight spoilers) - A boy lived in a nice home with his family. As they were eating dinner, an evil man stepped in to kidnap them all, but the boy got away. He survived for years on end to eventually enter a tavern to join a crew. He had the choice of joining one of four nations: the Dutch, the English, the Spanish, and the French. This is where the player takes over and joins. Joining a particular nation only affects your starting ship as you can easily switch your allegiance to another nation or fight for no nation at all. Of course if you stay with one nation and rise through the ranks by sinking enemy ships and helping them with tasks, you will get perks such as free upgrades and repairs. Not to mention, all of your faction's towns have a governor with a daughter. They range from plain, to attractive, to beautiful. Plain and attractive women are easy to romance while beautiful women take skill. Skill in what you say? Dancing. It's actually pretty tough and I've noted that some people have ways to cheat it. You get various rewards for completing dances and can eventually marry. On your ship you can board other ships and make their ship your flagship, sink their ship, or take it to sell or keep. There are some nice ships to get such as the prized ""Ship of the Line"" crewed by the English. To get it you have to make the English hate you by taking their ships and assaulting their towns. Don't forget to pick up crew at a tavern, you'll need a lot to take on those bigger ships! Town Assault works differently from the rest of the game as in you take your crew to assault a town. It's kind of like a chessboard but it works quite differently. Other than towns, there are also Missions, the religious kind where monks live. They help you make friends with factions that hate you, and grow towns that you want to grow. There are also other types of settlements such as small faction towns, pirate havens. and indian villages. Other features include a top ten list of pirates, that you can kill and get good loot from their ship, as well as renown. You can also take their secret treasure by buying their maps. Remember your wife? She can give you a different map as well, a map to a secret city which will give you a literal ton of gold. The MAIN point of the game though is to rescue your whole family, so don't forget! I've enjoyed this game a lot though, so I'd give it a 7.75/10.   TLDR - It's a good game, buy it.			"

												This game is actually the reason I passed the Carribean portion of my World Geography class in high school. I'm not joking. I sank a couple of hundred hours into this over a summer vacation, and I do not regret it by any means.Pirates! is the second game by Sid Meier that I played. I picked it up on a recommendation from a close friend after trying my hand at Colonization, and I feel as though I made an excellent choice with the $20 I spent on the game over a decade ago. I'd have gladly spent $20 again for this game on Steam, and the price point of only $10 is excellent.The minigames can be a bit repetative at times, and the game does not work well on netbooks. Those details aside, the game is certainly a good combination of strategy and RPG. Open worlds have always appealed to me, and this game is one of the first open-world games I played as a teenager. The quests are fairly simple, but they are still engaging and presented in such a way that a player can easily lose track of time. The graphics are quite good for a game originally released in 2004, and they've actually held up fairly well for over a decade. The soundtrack is fun and thematic, and the bright colors made--and still make--the room I play in feel like the early afternoon, even when I've played late into the middle of the night.I'll take this over Port Royale or Sea Dogs any day.

												A joy to play. The main plotline is long and tedious, which is why you ignore it and go muster an armada to beat up the French. That's what being a pirate is all about!Pirates! is an experience, but don't go in with high expectations. Gameplay is a series of minigames, which are fun but ultimately shallow. The sooner you accept the mechanical flaws, the sooner you can go back to raiding port towns and dancing at social balls, AKA the good things in life.Note: The default resolution is crap, but it's possible to hack in HD http://www.wsgf.org/dr/sid-meiers-pirates-2004 "

												If there was ever a game that needed another reboot, it's this one! The game is a fantastic trip down memory lane, but after a decade, Pirates! shows its age. A combination of losing my adolescent imagination and technological advancements means that the game doesn't feel anywhere near as immersive as I once remember it feeling. 12 year old me could play this game for hours on end and feel like a Pirate on the Spanish Main - 24 year old me can only take a few hours before I find myself bored.The truth is though, the ambitious Pirates! never was immersive. The game is fun, but the charm and novelty wear off far sooner than they should. Within just a couple of hours, you'll have likely done everything the game really has to offer aside from finishing the main storyline of finding your missing family members and eliminating the other pirates. For the price, you cannot go wrong. However, the game doesn't have enough diversity in its mechanics, is not at all challenging and simply doesn't offer enough to keep you interested for dozens of hours like other Sid Meier games do.

												This game has a very special place in my heart. I grew up playing the NES version for hours and hours, and I imagine I'll be playing this version in much the same way. While this 'new' version is well over ten years old it's still such a wonderful and exciting game that only a pirate game of the highest caliber would be able to take it's position as Admiral of the fleet.What makes this such an incredible game is the sandbox aspect of it. The player can really pursue just about any path that pleases them. Would you like to honor your selected nation by protecting its cities from invasion, boosting its economy by plundering other nations trade goods, and making the seas a place feared for anyone that doesn't fly your flag? You can. Would you like to cast all allegiance aside and plunder the nations of their gold and goods? Go to it. Want to become a master dancer, have a wife in each corner of the map, and become the Romeo of the high seas? Your ship awaits. If you want to create a massive fleet of warships and attack towns you can do that as well. Sid Meier's Pirates is truly one of the most incredible sandbox experiences available, incredibly replayable, fun, fast, engaging, and the best pirate game available. Highest recommendations for anyone that enjoys this period of history, pirates, nautical adventures, and ballroom dancing.			"

												Sid's Meier's Pirates! Has a place in my heart as being one of the first few games I have ever played on my old college laptop, I remember playing this game and having so much trouble getting it to run on a laptop (which doesn't have a keypad, everything was done with a mouse or scroller pad)Anyway about the game, what can I say, it's a simple and linear game, but that's what makes it so likable I suppose, it's a game where your quest is set out for you early on, and you decide how long you want to take to pursue those quests. However there is a time limit as you age in this game (yes you age)I have to say by today's standards, it's quite linear but for a game of it's age, I must say it certainly stood the test of time, and if you have some extra cash leftover, pick it up, simple clean fun that's just good for a casual gaming experience.I'd recommend it for sure, but only if you'd like to try something casual for a change. 6/10			"

												Brilliant pirate game, especially on a laptop on a slow day. Nice and simple.Well, I say simple. There are a number of mini-games and mechanics that you simply have to figure out yourself, but it is quite a simple little game. Less than a gig. The cartoonish art style holds up well and doesn't look any worse when you're forced to turn off Shadows to get your frames back. I've had a few hard crashes, and alt+tabbing out causes a runtime error, but the autosave is brilliant so it's not much of a frustration.Though, the base controls require either a numpad or professional level mouse response on an on-screen interface. I found a way to rebind some controls after a couple hours hunting through forumns across the interwebs, but it's not brilliant.So it's not perfect. But I'm having a blast with it and if you're even bothering to read reviews then you will too. I'd advise waiting for a sale, it's pretty bare-bones for any more than $10.			"

												You take the leading role of a Pirate Captain in the 17th century Caribbean. Get fortune and fame in an attempt to seize your rightful place as one of the most revered pirate in history. Test your skills as a sea captain exploring the high seas and exotic ports in a richly detailed 3D world like for game from 2004. Overtake the enemy and seize valuable booty. Engage in plank shattering broadsides in naval battles, and in duels with opposing captains. As your reputation and skills grow, so will the size and quality of your crew, and your ability to take on larger enemy ships, raid and plunder heavily fortified ports, and locate treasures. There's a whole cast of interesting and dangerous characters to meet, mysteries to solve, exotic island to discover, and powerful alliances to forge. Like with good old England or maybe Spain, even Dutch or French. It's your free will what you do.Game is old (before Steam) so yeah, good old times when games like this were marvelous.			"

												Even over a decade later, the remake of Sid Meier's Pirates! is still arguably the best pirate game around. Most of the main mechanics of the game have been copied over the years as flash games and freemium mobile games, but the 3D graphics and minigames in this version make it worth a few bucks if you like that sort of game. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but at $2.50 it's a good pickup and you're sure to get a couple of hours of fun out of it.Just as a side note, this game really wants you to use a numpad. It literally BEGS you to do so. I have been playing without, and while a little clunkier it isn't awful. The game has an onscreen numpad that you can click on to achieve the same effect. However, the game does turn on NumLock without telling you, and since my laptop keyboard doesn't have a NumLock button, I was very confused when my ""p"" key started typing ""*"". I had to pull up the onscreen keyboard to turn it off. Again, not a big deal, just be aware that this happens.			"

												Normally I'm not big on remakes, be it movies, games, or anything else. However this is one remake that comes damn close to living up to the legend of the original. I used to spend hours playing this game on the venerable Commodore 64, then on the Amiga, and again on the old 486..First up, I will confess that I prefer the original, especially the Amiga and PC versions, but I still enjoy having a lash at this now and then. I actually bought this game when it was released, but the disc has since succumbed to bit rot, so when I saw this on sale the other day I had to buy it.The addition of extra subgames adds to the fun and there are many other small improvements such as being able to battle multiple ships at a time. The audio and the visuals suit the game well and the addition of cut scenes enhance the games charm.While it may be nostalgia that draws me to this game, I still heartily recomend it. I also recomend that people try out Pirates! Gold Plus (comes with the original 1987 game and the early 90's remake) so they can get a taste of what made the game such a classic, and why Sid Meier has long been considered a legend.4/5			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! blends different styles of game into a thoroughly enjoyable romp across the Caribbean. Great replay value. Seriously addictive. Not quite Minecraft levels of addictive perhaps, but at least as absorbing, and delivers more entertainment. In this open-world, you can avenge your family, woo lovely ladies, plunder cities, raid shipping; carve out an empire for your favored faction, play all factions off against one another, plunder some more... It's an old game now, and it's stylized graphics have aged well. Great soundtrack really adds to the immersive experience. Fast becoming one of my all-time favorite games.			"

												Short review: BUY IT! Heaps of fun, and lots of hours of gameplay. (my play time is under-represented as I own the DVD version). Long review:Sid Meier's Pirates brings a classic game to a new generation. I remember when the original game came out, and spent many, many hours sailing the high seas - generally ending up not much higher than a pauper in the original score board at the end. Make money pirating, loot towns, rescue your family - all while under commission from the Dutch, English, French or Spanish, becoming a Duke for all 4 nationalities if you pick your targets right.This remake has a few changes from the original that in my opinion improve the gameplay, though that view is not shared by everyone.The new dance feature adds challenge to wooing the governers daughters. The previous a simple dialog choice of polite conversation, flirting or marriage offers was replaced with a complex dance scene, which increases in difficulty based on skill level and attractiveness of the woman in question. If you have any musical background, this is not too challenging as all dance moves are 8 bar sequences so you don't need to look for every hand gesture once you learn them. Those who dislike this feature however will find it a huge obstruction to gameplay, as many special items, maps, and information can be obtained this way. While you can get everything elsewhere, it takes much longer.Open-world nature of the game means endless replayability - side with different nationalities, declare piracy on everyone, play in different eras when towns are hugely fortified or not - each choice effects the overall difficulty and your final wealth and happiness. Very addictive.Recommended :) "

												This game was my childhood. Although I have barely played on steam, I have spent hundreds of hours of my life in this.the game is easily one of the best pirate games around, except for maybe AC Black Flag. even getting it was a mission because it's not sold in my country. But I found a random dude in another country to buy it on my behalf. Good guy +rep.You embark on a personal mission to rescue you family from evil villain.Find the minion, find the map, find family member get more maps.Eventually you get all the map pieces and rush the fort.The sea battles are entertaining.the fencing and swordplay are fun.But the ballroom dancing, that is intense, especially on harder difficulties.It's also one of the few games to have aging as a mechanic for you but no-one else.You have a finite amount of time to win the game.Start as a teenager and when you are 70 or so, the dude who kidnapped your family, is still the same age and reallly hard to beat.Sail around, listen to cheerful piraty songs, dig up treasure and defeat famous pirates in laughably easy duels, depending on your difficulty.There are loads of different ships to capture and add to your fleet.And stingy methods to avoid paying your crew. (one of my favourite is to get most of them killed so that their share is really high and they don't get upset.)And when they mutiny agaisnt you, stealing your other ship and heading to port.There shall be no survivors.

												So I was bored the other day and thought I might try one of the old classic piracy games.  Port Royale has always been buggy (tbh I don't even know if it will work in Win 10 - I'll worry about that later) so I decided to fire up Pirates, forgetting that I had bought the remake and not the original 90's version that I used to play longer ago than I care to admit.Imagine my surprise when I'm seeing 3D graphics rtather than still images!  Detailed maps instead of pixellated blocks of green and blue!  A Jolly Roger that actually looks like a skull and crossbones!I was almost disappointed...  Until I started looting the Spanish Main and became the second most feared pirate in the Carribean.  Curse you Blackbeard, I'll have you yet!			"

												The concept of this game is from the 80s. So it's a bit dusted but this remake from 2004 is a great piece of work. It's got decent graphics (for it's time) and the concept has been enhanced with more mini games (dancing and town assaults). I really enjoy, playing this over and over again. The only downside here is, that there are not really good Mods available. Only some graphical enhancements have been fan made. But aside from this...Arrrrr !Get the game.			"

												A lot of fun! The sea battles are great, and the game play is varied through all the side missions. I can't seem to make much gold through trading, but there's plenty to be made as a pirate! ;-) All the upgrades, and chasing down the Ship of the Line, as well as the treasure maps and relic finding, makes this a very compelling and addictive game.

												This game strikes a chord with me like no other. Steam logs the time spent playing the game while connected to the internet. I've played a LOT more.The sailing controls are best with the keyboard number pad in my experience. While the game is entertaining at every level, I find it more so at ""rogue"". My only critiques are- I would've liked an option to speed up time on long journeys or sailing against the wind sometimes. - an option to skip the repetitive cinematics while fencing. I often run up and down those stairs at 'swashbuckler' and it gets frustrating.I sincerely hope they come out with a more indepth version of this one in the next 10 years and I hope I live to play it.

												I loved the original game on both C64 and Amiga and i'm a big fan of Sid Meier games in general eventhough i do not think he was actually involved in this remake. This version of the game has a bit of looney added to it, but it still works. Like all Sid Meier games, this game also ""suffer"" from the ""just one more turn"" effect i.e. if you are a fan, you will loose track of time playing this game. A bit pricey perhaps (currently being sold at €9.99) so i recommend getting it on sale. Keyboard and mouse are the only possible controllers and game resolutions need widescreen support (1280x960 is the highest possible resolution) but that's about the only negative things i can think of but then again, the game is from 2005 so i guess it is excused. All in all, still a good game. Get it on sale.			"

												I saw this game and after a sale I picked it up.  I was a bit hesitant to play it as I had a few recent encounters where I should have left the old games in my memory as they just didn't withstand the test of time.This one, however, is still just as awesome now as it was when I first played it.I have played a lot of pirate sim games over the years, and this one, to me, is by far the best.  There is so much to do and so many ways to play - it offers a ton of replayability.  It has all the ship combat, treasure hunting, town raiding, dark alley sneaking, and ugly daughter avoiding thrills I remember and they are just as fun as ever!A very easy to learn and use interface lets you get right into it and start buckling all the swashes you can handle!  I really can't recommend the game enough, especially if it is on sale (for $2.50 USD at the time of this review).  In terms of a game you can play for a few minutes when you're bored or spend a day with those swashes we just talked about, you can count on Sid Meiers Pirates! being there for you! "

												I haven't played nearly as much of this as it claims. But with this game I found out why. It carries on as a running process after you quit out. so if anyone ever reads this and I have some silly number of hours playing this game it's because I forgot to kill the process in task manager after I exited the game. (Windows 10 Pro - this happened to me, it might not happen to you) Do I recommend the game, yes I do. Get it in a sale, it's old, but it's fun.

												Sid Meier's Pirates is just a classic and a real treat for nostalgic gamer.You like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Movies or the TV serie ""Black Sails"", than this is your game.On a simple basis and good enough graphics you get to be captain of your own ship (later fleet) and cruise through the caribbean sea, getting as many coins and fame as possible.Through ship battles, sword fight and land assault you advance in ranks and fame. In taverns you get your crew, informations and sometimes maps and other gears. Charming the governor's daughter in the bigger ports is fun as well and chasing after famous pirates and take their gold just a sweet satisfaction.IMPORTANT:There are some issues with the program/software - like crashes or/and graphical problems - but through the great community there are ways to get it rolling. In my first attempt it didn't work (Windows 10) and I refunded the game, but got it again and after a short try and the help of the community and internet I got it to work.The game is just a blast and as good as the first pirates game (not ""Sid Meier's Pirates"", just ""Pirates"") I played in 2002.I can really only recommend it and wish you a great journey - Arrgh!

												This game is awesome in almost every aspect. The ship mechanics, including the speed of wind and speed based on what type of ship your using. I have spent maybe 12 hours ignoring the main quest and just pillaging gold and plunder of the spanish main. Im not saying that the main quest is bad, but its pretty repetitive most of the time like ""Defeat this guy, then this guy will give you a map to your family and do it all over again"". It is a lot of fun but the strong point IS NOT the main quest. I definitely play it for plundering ships, raiding towns, defeating historic pirate figures such as blackbeard, and finding lost treasures. I sometimes find bugs where even though the wind is fast the ship that the sails are in perfectly good condition still go extremely slow. The fun pirating system, plunderin, and raiding alike I overall rate this an 8/10 if the main quest were not that repetitive i wouldve rated it like a 9/10. "

												played this game since childhood, and was never disappointed its never geting boring :)some fresh paint and i would not hesitate to choose it over a tripple A blockbuster!the mechanics are easy enogh to learn in a matter of seconds but hey will keep you in game for ages!the game awards skillful playing and not only using brute force, but on lower levels it can easily be beaten (meaning you get too old for that sh*t) if you figure out how to dance - thats a tough one but if you start feeling the vibe it will come to youat some point the quests start to get fairly repetitive, but you dont have to care...just take your scurry little ship and attack every friggin thing you want! its so much fun to wipe out fleets, citys even nations and you will do a lot of it because its insanely satisfying!even a tiny war canoe can rule the seven seas! - or at least the carribean...the graphics are surely outdated but somehow they managed to not be awfulits a shame that you cant create your own hero or at least choose from a bunch of themsome modding tools would surely do this game good but there arent any... -.-if you are searching for a great pirate game expirience, look no further!if you think port royale was too much of a trading game then try this one and rule the carribean!the best thing that could happen to this GEM, is a remake with some ""assassin's creed black flag"" like naval combat and better graphics ps. you can be an grumpy old pirate that barely moves and still kick♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Although a bit different from the '90s original, this game is still so much more fun than a lot of the newer games that are out today. This remake is just as addicting as the original, and it's very easy to spend 4+ hours in a single session. From land and sea battles to politics and trade, Pirates! has something for everyone.			"

												Really great game! One of the bests if not the best pirate game out there. 9.5/10 because there is no perfect games :)Definitally recommend it, but watch out because there is no autosaves. So save a couple times while you play (I save every in game year) just in case the game crashes which rarely happens.			"

From sinking ships aboard your boat, ransacking cities and charming govenor's daughters; there's adventure around every corner. Careful though as sinking enough ships of any specific nation will put a bounty on your head and soon pirate hunters will attempt to chase you down.So buy your pirate garb that fits your fancy capt'n; it's about time we raised carnage in the Carribean!

												As other remakes of Sid Meier classics, like Railroads f.x., this game is a graphic rework with some new features and an attempt to get rid of tiresome features. Basic concept for these re-launches of old Sid Meier games seem to be ""look hard, play easy"", since it from time to time tend to lose its challenge. Compared to other games, I say this one is on the lower end as a remake, since too much has been basically ""dumbed down"", as for ship combat as one example. Alot of things is improved though, as the boarding combat, and some new implementations are present as well, as the possibility to win your loves heart by dancing with her at a ball. Graphics wise it's a huge improvement compared to the earlier version though, of course. All in all, as a time waste it's good enough, and there's some enjoyment in following up on the main quest of tracking down the evil spaniard Marquis Vatevahisnameis. For those who liked the original Pirates! I recommend this game.			"

												I honestly didn't think much of it even after seeing gameplay and the trailers and such, but I had like $3 to spare and the sale was on and I was like hey, there are so few pirate games I might as well own this one too.Man, that was the best decision I made during that sale. This is probably the best pirate game there is right now, and yes I've played♥♥♥♥♥Creed's Black Flag (And adored it) This game may be a bit old but it's aged like a fine wine. I thought it was just sailing around and raiding ships, but there's so much more. Tavern brawls, winning the hearts of governor's daughters, fighting historical pirates: It's even got frickin' stealth missions when you try to enter a town that belongs to a nation that doesn't much like you. There's even this mini RTT like mode when you raid a town which I enjoyed a lot more than I was expecting to. Worth it at $10, an absolute steal at $2.50 on a sale day.			"

												8/10An oldie but a goodie.Easy to play but deceptively hard to master, this, in my mind, is the definitive pirate game.Not a very complicated game but highly addictive and very re-playable.The eldest child of a wealthy and prominent family from the Old World, you were celebrating with the rest of your extended family when, in the dead of night, the festivities were interrupted by a powerful and corrupt Spanish Baron. Bashing down the door, the Baron and his men storm into your family estate and, for reasons as yet unknown, takes your family hostage. You, as a child, are able to hide from the vile Baron and only you escape with your freedom. Growing-up on your own without your wealthy family's resources at your disposal, you learned to sail, swordfight, and have a natural ability to lead. But you've never forgotten the Baron or your family, still his captives. One day, though, you hear a rumor that the Baron has set sail for the New World and taken his vast fleet with him. Hoping your lost family is traveling with the fleet, you go to a local tavern and sign-up with one of the Carribbean's four super-powers.This is where the game begins. You create your character, define his name, set his profession, and choose a European nation to sign-up with. They each have their strengths and weaknesses and each will give you a different ship to start the game with. Your faction choice is not a PERMANENT one; you can change your loyalties as often as you like or even openly pirate everyone if you want.-England, whose small but well-equiped fleet has secured a number of well defended ports. Their fleet is smaller than Spain's but is the most flexible in the game; able to do everything adequately but nothing exceptionally.-France, whose strategic, but scattered, hold on the Carribbean leaves them in control of some of the most lucretive ports. Their hold on the Carribbean is tenuous when you arrive and they are threatened on all sides. With your help, though, France can grow into a power to rival Spain. Their ships are, generally, more formidable than England's but less flexible.-Holland, the smallest yet wealthiest Carribbean power. They have few cities but they are all extremely wealthy and give you access to some of the rarest goods, items and upgrades in the game. They, generally, have the weakest warships in the game and could be regarded as the hardest faction to start with but their cargo ships can hold immense ammounts of plunder and, if you're willing to invest lots of cash into upgrades, they can be turned into surprisingly formidable pirate vessels. If left alone, Holland will usually be ousted from the Carribbean fairly quickly because they hold so few ports to start with but, if you support them, the Dutch are very VERY good friends to have. If you're nice to the Dutch, they will give you the tools you need to turn nearly any ship in the game into a formidable warship capable of challenging even Spanish Galleons.-Spain, the dominant power in the Carribbean. They have more ports than England and France combined, the largest fleet and the wealthiest treasure ships. The Spanish are merciless to their enemies but can also be powerful allies. The slowest to trust, the Spanish are usually your primary target for piracy being that you'll encounter their ships pretty much anywhere on the map. At the start of the game, the Spanish will absolutely dominate all the other powers but, over time, they will become the targets of multiple wars and will slowly diminish. Eventually, near the end-game, Spain's military power will be a joke and, though they'll retain control of many cities, they will pose very little threat to the other nations by then. (Note: siding with Spain does NOT lock you out of the main storyline of pursuing the corrupt Baron as it is revealed that the Baron has gone rogue).Buy this game! It's cheap, it's fun, it's easy to play. Some of the game mechanics are contrived and get tiresome after a while (the ballroom dancing and the fencing, for instance) but the grand-strategy of the thing is worth sinking time and effort into. From managing crew morale to knowing when to divide the plunder, when to take down rival pirates and when to fight make deals and when to break them, this is a deceptively nuanced game. Beware, though! Your character is NOT immortal. The longer you play, the older he will get. If you're careful not to get arrested or marooned too often and buy medicine from taverns from time to time, you can extend your life but, eventually, you will grow old. Though it takes a while, your character will eventually enter fourties and you'll start noticing his reflexes dulling. When you enter your late fifties, you will become too old to continue your pirate career and retire from piracy. You have a limited time to accomplish as many great deeds as you can (gain promotions, mass wealth, marry a beautiful governor's daughter, rescue your family members, dig-up burried treasure, etc) so you don't have much time to rest on your laurels! Simple and fun. Just play it!			"

												This is a great game. Take on the evil Spanish, greedy Dutch, slimy French, or perfidious English for fame and fortune. The progression system is truly great. Your life is split up into voyages the dength depending on how fast you can accumulate gold and how much crew you have. After each voyage you split the loot and get to increase or stay at the same difficulty, at higher difficulty you get to keep a larger share. You also get slower as you age which increases difficulty in some aspects of the game.The attention to detail is also substantial. Every faction has their own feel to them and they send out ships of their own with special missions that affect which nations are at war, the wealth and size of towns, their defence and even their allegiance. You can intercept or guard these ships to affect wether or not their mission will be successful.It also feels that there is nothing missing, and I was surprised at how many different things you could do. You could just trade, or you could fight a war, and everything in between. Sink ships or capture them, loot towns in land battles and install a governor of your liking, woo ladies in every town and even marry, search for treasure, lost cities, captured family members and love interests. There are lots of different ships with different stats, pick which suits your style best or keep a fleet so you have many options. Upgrade your ships and buy rare items to boost your own stats. Even the sailing is a mini game in itself as you try to make use of storms and wind to get where you want faster. As I said there's so much to do but nothing is hidden in some obscure corner that requires reading a manual to experience.My personal best thing with this game is that there are never any ""fetch quests"" so common in other rpg's, instead you are totally free to do whatever you like. Once you have captured a criminal there's never that annoying unnessecary return trip to turn him in. Raising your military rank is done by simply helping your nation in any way you want. You don't need to talk to someone first, just declare what you have done to any governor and he'll promote you accordingly.There are a couple negatives though. No ship can sail very well against the wind this means the game can slow down from its otherwise fast paced tempo. This is also not very realistic as some of the ships in the game sailed better than this. The tretirement occupation you get is also kind of breaking the immersion as even though you are a duke with thousands of acres of land and plenty of money you may get something like farmer or innkeeper just because you didn't get revenge, found all family members or got married. Otherwise a flawless game.IRemember how civilization has the mantra ""just one more turn"" this game although not turn based gives you the same feeling: There's always just one more thing you need to do before you can save and continue later.

												It's difficult to beat a classic, isn't it?In Sid Meier's Pirates, you play as an unnamed man who seeks vengence for his wrongfully captured family. In doing so you get the chance to captain a ship in the golden age of piracy and plunder and pillage to your heart's content! That is, if you don't care for every nation sending their best to hunt you down. But let's face it, you only need to worry about that on the higher difficulties.Most of the game is spent sailing your ship between ports, and doing whatever you feel like doing in the process, whether that be pillaging traders, hunting pirates, obtaining proffesional and eventually noble ranks with one of four nations (or all of them if that's how you swing), trading (stolen) goods, finding treasure or romancing the governor's daughter. It's all there and ready for you to sink your teeth into.Some of the more exciting features include ship-to-ship combat, swordplay, dancing at the ball, besieging cities and of course spelunking. Although the naval combat is the most prolific of these, you'll likely also find a lot of enjoyment in besting the finest pirates ever to sail in swordplay and then digging up their buried treasures just to spit at their watery graves.As far as story goes, it's alright. The backstory gives you just enough to set out after the villain (whose name I shan't attempt to spell out for the sake of my sanity) and try to rescue your remaining family. Finding your family is like a treasure hunt in itself, only with a different kind of reward at the end.All in all, this is probably one of the best games I've ever played, regardless of genre. I might be slightly biased, since I used to own a physical copy of this game before Steam even existed, and played it so much that it eventually was scratched beyond salvation. Still it's a testament to its entertainment value that anyone would play it that much. And now I've got it on my computer once again...Well, reality is overrated anyway. So long everybody! :D			"

												Ahoy, matey! The objective of this game is to become the most notorious pirate in the Caribbean. Together with your band of pirates you will explore the Carribean, ransacking towns, wooing the mayor's daughters, fighting notorious pirates, and attacking ships for their gold, food, and luxuries as you work your way up the pirate ranks. This game REALLY provides a strong pirate experience.I didn't enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization games because even though I liked the macro management of the civilization anytime I would order units to perform an action, I wanted to be there in the action and not just watch a sim play out. I really love games that give you a macro management but let's you take part in the lower level actions. Because of this I was skeptical that I would like this game. But I can assure you, this game is NOT like that. This definitely feels more like an adventure game with a sim as a backdrop and several mini-games thrown into the mix. The game is completely nonlinear and really doesn't have an ending as you can keep playing as long as you like. The story is weak so don't expect a strong narrative. One annoyance I had initially with the game was that there are no keybindings setup and you can't set them up in the game, so you have to manually edit the game's configuration file to the keys you want, but once that's done I found combat and dancing much easier. I highly recommend using keys for the sword fighting and dancing. Pros:+ Nonlinear gameplay+ Strong pirate theme+ Good musicCons:- No key bindings settings in-game.I highly recommend buying this game. It's worth every penny even at regular price.			"

												Oh, joy! ""YOR MATAL!"" your pirates cheer after you capture a ship, whatever the hell that means (bless Sid Meier and his knack for inventing cutsey and timeless phonetic languages for all of his games) and your fist pumps and the gold flows. This is Pirates!, this is fun.You are Ingonito, young survivor of dastardly deeds and seeker of vengeance on the rum scented waves of the Caribbean. Your sloop, Revenge, is nimble and reasonably well gunned, and your pockets are light, your crew hungry for trouble. You have been to a town to recieve a letter of Marque from the Spaniards, the British, Dutch or French (did I miss anyone?) and now you course across the great blue expanse in search of bountious adventure.What ho! Dread Pirate Roberts has just issued from a port hidden amongst some jungled sand bars and he's telling you to watch out? Have at him!Launch flurries of cannonballs, but make sure you don't get stuck in dead air! Wheel around to dodge his projectiles while you try to maneuver your guns into position to hit his hulk - will you go for the ship's hull with cannoballs, go the masts with nunchuck-like chain-shot, or try to thin out his crew with grapeshot across the decks? No matter, this is all the prelude to the real combat - man-to-man combat with the dread captain himself on the heaving deck of his ship! Dodge blows, rain blows down upon thine enemy, chuck billhooks and drive him under a hail of swipes before eventually seeing him crash down - bloodlessly, of course - into the waves.YOR MATAL!!!!!Freaking awesome game. Lightweight, well made, endless fun, even the rinse-and-repeat gameplay doesn't get terribly old because of all the things you can do in towns, all the treature maps you can piece together, all the optional difficulty-boosts you can submit yourself to upon completion of certain waypoint objectives. Just a great, great game. And a great port, too.			"

												I first played Sid Meier's Pirates! on an IBM PC/25 with floppy disks (two of them, one for DOS and one for the game) with a greyscale monitor. I loved the premise, the fighting, the wooing and the general pirate behavior. It is all here, actually a couple of graphics versions are available depending on your taste. The overall story is that you were separated from your family at a young age by an evil Baron (is there really any other kind?) You take to a life of piracy and sail the Carribbean in search of loot, fame, your family, and the Baron (who is still evil). You can set your skill set to improve one skill, I strongly suggest fighting as you do a lot of it.  You can choose your nationality as Spanish (pretty easy as they sort of ruled the roost during the bulk of the time period), French, English (my choice as they start at a huge disadvantage port wise but they were at war with everyone so there are plenty of targets out there) or Dutch (also a good choice for a more difficult playthrough).  You get your letters of marque and off you go with a small ship and crew. Help your nation (or not), gain wealth and add to your fleet by taking ships (and crew). Visit ports and meet up with folks who can help or sell you map pieces to treasure or family members. Cuddle up with a barmaid or two or if you are lucky, a Govenor's daughter and find out about the goings on at port. Eventually, you will gain enough experience and learn the location of the Baron. Be prepared for a tough fight but if you prevail, you can retire with a high rank and lots of wealth.The game has several nice mechanics, your fighting skills drop with age and you may need more medicine to keep going. You also have to keep your crew happy and if you aren't getting loot on a regular basis, you may find yourself out of a job and out of luck. You can focus your efforts on your family or ignore them completely and still finish the game. The replay ability is fantastic as every game is different with lots of random elements (storms, ships you site, etc) so no two playthroughs will be the same. Your choice of nations and time period really do set different tones. You also choose how loyal you are (do you follow the Govenor's request, do you return criminals for trial, do you not attack the French when they are your ally?). By the way, the answer to the last is a resounding no.			"

												The greatest game of all time, no question. I've bought it 6 times over a span of 10 years, and I've never regretted purchasing it. This is a game I can keep coming back to year after year, even when my adventure ends and I stop playing I'll pick the game up in a year after I've forgotten about it and I'll relive the joy of sailing around the Caribbean plundering mountains of gold and winning the hearts of lovers. The game has some amazing features that were pretty much unseen in the early-mid 2000s, whenever you get hit your health gets damaged so the game rewards the player for playing well. The higher dififculties offer a real challenge and the game progressively gets harder as you age. Ships and civilizations trade and go to war without you intefering. Entire cities can change and the game will always be different each time you play. You can play the entire game as a merchant, trading goods from city to city or you can be a pirate that sinks any ship that passes by. You can work as a privateer and assist pirates and indians to demolish the cities of your enemies. The game hits the pirate atmosphere perfectly and the music assembles in a near perfect way to provide a casual enviroment that still makes you feel like a mighty pirate. The graphics hold up suprisingly well and even though they look cartoony they're still pleasant to look at and don't get tiring.Even though the game looks simple and casual at surface level, the mechanics go very deep. There are several hidden ships that are amazing if handled correctly (Indian War Canoe) and there are several ships which are nigh impossible to get (Ship of The Line). Pirates have certain mathematical calculations that determine their wealth and were they will be. It is possible to corner Baron Raymondo by watching his behaivor and seeing where he will go, famouse pirates also plunder cities and sink other pirates by themselves. Hint: Take out Vera Cruz and the other cities in Mexico, Raymondo and Montalban will only sail toward spanish cities.			"

												THE GAME! There is so, so , so many games that try to be like Sid Meier's Pirates but they are not.This game has everything from fight to trade, romance, strategy, treasure to find... and all well balanced.Game progres is cool. Before I bought it on steam I played it for hunderts of hours on CD. Ok with time it will get boring because even it offers a lot things are repetitive in a way but after you rest for few years you can become pirate again and plunder!!! Arrr! Full sails!  "

												Best pirate game out there.  Sunk a lot of time murdering Spainards and plundering the French.  The game is mostly a bunch of mini games that fit well together.  They provide a mix of things to do that keep each individual element fresh.The game play customizations give it a heads up on the competition.  True you play in the Caribbean, but you can play at different times for different groups of nations.  It also can be rather punshing on higher levels.			"

												This game is pretty cool I don't have too much to add to what others have said. However, whilst it is fun, remember this is a 10 year + old PC game. So the interface is kind of all over the place and the controls are based around using the NUM PAD. If you are the sort of person who is very much set into the more catch all modern control schemes of games then I'd think about it before you buy it.			"

Pros:	- Fast Pace Sailing- Stright Foward Barter System- Different countries to start from- More or less a choose your own adventure feel.- Ship combat is stright foward and addictive. - The cost of the game is $10- Great feelings of blowing up merchant and tax collecting ships.Cons:	- The game may get borning depending on the time you wish to spend on the game.- There is no tutorial unless you bump down the difficultly for tips during your play through.-  The game does loose its charm after playing for a few weeks.Conclusion:If you're a fan of Sid Meier and love Pirates then this game is a must have!

												Those who talk to me frequently about games will know of my complete OBSESSION with Pirate Games. Pirate Games as interactive audiovisual entertainment are almost, to me, an ascended form of art, and one sorely lacking in the modern industry. I have on more than one occassion been heard to utter ""The perfect video game has yet to reveal itself, and in truth we know little about what it will look like when it does, save that it will categorically and undoubtedly be an Adventure RPG about Pirates""Folks, Sid Meier's Pirates! is not that game which I describe.But it comes so damn close it can smell the soap that game used in the shower this morning.This is the key from which all future great pirate games were wrought and its influence can be felt in many of the newer pirate titles. Sid Meier's Pirates! is a true masterpiece of design and implementation. Right from the off you can side with the English, French, Spanish or Dutch and get to work plundering booty and sinking trade vessels. The whole experience is knit together with some fantastically well integrated minigames: dancing with the Governor's daughter is something you feel a drive to be able to get right; you feel proud of finding a swordfighting style that's right for you, there's a sense of power and achievement from attacking and sacking ports with your pirate army. It's honestly amazing that this diverse a range of game genres (Fighting game, rythmn game, turn based strategy, real time sailing) can fit so fluidly and perfectly into one title, but they do, and it's beautiful. An absolute must buy, despite the antiquity.			"

												Do you like pirates? Yes? Well then we have the game for ye matey!General: Sid Meier's Pirates!(I will refer to it as SMP! from now on) is a... pirate RPG... I guess? You take command of a young pirate and sail through the Caribbean in a strategy-ish POV. Your goal is to rescue your family from the clutches of gang of evil spanish dudes without dying. Now dear reader you will say well of course you shouldn't die that is quite obvious. Well it is not, in SMP! you only have a limited time to plunder until you are too old for the sea. That means be quick and find as many unique items that will prolong your life as possible.Visuals: SMP! looks due to it's sunny style and perspective quite good even for todays standarts.Audio: The sounds are not always synced with what is happening but are not bad enough for you to generally notice.Open World: The World feels incredibly alive as the differnet nations go to war, cities change their owner and missions are not as static as in other games.Gameplay: In SMP! you there are 2 kinds of missions, the ones that are directly tied to the story and side missions. Both however sometimes randomly collide as the Baron that kidnapped your family has also kidnapped your fiance.  Long story short: everything that you see in the world is something you ""can do"" and all of those activities are worth it, the Seas have tough spots and it all feels very alive. (Almost) Nothing that has to be triggered the old-fashioned way in a wacky sunny-pirate setting that reminds me of movies like ""Mutiny on the Bounty"".Story: While in itself the game offers a decent revenge story, the way the missions work make the game drag on.Basicly you hunt down those corrupt spanish guys to get information on the location of your family members(that look just like the day you lost them). However you will have to repeat this hunt multiple times to get to one of your family members. This is probably the only major problem the game has and even that is not that bad since there is more to do besides the Story missions.Final Verdict: Alive happy-go lucky Pirate awesomeness. SMP! is one of my favorite games and I can only recommend buying it especially if you like Pirates.~Captain AndGeo			"

												First, I can't recommend this game any more, it's honestly really awesome! In search for some great pirate games (and sadly, there aren't many) I remembered this fun remake, which I personally never played the time it came out, but I remembered reading about. So my opinion is not based on nostalgia. It's no complex simulation, no it's a fun little game you  can always start over again because you have total freedom what to do and when. 2 - 3 days you might have finished one career with a playtrough, but I find myself starting over and over again a new careers, because there are so many different options, time settings and different styles to choose from. I really like the style of firaxis games, x-com is also a remake from firaxis in this style, and it's awesome. They also have this distinctive look and graphics which age very well, I think besides a low resulution compared to modern games, it still looks very good! So, sail a realistic big carribbean map, do what you want, do the main quest or don't and then start over again. For a really fun and perhaps casual game (in a good way!) it's still the best pirate game out there. A remake of this remake would be awesome. ;)			"

												Please bear in mind, the following is my opinion alone. You may disagree with my opinion.Sid Meier's Pirates! is an old game, but still a good one.For starters, the map is huge. There are many, many settlements which means many, many ships. More ships means more conflict, which makes for a more fun game.The duelling system is good, however after about 10 duels or so it becomes mind-numbingly repetitive, and you just end up choosing the rapier and mashing 4 all the time.I like how there is no ""best"" ship - sure, the massive ships have a huge hull capacity and they can therefore carry more guns and more crew, but the massive ships are very slow whereas the smaller ships which have a smaller hull capacity and have less cannons are much faster and they can dodge their way out of ramming and situations with superior ships. They can even dodge cannonballs.Because logic.The graphics aren't very good, but give the devs a break, it was made in 2004.There are some cons, like with every game. There is a bug where when you go back onto your ship (when you have gone onto land) with the spyglass still in use, your ship moves ridiculously slowly and the spyglass is still there, meaning you have to go through the incredibly tedious process of turning around at 0.000000001 knots and landing again, then putting away the spyglass and getting back on the ship.And there is very little variation in the gameplay so after one or two playthroughs it becomes extraordinarily boring.However, while it still lasts, this game is worth buying. It's bad, but it's also very good.RATINGSGraphics - 4/10Gameplay - 6.5/10Story Originality - 1/10The Actual Story - 2/10Value for Money - 5/10Replayability - 4/10Length - Can't be rated, there isn't a definite point where the game ends, but you get bored after about 10 hours (counts as 6/10)Extra Special Feature - Balanced ships and huge mapMy Final Rating:6.8/10GoodMean Average rounded to 3 dp:4.071/10			"

												I was actually extremely surprised by how good this game was. I picked it up during a weekend sale based on reviews by some of the other steam users. I couldn't believe that so many people enjoyed a game that's essentially for kids.Sid Meier's Pirates! puts you in the role of a buccaneer who had his family kidnapped by your traditional ""evil noble"". You sign up with one of four major empires--England, France, Spain or Norway--and sink ships, conquer cities, raid caravans and fight off rogue pirates. As a naval leader, you rise in rank from a simple privateer all the way up to the commander of the royal navy. You outfit all of the ships in your fleet and engage in sea battles for ultimate supremacy of the Caribbeans.Sid Meier's Pirates has a surprising amount of depth for such a simplistic game. It has political elements, economics, resource management, sword duelling and...dancing. Yes. There is ballroom dancing in Sid Meier's Pirates. Let that sink in for a moment.I think it has something to offer for everyone. However, there are some downfalls. The difficulty quickly dies down as you amass larger, more well-armed ships. The various game aspects become repetitive after the 8 or 9 hour mark, and the campaign--which is quite short--can be completed with almost no difficulty, especially after acquiring the Duke's ship. There is a lot to do, but it can be done in a short amount of time. I finished the game and most of the quests in about 3.5 hours. So, while it is a good game, it doesn't exceed its financial value in any way. You get what you pay for, plus a little extra.PROS++ Expansive map with a lot to do.++ Amazing ship battles; very engaging and fun!++ Many different activities and side quests to complete apart from the campaign.++ SWORD DUELLING! CONS-- Limited story elements.-- Main campaign is shallow and easy to complete.-- Not much replayability once the quests are done.-- The ballroom dancing. Blech. As a guy, that was cringeworthy.Overall, the game is worth about a 7.5/10. Definitely a good game and worth the money.			"

												Pirates! is a really classic game for me - though I admit it could be part of its appeal to me was that it was so far ahead of its time when it came out. Free roaming, sailing with different handling depending on the size of the ship, a map based on the real world, two types of battle, leadership, piracy and privateering for political gain, marrying women, hunting treasure, searching for long-long relatives and trying to quell your crew from mutiny... all in a game from the mid-1980s. The only thing that even nearly matched it in terms of depth was Elite.It's received updates, and updates, and updates, and... it's still the same game, at the core.			"

												9/10This game is one of my favourite Sandbox Games that i've played in the last 2 years. Your family is imprisoned by an evil Spaniard, the Marquis Montalban! By this time, you are a young boy, who manages to escape imprisonment. 18 years later, you are a fully grown man, who decides to sign up on a ship (of your choosing). You decide whether to join crew with the Spanish, the Dutch, the French, or the English. Either way, you later mutiny against your captain with nearly the rest of the crew. After defeating the captain, the crew elects you captain. You are then allowed to do whatever you wish. Be that fighting for a certain nationality, being a Pirate and attacking everything in sight, raiding towns, attacking merchant ships, trying to rescue your long lost family, defeating the 9 best pirates in the game (Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, Stede Bonnet ETC) or just doing whatever you feel like doing.The game may take a bit of time to get adjusted to, but in the end, the amount of enjoyment and fun you recieve from playing this is just amasing! So overal, I HIGHLY recommend getting this game, especially when its on special sale thing (like the Steam Summer Sale ETC).			"

												This game is the archtype classical pirate game, and there is a reason it is still so loved today even as it was back when it was first released.   It has a lot of replayability, and I have no problem starting from scrach as each game tends to be diffrent.  It's very satisfying to finally figure out how to play the game well, and it took me a while to get it.  If you like oldskool games, or just want something fun to curl around for an afternoon this is the game for you.   Arrrrrgg.			"

												I got hooked on the Sid Meier's Pirates! series years ago and I was glad I was able to find this version on PC.Aesthetically the game isn't what most people are used to seeing these days but it is an older game and is very detailed in it's artwork. The period-centric music and sounds are great and while there is no actual dialouge, the gibberish word-sounding noises characters make can be hillarious in the right scenarios. The mechanics on the PC version work a little different so if you're used to the XBOX version like I was be prepared to retrain your and when you start dancing with the governer's daughter.It is a pirate game so you have plenty of booty and plunder to acquire as well as hidden treasures and lost cities and both sea battles and sword fight. Aside from the standard fighting and looting you find in most pirate games, Pirates! offers up trade goods to sell, daughters to be wooed and married to, and more importantly keeping your crew's morale high so you can stay at sea longer.

												Oh boy. Now this, this is one of my favorite games of all time. A rare example of where simple =/= equal fun. It's a rare example (if not the only) of where you can literally just sail around and do whatever the hell you want right off the bat, having oodles of fun whilst making oodles of gold. Hardcore to easy, ship combat is handled by steering the boat while giving orders to fire. There is a wide variety of boat 'models' and upgrades to temper how this handles, and there are multiple cannonball types. Dancing, and fencing are handled in a DDR fashion with the numpad, with 8 as up and so on. It works suprisingly well and can be rewarding to see your rougish character sweep the danish noblewomen off their dainty feet.If you aren't looking for an overly complex story and just want to hop in and have some short, but nonetheless addicting fun. this is one of my favorite games, and in my opinion up there with civilization as one of Sid Meier's great contributions to gaming.

												8/10For however long I have been playing this game, I can give a few things that I think would be helpful to someone debating on buying this. I bought this for like $2.50 when a sale was going on. The game is DEFINITLY worth at least $10.00 though...Goods:-Open world partly on ship, very little on land, some forced minigame, easy UI for movement.-Fun missions.-You get the sense of accomplishment for doing practically anything but losing.-Treasure maps are an entertaining game dynamic.-Take over literally ANY ship and use it as your own.-Raiding towns is fun.-Player items actually make a difference in a variety of aspects of the game.Neutrals:-Gameplay dynamics and reward increments revolve around difficulty.-Dancing can get more difficult as difficulties progress, and having to press 1 of 8 options in the fraction of a second based off of your partner's gestures is not very simple.-Crew is hard to keep happy unless all you do is what pirates would do even though the game gives you the ability to be 'good'.-Graphics match their time.-Winds heavily effect movement around the map.-You only retain your flagship when you give the crew members their cut.-Some ships will not engage in ship to ship warfare and instead will follow windward right into you and force you into a cinematic minigame.-Only about 6-8 ship upgrades.Bads:-Sometimes can be very repetitive.-Sailing down certain inlets can cause the game to continually ask you if you would like to anchor.-The Spanish own the entire south half of the Caribbean. (Not really as bad since it is pretty historically accurate. more difficult attacking vessels without upsetting the Spanish).-When escorting another ship, another WILL spawn and attack you at some point on the voyage.

												I've always wanted a good pirate game, where you can recruit and manage your crew, customize your ship, terrorize the seas, and search for buried treasure.  Though this game only includes some of those features, it manages to be the best pirate game available (even better than AC: Black Flag in terms of a pure pirate experience.)  Though the visuals are simple, and some of the minigames get old quickly, this game kept me hooked for a long time.  Hopefully in the near future, we can get an updated version of this game, or another attempt at a great pirating experience that doesn't include an Animus.			"

												Pirates is a good game. That is if we look at where it is in comparison with current games. In comparison to the games that were around when this was released it was superb.I am running it on win 8.1 with not problems whatsoever; OK, the graphics are dated, but not unplayably so; the sound is not the best around now, but again this is not a problem.I loved the original game and this rework is just as good. There is dancing, which I was always crap at and I expect I will still be crap at; the fighting onboard ship takes a bit of getting used to; I expect that will come back to me, (Already lost and slung in a French prison, just because I attacked a French ship and got too close and started a boarding action when I really should have stayed away a bit longer!) The naval battle mechanics are pretty good, not Black Flag but this is a game that is 9 years old!So, yes I do recommend it, I have had no problems getting it to run on 8.1, and it is a real reminder of the good old days! I got it in the winter sale, or perhaps that should be SAIL maybe? :-) and I have already abandoned one career in less than an hour. Not to self; always keep enough cash with you so when you escape from prison you can afford to repair your ship. (Attacking when your ship is damaged is not worth it, your victim can sail away!			"

												I was actually extremely surprised by how good this game was. I picked it up during a weekend sale based on reviews by some of the other steam users. I couldn't believe that so many people enjoyed a game that's essentially for kids.Sid Meier's Pirates! puts you in the role of a buccaneer who had his family kidnapped by your traditional ""evil noble"". You sign up with one of four major empires--England, France, Spain or Norway--and sink ships, conquer cities, raid caravans and fight off rogue pirates. As a naval leader, you rise in rank from a simple privateer all the way up to the commander of the royal navy. You outfit all of the ships in your fleet and engage in sea battles for ultimate supremacy of the Caribbeans.Sid Meier's Pirates has a surprising amount of depth for such a simplistic game. It has political elements, economics, resource management, sword duelling and...dancing. Yes. There is ballroom dancing in Sid Meier's Pirates. Let that sink in for a moment.I think it has something to offer for everyone. However, there are some downfalls. The difficulty quickly dies down as you amass larger, more well-armed ships. The various game aspects become repetitive after the 8 or 9 hour mark, and the campaign--which is quite short--can be completed with almost no difficulty, especially after acquiring the Duke's ship. There is a lot to do, but it can be done in a short amount of time. I finished the game and most of the quests in about 3.5 hours. So, while it is a good game, it doesn't exceed its financial value in any way. You get what you pay for, plus a little extra.PROS++ Expansive map with a lot to do.++ Amazing ship battles; very engaging and fun!++ Many different activities and side quests to complete apart from the campaign.++ SWORD DUELLING! CONS-- Limited story elements.-- Main campaign is shallow and easy to complete.-- Not much replayability once the quests are done.-- The ballroom dancing. Blech.

												Pirates! is a really classic game for me - though I admit it could be part of its appeal to me was that it was so far ahead of its time when it came out. Free roaming, sailing with different handling depending on the size of the ship, a map based on the real world, two types of battle, leadership, piracy and privateering for political gain, marrying women, hunting treasure, searching for long-long relatives and trying to quell your crew from mutiny... all in a game from the mid-1980s. The only thing that even nearly matched it in terms of depth was Elite.It's received updates, and updates, and updates, and... it's still the same game, at the core.			"

												Ive played every iteration of this game starting with the Commodore 128 version back in the late 80s, I got Pirates Gold in hte late 90s, and now this. It is basically the same gameplay from the 80s, which is endless, fantastic, satisfying, open world, but now with mini games, items and decent graphics. Its still fun today, even though its old. WIN.			"

												This game really is a Sid Meier's title. Not 'cause it has Sid Meier in the title, or 'cause Sid Meier made it or whatever, but 'cause you just can't fockin' quit playing it! Not even when you start to realise just how EXTREMELY repetetive and dull the game really is, or how MOTHERFOCKING GÖDDÄMN ANNOYING those worthless dancing mini-games are!

												I love this game, been playing it since it was first released. Sadly it is not keeping up with modern times. It was fine until a couple of weeks ago then it kindly informs me that 'it cannot initialise' dx. and wont run. I have tried it on a revamped new windows install pc, and uninstalled steam and all my games, then re installed it all, to no avail. The fault is at Steam end. Otherwise all my work would have resulting in success.			"

												As much as I want to be a pirate, I cannot play thisIt's not bad, other peeps love it, especially when they played it in childhood. But I cannot relate, I just didn't like it.+ : you get to be a pirate, you get to plunder and all that jazz- : controls and gameplay felt clumsy, outdatedIf you really want to be a pirate, you are filled with patience, have a lot of time and this is on sale, you might want to try it. But I rather play something else. Still, on it's age, GG surely and I'm gonna give it 5/10 and thumbs up only for other people. I would not play again.			"

												I love this game! I have for over 20 years. Probably my favorite game in the history of video games and I wouldn't be alone in that thought. This is a remake, of a remake, of a remake. All of them are good, but I like the 1987 version for NES the best. There are minor changes in this version that I do not like or enjoy as well as the older versions. (Cartoonish graphic style, silly voice sounds, and ballroom dancing) being the main drawbacks. However it's still a great game. I wonder if it's not time for another remake of this timeless classic? With modern realistic looking graphics, expanded trading system, professional voice acting, and a darker more sinister plot and overall feel. THAT would make it AWESOME! I can only hope.			"

												I brought my thirst and swag into a local tavern off an island I was sailing by, we proceeded to drink and dice, and having a luck roll of 77 when I was born, the gambling addict was soon out of money. He proceeded to bring me into a back room and show me this girl he had found as a stow away. Double or nothing he says for the girl as collateral, Wanting to bang out as many chicks as possible before the redcoats end my reign of terror I of course accept and walk away with a new wench. She proceeds to tell me she is looking for her husband, a naval officer who went missing, and If i was a decent man I'd help her. I proceeded to shut her down and make her train my sailors to bring morale up. A year goes by and I'm at another tavern; a man comes up to me and tells me that I own his wife and hes been looking for her all this time, would I part with her out of a sense of lost romance and love? I of course decline because this isnt a charity, he offers 10,000 gold, I accept. Its 4am and I log off, when I retern my coffers are filled with 1,000,000,000 Gold.  I proceeded to throw volley after volley of conscripted men into the meat grinder of local forts until I owned the worlds best fleet. Needless to say the game was ruined after that, but I was the best pirate in the land.			"

												If you played the original i'd recommend playing this for a big ole blast of nostalgia.  If you've never played pirates before, well i guess you can buy this as it is a pretty fun adventure/rpg/exploration type game thingy.... i suppose....  I got it on sale for dirt cheap and seeing as how it is an older game i'd recommend getting it cheap too.  While it definetly shows its age, for the price tag its hard to pass this one by.  I'd recommend it if you like old school games, but if you aren't into playing remade old games then skip this one as you aren't going to get any real modern play mechanics.			"

												FIXED!: I still say ""buyers beware"", but I have found a reliable, and good fix for the problems I have been having. I am hoping this fix is good for anyone else who was having the same issue. It is a game made before Windows Vist, 7, and 8, and thus was not optimized for play on those versions. I hope these solutions work for you, so that you can seemlessly enjoy this classic.Fixes random crashes: http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/31/pixel-boost-sid-meiers-pirates/?ns_campaign=article-feed&ns_mchannel=ref&ns_source=steam&ns_linkname=0&ns_fee=0Fixes ""steam not found"" error: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=26798077&postcount=13----------I love this game. I have spent hours and hours playing this before, on Xbox, as well as Windows. However, I cannot play this version for more than 15 minutes before it crashes. It is really annoying. There are some compatibility issues with modern versions of Windows that cause this, and has never been patched. I recomend this game if you are playing on a Windows XP machine. However, if you are on Vista or later, especially 64 bit, just beware.			"

												Looking for someone to tell me I'm wrong with the following statement.  This game is perfect . . . except for:1. Ship speed is everything for winning this game on the hardest setting, thus making all the dif ships you can get moot; expecially trying to sail around slowly with a whole fleet--something you'd never do trying to win the hardest dif.2. The game provides several avenues for making money, but just basic capture/sell is so much faster/effective than anything else; which also makes the rest moot.3. The sneak-in-to-town mini-game is way to high risk vs. reward, so again in a game you're trying to win, you'd never do this . . . unlase you ""save-scum""Recap: the designers put in multiple paths to victory in this game (a must for any ""good"" game), but once you discover the ""correct"" path, it is so overwhelmingly the ""correct"" path that even if you force yourself to try something different all you can think is this is stupid and can do task X in 1/2 the time (time - the greatest commodity in the game) by doing it the ""best"" way.

												I really had my reservations about this game. It looked a little dated, and not much content. I do like ships and pirates and trading and after I got the game in a humble bundle i decided id give it a go. This game is wonderful. You start out as an apprentice level sailor with the que's flashing during fights and dances so you dont fail. Then journeyman comes around and the que's are gone and you have to see the movement of the person your fighting or dancing with to have an idea of what your defence/dance move should be.At first i thought it was dumb that you could only battle one ship, but that ship you have direct control over and it would be difficult to control more, and relying on AI to fight with you brings in risks of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decisions. Over all, this game is really worth it. i would have paid the 10 bucks in full if i knew what i was getting into			"

												I think the current steam rating of 100% overwhelming positive reviews, speaks for itself. This is the game I played in 1993 remade for modern graphics. But the game retains all of its potency. If your at all intrested in pirates and ship combat and the carrabiean, then this is the game for you. It's also great for kids and adults.10 out of 10 would sail the carrabiean again.			"

												Should we accept a classic as a classic after the era it became a classic in stops being classic? This is the classic question that I would love to finally classify and I shall provide a vintage standard and time-honoured solution to this problem. Pirates, classically, are known as the typical scurge of the usual seven seas we are all familiar with. However, this classification is typically unjust. Sid Meier's classic experience, Pirates! focuses on the most representative of all classical periods of piracy, namely the Golden Age in the Caribbean of pre 1730 vintage. I want to point out that typically, a classic pirate crew of this day would not be a simble group of your usual scoundrels, but in fact much closer to the democratic nature of classical liberals. While I don't believe that the classic game Sid Meier's Pirates! represents this class of pirates in a standard manner, it does make a good attempt at showing how Piracy was a reasonable and standard career choice in this era.Now for the typical pros and cons;+Classic arcade combat+Classic lost family story line+Classic famous pirates (collect the skulls of all 9)+Classic ship designs +Classic game-Classic repetitive gameplay-Classic ugly charachter models-Classic scurvyOverall, this game is a classic that still stands the test of time. A true classic for video games!			"

I spend hours and hours playing this in college, lost the CD but picked it up again on a steam sale. Some of the side missions are a little dumb, like dancing with the governer's daughters...you'd think a real pirate would just punch them in the face. Oh well. still, the sea combat is great, taking out towns, ships, building a fleet. all fun times.			"

												This is a great classic. Each successive journey out into the world gives you the opportunity to build your wealth up through attacking ships, raiding towns, finding treasure or just the best buy/sell prices. The higher you set the difficulty, the more loot you get to keep. The fewer crew you have, the more loot there is to go around. So there's a real incentive to keep challenging yourself to take on more risks. Freeform Pirate games aren't common, but this is definitely one of the best.			"

												I still remember the first Pirates! It was a very good game to play at that time and i spent a lot of hours in it. So when this version came available i hoped it was as the first one and it was. It is a remake of the original with better graphics, playability and they added a few extra's to the newer version. If you are a fan of the old one then this is a must have, relive your childhood.If you are looking for a realistic sea battle game then this is not the game you are looking for it is a casual game. Con's - User controls are somewhat unusual. Takes a few to get used to but not a real hinderance.Pro's- Different activities to pursue. Be a trader, Pirate or go out and conquer for your nation.- Easy battles which makes it fun to play, it does not take ages to conquer a ship or town.			"

												Sid Meier has made many games with clever tactical depth, but is not so swollen with rules, so that anybody can jump right in. Pirates! continues the tradition by being a game chock full of strategy, but is highly accessible.The game is a sandbox. You can go anywhere, and do anything, within the Spanish Main. Generally, you plunder ships or towns, and get promoted by friendly nations. There are plenty of other things to do, too.Tasks you perform have an associated action oriented mini-game. You'll be ship-to-ship battling and swordfighting a lot. I like most of these games, though your mileage may vary. Many people have mixed feelings about them.As far as management goes, the game cuts out micro-managing. The action just keeps flowing. The typical mundane busy work of hard-core strategy games is kindly removed here, in order to get to the good bits. There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made, but you get to think in a sense of what you WANT to do, not what you HAVE to do.Certain things are a little tricky to get used to. Sailing East is much harder than sailing West. Your crew slowly becomes restless over time, forcing you to pay them off and take a few months vacation before going back to sailing.After you get to the ripe old age of about 35, your health starts to decline, and you might have to retire before too long. This takes you to an amusing detailed report on your post-pirate life. Hopefully you are a Governor instead of a Pauper!The graphics and sound are cartoony. Everything looks like it's from a Disney/Pixar movie, and the voice acting is done in jibberish, like in The Sims. Subtitles are in English, though. The cartoony feel is not bad, but is sometimes just a little TOO campy.The controls are a bit strange. While you can use a mouse, you're better off doing the mini-games using the numpad. It's a little awkward at first, but you get used to it fairly soon.Pirates! is one of my all time favorite games. Two thumbs and a wooden peg-leg up!			"

												Pirates! is a game I played quite a bit in college, and playing it again now, it holds up surprisingly well. You play as a Caribbean pirate in a small ship, and you can use it to build up a huge fleet, earn a fortune, find lost cities of gold, and do tons of other things. More than anything else, Pirates! is a sandbox game. It will suggest things to do, but you're free to set your own goals.When you're not sailing, most of the Pirates! gameplay is in the form of mini-games. You'll become very familiar with Fencing... your sword will solve many problems. But you can also participate in naval combat, dance, siege towns, sneak into hostile towns, or hune around the wilderness for treasure. Most of them are short, simple, skill-based games that are incredibly easy on low difficulties, but can get near impossible on the higher ones.The graphics were good for their time, and they've held up better than I expected. The music is nice, but there's not enough of it. The game usually controls well enough.I got this game when it went on sale, and I've been having a lot of fun with it again. I'd wait for a sale to get Pirates!, but when it does, this is a game worth getting.			"

												Pirates! is the all the swashbuckling fun a person could want from a pirate-themed video game without being too restrictive. It lays out a basic backstory with optional follow-through, but otherwises allows the player to run wild in the 17th Century Caribbean. At times, however, the game can be a little too hands off in terms of direction (explanation of game and world mechanics and parts of the ""storyline""). The controls can a little confusing at first, and I would really recommend a number pad if using a laptop but a mouse is a good alternative also (I've used both and found that while the mouse is more convenient a number pad makes the game much easier to play). Overall, this game is easy to get a hang of quickly and you'll have a fantastic time pirating your way across the high seas.			"

												Score: 10/10Although Sid Meier's Pirates! is a very old game, it gives the player an unrivaled pirate experience. You are free to make your choices and shape the world in any way you see fit, and that is what I call a true RPG. Which brings us to what I believe is the strongest point of this game, the hability to provide an amazing interaction with the game world, even if you don't realized as you do, as every action brings a reaction somewhere. If you save the merchant ship from the pirates, your allies may prosper, but that very pirate ship that you sunk will be a hard hit in the pirate community. Or, if you are to become the most fiered pirate of the seas, you might find that your pillage is bringing cities to decline.The other mechanics in the game do not present any remarkable point, but been able to have old school ship fight is quite amusing, as well as deciding your batles by your favorite method of combat (ship/sword fight). The graphics and sound are alright and there is no plot, you make your own history.This game deserves a 10 for the great interaction mechanic it carries even being decades old! Definitely a gap to be yet filled.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a surprisingly fun and deep simulation of being a ship captain in the Caribbean during the glory days of piracy. You're not limited to being a pirate. Although the game doesn't explicitly say so, the simulation of the four major powers and two minor powers operating in the Caribbean is quite complex. There's a real war going on, and all of it happens by sea. Although invasions happen over land, troops don't get into position to invade unless they're transported by ship. Many troops don't get paid and people don't get fed unless their wages and food arrive by sea. The economy is primarily based on sea trade, and blockades occur. Warships must be built and sailed where they're needed. And governors and other important people move around by ship.All this means that there's a rich environment for you to play in, and many possibilities for how you want to play. You can, of course, be a pirate and loot the treasure ships of all the wealthy nations. You can serve a nation as a legitimate but independent privateer. You can pretend to be part of a nation's navy and go to war on its behalf, attacking targets of military importance and earning the appreciation of the nation even if you don't get much money out of it. You can even take part in land-based invasions and try to conquer cities, either for the benefit of a nation - territory really changes hands in this game - or just to loot and pillage. Or you can be a peaceful trader. The lesser powers, pirates and Indians (i.e. Native Americans), have their own agendas which enrich the environment further.Besides the sandbox gameplay, you have several concrete goals: rescue your family, acquire wealth and fame, woo beautiful women, find hidden treasure and lost cities, bring villains to justice, and defeat the top pirates in the Caribbean. There are also minor quests that allow you to act as a law enforcer (or turn a blind eye to crime in exchange for bribes, if you wish), and mini-games such as breaking into enemy towns, dancing (which is quite fun), and both real-time combat at sea and turn-based combat on land.There's a lot to do, and for the most part it's all well-designed. There are five difficulty levels, allowing the game to be enjoyable for all players, and several eras you can start in and skills you can specialize in, which increase replay value. The game's main shortcoming is that it's too easy, because it helpfully auto-saves before anything bad happens, allowing you to simply reload your game and retry. This diminishes the importance of many gameplay elements, such as breaking out of jail, upgrading your character, and maintaining multiple ships in your fleet, and leads to excessive risk-taking while dampening the thrill of success. The game really needs an Iron Man mode. (Thankfully, a mod to add one exists.)Another potential problem for some players is that the game doesn't have much of a tutorial, but the manual is good and worth reading.			"

												When I picked this game up, I had been having this urge to play a pirate game. Something open world, where I could choose my own path, but still be a pirate. I wanted the game to be about more than just continual swordfights. As I looked over the community reviews on various ""pirate"" games, there didn't seem to be a lot out there that offered open world freedom.Sid Meier's Pirates! offer you that freedom. You can determine the size of your crew, the routes you travel, even who you fight: you are offered the chance to be a privateer for any of 4 different countries (Don't worry, you don't have to serve any allegiance). You also get to decide if you will be the pirate that raids ships and pillage towns for a living, or more of a merchant/pirate that buys and sells goods as well. There is a main questline of finding your long lost family and getting revenge against those responsible, but it doesn't get in the way of any other path you choose.Now, Sid Meier's Pirates! isn't perfect. Some of the minigames get very VERY tedious the ninth or tenth time you do them (dancing with the governor's daughter). But all around, this is a very fun game. And for it's price, this game was definitely worth it, especially for those of you looking to scratch that Pirate itch.			"

You are more or less free to roam...follow the story line (free your family), hunt pirates, loot tons of ships, achieve royal status with various nations, marry ump-teen govenors daughters...pretty cool.  If you go the love route, be prepared for pirate ballroom dancing...yes you read that right.  That part is kind of corney, but if you master it you do receive a lot of high level and expensive loot for free.  BTW, the aspect ratio for graphitcs is stuck at 4:3, no way to change it without messing up the GUI/menus.  You can learn to live with it, or waste time in the forums looking for a solution that does not exist like I did.  Overall a 10/10.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates is one of his best games, alongside Civilization 4 and Civ 5. In this game you can experience the exciting world of the 18th century Caribbean, filled with notorious pirates like Blackbeard, buried treasure, and devastating storms to blow you off course. There are two basic ways you can play the game: You can plunder every single penny from every single person, or you can obey every law there is, and befriend the governor of every town and city on the map. And, of course, you can be somewhere in between. This game has one drawback I will mention: you must have a number pad on your keyboard to play it. Almost everything from sailing your ship to the swordfighting minigames requires the number pad. Aside from that limitation, it is a great game. Not too difficult, but not too easy. I recommend that you purchase this game and try it out for yourself. If you like Sid Meier's other games and you like pirates, you'll like this.			"

												I really wanted this game and after a year or two of waiting I bought it.I went through and fully completed the campaign in about twenty to twenty-five hours, so this can last you awhile.There is swashbuckling and ship battles to be had!You can own and command a fleet of ships ranging from a Canoe to a fearsome ""Ship Of The Line"".When you divide the plunder you can choose to stay at your current naval rank/ game difficulty or get a promotion and slightly increase the game's difficulty. You can also look for buried treasure by purchasing or finding a treasure map.You can attack any ship you see even ones you're supposed to be escorting.You can attack or invade any port or town, to do this,Attack a town with your ship's cannons to kill most of it's men, then invade by land to capture or pillage the town.The graphics are good, music is decent and the dialogue is good aswell.I rate this game, Eight War Canoes Out Of Ten.

												Been wanting a fun pirate game for a while, and since AC Black Flag just didn't do it for me I tried this out.  To my surprise this game is awesome.  Can easily put many hours into it and is simple yet deep and fun.  Totally sandbox, and you can plunder to your hearts desire.  It's definitely a Sid Meier's kinda game, and its old so the graphics and RPG elements are a little dated.  But its definitely worth the small price tag and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend if it was on a steam sale.  However, I truly wish a decent pirate RPG would come out with: leveling, weapons, ship upgrades, custom crew members, sea/land battles, and a good story; as this game sadly is not that.  And that game would most definitely sell.All in all, simple, fun, addictive.  Good purchase.			"

I LITERALLY HAVE TO RIP MYSELF AWAY WHENEVER PLAYING IF I HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE.  Honestly, Sid Meier's games are all good, but this one is amazing.  If it wasnt for the graphics and a little more detailed mechanics/gameplay, this could honestly pass for a 2010 or 2011 game, maybe even 2012.  I only reccomend the best, so if you have 10 dollars, you will get a game worth its money.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING IT!			"

I begged my mom to buy it, eventually she caved and bought me it. I loved it immensely. Sadly over the years the disk has gotten scratched and very recently lost.

												Eh, Pirates still is a playable and fun game after all these years, but the many quirks get old quickly. There are a handful of activities to acomplish with a handful of minigames that involvethe numpad, mostly. You can defeat and plunder other ships, sword fight, buy and sell goods, explore the map, track down other notorious individuals, dance with governor's daughters, escort various other ships from town to town, build a skilled crew and search for buried treasure. That sounds like a ton of different things, but it gets repetitive quickly. I like that the game allows you to increase the difficulty level as you deserve it, but when I stopped playing, I realized I  had a bad understanding of the sword fighting mini-game, and has simply bumbled through it at earlier difficulties, and I was having to reload to deal with every other battle, which got really tiring really quickly. I never could find my sister, which was the goal of the game. Maybe I'll reappoach the game with a new character and see if I can be a bit more efficient.			"

This is essentially the same game, dressed up with modern graphics and a few changes to make it easier to navigate. Having a mouse in the city is handy, I must admit.It's still just as fun now. The main thing that's been added is that there are more depth to the missions available to you, and the plot is much more obvious to follow with the cutscenes and such.			"

												I bought this game with low expectations but, with it being on sale and all, I figured ""why not""  - looking to scratch an itch for boarding vessels and some fun swordplay, I went for it.  Whilst not bowled over entirely, this game IS very addictive, and I played it for several long, intensive sessions; certainly getting good value for money in the process.What we have here is more a collection of minigames than anything else; hotkey-based swordplay and dancing, a very detailed sailing simulator (albeit an easy one), and some grid-based TBS thrown in for good measure if you decide to take your crew ashore to plunder a town.A good game, but with limited replayabiility as you tend to find the ""optimum"" build very quickly.  I'd pay £5 for this game.			"

												I owned the game for xbox and picked it up with the Sid Meier's Humble bundle.  I am very happy to have a working copy again.  I really liked the xbox version, but the PC version is way more indepth in some areas, mainly heading to shore when running aground. My only gripe is that I feel it is a little repetitive at times.  A bit outdated, but what do you expect from a game from 2005.What did surprise me was the difficulty I had playing on my wife's laptop.  I connected a keyboard for the number pad but found that even moderate graphics settings were taxing on the computer.  It is a 3-4 year old computer with only a 3 core Phenom in it, but considering the game's age I feel like it should have handled the whole game with ease.  I play on my desktop usually so it's not an issue, just surprising.			"

												I played the old DOS version alot, and thought the remake wouldn't be as good.  While somewhat different, I like this version more.  You know you have played for too long when you can take the top spot on the Top 10 Pirate list without taking out any of the other 9, and then still have time to finish the main quest and take down the 9 before retiring.Simplistic yet addictive.  Play it if you haven't.			"

												I love this game! One of my all-time favorites.  I've got it for basically every type of computer and game machine they've ever released it for, and I'm really not ashamed of that. This game rocks so much.  Yeah, the plot is really weak, but that's not what it's about.  It's a true sandbox, the Caribbean ocean is your plaything in this game. It makes you feel like Errol Flynn.			"

												Greatest pirate game of it's time (not like there was much competition), and the best pirate game I've ever played. If you don't mind spending a bit of time watching your boat sail against the wind at a snails pace (GODDAMMIT THE WIND ONLY BLOWS TO THE WEST AND I WANNA GO EAST ♥♥♥♥ I'LL BE HERE FOR DAYS), no game I've played yet meets the sense of adventure and purpose that this game provides. With so many ways to pirate, from killing everything you see to finding buried treasure to working for the a nation's military (if only to bone that governor's beautiful daughter), this game stays fresh and fun every time.

												Sid Meier's Pirates another great game from a great game maker. Your family is taken for ransom, you grow to be a teenager and you are ready to set sail to try to free your enslaved family from the evil Colonel.Or you can say SCREW THAT, IMA GO PLUNDER SOME SHIPS!!! You are free to do so :)This is a pirate-sandbox game. Similar to the newly released Pirate Game, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. You can follow the storyline and set free your enslaved family, or you could go out to sea and plunder, get yourself married to a governer's daughter, gather the ships of Blackbeard, Black Bart, and Captain Morgan, upgrade them to their highest, THEN go out and rescue them. This is what I like about Sid Meier's games, its got good sandbox engine to it. The Carribean is HUGE, you could sail for hours and maybe not even get 100% of the content done.The Melee combat is fluid, but a little TOO easy. Just counter when the button flashes, then attack. The ship combat is fun as well, although its very trivial if compared to Black Flag. If you wish to go save your family and THEN take down famous pirates, feel free to do so! It is important to note that you should not split your loot until you feel you are ready to do so, because you will lose some ships and loot and you need all the loot you can get since upgrades and items are expensive, but it makes it so money HAS a use at least. Unlike Black Flag, this game requires you make an effort to keep your ship in good condition and your crew happy, if your crew gets unhappy, they will abandon you. You dont want that.As I said, the Carribean is huge, but honestly in this game, Its kind of TOO big. Black Flag has a function where you can initiate Travel Speed and get where you need to go faster. This game only has half and full sails, and even then, if you dont follow the wind direction, your not gonna get anywhere in the next 5-10 minutes. It should also be worth mentioning that you do NOT have any sort of waypoint system in this game. You have to navigate your way around, which can be a bit difficult, but if your patient, you'll start getting it.So, is this game good? Yes! This is for you if you absolutely love the Golden Age of Piracy and want to experience it in a way.			"

												This game is like 5 games in one: sailing, real time ship battles, fencing, turn based strategy, dancing (Rhythm game), and more. Stick with me here though: what makes classic nintendo games great, is that they are simple enough for a newbie to pick up and enjoy but also evolving with enough depth to grasp a hardcore gamer. THIS IS THAT TYPE OF GAME and what makes Pirates! so great as well. Start out as an apprentice -each time your crew is unhappy, divide the plunder to start refresh and jump to the next diffculty level. The game really progresses from each tier of diffculty nicely til your at the most difficult level and you are like wow, how did this game get to this point, it was so easy at first. The graphics still hold up too! Play this now! Trust me, there is something for everyone in this game.			"

Nemesii? Whatever. It's a good game, and pretty damn easy to pick up. If you like sword fighting, ship sinking, and treasure accruiing, pick up this game! You will need a numpad though.			"

												My second favorite pirate game of all time.  Favorite being Uncharted Waters: New Horizons on the SNES.  This game is entirely based in the Carribean.  Starting the game up you choose what type of pirate you are going to be by picking a skill.  After that you pick your nationality.  You can choose between Spanish, English, French, and Dutch.  The Spanish seem to have the most ports and cities so I'd consider them the easiest to start with.  You work your way up the pirate ranks by finding buried treasure, defeating notorious pirates like Blackbeard, and trading goods between ports.  It's a great game and worth the price in my opinion.

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a 2005 remake of the original game he made back in the 1980s. This time, you have better graphics, more advanced swordfighting sequences and more options for everything. You start the game off by leading a mutiny on a merchant vessel. From there on, you can decide whether you want to avenge your family by defeating the Marquis de Montalban, defeating all the major pirate captains in the Spanish Main, accumulate vast amounts of wealth through trade, marry a governor's daughter whether she be sexy or ugly, or if you want to attack merchant ships, plunder seaports and instigate a brand new war. The choice is yours! My only complaint is that you can't customize your character: although he does age, you always have to be the Orlando Bloom type of character. Beyond that, this game is every sandbox adventure you ever dreamed of.			"

												For a game that's over ten years old, Pirates is easily the best game I've played in a long time.  It brings a romanticized view of a century of piracy to gaming, yet avoids Treasure Island clichés like parrots and peg legs.  You'll find a lot of light comedy in the presentation of the game, too!  However, the overall gameplay is quite sophisticated.  Unlike games such as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, you have to know how to sail with the wind to your advantage.  The size of your sword, ship, and crew matter tremendously as you conquer the West Indies, as well as the hearts of colonial governors' daughters.  You may find yourself chasing ships for game days on end only to lose it to the wind, so you have to be good at assessing situations and using them to your advantage, else the enemy does the same.  Surprisingly, these elements do not detract from the gameplay, but instead add a level of interest and challenge that draws you in further.I'd give it a 9.8out of 10.  It's not perfect, but it's damn close.  My only concern is technical issues (performance), as the game did not run optimally on my system due to the game's slightly antiquated nature.  Even so, the fact that the game IS so old (and this one was a remake) stands as testament to its fantastic ability to entertain.  Any PC gamer should definitely give it a try.			"

												This is one of my all time favorite games.  A great feel for pirating and lots of different styles of gameplay within it.  Large overarching quests to seek out treasures, opponents, and your family.  Then smaller pieces that make it all up:  Naval combat with a ship you customized and/or captured, dueling and dancing rhytm games, merchant trading (and looting), and even some land based army combat is an option.  The feel of the playthrough changes based on the factions you win favor with or lose, items to collect, and special crewmen to build up.			"

												Sid Meier has made many games with clever tactical depth, but is not so swollen with rules, so that anybody can jump right in. Pirates! continues the tradition by being a game chock full of strategy, but is highly accessible.The game is a sandbox. You can go anywhere, and do anything, within the Spanish Main. Generally, you plunder ships or towns, and get promoted by friendly nations. There are plenty of other things to do, too.Tasks you perform have an associated action oriented mini-game. You'll be ship-to-ship battling and swordfighting a lot. I like most of these games, though your mileage may vary. Many people have mixed feelings about them.As far as management goes, the game cuts out micro-managing. The action just keeps flowing. The typical mundane busy work of hard-core strategy games is kindly removed here, in order to get to the good bits. There are plenty of strategic decisions to be made, but you get to think in a sense of what you WANT to do, not what you HAVE to do.Certain things are a little tricky to get used to. Sailing East is much harder than sailing West. Your crew slowly becomes restless over time, forcing you to pay them off and take a few months vacation before going back to sailing.After you get to the ripe old age of about 35, your health starts to decline, and you might have to retire before too long. This takes you to an amusing detailed report on your post-pirate life. Hopefully you are a Governor instead of a Pauper!The graphics and sound are cartoony. Everything looks like it's from a Disney/Pixar movie, and the voice acting is done in jibberish, like in The Sims. Subtitles are in English, though. The cartoony feel is not bad, but is sometimes just a little TOO campy.The controls are a bit strange. While you can use a mouse, you're better off doing the mini-games using the numpad. It's a little awkward at first, but you get used to it fairly soon.Pirates! is one of my all time favorite games. Two thumbs and a wooden peg-leg up!			"

												Pirates! is a game I played quite a bit in college, and playing it again now, it holds up surprisingly well. You play as a Caribbean pirate in a small ship, and you can use it to build up a huge fleet, earn a fortune, find lost cities of gold, and do tons of other things. More than anything else, Pirates! is a sandbox game. It will suggest things to do, but you're free to set your own goals.When you're not sailing, most of the Pirates! gameplay is in the form of mini-games. You'll become very familiar with Fencing... your sword will solve many problems. But you can also participate in naval combat, dance, siege towns, sneak into hostile towns, or hune around the wilderness for treasure. Most of them are short, simple, skill-based games that are incredibly easy on low difficulties, but can get near impossible on the higher ones.The graphics were good for their time, and they've held up better than I expected. The music is nice, but there's not enough of it. The game usually controls well enough.I got this game when it went on sale, and I've been having a lot of fun with it again. I'd wait for a sale to get Pirates!, but when it does, this is a game worth getting.			"

												One of the best games of its times(1987), this good old game buffed with better graphics, without c64/amiga loading times. Only thing i missed was silver train heists. Very good example how good and complex the gameplay was in older games allready, with several different ship types and you could make a fleet of ships if you had the crew and food to maintain them also.For an definate classic game honoring its predecessors 10/10, get it if you dont have it !

Different ships have different cargoes, and you might want to capture some for your own fleet.You have different difficulties, different times (1600-1660) to choose from. As your character ages, his health deteriorates and in the end you retire.I recommend reading the manual though, as the game has no tutorial and drops you smack-dab in the middle of the caribbean between four rival factions,			"

												This is a terrificly fun, low stress game that gives you the sights and sounds of being a pirate in the caribbean seas circa the 1600's. It plays out like a fast paced board game crossed with an enthusiastic child's fanciful imaginings of the piratey life: all of the highs and none of the lows. It's such a breath of fresh air to play a game that doesn't try to saddle you with a heavy ""Hollywood"" cinematic story. The encounters are entirely under your control in true sandbox style and you venture through a series of minigames at different locations to obtain information about the placement of notable people, treasures, and upgrades, with each task being fun and easy to grasp.  There's a wealth of things to do with the only drawback being repetition sets in too early; you fight the same pirates, perform the same battle actions, talk to the same placeholder figures over and over again. Give it a shot.  It's fun and frivolous and you'll definintely be entertained.			"

												An updated edition of an older classic I loved as a kid - I was pumped to find this edition in a bundle, which I picked up for a song. Usually, this game can be found discounted, but is worth a LOT more than a lot of other, more expensive games out there.You're a pirate, you go around capturing and looting ships, rescuing damsels in distress, dancing (it's fun; don't look at me like that), and fencing with other pirates. If you haven't tried it, DO SO.THe only con - difficulty settings are managed in-game, unlike in previous editions, with significant in-game consequences. For some, this can be a little off-putting, especially if you want to jump straight in to a higher difficulty level from the beginning.			"

												Pirates! is the all the swashbuckling fun a person could want from a pirate-themed video game without being too restrictive. It lays out a basic backstory with optional follow-through, but otherwises allows the player to run wild in the 17th Century Caribbean. At times, however, the game can be a little too hands off in terms of direction (explanation of game and world mechanics and parts of the ""storyline""). The controls can a little confusing at first, and I would really recommend a number pad if using a laptop but a mouse is a good alternative also (I've used both and found that while the mouse is more convenient a number pad makes the game much easier to play). Overall, this game is easy to get a hang of quickly and you'll have a fantastic time pirating your way across the high seas.			"

												Score: 10/10Although Sid Meier's Pirates! is a very old game, it gives the player an unrivaled pirate experience. You are free to make your choices and shape the world in any way you see fit, and that is what I call a true RPG. Which brings us to what I believe is the strongest point of this game, the hability to provide an amazing interaction with the game world, even if you don't realized as you do, as every action brings a reaction somewhere. If you save the merchant ship from the pirates, your allies may prosper, but that very pirate ship that you sunk will be a hard hit in the pirate community. Or, if you are to become the most fiered pirate of the seas, you might find that your pillage is bringing cities to decline.The other mechanics in the game do not present any remarkable point, but been able to have old school ship fight is quite amusing, as well as deciding your batles by your favorite method of combat (ship/sword fight). The graphics and sound are alright and there is no plot, you make your own history.This game deserves a 10 for the great interaction mechanic it carries even being decades old! Definitely a gap to be yet filled.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a 2005 remake of the original game he made back in the 1980s. This time, you have better graphics, more advanced swordfighting sequences and more options for everything. You start the game off by leading a mutiny on a merchant vessel. From there on, you can decide whether you want to avenge your family by defeating the Marquis de Montalban, defeating all the major pirate captains in the Spanish Main, accumulate vast amounts of wealth through trade, marry a governor's daughter whether she be sexy or ugly, or if you want to attack merchant ships, plunder seaports and instigate a brand new war. The choice is yours! My only complaint is that you can't customize your character: although he does age, you always have to be the Orlando Bloom type of character. Beyond that, this game is every sandbox adventure you ever dreamed of.			"

												A graphically enhanced, feature-enriched, compatability-stabalized version of a completely addictive game, that set the standard for ALL subsequen open-world pirate games!  You don't have to be a fan of the original to thoroughly enjoy all this game has to offer.  Sid Meier understood what gamers want out of the gaming experience.  This polished classic is sure to delight ALL audiences, even those who are new to the pirate-genre of gaming.  Whether you choose the route of a pirate, or a privateer in the service of a great navy, you are going to have fun!			"

												This is a really good game.  You are more or less free to roam...follow the story line (free your family), hunt pirates, loot tons of ships, achieve royal status with various nations, marry ump-teen govenors daughters...pretty cool.  If you go the love route, be prepared for pirate ballroom dancing...yes you read that right.  That part is kind of corney, but if you master it you do receive a lot of high level and expensive loot for free.  BTW, the aspect ratio for graphitcs is stuck at 4:3, no way to change it without messing up the GUI/menus.  You can learn to live with it, or waste time in the forums looking for a solution that does not exist like I did.  Overall a 10/10.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates is one of his best games, alongside Civilization 4 and Civ 5. In this game you can experience the exciting world of the 18th century Caribbean, filled with notorious pirates like Blackbeard, buried treasure, and devastating storms to blow you off course. There are two basic ways you can play the game: You can plunder every single penny from every single person, or you can obey every law there is, and befriend the governor of every town and city on the map. And, of course, you can be somewhere in between. This game has one drawback I will mention: you must have a number pad on your keyboard to play it. Almost everything from sailing your ship to the swordfighting minigames requires the number pad. Aside from that limitation, it is a great game. Not too difficult, but not too easy. I recommend that you purchase this game and try it out for yourself. If you like Sid Meier's other games and you like pirates, you'll like this.			"

Treasure hunting, sailing, trading, ship to ship and sword combat (realtime), raiding towns (turn based).Only downsides I can see are the mutiny mechanic (there's a sort of upkeep system that makes you keep stealing amounts on a regular basis and they get increasingly picky about how you get it) and the aging of the captain (It's a decent length though. My first campaign is still going).If you want a time sink, this is a good one to go with.			"

												So much fun!  Pirates doesn't conform to typical genres.  It simply bundles up everything you'd ever want to do if you were a pirate.  Fire the cannons, swashbuckle, plunder, dig for treasure, assemble a fleet, escape from jail, hang out at the tavern, explore the Carribean... seriously, I can think of nothing pirate-related that's not represented.  My biggest gripe is how the protagonist ages.  Unlike Civilization, where the leader reigns for 6000 years and then retires, here your reflexes get worse and worse, making swordfights increasingly frustrating until you're forced to call it quits.  That's not fun, and it's not fair that Marquis Montalban, the final boss, sits in his hideout for eternity, not slowing down over the years even though he was an old man when you were young!			"

												Eh, Pirates still is a playable and fun game after all these years, but the many quirks get old quickly. There are a handful of activities to acomplish with a handful of minigames that involvethe numpad, mostly. You can defeat and plunder other ships, sword fight, buy and sell goods, explore the map, track down other notorious individuals, dance with governor's daughters, escort various other ships from town to town, build a skilled crew and search for buried treasure. That sounds like a ton of different things, but it gets repetitive quickly. I like that the game allows you to increase the difficulty level as you deserve it, but when I stopped playing, I realized I  had a bad understanding of the sword fighting mini-game, and has simply bumbled through it at earlier difficulties, and I was having to reload to deal with every other battle, which got really tiring really quickly. I never could find my sister, which was the goal of the game. Maybe I'll reappoach the game with a new character and see if I can be a bit more efficient.			"

												I have always wanted to be a pirate, the smell of the sea, the blatant disregard for everyone around you, the pillaging, stealing, and badassary have always been something I want to partake in... However the long hours, risk of scurvy, the possible death sentence and being stuck on a boat with 100 other men for months at a time really puts a damper on that dream. This game allows you to do pretty much all that stuff without the terrible consequences! Seriously though it is a fun, light hearted, ADDICTING game that I absolutely love. It gets a bit repetitive at times but what doesn't? If you are looking for something to kill a few hours sailing the seas and pillaging every ship you come across look no further, definitely worth the couple of bucks for the amount of enjoyment you get out of it!

												This is a terrificly fun, low stress game that gives you the sights and sounds of being a pirate in the caribbean seas circa the 1600's. It plays out like a fast paced board game crossed with an enthusiastic child's fanciful imaginings of the piratey life: all of the highs and none of the lows. It's such a breath of fresh air to play a game that doesn't try to saddle you with a heavy ""Hollywood"" cinematic story. The encounters are entirely under your control in true sandbox style and you venture through a series of minigames at different locations to obtain information about the placement of notable people, treasures, and upgrades, with each task being fun and easy to grasp.  There's a wealth of things to do with the only drawback being repetition sets in too early; you fight the same pirates, perform the same battle actions, talk to the same placeholder figures over and over again. Give it a shot.  It's fun and frivolous and you'll definintely be entertained.			"

												I really wanted this game and after a year or two of waiting I bought it.I went through and fully completed the campaign in about twenty to twenty-five hours, so this can last you awhile.There is swashbuckling and ship battles to be had!You can own and command a fleet of ships ranging from a Canoe to a fearsome ""Ship Of The Line"".When you divide the plunder you can choose to stay at your current naval rank/ game difficulty or get a promotion and slightly increase the game's difficulty. You can also look for buried treasure by purchasing or finding a treasure map.You can attack any ship you see even ones you're supposed to be escorting.You can attack or invade any port or town, to do this,Attack a town with your ship's cannons to kill most of it's men, then invade by land to capture or pillage the town.The graphics are good, music is decent and the dialogue is good aswell.I rate this game, Eight War Canoes Out Of Ten.

												This is the most repeatitive game Ive ever played... the mechanics are okay and the for an old game... IT IS THE BEST THING EVER.  I LITERALLY HAVE TO RIP MYSELF AWAY WHENEVER PLAYING IF I HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE.  Honestly, Sid Meier's games are all good, but this one is amazing.  If it wasnt for the graphics and a little more detailed mechanics/gameplay, this could honestly pass for a 2010 or 2011 game, maybe even 2012.  I only reccomend the best, so if you have 10 dollars, you will get a game worth its money.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING IT!			"

												Been wanting a fun pirate game for a while, and since AC Black Flag just didn't do it for me I tried this out.  To my surprise this game is awesome.  Can easily put many hours into it and is simple yet deep and fun.  Totally sandbox, and you can plunder to your hearts desire.  It's definitely a Sid Meier's kinda game, and its old so the graphics and RPG elements are a little dated.  But its definitely worth the small price tag and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend if it was on a steam sale.  However, I truly wish a decent pirate RPG would come out with: leveling, weapons, ship upgrades, custom crew members, sea/land battles, and a good story; as this game sadly is not that.  And that game would most definitely sell.All in all, simple, fun, addictive.  Good purchase.			"

												In my opinion, Sid Meier's Pirates! is probably the most addicting RPG ever made. Open-World, minigames, side quests, treasures etc. The soundtracks are awesome and catchy.I have been playing this game for 47 hours since I bought it on STEAM and probably hundreds of hours before that.

												love this game! One day when i was in 5th grade, i was wandering around the computer disk aisle of my local Office Max and stumbled upon this game. I begged my mom to buy it, eventually she caved and bought me it. I loved it immensely. Sadly over the years the disk has gotten scratched and very recently lost. It was sad to see a childhood favorite of mine deteriorate before my very eyes, before dissapearing completely! But then I found it on steam and I was overjoyed. I love this game. 10/10			"

You can also claim cities and kill off other notorious pirates to increase your reputation amongst the other countries and pirates, which gives you harder pirates to kill and stronger ships to raid and more loot to have.Just recently got the game, so i only really have the genaral gist of the game but i think it gets a solid 8/10 for the gamplay I really wanted to have playing black flag			"

												Extremely fun, very cute, quality gameplay (for a 2004 title this ran smooth and looked good!!!!!). I can't see myself replaying this, but the single playthrough I did was *very* enjoyable (I received the rank of Mayor, 3rd highest).Gameplay wise you start with your family being wronged and you are able to escape imprisonment and choose to enlist with 1 of 4 nations- the Dutch, the English, the Spanish or the French. You sail around the Carribean and capture ships (or even cities!) of the other nations. You can fight pirates too, including some of the famous ones! Combat involves primarily dueling where you could your opponent's sword move and attack with your own. You may also utilize ship based naval combat by firing off your cannons against other ships with 3 different kinds of shots: your general damage round shot, grape shot to take down crew members, or chain shot to bring down masts & sails. Aside from the combat your goal is to defeat the baddies, gain treasure maps, rescue family members, and even settle down with a lovely wife! =)Bottom line: play it, but ♥♥♥♥ sailing east.			"

												(This is the 2004 remake of the original game from 1987). Sid Meier's Pirates is a lighthearted swashbuckling romp set during the Age of Discovery.The gameplay basically boils down to a series of minigames; ship-to-ship battles, sword duels, dancing, land battles and treasure hunts.The game is open-ended; there's a 'main quest' of sorts but you can feel free to ignore it if you want. There's plenty of other goals to pursue; find buried treasure, defeat infamous pirates to become the most feared in the Caribbean, track down wanted criminals and collect their bounties, escort ships carrying peace treaties (or betray the nation you're helping and destroy them - war is more profitable than peace for a pirate after all) or just attack everything in sight and amass as much loot as you can.A game won't last forever - your pirate starts the game aged 18 and as time passes in the game he will age and eventually be forced into retirement. If this game has an overall ""goal"" at all it's to have the highest score you can at the time you retire. The game has difficulty levels; on every playthrough after your first you can choose between them - first time starting a new game, you're forced into the easiest difficulty, though there's a way to change it once you get going, too.Unfortunately, I don't feel like the game has much replay value. The minigames (with the exception of ship battles) are repetitive and shallow and I was burned out on the game before I'd seen everything it had to offer (I completed the ""main quest"", went after all the named pirates and then lost interest). The harder difficulty settings feel more frustrating than genuinely challenging, too.Still, I got 25 hours of fun out of this game for £6, so I'd say I got my money's worth; I recommend it. "

												I like this game but the age really limits it's mechanics. It becomes very samey after a few hours. I feel like if there was a sequel to this game made today, it would be really great. So ill list all the bad points first.-Ship travel is often SLOW as hell. Especially if you have to travel against the wind (which never changes direction). It could have done with a minimum speed cap based on the ship you have.-Basic sword fighting. The sword fights are all the same and are quickly cheesed with fast attacks.-Not much to do. You can marry a daughter (one), Kill 9 other pirates, rank up with each faction, tresure hunt, and do  the main story line. Sounds like a lot on paper but then you realize killing pirates are the same as fighting any other person in the game, Ranking up is exactly the same in each faction, each daughter requires the same exact things, and the main story is mostly more pirate hunting stuff. Its extremly limited in variation.-There really isnt much of a story anyway. Its got open world-itus which means you can go anywhere at anytime but there isnt any structure. The pacing is god awful. and it takes forever to get to the next story point. In the 6 hours I have played (never played it before) I got to the highest rank in the english faction as well as midway in the other 3, killed all other 9 pirates, had married a daughter and romanced 4 others high enough to marry if I wasnt already, Saved 3 family members in the main story (which involves killing the SAME guy over and over) and gotten most of the items in the game.All that said though, I did enjoy myself for the most part. The only part I really hated was just how slow ship travel is which would entail me watching a video on another screen while my ship traveled across the map for 10 minutes. I do think its worth picking up if its on sale for very cheap and I do think you will have a decent time with it for a few hours.Its just held back due to the time period it was released in. Unfortunatley the mechanics dont hold up as well in this day and age. Im surprised a sequel hasnt been made yet seeing the love for the ship battles in Assassins Creed Black Flag though.

												I remember playing the game back in the day on sega genesis and totally forgetting what it was. Some features are redundant (dancing with town's daughter) and you have to complete some aspects of the game in a timely manner (you age in game). It is fun in a tycoonish kind of way to build your fleet, pillage towns and do things on your own free will. It's a game that aged well for something that originated in the late 80's/90's. Would recommend.			"

												This game is now 11 years old as of this review and I still come back to every couple of months and get lost in it.It's a great little pirate sandbox. Cruise the Carribean plundering Spanish, French, English and Dutch shipping. Or slip into port and romance a nice lady. When she turns you down, seige the city and hand it over to a rival power! Are you boring? Fine... go be a trader or something... loser.Is this a super deep pirate simulation? No. It's just a fun, almost zen, experience. And for the peanuts it costs when it goes on sale (which seems to be always) the cost:time-spent ratio is just obsurdly in your favor.			"

												Should we accept a classic as a classic after the era it became a classic in stops being classic? This is the classic question that I would love to finally classify and I shall provide a vintage standard and time-honoured solution to this problem. Pirates, classically, are known as the typical scurge of the usual seven seas we are all familiar with. However, this classification is typically unjust. Sid Meier's classic experience, Pirates! focuses on the most representative of all classical periods of piracy, namely the Golden Age in the Caribbean of pre 1730 vintage. I want to point out that typically, a classic pirate crew of this day would not be a simble group of your usual scoundrels, but in fact much closer to the democratic nature of classical liberals. While I don't believe that the classic game Sid Meier's Pirates! represents this class of pirates in a standard manner, it does make a good attempt at showing how Piracy was a reasonable and standard career choice in this era.Now for the typical pros and cons;+Classic arcade combat+Classic lost family story line+Classic famous pirates (collect the skulls of all 9)+Classic ship designs +Classic game-Classic repetitive gameplay-Classic ugly charachter models-Classic scurvyOverall, this game is a classic that still stands the test of time. A true classic for video games!			"

												No other game stole so many hours of my childhood.  Well, maybe Rollercoaster Tycoon Gold, but that's besides the point!  This timeless open-world sand-- er, waterbox-- gives you a ship and wishes you well, then reels in the anchors to let you do whatever the hell you want.  Sure, you could be a hero and save your family from slavery at the hands of an evil and abusive Marquis, but... why would you?  There's only so much time in your simulated pirate life, time that could be used to board Spanish trade galleons, to sack cities, to find ancient Incan ruins, to deliver ultimatums, to conquer all in the name of the Dutch, to beat up drunk tavern regulars, to buy treasure maps and moustaches from Sid Meier in the back corner of the tavern, to marry sixteen governors' daughters through your ballroom dancing swagger, to do whatever the hell you want!YAR HAR DIDDLY DEE, BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT TO BE, DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOU ARE A PIRATE!

Personally I say Remake.In anycase, you sail around shooting cannons, sword fighting, plundering cities and searching for treasure, or your long lost family members.The real prize of this game is to capture the famed 'Ship of the Line' which is the fastest ship and carrying the largest amount of cannons at 48. I'm hopeful for a remake of this game one day, in the mean time this game will keep your pirate needs satisfied.			"

												Where to start..... Unlike alot of these reviewers, i had not played this before, i walked into this game completely blind. So, the fact that theres no nostaligia involved here, my review is for those who have never played or heard of this game before. Theres no tutorial or manual to speak of, but to be honest this game dosnt really need one. Its an rpg, so if youve palyed previous rpgs like me, you'll have a basic understanding of what your doing. If you havnt played one before then this would be an excellent first choice. So, your thrust into this open world pirate game with nothing but a back story, which i might add is not narrated in the slightest. In fact, i think the reason theres so much content in this game is because they didnt do any voice acting AT ALL. Theres just mostly grunts or the wooing of ladies for ""dialog"". But besides the lack of voice acting, the game is damn near perfect. There is SO much to do in this world. Without any spoilers, You have to save your family, become a top notch pirate, track down criminals, defeat pirates based off of real life ones such as Captain Kidd and Black Beard, pillage ships, raids towns, dance with the ladies, ship battles, fleet managments, sell plunder, buy food stocks, get unique items, upgrade your ship, get special crew members, conquer cities in a board game like rts mode, search for buried treasure, get promotions, gain land, ect. And thats probably half of what there is. At this point im only 10 hours in the game and i have already done all of that, and there is just so much more to do. If your a fan of pirates or Rpgs, GET THIS GAME AND GET IT NOW!!! It's only 10 dollars for so so SO much content, and the replayability is off the charts! Do yourself a favor, and buy this game and pray they make another one!			"

												Arrr me maties! To this date the best game for you to become the most badass pirate ever! Beautiful sandbox-like gameplay, a true gem, sadly overlooked by many people. I really don't have much to criticize - perhaps the lack of a proper story. But what the game has to offer (which is sailing around with ships, battling others, duels, sieging cities and many other things) is really good.And unlike Assassins Creed 4, there is actually kinda realistic morale element where your crew can revolt when you're too long at sea, or you're not very succesful pirate. Game itself is easy to jump in, but certainly provides more than a decent challenge.Ship ahoy!			"

												This is basically Mount and Blade's campaign mode but instead of visceral, gory combat holding the whole thing together, we have pirate-themed quicktime event minigames. And yet, it works! I found the lack of variety pretty stunting around hour 4 though, and I doubt I'll finish it. In the ~five hours I played I completed about 10% of the actual main storyline (granted, I spent almost all that time ♥♥♥♥in' around). So, uh, yeah. If you liked running from camp to camp, building up an army, gearing them up, then watching as they all get taken away in one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t battle, you can do that here. Except, y'know, no battle. Pirate minigame.			"

												Let me start off by saying that I love this game so much that I almost felt like I was cheating on my wife when I bought it anew last night. I bought it on the day that it originally came out, and spent actual DAYS playing the game, only stopping to eat, bathe, and go to the bathroom. I don't think that I slept more than eight total hours in that first week, and my name was known, loved, and feared throughout the Caribbean. More so than in any other Sid Meier game before or since, I was completely engulfed by this game to the point of addiction.Then, you know, life (and other games) happened.So, flash forward a few years and I saw that it was on Steam. How well did it hold up? Would I fire it up, laugh at the dated gfx and gameplay, never to play again? Would it be like I'd never stopped playing and find myself engulfed into the game again? I downloaded it last night, and have already racked up seven, almost eight hours. Gfx and some clunky and (now) counter-intuitive gameplay aside, I still love this game and thought it was absolutely worth the $10 to buy it again. It's just as fun as I remembered, although I do confess that I still hate the dancing portion of the game! Absolutely recommended!My only REAL gripe is with the sound. It's not that it's dated, it's just that when you're playing the game, you have no choice but to either turn off the sound altogether OR you're forced to listen to the same... jaunty... pirate... ditties... again... and... again... and... Imagine being forced to listen to the sound of a dentist's drill or your favorite child's death rattle on infinite loop - this is the quality of the music. While you can go into the system properties and turn off the music, that's only the music for cut scenes and the like - the in-game music is tied irrevokably to the sound effects, so no cannonfire, no sound of the wind... unless you're willing to listen to monkey-grinder music.

In fact, i think the reason theres so much content in this game is because they didnt do any voice acting AT ALL. Theres just mostly grunts or the wooing of ladies for ""dialog"". But besides the lack of voice acting, the game is damn near perfect. There is SO much to do in this world. Without any spoilers, You have to save your family, become a top notch pirate, track down criminals, defeat pirates based off of real life ones such as Captain Kidd and Black Beard, pillage ships, raids towns, dance with the ladies, ship battles, fleet managments, sell plunder, buy food stocks, get unique items, upgrade your ship, get special crew members, conquer cities in a board game like rts mode, search for buried treasure, get promotions, gain land, ect. And thats probably half of what there is. At this point im only 10 hours in the game and i have already done all of that, and there is just so much more to do. If your a fan of pirates or Rpgs, GET THIS GAME AND GET IT NOW!!! It's only 10 dollars for so so SO much content, and the replayability is off the charts! Do yourself a favor, and buy this game and pray they make another one!			"

A classic. One of my favorite games of all time.Personal overall rating: 9/10I've played this game for almost 9 years now! Just got it on my computer a few days ago and, wow... It's so much better. I first played it on Xbox, then psp, then got it for my 360, and now have it for my computer. Of course, this is the best version of the game. ALL HAIL THE MASTER RACEOPTIONS MENU:The Video settings has 9 options. Picture Gamma, Water Detail, Object Detail, World Detail, Resolution, Shadows, Advanced Lighting, Trillinear Filtering, & Shaders. It's an old game, most computers will be able to handle it with the settings turned up relatively high. The Audio Settings has a Master Volume slider, Music Volume, Sound FX Volume, Dance Music Volume, and a 3D Sound Driver toggle. The Modify Ship's Sails and Flags option changes your ship's flag appearance and the logo/crest on your main sail. There's 6 crests/logos for your sail. 1.Dutch: Greater Coat of Arms of The Netherlands, 2.English: St George Crest, 3.French: Royal Coat of Arms of The Kingdom of France, 4.Indians: Tribal Tiki Logo, 5.Pirates: Jolly Roger Crest, 6.Spanish: Coat of Arms of Toledo.There are 5 flags, the Flags are 1.Dutch: Orange flag with a green xing emblem, 2.English: White flag with a red St George cross, 3.French: Blue flag with a gold Flour De Les emblem. 4.Pirates: Black flag with a white Jolly Roger. 5.Spanish: Yellow flag with a black Royal Lion. GRAPHICS:It's an old game. It's not exactly pretty. The game looks best while you're out sailing. There is noticeable aliasing, mushy textures, and choppy animations. The water refelction is decent. The explosion effect during ship battles when cannonballs make contact and when ships explode is awesome. It's the game's strongest point graphically. The way the colors of the sea blend together is nice as well. STORY:The story is kind of weird. An evil Spanish nobleman (the Marquis de la Montalbán) interupts a dinner party consisting of you and your family. Your family is in debt to him. When you see him, you immediatley know he has bad intentions, so you bolt passed him through the door. He takes your family. They become slaves. You survive on your own for the next 10 years. You begin your young adulthood joining a faction (Dutch, English, French, or Spanish). You serve on a ship where a cruel captain is in charge. Tired of being abused and insulted by the captain, you and your mates rally up and form a mutiny against him. You boot him from the ship, and take charge. You're the captain now, and realize this is the perfect opportunity to find your lost family. PLAYING THE GAME:Sailing is a ton of fun. The feeling of adventure you get from cruising the sea is so satisfying. Playing a game that isn't the same copy paste recipe as every other game in itself is extremely satisfying. There's open sea adventure, epic ship battles, duels, city invasions, sneaking through hostile towns, treasure hunting, pirate hunting, and the wonderful ability to do whatever you want. Live the pirate life your way. You can gain new items for your character like dual pistols and some well crafted swords. You can aquire new ships and give them upgrades. You can even name your ships as well as your character of course. You'll be addressed by your character's name by the other people in the game. They address you by your surname, so when creating your character make sure you name them by their last name. Anyways but yea, that's the game. You build up your crew, and become the deadliest pirate to ever live. Please try the game. It's cheap, it's fun. You'll enjoy it. Please just try it.			"

												Where to start..... Unlike alot of these reviewers, i had not played this before, i walked into this game completely blind. So, the fact that theres no nostaligia involved here, my review is for those who have never played or heard of this game before. Theres no tutorial or manual to speak of, but to be honest this game dosnt really need one. Its an rpg, so if youve palyed previous rpgs like me, you'll have a basic understanding of what your doing. If you havnt played one before then this would be an excellent first choice. So, your thrust into this open world pirate game with nothing but a back story, which i might add is not narrated in the slightest. In fact, i think the reason theres so much content in this game is because they didnt do any voice acting AT ALL. Theres just mostly grunts or the wooing of ladies for ""dialog"".

If you remember the old Pirates! fondly, this might shatter your nostalgic illusions a little.But that said, it is exactly what it's supposed to be, it works, and it's still an ok way to kill some time when you just want a nice, casual game.

												All games are based off of DnD. And all merchant games are based off of Sid's Pirates. The only thing comparable would be Space Rangers. This game is played inside an elaborate Simulation where The French, Dutch, British, and Spanish are all Playing an RTS. Trying to take over the Carribean. There are 10 Legendary pirates playing the game just like you, raiding ships and amassing wealth. Its a living world and you are a small part of it.			"

												This is one of the best pirate themed video games ever made, and the game that most pirate themed games end up taking their inspiration from. It's easy to pick up and play yet there's a lot of complexity here too. From bounties to allegiances to trading there are a lot of things you can do here yet you can also just sail around capturing ships & pillaging. The main thing I like about this is the fact that no matter what you do you never feel bored. You never run out of stuff to do, and you're always accomplishing stuff. Goals can be challenging but they're never so impossible that they get too frustrating. This is a great title that will challenge you and even if you fail at a challenge it never punishes you for it. It gives you many chances to come back later when you're more prepared for it. All in all one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly one of the best pirate games ever.			"

												I put off playing this game for years and wish i would have stuck to that. While this game is not bad, its just not fun to me. The best part of the game is ship battles, and they are very simple. Just keep moving and fire when ready. As I said its just not for me. I would recommend Age of Pirates/Pirates of the Carribean series if you want a decent pirate RPG. Get Sid Meier's Pirates if you want a casual age of sail game.			"

It's good for that one playthrough, but in my case. having accidentaly  started a new game, had my progress crushed along with my will to continue. Sorry, but I can't recommend.

												Disappointing.  I really want to like this game but it has some issues.  There are some bugs that can pop up and make life annoying, such as getting stuck different places in your ship.  For example, I was captured and then bribed my way out of Havana.  My ship ended up on the opposite side of the island, glued to the shore.  No way to get off the beach.  Only thing to do is go to last save point.  I've also been trapped near towns with sand bars near, having to constantly answer the pop up ""do you want to anchor or sail away?"" while attempting to navigate away in the split second allowed.  Game is really, really simple.  Kind of surprising, given Sid Meier's other games.  Overly simple/devoid of features in many ways.  Can't do anything with land you're granted.  Can't invade enemy towns unless they have a garrison.  Can only attack convoys with one ship at a time, no matter how many ships you have.  Convoy gets all ships.  You can accidentally sell the cannons off your ship and end up defenseless.  If enemies capture a ship of yours, you can't capture it back, it just disappears.			"

												I heard so much about this game and I love Civilization that I had to try it.  It was meh.  I think nostalgia clouds too many minds on how wonderful this game is.  It's not bad, it just isn't all that special. There isn't a real storyline (they kind of make a basic quest of finding your family which isn't very exciting) and maybe that would have spiced the game up for me.  I love a good story.  It just throws you in there and you just start living the life of a pirate captain which is great if you don't like being shackled to linear game play.  Felt like a chore going back and forth on the map at a snail's pace and I just wasn't having fun.  I gave up after realizing how many times I had to trek back and forth and I didn't want to waste my time with it.  I feel like this would work as a casual game on a mobile device that you could play for a bit, put it down, and pick it up later.  The dancing sequences are annoying, the sword fights are all the same and get boring, and trying to catch the wind in your sails was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  I feel there are more engaging choices out there.			"

												Though I put quite a few hours into this game my lasting impression is that it's not very enjoyable.  The concept itself is good, but the game becomes very repetitive and the play balance on harder difficulties is completely bonkers.  Late game on Rogue difficulty I lost a ship to only three hits, when fighting other ships of the same type I would hit them twenty times or more before they would sink.  The AI gets special abilities like attacking you on the strategic map, and the late ""quests"" of endgame are simply finding and fighting the same guy over and over again until you get a map to go and fight him again in some place in the middle of no where. And while the game has a lot of ""mini-games"", man of these are simply not compelling.   The game has a lot of content but all that content is ultimately light on depth, and despite playing the game to its conclusion and getting a Fame score of 106 my ""victory"" was little more than a page of text.  Why not a simple cinematic?If you get it cheap, play it, then go on to something with more enduring quality and depth.			"

												Hahaha, these upset fangirls.  I guess the truth does hurt.I should've stopped playing this a couple hours in, but I wanted to give the game a chance to get better.  It's too bad that it never does.Let's start with what looks good about this game.  Decent sized world, four nations to work for/against to gain rank, NPC ships attack one another, nations declare war and peace against one another, nations capture each others ports, many types of ships, freedom to do what you want, trading, pirating, making a fleet, sword fighting, romance, treasure hunting, rescuing family, finding lost cities, storms at sea, crew mutinies, bringing down pirates, and even other stuff.  It sounds awesome.  It's too bad most of the things that happen are pointless and half of the game is tedious minigames.I'd say about 50% of your time will be spent playing the minigames, so lets start with them.  There are several minigames including sea battles, sword-fights, dancing, land navigation, sneaking, and ground battles.  Most of the minigames you'll play will be the first three.  They're ok at first, but you'll play those same minigames over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.  Did you get tired of reading that? That's how I felt about those first three minigames after playing them 15 times.  Then realize in a playthrough that you'll play those three anywhere from 60-100+ times.  Imagine playing Mario Party, except it only has 6 mediocre minigames, and it only selects 3 of those minigames 90% of the time.  Then play that Mario Party for 10-13 hours.  That's what playing through Sid Meier's Pirates feels like.  I have absolutely no idea how anyone could tolerate multiple playthroughs of this mindless dreck.The other 50% of the time spent sailing would've been alright, except for the wind.  Do you like sailing west?  No worries, because the wind has got your back.  At some point though, you're going to need to sail back east.  You will.. do... this.... at.... a.... snail's.... pace.... against.... the.... wind.... Oh... here... comes... a... cloud... to.. speed me back up and.. it's... gone.... Time.... to.... take.... a.... nap....  I hated sailing anywhere in the west.  There were times when I'd set sail east, walk out of the room for a bit, come back, and still not be at my destination.  Nothing interesting ever happens while you're out at sea either.  You'll never be in danger of running out of food.  I often had multiple years worth of food from sacking ships.  I'd go into ports selling it off.  It's cool to see a Treasure Ship or Military Payroll for the first time, but by the 5th time, it's not quite so exciting, and by the 10th time, you won't even bother plundering them unless it keeps your crew from going to mutiny status.  The most exciting thing that happens out on the sea is accidentally running into one of the main quest enemies.  This is only exciting because it saves you 10 minutes of boredom finding out where they're headed and spending time tracking them down.  Also somewhat annoying is that occasionally the game will launch you out of a port straight into some rocks which damage your ship.  If you have a large fleet, instead of following your path, they do their own thing.  This often includes taking damage when they sail into rocks that you manuevered around but they decided would make an excellent path.I could've probably tolerated all of that stuff if the rest of the game made up for it, but it doesn't.  The game has no objective and nothing you do matters.  Doesn't matter whether you save your family, or rank up with each nation, or take out all the top pirates or do anything.  The game ends whenever you feel like it should end and retire.  One nation declares war or peace on another nation, doesn't impact you at all.  NPC ship sinks another npc ship, it'll respawn.  One nation conquers another nation's port, doesn't matter, can still sail in there and do all the same things I could've done anyway.  Pirates sack a port, doesn't matter.  Want to buy some of the cool stuff that guy in the corner sells, crew gets mutinous.  Amass a nice fleet, doesn't matter, only your flagship fights in battles and your crew will become mutinous and you'll have to divide the plunder and go back to 1 ship anyway.  You're the top pirate in the land, doesn't affect a thing.  Saved all your family, does nothing.  Want to save your family?  Have fun hunting down Baron Raymondo and waiting for him to respawn 12-16 times to get all the maps pieces.  Have fun sword fighting that same guy behind the bar 25 times that the dancing minigame gives you as a quest.  I completed most of the main objectives, aside from nation ranks, but gave up and retired when my wife expected me to dance with her 8 more times for the rest of the lost city map pieces.Maybe the problem is that I played Uncharted Waters on the Sega Genesis and know what a good pirate game should be.  This entire game is a tedious grind where nothing you do matters.			"

												An old game with old game problems.Some minor bugs with Steam and DirectX that can be easily fixed.The main problem is the lack os native widescreen support. There is a couple of fixes available, but if you apply any of them, the HUD, some buttons and texts stays partially off screen. If that isn't bad enough, to click on some buttons you'll need to click outside then for them to work. It gets very frustrating to play this way.If you don't apply the resolution fix, you get stuck with 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions and using this with widescreen, everything will get stretched. "

												I bought this game on sale as I was looking through the lunar sale offers and came across it.From my childhood I remember my dad playing this as I watched and he recently told me he started playing it again. I bought it and while I don't regret my purchase, I can't recommend it either. For the time it was released, this was an awesome game.Now...Widescreen resolutions makes the game crash on Windows 10 and when I tried buying a diamond necklace at the tavern, it crashed again for some reason, even though I've bought anything else I've come across without issues.Maybe it's meant to be that way, but the dancing minigame is horrible, every guide says to follow the rythm of the music, but even as I press the required key, I lose my progress if I had any. Only thing that works is to press slightly after you'd think it would fit with the music and the rythm, but this is just making it incredibly hard to time right.If you've played this game before,you won't need my review, if you haven't, don't buy it. It's outdated and crashy on newer systems.			"

												Not sure why this gets so many great reviews but I just didn't like this game and if it were possible I would have looked into a refund. The whole thing reminded me of a Disney Movie, with the campy cartoonish characters, little to no story to speak of, no managing a pirate fleet, combat was way to simplistic and seemingly made for 8 year olds. I guess I wanted to raise a pirate fleet and take over the seas, micromanage the ships and crews and had combat be a bit more interesting than this. No fast travel either. It's cheap and if you got little kids then buy this but if you are looking for a more realistic pirate experience this isn't it.			"

												It blows my mind how this gets any positive reviews. I suppose everything will have it's lovers and haters. Count me in the latter category.I typically love Sid Miere's games too. NEVER have I run into more outdated controls in my life. Even playing it at moderate difficulty levels I found this ""game"" to be more stress-inducing than a flight being canceled at the busiest airport while being forced to take two final exams in chemistry and 16th Century Literaure all at the same time. CONS:- The AI will generally always counter your sword attacks, while countering it's own requires PRECISE timing or else. - Adapts and speed up dance challenges, to the point where the odds of winning are slim to none.- You'll generally ALWAYS be placed upwind in ship battles, making manuvering nigh impossible. Meanwhile, AI ships will dance circles around you- The winds tend to blow extremely fast in one direction (west in my experience) making travel in the opposite direction very tedious and time-consuming.PROS:- Immersive, the general atmosphere is great- The music is simple but lovely- Fun, when the difficulty is balanced [usually never] (even at lower difficulties it's an imbalanced game)All in all I can't say I enjoyed my time with this title. In fact, I believe it gave me muscle cramps due to the stress it induced. I'm glad I only spent $2.50 on it during a sale, but I can say it was $2.50 wasted "

												This was a phenomenal game back when it released but it desperately beckons for new updates. Unless you are somone with an old-school crt monitor and ancient hardware or just someone who has to have it, skip this one.If you're still going to buy it, enjoy an open world with a nice barter/trade system and addictive pirate ship battles.

												Ugh, so much abou this game drives me CRAZY, but so much of it is fun too. The fun part is mostly due to open-world sandbox play, with no scripted gameplay, you can just sail around and do what you want. The good is pretty good. The bad is absolutely a deal breaker, though. The dancing thing with the governor daughter is impossible on the PC. I played this to death on the Xbox with no problems but this stupid PC version gives you 1/10th of a second to respond to the dancing bullcrap which made that part of the game unbelievably frustrating--on par with the buggy SM Railroads. The ships get stuck on land masses and LAUNCH like a rocket out of ports so you have to hit pause every time you leave a port. ANNOYING! In summary, it's too buggy and annoying for repeat play. the old Xbox version of possibly iPad version are better choices for this game. This PC original is not worth playing.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago but only play recently... This game is really repetitive and boring can make you have fun for some hour but after is really boring.The main story is really poor and is really frustratting to proceed because everytime i got a help and get where they say to go the guy is allready gone, i'm fine with that i mean is really immersive way BUT you got there and nobody else give you task you just go around and hope someone will say something because is random the task in the city! I mean you can go around for half hour or more and don't proceed with the story!The subquest in everycity is copypasted... You proceed defeat everyone and got a girlfriend in everycity with the same pattern...I like the idea and the concept but is really old game and not really worth to buy now.Maybe back in time was a really good game but don't buy it now.

												I wish ratings was not yes or no. Im giving it a no just because the ratings are too high. See, it is a great game for its time. But theres a few annoying parts. It cant be called an adventure game because you are restricted to the caribean and you do not feel like an adventurer. Not the improved 'uncharted waters' I hoped for. The challenge is too wimpy at first- get your attack speed up and mash buttons in duels to win every battle- then becomes too hard. But most annoying of all there is no tutorials. I have played this long and became #1 pirate, and dont know HTF dueling (the main thing in the game) even works, the controlls seem to suck. Dancing seemed impossibly hard. Granted I am playing as adventurer captain (hard difficulty) but that stuff should have been explained by the time I finished my 6th pirating carreer. You cant really customize your ship. And trading stinks, you really cant make any money at it. For the record I do recommend it anyways if it is on sale.Some things I find quite great is the ship to ship battles take a lot of skill, and has quite a lot of depth. And when you attack a town the game turns into a nearly full strategy game.If I or anyone else could mod the game for even a few months, it would be great. But as is it just slightly below wonderfull, just a collectors item from another time.			"

												It becomes rather repitive after a short while. Once you've danced with 1 governors daugther, you've danced with them all, 1 seabattle is the same as all others, the same goes for swordfights. You'll be spending a lot of time sailing and at some point you don't even bother to fight the battles, which you can choose as hardly anyone wants to attack you. When you want to complete the questline you'll kill the bad guy about 4 times.			"

												It's from 2005, but feels even more oldschool.It presents the kind of fun you don't find in newer games, where everything is streamlined and sugercoated for the users. This is the kind of game that has initially a very steep learning curve but eases up quickly as you go along and that in it self is a pleasure new games rarely give.It's got just a bit too many flaws to be a really good game, but the few hours i put into it was filled with fun and joy. On sale if you like pirates and want a bit of the old games feeling, go ahead and get it. But i don't think anyone has the patience to spend too much time on it.			"

												So much promise but age and/or operating systems have brought down what Pirates could be.The first problem I encountered was an absolutely ridiculous graphical glitch with the sails and flags of the ships. I would boil it down to a physx issue, but I don’t think that technology even existed when Pirates was released. Basically what would happen is that when the wind blew a certain direction, any fabric on screen would stretch to infinity and obscure 60-70% of the screen. The next issue I had was that for some reason the primary method of control (awkwardly using the number pad) straight up did not work. I tried a different keyboard as well as an old PS2 board and neither allowed any of the diagonal buttons to register.I’m not a computer genius or anything, but I can’t imagine all the technical problems I had running the game being anything more than driver issues and modern operating system changes. If you have an older XP system I bet this game is amazing, from the little bit I suffered through, there was so much awesome content. But if you own a modern gaming computer, just be aware that this game may not play nice with your setup.			"

												Maybe I don't get this game, or it just wasn't running properly on my computer. A slow and choppy game, Pirates is a baisc open world Pirate game where you sail around trading and plundering.The trade mechanic worked fairly identically to most games with a trade mechanic, and was fine, but the actual pirate battles were fairly lackluster, mostly involving a bit of maneuvering and a whole lot of patience. While you can build up a fleet of ships, this is mostly for maximizing your cargo capacity, and not really for getting increases in combat bonuses (at least as far as I could tell). You can only ever bring one ship into battle, which kept the gameplay very light. If there is depth to be found in this game, I was too frustruated by the incredibly slow pacing to find it.			"

												Seems great fun at first but there isn't much point to it. I never felt attatched to the story and it quickly grew too repetitive, shallow, and easy.

Dont buy this game if its only for nostalgia, it ruins it for you completely. Most times, my ship wont even move when I engage an enemy ship, and I even had it once where I sail backwards. Thats not the only reason, but there are many more.Sid Meiers Pirates, just the once....			"

												It's not that this is an old game, it's that this game isn't very good.  Gameplay is instantly repetitive and dull, very little risk, all reward, but no real action.  Sea battles make no sense, guns don't matter, all you do is ram the ship, hit a few buttons to defeat the captain, loot.  Dancing with girls mini game is just silly.  Mechanics make no sense.  Split loot disbands your fleet and you lose all your money?  Why would you ever do that?  Retire ends the game?  Why would you ever do that?  No clear benefits to upgrading ships, again because all you do is ram other ships and duel.  No clear point to hiring more men, just more mouths to feed for no reason.  Overall, just a terrible game that you throw away after half an hour.			"

												In this game you take a role of privateer or pirate. You can work for either English, French, Dutch or Spanish - or even for all of them if you time your actions well. There's constantly changing basic economic and political system where player's actions do affect on the bigger picture as well. You can sail, capture ships, fight pirates, trade, do missions, dance with governors daughters and so on. There's many goals to fullfill and many ways to play. Because there's different eras to choose from and the world is open, dynamic and reactive the gaming experience does change lot. There's also different difficulty levels which do have effect. Game's replayability value is quite high and you can get it cheaply, especially on sale. Technically speaking I have been playing this game for something like 30 years from it's early versions on Commodore 64. From those early days they have added more content and huge haul in graphics but the core is same. And it works. Still one of the best, if not best, pirate games there are.			"

												I was playing Pirates! for a year after it came out on PSP. I borrowed it as often as I could from the library and played so much I recognized where every treasure could spawn at from one scrap of the map. I would dedicate entire days to me lying on the couch, trying to sack a new town for the Dutch. I became so skilled that I wouldn't be slowed on the hardest difficulty.However, even with all of that work, I never 100% completed the game. It's so easy to get caught up in the politics, treasure hunting, intregue, and dancing. This game can keep you so busy that you'll be retired before you know it.The only way for this game to be made better is to release an HD remake (or sequal) with some minor adjustments:Improved graphics (better textures, water effects, etc)Improved framerate (60+ would be ideal)Custom keybinding and controller supportModding support Other than that, it's a really good game. 9/10			"

												Sid Meier's PiratesOne thing I can say is get it. The game is hours of fun. Granted very repetitive but very fun.You play as a Pirate with a Privateer contract with the Empire you first sail with (England, France or Spain). You can choose the raid any of the countries ports in the Caribbean. The option is to amass your wealth and get promoted to have a variety of different types of women (governors daughters that can be your wife). Plain, Pretty and Beautiful. The women you impress by not only acquiring rank with the Empire involved but also getting little gifts. The option is to also save your family and avenge what happened to them to force you to be a privateer. Or do both at the same time. Like I said before the gameplay can be repetitive as can the mini-games inside such as the sword fighting or the dancing mini-games. But this is a game you can literally play for hours and not notice the time lapse. I have outside of steam having owned it for years before the disc didn't work properly. A must buy game well worth the price			"

												I have always loved this game, it's a pretty simple game that isn't very challenging, but I love it.Pros:•Wont matter for a lot of people, butvery little mouse input needed, great for playing on the bus, or somewhere where I don't have an external mouse with my laptop•Graphics still hold decently well, the animations are a bit laughable, but the graphics don't hurt my eyes.•Very little story.  While the game does have a story, it doesn't push you into doing it at all, so your free to do whatever you want. Considdered a pro, because a lot of simular games like this force you to do the main storyline, and limit the open-world.Cons:•Some of the minigames can get a bit reppetitive. Dancing is very important in the game, but is not very fun, and I hate sneaking into towns. The most common ones like sword-fighting or ship battles stay fun.•Not very difficult. Even on swashbucking difficulty (the hardest one) the only thing I have trouble with is a few sword fights, but if you use the cutlass and taunt often, they aren't a problem.Overall, this game deffinetly is not for everyone. I have always loved this style of game, so it's easy for me to love this game. The game isn't very expensive, especially on sale, so I would whole-heartedly recomend picking it up if it looks even slightly appealing to you. "

												This game--- oh Lordy have mercy, this game! Going into 'Sid Meier's Prirates!', I had the impression it was going to be an overall decent experience, but without much direction. The game has a story, but, in my first few minutes, I had feared it'd be too open-ended and not give me much to go on. Wrong.You're set out proper into the ocean with a decent crew, a small ship and a good six or so months worth of food, and are tasked with finding your captured family. While this may seem daunting, seeing as there are sixteen greek family members to all track down, it's surprisingly simple to start the story. Simply make your mark by capturing a few easy ships, do some quests for some governers and such-- before you know it, you're hunting down pirates, treasure, merchant vessles and everything of the sort, easy peasy!The game is wonderfully simple to get into, and it kept me hooked for hours. Couldn't stopl playing unit I demended to myself ""Go eat something and finish your homework--- THEN you'll have EVEN MORE time to play!"" And so I'm writing this review eating one heck of a tuna sandwich, if I do say so myself. It's got parsley and mayo in-- I put lettice and some mango on it, and a little bit of hidden valley ranch---The game.It's awesome.If you're looking for a light-hearted but still involved pirate game where you carve out a ledgend other pirates will envy, this is the game for you! Fluid mechanics, everyhting feels wonderful to do-- just... I waited for a sale-- and this was undoubtedly some of the best three bucks of my life. Usually 10 but heck-- I'd say it's totally worth it, there's just so much to be had!			"

												Ah Sid Meier how you love to make people waste their entire day away on just one video game. He does it well that's for sure, and Pirates (Next to civilization) Shows this better than anything. With this 2004 release being the best.Pros:-Very Piratey...Yohohoho.-Capturing, Plundering, and Digging up treasure never gets old.-The game let's you increase the difficulty the farther you get in the game-Restoring your family feels good-There's a good amount of upgrades-Pillaging Towns is the best part in my view. It acts as a Turn Bases Strategy, with some nice mechanics-You can Fight actual pirates like Black Beard.Cons:-If you can't control yourself while playing video games. Then STAY FAR AWAY! This game will take your entire life in a blink of an eye.-It's very tedious. If you can't stand grinding you will hate this game.-Dancing STINKS! If you don't have a good num pad then good luck trying to play that minigame.Overall if you like being a pirate then pick this up. Oh but remember something. The Spainish are the best to raid. (SO MUCH MONEY!)			"

												This game is great. In fact, it's probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. You get to live the fantasy of being a pirate...not with all the realities of wasting months of your life on the sea and all the infections that come with that, but you get to fire cannons and have sword fights on deck and raid colonial fortresses and dance with the governors' beautiful daughters. There is plenty of variety in what you can do in this game. If you're tired of capturing ships for profit, go take an outpost for your favorite nation; search for buried treasure; play the main story line; hunt down famous pirates; get captured just so you can have fun sneaking out of jail. This game never gets boring, and the difficulty levels are sufficient to either give you a leisurely stroll through the Caribbean or a truly gripping fight at sea. Highly recommend it.			"

Also the aging factor is really annoying. But it is a fun little game.			"

												Fun game to play takes me back to the 80s and 90s when i played this game as a kid. But the only bad thing I have to say about this game is that when I hit alt plust tab button to check what the time was the game crashed.. Probably crashes every time after that :D but its annoying after having done some progresss and its annoying yes. If that get fixed it would be ten out of ten, for now its only 9.9 out of ten ..  "

												It's a great game with actual things to do instead of just plunder gold like you'd exspect. It has a great storyline where you have to save your family, and get revenge on this guy who split you apart from your family. You can also find lost cities which will give you at least 100,000 gold. You can marry a governer's daughter. What I usally do is raid a town. I only raid towns if the governer's daughter is not beatiful rating, or if the town belongs to the Spanish. You can betray the country you pick, and maybe even wipe their city's off the map. Although it's old don't stop yourself from buying it.			"

												This is an old game, but I gotta say, it's a good one.I got the urge to play some kinda pirate simulation game a while back, and there has just been nothing out on the market like that of late, unless you're into Assassin's Creed.. which I'm not. (because Ubisoft.)  But I found this on sale for a few bucks.. and thought.. Ok.. Pirates.. Sid Meier.. sure, why not.  It was a good choice.Lots of things you can do..different goals you can try for.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.. I mean, it's a 2004 remake of a 1987 game, so you can't expect too much sophistication out of it..  But that said, if you're looking for something to swash your buckle.. (or would that be buckle your swash?), this'll do it.  The minigame mechanics for fencing and dancing are easy at the lowest difficulty, but get quite challenging at higher ones unless you've got good ""twitch gamer"" reflexes... So most of us will find a decent challenge available.The AI does some strange things at times.. that's pretty much to be expected..   Like in my latest playthrough, I decided to be a English pure ""privateer"".. following the terms of my ""Letter of Marque and Reprisal""..  Drove the French and the Dutch completely out of the Caribbean, and the Spanish are down to just a half a dozen cities on the coast of Mexico and Central America..  The last French and Dutch cities to fall, and the last Spanish city on the northern islands, all responded by sending invasion force after invasion force, sometimes 3 or 4 frigates at once laden with troops.. over and over.. out of cities with barely any money or troops due to my blockade..  which, of course, would be impossible with any sense of ""realism""..But that doesn't detract from the fun. In fact, it makes it even more amusing.. ""How can I get the AI to freak out this time?"" becomes it's own sort of meta-game.  At least for me. I personally would *love* to see a *sequel* to this game.. not a HD remake, or a relaunch.. but a full Pirates! 2.  Updated engine, graphics.. merging geopolitics into it a bit borrowing elements from the Civilization series.. Really treating the naval situation and piracy in the region during that time as it was historically... a proxy war between the competing empires of Europe..  Character development maybe, a skill tree, so you get better at your skills along with upgrading gear, instead of just getting bonuses from equipment..  More promotion options, etc..  The ability to have actual fleet combat, and the ability to found your own colonies...But probably the only actual real *downside* to this game.. is that I haven't figured out how to actually be the aggressor against a foreign city... the only way I've found so far is to just look and sink a whole bunch of their ships till the harbor guns get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥enough to take a pot shot at you.. then you get the option to ""attack""..  I wanna bombard em from sea, then unleash the pirate hordes.. lol..But even with that annoyance, and the limitations of this being a very old remake of an even older game.. it's a classic.. Revolutionary for it's time, and has aged quite well. Give it a try.			"

												Sidmeier's Pirates is a remake of an older version of the Game and ticks all the boxes right for doing so. Having said that. I have 10.5 hours in it and finished it - that said higher difficulties from the start are still open to me, as you are obligated to start at the easiest difficulty when you first start the game but you can during the game up the difficulty by 'dividing the loot'.It has several 'mini-games' including dancing/romancing governor daughters, attacking cities, and fighting on ships. These mini-games are not overly hard, but not too difficult that is just a breeze. As you can interspace them the way you want the mini-games are never bothersome, in my opinion.The atmosphere and humor of the game is its major selling point and as such it a good little game for a bit of relaxing. And with the difficulties, different starting eras, and starting proficiencies you can definately make it harder on yourself to get a more challenging experience should you wish it, but to me it does not seem as if it was created to make you have deep low and mountain peak highs, but rather a relaxing giggle.

I have no idea how many hours I spent building up my pirates back in the day, but I'm looking forward to killing a few hours with this game once more. It will also be a lot of fun introducing my kids to it.Strategy is the name of the game. It's absolutely possible to use a sloop to take down a galleon. As others have said, within minutes of starting the game you can have a massive War Galleon or a Fast Galleon and find yourself taking ports.Don't think about it, just pick it up.			"

It has all you can ask from a game: interesting gameplay, simulation, action, adventure, strategy, a nice story and replayability. The game can get very challenging as there is lots of parameters to take into account (for instance, if your health gets too bad because of age or of too many sword wounds, it'll will be almost impossible to vainquish your archenemesis) so make sure to save from time to time and google some forums before getting frustrated.>9000, 10/10.

												A fun pirate game set in the Caribbean, during the 17th Century. You are a privateer looking to make his fortune and rescues if lost family. It is an early open world game, in that although there is a notional storyline, in practice you tend to end up sailing the seas, capturing or sinking ships with impunity whilst leaving your family to rot in captivity. The gameplay is not only confined to sailing the ocean blue, there is a host other (nefarious) activities to take part in, ranging from sacking cities and copious amounts of swordplay to wooing the daughters of cites governors with your masterful dancing skills. The controls are simple to pick up, although can hard to master are higher difficulty levels – a case in point is the dancing. At low difficulty you are given clear guides to which button to press. This becomes subtle hand gestures at higher levels, easy to miss as you stumble around the dancefloor like you have had too much grog. Graphically it is pretty to look at, without be Assassins Creed Black Flag. Bear in mind this was first released in 1987. It has been updated for modern OS but is still more functional than flashyGameplay	8Graphics	        6Control		7Fun		        8Overall		7.5 "

												Ah Sid Meier how you love to make people waste their entire day away on just one video game. He does it well that's for sure, and Pirates (Next to civilization) Shows this better than anything. With this 2004 release being the best.Pros:-Very Piratey...Yohohoho.-Capturing, Plundering, and Digging up treasure never gets old.-The game let's you increase the difficulty the farther you get in the game-Restoring your family feels good-There's a good amount of upgrades-Pillaging Towns is the best part in my view. It acts as a Turn Bases Strategy, with some nice mechanics-You can Fight actual pirates like Black Beard.Cons:-If you can't control yourself while playing video games. Then STAY FAR AWAY! This game will take your entire life in a blink of an eye.-It's very tedious. If you can't stand grinding you will hate this game.-Dancing STINKS! If you don't have a good num pad then good luck trying to play that minigame.Overall if you like being a pirate then pick this up. Oh but remember something. The Spainish are the best to raid.

												This game is great. In fact, it's probably one of the most fun games I've ever played. You get to live the fantasy of being a pirate...not with all the realities of wasting months of your life on the sea and all the infections that come with that, but you get to fire cannons and have sword fights on deck and raid colonial fortresses and dance with the governors' beautiful daughters. There is plenty of variety in what you can do in this game. If you're tired of capturing ships for profit, go take an outpost for your favorite nation; search for buried treasure; play the main story line; hunt down famous pirates; get captured just so you can have fun sneaking out of jail. This game never gets boring, and the difficulty levels are sufficient to either give you a leisurely stroll through the Caribbean or a truly gripping fight at sea. Highly recommend it.			"

												I won a duel against the swordmaster, found a huge treasure and stole a valueable idol from the governor's mansion. Then I started my travels as a swashbuckling pirate and liked every minute of ""Sid Meier's Pirates!"". It's an awesome game which connects a lot of minigames like ship-to-ship-combat, sword-duels, dancing and town-sieging with the small but nice story of finding your family. Even though it is repetitive, there are different quests as you progress and setting the difficulty also affects the A.I.'s behaviour.			"

												All you need to know about Pirates.This game was released in a similar form in the early 1990's called Pirates Gold for Sega Genesis.One day I started playing in my crappy college apartment as my roomate was leaving to go home for the weekend.  I don't remember the following hours...and days.   What I do remember in startling clarity is the horror on my roomates face when he comes in the door and I am still perched on the same crappy directors chair in the same boxers and t-shirt with several plates of sandwich crumbs and empty pint glasses with dried kool-aid stains still playing the game I had started 3 days earlier to the exclusion of all else, even basic hygiene more advanced than using the toilet.Its just that good.10/10 would neglect all life functions in the manor of a useless junkie again.

At $2.50, there is no excuse for everyone not to have experienced this game.   You could spend $2.50 on coca-cola and regret the calories more than you'll regret this game.And that's silly, because who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the calories in a soda?

												Sid Meier's: Pirates! is an amazing game. I highly enjoy playing it, and I most definitely recommend this game to others, especially to those who loves open world and RPG games.  This game has a lot of mechanics to play with, and the varieties are just endless! There is also some element of tactic and strategy: to get the wind on your side so you can sail faster than other ships, turning your ship to the right angle to bombard your enemies with cannon balls, and position your pirates and buccaneers at strategic positions to overwhelm ports and cities! Or you can just brute force everything, like ramming your ship into enemy ships and hack the captain to pieces! Works too! However, don't expect too much from the stories, as they are slightly repetitive and there isn't too much about the main story of the game. But I definitely recommended the game.Positive:-Lots of things you can do! Recruit crews, take other ships, chase down criminals, romance governors' daughters, find treasures, attack ports, and many more!-You can play the absolute balls out of this game. As if the main quests isn't long enough, you can do many other side quests, like hunting down notorious and famous pirates, hunting for treasure, and finding lost cities. You can also do things for your personal achievement, like becoming the most famed pirate and advancing through the ranks in a faction.Even then, you still can increase the difficulty and add more challenge! Or, you can just retire early, and divide the plunder with your crew.-Variety. There are many different kinds of ships that you can sail, be it a war sloop, a war galleon, a trade galleon, a simple indian canoe, and many more! Add various upgrades to your ship. Be nasty to the European kingdoms by wrecking their ships and sacking their ports, or rise through the ranks as the admiral of the European fleet! Hire (force them to join your crew by sinking the ship they were on and leaving them with no choice) various specialists to aid you in your journey. Choose a weapon to duel against your enemies!Negative:-The plot of Sid Meier's: PIrates! is not too rich. The story is quite repetitive, and may seem boring after a while. Tossing notorious pirates into the sea only to see them magically reappear alive and well while rising through the top 10 pirates list is not the smoothest of things.-Expect not HD high quality graphics. The graphics excellent considering the time when the game was made, and it is bright, cheery and colorful, but it is starting to show its age.-Gameplay might be repetitive after a while. Capturing ships over and over with no other things to do left gets boring. The mechanics of sailing and taking over ports are also dramatically simplified, and it is certainly no sailing simulator.Recommended, 9/10.			"

												This game...it's hard to describe it exactly in an overarching view.Let me go ahead and talk about the factions in this game.Spain: Huge amounts of land and ships, but the ships suck and the land cities are heavily guarded. Ships are usually huge, but slow, and have a huge amount of crew, but the ships seem like they are made out of cardboard. Has most cities in the game. Also, the Spanish are at war with everyone almost all the time.England: Sloops and Brigs as far as the eye can see! England has some of the fastest ships, and remember how I said the Spanish ships are made of cardboard? Well, the English cannons fire the equivalent of napalm in a ball when hitting a Spanish ship. Besides the Spanish, they have the most amount of cities, although most are islands and not on the mainland Americas.France: The French have some what I'd consider all around style of ships. They are a mix of ships and power, but they work. They have less than the English, but aren't doing the worst.Netherlands/Dutch: ""Oh sweet almighty Jesus, we are screwed,"" is probably what you'd think if you were the Dutch king. Basically, the Dutch aren't exactly doing the best when it comes to amount of land or types of ships, but it's much easier to buy and sell in Dutch markets, as well as get promotions. Basically, you want more recruits and buy food cheaper? You want to be Dutch.Jesuit Missions: Basically, think of a bunch of priests living on islands. There you go. They have no real alignment or ships, they just are there and sell food. Talk to them to help with your main quest to find your family.Pirate settlements: Like a regular city, but you can usually only get recruits and food here, but you can end up helping the pirate leader to take over cities.You do NOT have to side with anyone. Basically, the game allows you to have the freedom of you choosing the options to help anyone. I, personally, help the Dutch all the time (because it's actually easy if you are good with economic type of gameplay), but you could, for example, help the Dutch one time, help the English one time, help the Spanish once, then help the French, and have everyone love you.This game is amazing, and it has multiple minigames of fencing, land battles, ship battles, and, yes, dancing.

												Stupidly fun pirates game. There's a main quest to follow, but you can ignore it if you'd like. There are lost cities to discover, treasure to be unburied, towns to be sacked! Work your way up to the number 1 pirate by defeating famous pirates (including Blackbeard!). It's a game of revenge and adventuring, but even a taste of romance as you dance your way through all the governor's daughters. Literally dancing, because there's a dancing minigame.One thing I particularly enjoyed about this game was the combination of real-time and turn-based strategy. Most of it's real-time, but oftentimes if you sack a town, you'll have to pit your pirates against their soldiers in a fun turn-based game (the only time that isn't the case is if your number of pirate greatly trumps their number of soldiers; then you'll just have a sword fight with the Captain of the Guards). It's a fun game with several levels of difficulty, plus you can start at different time periods, which will also help decrease or increase the difficulty of the game, so replayability is high.			"

												Highly addictive. Great fun. Your pirates will sing ""Blow the man down"" when you defeat top pirates. What's not to like?Oh, well, there is the one drawback of not being very userfriendly about how to attack towns and settlements seem to be off limits (if I try to attack via land, it just walks me into the town because even hostile nations don't guard their smallest settlements with soldiers so I guess the townsfolk just defeat pirates by friending them?) I have beat this game twice (if there's such thing as beating it) and I am still planning to play a few more lives. Get this game if you like pirates (legal or non-legal), ships (small and fast to freakin huge frigates), cannons (with a variety of ammo), swords, or, well, ballroom dancing to mad harpsichord music.

												Sidmeier's Pirates is a remake of an older version of the Game and ticks all the boxes right for doing so. Having said that. I have 10.5 hours in it and finished it - that said higher difficulties from the start are still open to me, as you are obligated to start at the easiest difficulty when you first start the game but you can during the game up the difficulty by 'dividing the loot'.It has several 'mini-games' including dancing/romancing governor daughters, attacking cities, and fighting on ships. These mini-games are not overly hard, but not too difficult that is just a breeze. As you can interspace them the way you want the mini-games are never bothersome, in my opinion.The atmosphere and humor of the game is its major selling point and as such it a good little game for a bit of relaxing. And with the difficulties, different starting eras, and starting proficiencies you can definately make it harder on yourself to get a more challenging experience should you wish it, but to me it does not seem as if it was created to make you have deep low and mountain peak highs, but rather a relaxing giggle.

												This is an old game, but I gotta say, it's a good one.I got the urge to play some kinda pirate simulation game a while back, and there has just been nothing out on the market like that of late, unless you're into Assassin's Creed.. which I'm not. (because Ubisoft.)  But I found this on sale for a few bucks.. and thought.. Ok.. Pirates.. Sid Meier.. sure, why not.  It was a good choice.Lots of things you can do..different goals you can try for.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.. I mean, it's a 2004 remake of a 1987 game, so you can't expect too much sophistication out of it..  But that said, if you're looking for something to swash your buckle.. (or would that be buckle your swash?), this'll do it.  The minigame mechanics for fencing and dancing are easy at the lowest difficulty, but get quite challenging at higher ones unless you've got good ""twitch gamer"" reflexes... So most of us will find a decent challenge available.The AI does some strange things at times.. that's pretty much to be expected..   Like in my latest playthrough, I decided to be a English pure ""privateer"".. following the terms of my ""Letter of Marque and Reprisal""..  Drove the French and the Dutch completely out of the Caribbean, and the Spanish are down to just a half a dozen cities on the coast of Mexico and Central America..  The last French and Dutch cities to fall, and the last Spanish city on the northern islands, all responded by sending invasion force after invasion force, sometimes 3 or 4 frigates at once laden with troops.. over and over.. out of cities with barely any money or troops due to my blockade..  which, of course, would be impossible with any sense of ""realism""..But that doesn't detract from the fun. In fact, it makes it even more amusing.. ""How can I get the AI to freak out this time?"" becomes it's own sort of meta-game.  At least for me. I personally would *love* to see a *sequel* to this game.. not a HD remake, or a relaunch.. but a full Pirates! 2.  Updated engine, graphics.. merging geopolitics into it a bit borrowing elements from the Civilization series.. Really treating the naval situation and piracy in the region during that time as it was historically... a proxy war between the competing empires of Europe..  Character development maybe, a skill tree, so you get better at your skills along with upgrading gear, instead of just getting bonuses from equipment..  More promotion options, etc..  The ability to have actual fleet combat, and the ability to found your own colonies...But probably the only actual real *downside* to this game.. is that I haven't figured out how to actually be the aggressor against a foreign city... the only way I've found so far is to just look and sink a whole bunch of their ships till the harbor guns get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥enough to take a pot shot at you.. then you get the option to ""attack""..  I wanna bombard em from sea, then unleash the pirate hordes.. lol..But even with that annoyance, and the limitations of this being a very old remake of an even older game.. it's a classic.. Revolutionary for it's time, and has aged quite well. Give it a try.			"

												Ah Sid Meier how you love to make people waste their entire day away on just one video game. He does it well that's for sure, and Pirates (Next to civilization) Shows this better than anything. With this 2004 release being the best.Pros:-Very Piratey...Yohohoho.-Capturing, Plundering, and Digging up treasure never gets old.-The game let's you increase the difficulty the farther you get in the game-Restoring your family feels good-There's a good amount of upgrades-Pillaging Towns is the best part in my view. It acts as a Turn Bases Strategy, with some nice mechanics-You can Fight actual pirates like Black Beard.Cons:-If you can't control yourself while playing video games. Then STAY FAR AWAY! This game will take your entire life in a blink of an eye.-It's very tedious. If you can't stand grinding you will hate this game.-Dancing STINKS! If you don't have a good num pad then good luck trying to play that minigame.Overall if you like being a pirate then pick this up. Oh but remember something. The Spainish are the best to raid. (SO MUCH MONEY!)			"

												A fun pirate game set in the Caribbean, during the 17th Century. You are a privateer looking to make his fortune and rescues if lost family. It is an early open world game, in that although there is a notional storyline, in practice you tend to end up sailing the seas, capturing or sinking ships with impunity whilst leaving your family to rot in captivity. The gameplay is not only confined to sailing the ocean blue, there is a host other (nefarious) activities to take part in, ranging from sacking cities and copious amounts of swordplay to wooing the daughters of cites governors with your masterful dancing skills. The controls are simple to pick up, although can hard to master are higher difficulty levels – a case in point is the dancing. At low difficulty you are given clear guides to which button to press. This becomes subtle hand gestures at higher levels, easy to miss as you stumble around the dancefloor like you have had too much grog. Graphically it is pretty to look at, without be Assassins Creed Black Flag. Bear in mind this was first released in 1987. It has been updated for modern OS but is still more functional than flashyGameplay	8Graphics	        6Control		7Fun		        8Overall		7.5 "

												The tale of the Shipless pirate.it all started well, Mr. Sir. Captain. Reynaldo was a French Privateer raiding English and Spanish shipping he came to amass a small fortune in prizes and plunder he soon became famous and took on more crew, but soon things changed for the worse the French made peace with the spanish and the English merchants were all too scared to sail home. with the money stoping he soon took to darker pursuits, buying strange medicine from a myterious man in a backroom of a shady for 6000 Gold the men soon became worried for their captain, but more so for the loot. the spending was rampent, 3000 gold here a few thousand more there. soon the fortune he had spent years building was well deminished he resorted to outright Piracy to keep the crew in line. he started spinning tales to governors daughters dancing with them hoping to lead them on for more money to buy ""exotic"" and ""mystical"" items, but the crew finally agreed it was time for Mutiniy but just as it happened they suddenly came under fire, an English Pirate Hunter masking itself as french. the Crew returned fire a round of chain shot destroyed the main sail and the English promptly surrendered, a large amount of gold was plundered, and the Crew Mutinied taking the Gold and the Captains ship leaving him stranded on an Island.  Thus the final score is 10/10 would buy strange medicine from a mysterious man in a dark backroom of a Shady tavarn.			"

												An amazign well designed game. It is so much fun and quite simple to pick up I played for hours straight. I became addicated to getting everything and beatling all quests which is extremely unlike me. Only issue is that for me at least the keypad never worked and I played the whole game using the mouse which once you get the hang of it isn't bad but during fencing I had to ""cheat"" and keep pause the game.

I normally don't rate a game higher than 9.5 no matter how awesome it is if it has no replay value.  For this reason, I give Sid Meier's PIRATES!  a 10.  I have played hundreds of arcade and PC game and this game is most certainly in my top 5 of all time.			"

												I won a duel against the swordmaster, found a huge treasure and stole a valueable idol from the governor's mansion. Then I started my travels as a swashbuckling pirate and liked every minute of ""Sid Meier's Pirates!"". It's an awesome game which connects a lot of minigames like ship-to-ship-combat, sword-duels, dancing and town-sieging with the small but nice story of finding your family. Even though it is repetitive, there are different quests as you progress and setting the difficulty also affects the A.I.'s behaviour.			"

												This is an old game, but I gotta say, it's a good one.I got the urge to play some kinda pirate simulation game a while back, and there has just been nothing out on the market like that of late, unless you're into Assassin's Creed.. which I'm not. (because Ubisoft.)  But I found this on sale for a few bucks.. and thought.. Ok.. Pirates.. Sid Meier.. sure, why not.  It was a good choice.Lots of things you can do..different goals you can try for.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.. I mean, it's a 2004 remake of a 1987 game, so you can't expect too much sophistication out of it..  But that said, if you're looking for something to swash your buckle.. (or would that be buckle your swash?), this'll do it.  The minigame mechanics for fencing and dancing are easy at the lowest difficulty, but get quite challenging at higher ones unless you've got good ""twitch gamer"" reflexes... So most of us will find a decent challenge available.The AI does some strange things at times.. that's pretty much to be expected..   Like in my latest playthrough, I decided to be a English pure ""privateer"".. following the terms of my ""Letter of Marque and Reprisal""..  Drove the French and the Dutch completely out of the Caribbean, and the Spanish are down to just a half a dozen cities on the coast of Mexico and Central America..  The last French and Dutch cities to fall, and the last Spanish city on the northern islands, all responded by sending invasion force after invasion force, sometimes 3 or 4 frigates at once laden with troops.. over and over.. out of cities with barely any money or troops due to my blockade..  which, of course, would be impossible with any sense of ""realism""..But that doesn't detract from the fun. In fact, it makes it even more amusing.. ""How can I get the AI to freak out this time?"" becomes it's own sort of meta-game.  At least for me. I personally would *love* to see a *sequel* to this game.. not a HD remake, or a relaunch.. but a full Pirates! 2.  Updated engine, graphics.. merging geopolitics into it a bit borrowing elements from the Civilization series.. Really treating the naval situation and piracy in the region during that time as it was historically... a proxy war between the competing empires of Europe..  Character development maybe, a skill tree, so you get better at your skills along with upgrading gear, instead of just getting bonuses from equipment..  More promotion options, etc..  The ability to have actual fleet combat, and the ability to found your own colonies...But probably the only actual real *downside* to this game.. is that I haven't figured out how to actually be the aggressor against a foreign city... the only way I've found so far is to just look and sink a whole bunch of their ships till the harbor guns get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥enough to take a pot shot at you.. then you get the option to ""attack""..  I wanna bombard em from sea, then unleash the pirate hordes.. lol..But even with that annoyance, and the limitations of this being a very old remake of an even older game.. it's a classic.. Revolutionary for it's time, and has aged quite well. Give it a try.			"

												I originally bought this game off a scholastic reading catalog in 4th grade. My brothers and I would play it for hours obviously and would never be able to find his lost family and ever beat the game. That being said we had a blast sailing around the Caribbean and Spanish main doing pillaging and retiring as rich badasses with the governor of Port Royal’s daughter. The game is still fun even though I now find it very easy. All in all its a good game. If for whatever reason you don’t feel like shelling out ten dollars for it wait for a sale. It’s worth the buy.

												Previously worked on my linux machine under steam. After having come back to steam after having spent a year or so not using it, then reinstalling it on my new machine, i find that this game has been disabled for linux.There were no issues whatsoever that I encountered in playing this game the first time round. No crashes, no graphical glitches, nothing. And I played it plenty.The game is good, steam is crap.There are other titles that I'm tempted to purchase on steam, because they are interesting, and only available on steam. I've always known that a system like steam keeps full control of the titles it manages away from the purchaser, making situations like mine possible, but never thought it would actually happen.Now that I know anything I purchase has a serious chance of being arbitrarily stolen from me at a later date without warning I will be going without.

												In this game you take a role of privateer or pirate. You can work for either English, French, Dutch or Spanish - or even for all of them if you time your actions well. There's constantly changing basic economic and political system where player's actions do affect on the bigger picture as well. You can sail, capture ships, fight pirates, trade, do missions, dance with governors daughters and so on. There's many goals to fullfill and many ways to play. Because there's different eras to choose from and the world is open, dynamic and reactive the gaming experience does change lot. There's also different difficulty levels which do have effect. Game's replayability value is quite high and you can get it cheaply, especially on sale. Technically speaking I have been playing this game for something like 30 years from it's early versions on Commodore 64. From those early days they have added more content and huge haul in graphics but the core is same. And it works. Still one of the best, if not best, pirate games there are.			"

												I have always loved this game, it's a pretty simple game that isn't very challenging, but I love it.Pros:•Wont matter for a lot of people, butvery little mouse input needed, great for playing on the bus, or somewhere where I don't have an external mouse with my laptop•Graphics still hold decently well, the animations are a bit laughable, but the graphics don't hurt my eyes.•Very little story.  While the game does have a story, it doesn't push you into doing it at all, so your free to do whatever you want. Considdered a pro, because a lot of simular games like this force you to do the main storyline, and limit the open-world.Cons:•Some of the minigames can get a bit reppetitive. Dancing is very important in the game, but is not very fun, and I hate sneaking into towns. The most common ones like sword-fighting or ship battles stay fun.•Not very difficult. Even on swashbucking difficulty (the hardest one) the only thing I have trouble with is a few sword fights, but if you use the cutlass and taunt often, they aren't a problem.Overall, this game deffinetly is not for everyone. I have always loved this style of game, so it's easy for me to love this game. The game isn't very expensive, especially on sale, so I would whole-heartedly recomend picking it up if it looks even slightly appealing to you. "

Graphics and controls (obviously) much improved!2) Family friendly gameplay without sacrificing good ole fashion pirating!  Fighting, plundering, charming governors' daughters, revenge...I could go on.3) Definitely fits in the ""Just one more turn"" category.Cons:1) For modern gamers, this might be a bit outdated, but for those who remember the grinding of the floppy drives and the monochromatic displays, there's nothing wrong here.2) No lady pirates and no character customization.

Yes, there are third party sites you can go to but its not very user friendly.

												When Sid Meier's Pirates! came out in 2005 it was a great remake and a great game by itself. However, i cannot recommend it anymore. The graphics are still not too shabby and the game itself is great but you cannot select widescreen resolutions in the menu and so you will end up with a 4:3 windowed game. Even worse is that the game sometimes has some problems with controls. Numblock won't work then. I would really like to see the developers adding widescreen resolutions and real Windows 7/8/10 compatibility and a fix for the numpad problem. Up until then the 1987 PIRATES! GOLD will work with less hassle than this game.			"

												This game holds up remarkably well, despite its age. The developers did an excellent job at picking an aesthetic that looks great within the limitations of mid 2000's hardware. The gameplay is solid and is remarkably glitch-free. I love that it includes real geography and historical pirates. It's a fun, whimsical, and colorful interpretation of the pirate mythos.I only have two complaints about the game. The first is that the ground combat is lacking and I feel like it could have been left out entirely. The second is that the game is involved in some historical revisionism in that it completely ignores slavery and the triangular trade. That said, neither of those stopped me from dropping 50 hours into a decade-old game.			"

												The game has Sid Meier's name. It should say it all. Open world and  addictive gameplay is what you get. The game is still enjoyable many years after its release. The graphics do look aged, but the art style looks good and that, in my book, is more important than polygon count and texture resolutions.			"

												This is an old game, but I gotta say, it's a good one.I got the urge to play some kinda pirate simulation game a while back, and there has just been nothing out on the market like that of late, unless you're into Assassin's Creed.. which I'm not. (because Ubisoft.)  But I found this on sale for a few bucks.. and thought.. Ok.. Pirates.. Sid Meier.. sure, why not.  It was a good choice.Lots of things you can do..different goals you can try for.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.. I mean, it's a 2004 remake of a 1987 game, so you can't expect too much sophistication out of it..  But that said, if you're looking for something to swash your buckle.. (or would that be buckle your swash?), this'll do it.  The minigame mechanics for fencing and dancing are easy at the lowest difficulty, but get quite challenging at higher ones unless you've got good ""twitch gamer"" reflexes... So most of us will find a decent challenge available.The AI does some strange things at times.. that's pretty much to be expected..   Like in my latest playthrough, I decided to be a English pure ""privateer"".. following the terms of my ""Letter of Marque and Reprisal""..  Drove the French and the Dutch completely out of the Caribbean, and the Spanish are down to just a half a dozen cities on the coast of Mexico and Central America..  The last French and Dutch cities to fall, and the last Spanish city on the northern islands, all responded by sending invasion force after invasion force, sometimes 3 or 4 frigates at once laden with troops.. over and over.. out of cities with barely any money or troops due to my blockade..  which, of course, would be impossible with any sense of ""realism""..But that doesn't detract from the fun. In fact, it makes it even more amusing.. ""How can I get the AI to freak out this time?"" becomes it's own sort of meta-game.  At least for me. I personally would *love* to see a *sequel* to this game.. not a HD remake, or a relaunch.. but a full Pirates! 2.  Updated engine, graphics.. merging geopolitics into it a bit borrowing elements from the Civilization series.. Really treating the naval situation and piracy in the region during that time as it was historically... a proxy war between the competing empires of Europe..  Character development maybe, a skill tree, so you get better at your skills along with upgrading gear, instead of just getting bonuses from equipment..  More promotion options, etc..  The ability to have actual fleet combat, and the ability to found your own colonies...But probably the only actual real *downside* to this game.. is that I haven't figured out how to actually be the aggressor against a foreign city... the only way I've found so far is to just look and sink a whole bunch of their ships till the harbor guns get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥enough to take a pot shot at you.. then you get the option to ""attack""..  I wanna bombard em from sea, then unleash the pirate hordes.. lol..But even with that annoyance, and the limitations of this being a very old remake of an even older game.. it's a classic.. Revolutionary for it's time, and has aged quite well. Give it a try.			"

												Great game but there is a major issue. I call it the death bug. It's happened to me and my friends around 10 times. Basicly you're having fun, doing the story, getting promoted, then BAM, you're stuck on a island. I've heard tales of people getting out of the death bug, but sadly it's consumed 3 of my saves and stopped me from playing the game a month ago. I'll probably try again soon to see if I can last more than 2 hours without the death bug.			"

												This is a minigame fiesta that even Miyamoto would be proud of.  I could win this game on hardest difficulty with a beer in one hand while doing my taxes on a seperate screen.   You would think that would make it boring- you'd be dead wrong. This game is the epitome of the Sid Meier Sorcery™.   It's a perfect mix of theme and mechanic, people of all ages and backgrounds could enjoy it- it's just a perfect game, really. He could merely update the graphics, add a couple more minigames, and sell it for 60 bucks and I would seriously consider it.  "

												This game is one of the best games I've ever played. A balanced and engrossing mix of elements including tactics, trading, sailing, rpg(revenge), humor, Disney (yes), combat, and rommance！！The details of every fraction is extremely well handeled. I like how they put 3 levels of rommance options for each nation and you can potentially pick your GF from 24 different girls! That's more than Skyrim! Though usually I would skip the ""plain"" ones. (I mean seriously the barmaid looks more royal than them)  In the begining I was a little lost about what to do in the game but once I found my way around the game it became very addictive. That didn't take too long since it's pretty self-explanatory. 9.5 out of 10 the 0.5 taken out because I had a headach finding lost relatives/city the map for those missions seems to be auto-generated at random. Sometimes it tells you to search ""The south of XX city"" you could end up spending 3 hours hiking through the area in vain. Not sure if it's a bug or I wasn't doing the right thing.			"

You can upgrade your ships and rule the sea while being friendly with city mayors to get their backing. I loved it in when i was a kid and I still love it.  Best pirate game out there...  "

												Very enjoyable classic game. You get too sail around attacking pirates and or other nations (and even your own) ships as you please. You might even annoy a nation enough to attack you on sight, forcing you to fight the town you were trying to buy some food supplies from and install a new governor. If you dont feel like sinking every ship you see there is also dancing with governors daughters, sword fighting (both in the tavern under some circumstances, and on the deck of the ship if your ships get too close during a ship battle) and Trading. You can build up a fleet of powerful ships, you can hunt down the pirate captain that has taken your sister... you can be left stranded on some rocks for months on end...For a game of it's age it does not dissapoint, is very entertaining and has more elements to it than expected. The graphics are not bad and you can sink a lot of hours into it without noticing!Highly reccomended to everybody			"

												Fun game for traveling the sea as a pirate.  Attack and plunder ships from different nations, only use care not to continously attack the same nation vessels/cities, otherwise they will attack you on sight for some time.  If you get in good with the local mayor, you can begin courting his daughter based on a game of pressing the keys in time with her dance movement.  This dancing is similar to combat in the game, only with the combat, you want to press the key that counters the pirates attack, not the same attack.Also, if you court the daughter enough times, you can eventually marry her.  There are three levels of ""hotness"" for each daughter.  You should be able to tell which daughter of a town/city is the hottest and which one is mediocre (the amount of cleveage is a good indicator [except for one version of the Dutch daughter, you just have to look at her face and breast size to verify if she is the hot one or not]).When you obtain enough portions to complete a map, you can search the land for buried treasure or a missing family member.  You can also assault a town/city like this, switching to a strategy game of moving your troops around a grid.One problem I had with this game is the pirates you recruit for your ship.  They constantly become demanding for more and more goods.  If you hold on to the goods for too long, sailing from one location to another without constantly plundering goods, they may mutiny on you and take off with one of your ships.  This usually requires splitting up the loot and recruiting more sailors, which eats up time in the game and lets your character age more quickly.The second, and much worse problem, in the game is the game becomes too redundant.  You go to a port town, sell off your goods, recruit new sailors, plunder ships, and search for your missing family and buried treasure.  At first it is fun but does lose its appeal about half way through.I still enjoyed this game overall and would recommend playing it, especially if you can purchase the game with a Steam special sale price.

												I saw my roommate playing this game, and he reccomended it to me. Easily one of the best uses of $10 on steam. It's not particularly hard, the graphics haven't quite aged well, the numberpad can be awkward, the factions are pretty interchangeable, the romance mechanic would cause anger on Tumblr (attractiveness is determined purely by how much cleavage the girl shows), but the game itself reminds me of the old Errol Flynn movies. Shooting some cannons, swinging onto a ship, fencing the captain down, then sailing victorious into port to kiss a lovely maiden and bring a rogue to justice is such pure FUN that I can ignore the flaws, all of which could be fixed by a good remake. Since that is not imminent, I highly recommend this game for a great PG pirate adventure			"

												I enjoy this game from time to time. It's a slow paced pirate game - achingly slow when it comes to sailing (there are ways to speed it up, but even when maxed speed it's achingly slow when you sail against the wind) where you basically sack towns, fight and collect ships and more or less do what you'd expect in a game based on pirates.The ship combat I like the most. It's all about nailing the enemy ship(s) hard enough to cripple their ability to fight back without doing so much damage that you sink them (lest you say goodbye to the loot on their ship - or the ship itself if you wanted to capture it for your fleet) all while taking into account angles and wind direction to keep your ship moving. There are a good number of ships but once fully upgraded they fall into 2 basic catagories: 1. Big ship. Holds a lot of health, crew and cannons.2. Small ship. Dodges everything much easier with small size, fast turning, and fast speed.Once you collide of course there's a boarding sword fight scene - the ship battle being to widdle each others' crew down before boarding or get the other to surrender. The more crew you have the more time you have - if one crew defeats the other before the sword fight you're in is over the winning crew takes the win. There are a couple of options for swords but they don't change the experience very drastically unless on higher difficulties. After the fight the winner takes the loser's ship (they'll either sink it or add it to their fleet).There's a few other things to the game too. Sailing and ship battles tend to take up almost all of the time I spend playing. The battles are not soul draining though - unless one ship runs and the similar speeds result in the chase going on about a literal minute or two of almost no stimulation (I prefered small fast ships because they cut out the speed problem more often than big ones). There are a few other parts though. Minigames as part of the game progression more or less; ballroom dancing with govenors' daughters to raise reputation with them, sword fighting resembles a combinarion of ""Paper-Rock-Scissors"" and Flash Cards, hide and seek style treasure hunting where you collect map peices and use them to find where to go, and city seiges which feel like turn based Overhead strategy game.The overhead city attack is actually a little fun too. Your crew make up 3 unit types. Officers, Pirates and Buckaneers. They play very simply. Officers and pirates melee attack like chess peices that all only move 1 space each on the board (with officers being stronger). The buckeneers can shoot from several spaces away for much weaker damage. Attacking from the back or sides deals a lot more. Diving into cover helps against their guns. Also the more one unit gets into a fight the weaker he is due to moral dropping. That's about it to the strategy. There are no buildings to create or making more units or anything. The enemy does have a pretty varied amount of unit types though (protip: If the enemy has horsemen go straight for a forest tile. Those suckers are OP outside of them but get cut a third of their strength in forests. If the enemy has indians get out of the forests).You pretty much do these things over and over. There's really no plot or story other than a little intro scene (well technically you hunt down family, but it's not very focused on). It's a reletively fun game when just chilling and wanting to pimp up a ship. I won't lie though... the slow parts are painful.			"

												This is currently £1.49 in the winter sale and I was playing this before I even had steam so my hours on steam are a bit of a lie. I love this game, it is one of the best games I have ever played I have been playing games for around 35 years. Sure it is now looking a little old but it is just plain good fun and adventure at its normal price it is worth every penny, right now you are crazy if you don't get it.			"

												Great little game that I deeply enjoyed.Controls take a little getting used to but once you get to grip with them they're fine.Only real downsides for me were the need to 'split the booty' multiple times in a game, would have preferred it to be an optional thing and have a quest or expensive item as an alternative way to reduce crew unhappiness.And the occasional accidental sinking of a member of your fleet, would have been nice for the ships in your fleet that you don't control to have a little smarter Ai for pathing, sending a massive galleon through that tiny gap I just sailed my tiny slope through was an expensive mistake.Wished for feature: fountain of youth aka endless mode, who wants to get old and have to stop being a pirate I want to live forever with endless time to go kill blackbeard or find that missing person.

												Previously worked on my linux machine under steam. After having come back to steam after having spent a year or so not using it, then reinstalling it on my new machine, i find that this game has been disabled for linux.There were no issues whatsoever that I encountered in playing this game the first time round. No crashes, no graphical glitches, nothing. And I played it plenty.The game is good, steam is crap.There are other titles that I'm tempted to purchase on steam, because they are interesting, and only available on steam. I've always known that a system like steam keeps full control of the titles it manages away from the purchaser, making situations like mine possible, but never thought it would actually happen.Now that I know anything I purchase has a serious chance of being arbitrarily stolen from me at a later date without warning I will be going without.

Shooting some cannons, swinging onto a ship, fencing the captain down, then sailing victorious into port to kiss a lovely maiden and bring a rogue to justice is such pure FUN that I can ignore the flaws, all of which could be fixed by a good remake.

												All you need to know about Pirates.This game was released in a similar form in the early 1990's called Pirates Gold for Sega Genesis.One day I started playing in my crappy college apartment as my roomate was leaving to go home for the weekend.  I don't remember the following hours...and days.   What I do remember in startling clarity is the horror on my roomates face when he comes in the door and I am still perched on the same crappy directors chair in the same boxers and t-shirt with several plates of sandwich crumbs and empty pint glasses with dried kool-aid stains still playing the game I had started 3 days earlier to the exclusion of all else, even basic hygiene more advanced than using the toilet.Its just that good.10/10 would neglect all life functions in the manor of a useless junkie again.

												Anyone that doesn't like this game is out of their damn mind. I LOVE THIS GAME!!! I just had close to 50k gold. Went to Havana and divided it all between my crew of like..almost 400? I came out with close to 7k.I'm a count to the Spanish, even though they are who I attack and plunder ships of most often. I have a LOT of treasures or collectible thingers, like upgraded swords, guns, clothes, ruby ring, diamond necklace, compasses, rutters.....dancing shoes, all sorts of stuff. I am (or was, but probably still am) the 2nd Most Notorious Pirate in the Spanish Main. I beat Henry's butt (forgot his last name) and got Queen Anne's Revenge from him (not sure what happened to Blackbeard..assuming this guy took it from him), and toted around the ocean with it in my fleet for a long while. I have every upgrade on my Spanish War Galleon that I think there possibly is. So......yeah.This game is awesome.Now I just need to make it back to the other side of the map and find that big breasted woman I wanted to woo and try and woo her.♥♥♥♥♥ better like the jewelry I got her or I'll choke her with it.Also, I've done barely any of the quests. Aside from one waiting for me when I get to a place. My family is probably long gone or dead by now...			"

												This is a dumb game!  And it's unlike most of the Sid Meier's Civilization games. That said it can be fun to stumble through this (and if you've tried dancing with the Governor's daughter You'll know what I mean) But dumb isn't always a bad thing. The basic mechanics seem simple and it's a great change of pace. I originally bought a copy of this years ago and toyed with it a bit. But when I saw the chance to get it in my Steam account for under $1 I decided it was time to revisit it.When I checked that it would run OK I was immediately drawn back into the game's playful aspects and spent over an hour before saying ""It's time to get back to the real world.""  By all means check it out. For less than a buck it's already been worth my money.			"

You can upgrade your ship, capture other ships to add to your fleet, manage your crew and goods, visit towns. It's a whole bunch of things that sound mundane when written, but surprisingly addictive when you actually play the game.7/10 ""Good""			"

												Stupidly fun pirates game. There's a main quest to follow, but you can ignore it if you'd like. There are lost cities to discover, treasure to be unburied, towns to be sacked! Work your way up to the number 1 pirate by defeating famous pirates (including Blackbeard!). It's a game of revenge and adventuring, but even a taste of romance as you dance your way through all the governor's daughters. Literally dancing, because there's a dancing minigame.One thing I particularly enjoyed about this game was the combination of real-time and turn-based strategy. Most of it's real-time, but oftentimes if you sack a town, you'll have to pit your pirates against their soldiers in a fun turn-based game (the only time that isn't the case is if your number of pirate greatly trumps their number of soldiers; then you'll just have a sword fight with the Captain of the Guards). It's a fun game with several levels of difficulty, plus you can start at different time periods, which will also help decrease or increase the difficulty of the game, so replayability is high.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates is an interesting mix of genres presented in a sort of ""proto-sandbox"" fashion: players take on the role of a swashbuckler living during the 17th century ""Golden Age of Piracy"". You may pursue the in-game story of searching the Caribbean Sea for their lost family members, but the game does not push this object on you but every so often, meaning that players are fully free to disregard the main storyline in order to make their own distinct niche out of Caribbean life. These activities include ship navigation and exploration, land combat (presented as a turn-based strategy minigame, ala Civilization), and courting noblewomen (presented as a rhythm minigame).The graphics are colorful and have the right amount of cartoonishness to them, and the often upbeat soundtrack helps put a smile on my face every time I boot this game up. If any of this sounds interesting, I'd say to jump head-on into Sid Meier's Pirates, as I don't think a simple review conveys how much fun this game is, so much as sitting down and making of it what you will does. The seas are what you make of them!Also, for those of you who originally owned this game on CD like I did, Steam will be able to read and use your old save files!			"

												Great game. The first time i've played this game was on a 386 computer, I believe that wsd the first game I bought.Of course this game is not the same thst I bought for my 386, it has many more features. This game is not a new one and the graphics are outdated but the game itself is very enjoyable. It has also many minigames, like the dancing or the fencing which give some depth to the game.			"

												Anyone who has ever played Pirates of the Carribean Online will find this game very similar. It's got great naval fights, however other than that the fights on land are rather plain and revolves around a simple puzzle similar to rock-papers-scissors. After about 10 hours of gameplay, I've managed to practically finish the story mode and it gets rather dull afterwards. Nevertheless, I still recommend the game since it's surprisingly still very fun for a 2004 game.			"

He could merely update the graphics, add a couple more minigames, and sell it for 60 bucks and I would seriously consider it.  "

												This is a dumb game!  And it's unlike most of the Sid Meier's Civilization games. That said it can be fun to stumble through this (and if you've tried dancing with the Governor's daughter You'll know what I mean) But dumb isn't always a bad thing. The basic mechanics seem simple and it's a great change of pace. I originally bought a copy of this years ago and toyed with it a bit. But when I saw the chance to get it in my Steam account for under $1 I decided it was time to revisit it.When I checked that it would run OK I was immediately drawn back into the game's playful aspects and spent over an hour before saying ""It's time to get back to the real world.""  By all means check it out. For less than a buck it's already been worth my money.			"

												Highly addictive. Great fun. Your pirates will sing ""Blow the man down"" when you defeat top pirates. What's not to like?Oh, well, there is the one drawback of not being very userfriendly about how to attack towns and settlements seem to be off limits (if I try to attack via land, it just walks me into the town because even hostile nations don't guard their smallest settlements with soldiers so I guess the townsfolk just defeat pirates by friending them?) I have beat this game twice (if there's such thing as beating it) and I am still planning to play a few more lives. Get this game if you like pirates (legal or non-legal), ships (small and fast to freakin huge frigates), cannons (with a variety of ammo), swords, or, well, ballroom dancing to mad harpsichord music.

												Just because a game is old doesn`t mean that its poor. This game is amazing and still stands up today in both gameplay and graphics. There are multiple paths you can choose in your personal adventure. With four factions (England, France, Spain and the Dutch) theres plenty of ships to plunder and town to raze, plus lots of goveners to help and ranks to climb, not to mention the dancing at the ball. On YouTube I`d recommend Sips` playthrough if you need any help or just want an entertaining watch.			"

												This game...it's hard to describe it exactly in an overarching view.Let me go ahead and talk about the factions in this game.Spain: Huge amounts of land and ships, but the ships suck and the land cities are heavily guarded. Ships are usually huge, but slow, and have a huge amount of crew, but the ships seem like they are made out of cardboard. Has most cities in the game. Also, the Spanish are at war with everyone almost all the time.England: Sloops and Brigs as far as the eye can see! England has some of the fastest ships, and remember how I said the Spanish ships are made of cardboard? Well, the English cannons fire the equivalent of napalm in a ball when hitting a Spanish ship. Besides the Spanish, they have the most amount of cities, although most are islands and not on the mainland Americas.France: The French have some what I'd consider all around style of ships. They are a mix of ships and power, but they work. They have less than the English, but aren't doing the worst.Netherlands/Dutch: ""Oh sweet almighty Jesus, we are screwed,"" is probably what you'd think if you were the Dutch king. Basically, the Dutch aren't exactly doing the best when it comes to amount of land or types of ships, but it's much easier to buy and sell in Dutch markets, as well as get promotions. Basically, you want more recruits and buy food cheaper? You want to be Dutch.Jesuit Missions: Basically, think of a bunch of priests living on islands. There you go. They have no real alignment or ships, they just are there and sell food. Talk to them to help with your main quest to find your family.Pirate settlements: Like a regular city, but you can usually only get recruits and food here, but you can end up helping the pirate leader to take over cities.You do NOT have to side with anyone. Basically, the game allows you to have the freedom of you choosing the options to help anyone. I, personally, help the Dutch all the time (because it's actually easy if you are good with economic type of gameplay), but you could, for example, help the Dutch one time, help the English one time, help the Spanish once, then help the French, and have everyone love you.This game is amazing, and it has multiple minigames of fencing, land battles, ship battles, and, yes, dancing.

												I played this a lot years ago, and it's still very enjoyable.  It's a pirate simulator with gameplay broken into a series of mini-games.  Sailing, sword-fighting, dancing, and sneaking are each individual mini-games, most of them similar to quick time events, and there is a simple system for dealing with food, morale, crew, loot, and all that.  There's also a story but it's not very interesting.  It's weakness is a lack of depth.  You will get tired of it eventually, because it becomes quite repetetive after a while.			"

												Fun game for traveling the sea as a pirate.  Attack and plunder ships from different nations, only use care not to continously attack the same nation vessels/cities, otherwise they will attack you on sight for some time.  If you get in good with the local mayor, you can begin courting his daughter based on a game of pressing the keys in time with her dance movement.  This dancing is similar to combat in the game, only with the combat, you want to press the key that counters the pirates attack, not the same attack.Also, if you court the daughter enough times, you can eventually marry her.  There are three levels of ""hotness"" for each daughter.  You should be able to tell which daughter of a town/city is the hottest and which one is mediocre (the amount of cleveage is a good indicator [except for one version of the Dutch daughter, you just have to look at her face and breast size to verify if she is the hot one or not]).When you obtain enough portions to complete a map, you can search the land for buried treasure or a missing family member.  You can also assault a town/city like this, switching to a strategy game of moving your troops around a grid.One problem I had with this game is the pirates you recruit for your ship.  They constantly become demanding for more and more goods.  If you hold on to the goods for too long, sailing from one location to another without constantly plundering goods, they may mutiny on you and take off with one of your ships.  This usually requires splitting up the loot and recruiting more sailors, which eats up time in the game and lets your character age more quickly.The second, and much worse problem, in the game is the game becomes too redundant.  You go to a port town, sell off your goods, recruit new sailors, plunder ships, and search for your missing family and buried treasure.  At first it is fun but does lose its appeal about half way through.I still enjoyed this game overall and would recommend playing it, especially if you can purchase the game with a Steam special sale price.

												I used to play this game as a youngling, and it was a captivating experience then. I wanted to experience the game again, (My CD-ROM version of the game is lost to time.) so I searched for it on the Steam store. I was plesantly surprised when I found one of my childhood relics in the results. Gleefully I bought it. I booted the game, chose my name and the nation that I would steal my first ship from, and set sail. I am happy to say that this game has weathered the test of time very well and still holds a depth and replayability that many more modern games lack. Even ignoring my nostalgic feelings for the game, I feel compelled to recommend this game to everyone.			"

												When Sid Meier's Pirates! came out in 2005 it was a great remake and a great game by itself. However, i cannot recommend it anymore. The graphics are still not too shabby and the game itself is great but you cannot select widescreen resolutions in the menu and so you will end up with a 4:3 windowed game. Even worse is that the game sometimes has some problems with controls. Numblock won't work then. I would really like to see the developers adding widescreen resolutions and real Windows 7/8/10 compatibility and a fix for the numpad problem. Up until then the 1987 PIRATES! GOLD will work with less hassle than this game.			"

It's an awesome game which connects a lot of minigames like ship-to-ship-combat, sword-duels, dancing and town-sieging with the small but nice story of finding your family. Even though it is repetitive, there are different quests as you progress and setting the difficulty also affects the A.I.'s behaviour.			"

												An absolute classic of a game. It's not that deep, but its broad, and its more or less a ton of mini-games piled one on top of the other, so the game play is always varied enough to be engaging, and the more or less simple games don't get boring in and of themselves.			"

This game is just fun and I have logged hundreds if not thousands of hours on this game over the years.			"

												Sid Meier's Pirates! is a game with true staying power. Dated by todays standards, any fans of the fictionalized 'Golden Age of Piracy', that can get past the aging graphics and interface, will be deeply rewarded.  From ship combat to searching for treasure on land, Pirates! touches on them all. Trading, pillaging, romancing and prestige; all await the intrepid adventurer!			"

												I remember the old 5 1/2 inch floppy version of this game, back when I was 8 years old.  I thought it was cool then. This reboot is much the same as the original, but better in so many ways.  Pros:1) No more 5/12 inch floppy! Graphics and controls (obviously) much improved!2) Family friendly gameplay without sacrificing good ole fashion pirating!  Fighting, plundering, charming governors' daughters, revenge...I could go on.3) Definitely fits in the ""Just one more turn"" category.Cons:1) For modern gamers, this might be a bit outdated, but for those who remember the grinding of the floppy drives and the monochromatic displays, there's nothing wrong here.2) No lady pirates and no character customization.  You will not be disappointed.			"

I normally don't rate a game higher than 9.5 no matter how awesome it is if it has no replay value.  For this reason, I give Sid Meier's PIRATES!  a 10.  I have played hundreds of arcade and PC game and this game is most certainly in my top 5 of all time.			"

												Sid Meier's: Pirates! is an amazing game. I highly enjoy playing it, and I most definitely recommend this game to others, especially to those who loves open world and RPG games.  This game has a lot of mechanics to play with, and the varieties are just endless! There is also some element of tactic and strategy: to get the wind on your side so you can sail faster than other ships, turning your ship to the right angle to bombard your enemies with cannon balls, and position your pirates and buccaneers at strategic positions to overwhelm ports and cities! Or you can just brute force everything, like ramming your ship into enemy ships and hack the captain to pieces! Works too! However, don't expect too much from the stories, as they are slightly repetitive and there isn't too much about the main story of the game. But I definitely recommended the game.Positive:-Lots of things you can do! Recruit crews, take other ships, chase down criminals, romance governors' daughters, find treasures, attack ports, and many more!-You can play the absolute balls out of this game. As if the main quests isn't long enough, you can do many other side quests, like hunting down notorious and famous pirates, hunting for treasure, and finding lost cities. You can also do things for your personal achievement, like becoming the most famed pirate and advancing through the ranks in a faction.Even then, you still can increase the difficulty and add more challenge! Or, you can just retire early, and divide the plunder with your crew.-Variety. There are many different kinds of ships that you can sail, be it a war sloop, a war galleon, a trade galleon, a simple indian canoe, and many more! Add various upgrades to your ship. Be nasty to the European kingdoms by wrecking their ships and sacking their ports, or rise through the ranks as the admiral of the European fleet! Hire (force them to join your crew by sinking the ship they were on and leaving them with no choice) various specialists to aid you in your journey. Choose a weapon to duel against your enemies!Negative:-The plot of Sid Meier's: PIrates! is not too rich. The story is quite repetitive, and may seem boring after a while. Tossing notorious pirates into the sea only to see them magically reappear alive and well while rising through the top 10 pirates list is not the smoothest of things.-Expect not HD high quality graphics. The graphics excellent considering the time when the game was made, and it is bright, cheery and colorful, but it is starting to show its age.-Gameplay might be repetitive after a while. Capturing ships over and over with no other things to do left gets boring. The mechanics of sailing and taking over ports are also dramatically simplified, and it is certainly no sailing simulator.Recommended, 9/10.			"

												Previously worked on my linux machine under steam. After having come back to steam after having spent a year or so not using it, then reinstalling it on my new machine, i find that this game has been disabled for linux.There were no issues whatsoever that I encountered in playing this game the first time round. No crashes, no graphical glitches, nothing. And I played it plenty.The game is good, steam is crap.There are other titles that I'm tempted to purchase on steam, because they are interesting, and only available on steam. I've always known that a system like steam keeps full control of the titles it manages away from the purchaser, making situations like mine possible, but never thought it would actually happen.Now that I know anything I purchase has a serious chance of being arbitrarily stolen from me at a later date without warning I will be going without.

												Although the game squarely qualifies as old now, I couldn't resist buying it given how much I played it years ago, and how powerful the memories of it.The story offers a simple and straightforward red thread to follow for completion, but leaves so much room for exploration, choices and personal characterization (or lack thereof) that it actually allows many replays without getting boring.The minigames are of course a bit repetitive, but that's not something that ever bothers me, especially since they're based on rhythm and reactivity. Only the slow sailing across the map got annoying after a while, and that's a feature; you're NOT supposed to cross over the whole ocean without pause or action.Basically, this game is a blast for any player who likes writing their own story.One day, I'll publish the epic chronicles of the dreaded legendary pirate who attacked and took over the whole Spanish Armada with his lone but glorious war canoe Croustibat! :D			"

I am sure though that it is more and issue with me in 2016 than the game itself.There aren't many pirate games out there to compare with but so if swashbuckling is your thing, this is probably the one you need.Njoy!

												The game in its core is a collection of mini-games that all work towards a common goal and make it more than the sum of its parts. Lots of activities in the game, from sea battles, trading, ""massive"" town sieges, finding buried treasure and all the other pirate stuff you expect to do in a game with the name ""Pirates!"".There is something here for everyone I would say and you should really have it in your library. It is easy to jump in and out of and won't take a lots of time to enjoy it. The only thing I don't like about this game is that the movement and action keys are bound to the numpad, but with that said it does not take away from the game that much and you get used to it pretty quick. Overall, it is one of the best pirate themed games ever and it is dirt cheap, especially if on sale.			"

												The graphics are dated and cartoony, the gameplay is simple, and yet it's the funnest Pirate based game I've ever played. If you tried playing Pirates of the Burning Sea, this is very similar, but lacking the MMO economy driven enviroment that that game had. Overall, if you have been on the fence about this game, wait for it to go on sale during a holiday or random weekend event and pick it up. It's certainly a decent time waster.			"

												As someone who has a deep appreciation for retro games, I found Sid Meier's Pirates! very entertaining. Its charm lies in its simplicity. Dueling, sacking cities, completing quests; every thing in this game is simple and easy to learn. This game was my very first pirate-themed game, and I cannot reccomend it enough to those who love pirates or are even just looking for a classic, fun game.			"

												Really nice game! I started with a sloop with 8-10 cannons and few upgrades, but eventually stole a ""New Warship"" from the Spanish with cool upgrades like cotton sails and bronze cannons. The ship had 32 cannons. I took a Spanish city, gave it to the French, and got a 13500 bounty on myself from the Spanish. I highly recomend this game, especially if you like to make everybody hate you (The French are the only ones who like me).			"

												The game in its core is a collection of mini-games that all work towards a common goal and make it more than the sum of its parts. Lots of activities in the game, from sea battles, trading, ""massive"" town sieges, finding buried treasure and all the other pirate stuff you expect to do in a game with the name ""Pirates!"".There is something here for everyone I would say and you should really have it in your library. It is easy to jump in and out of and won't take a lots of time to enjoy it. The only thing I don't like about this game is that the movement and action keys are bound to the numpad, but with that said it does not take away from the game that much and you get used to it pretty quick. Overall, it is one of the best pirate themed games ever and it is dirt cheap, especially if on sale.			"

												Graphics: 5/10Sound: 4/10Mechanic: 5/10Story: 4/10Action: 8/10Originality: 6/10Lasting Fun: 4/10and all considering that this is a game from a totally different age of computer games.Quite a good and funny game but definitely not what you expect from a modern game any longer. The game was released in 1987 and kinda overhauled and re-released sometimes around 2004. Considering the age of even the later version graphics and game look pretty good. I bought it for about 4 bucks which is an ok price, but I would never have paid 10+ for it. This game is not a simulation, it's more an arcarde style action game where you sail around, sink ships of several factions or pirates, do some politics and a little trading and can go for treasure hunting as well. actually the game has all a good pirate game needs. Yet, the action becomes stale pretty fast. Trading is kind of tedious as it requires you to have large ships and go long distances. Sailing long distances is punished in the game as your crew is going to desert you faster than you can replace them. In the later game this seems to get much better, but getting there is not funny at all. You can use your small starting loop to easily take a full blown war galley as prize. But you will not have the men to maintain it for long, even if you have loads of gold. The game is pretty open to your actions, there is no fix chain of quests you have to follow, although there are very helpful quests. The information in the game and the presentation of your ships is bad. You do get zero info about the capacities of your ships (you can carry 60 guns in small ships, but you don't see easily how many guns get fired and how many are just cargo). There is no full size view of your ship in the menues (I wish I could have seen it in full size and rotating), no fluff info (ship type, tonnage, sails, guns, etc). Hunting pirates was a laugh, I brought down No. 1 from the list within my very first 15 minutes if gameplay. Orientation is hard sometimes when leaving harbour, the compass is pretty simple and yous camera view very narrow. Although many seem to have enjoyed the cartoonist fun style of the game I missed the feeling of grim and dangerous piracy. It feels a bit like playing pirate in your bath tub. Good for a moment but nothing that makes me remember it or want to proceed further. Nice but yesterday.			"

												Great game. I've played this late into the night only to wonder why it is suddenly becoming light outside, and why the birds are chirping... Surprise! It isn't night anymore, and I'm supposed to ""get up"" for work in two hours.Certain parts of the game (i.e. dancing) I've never been very good at, but you can pick up some good equipment from the ladies. There are some patches available that allow you to cheat these parts. Just use then at the risk of making the game far too easy.Ship combat is simple but enjoyable. The backstory of trying to rescue your family adds a reason to sailing around and pirating for years.Overall a great game, and it is still fun to play years later. Give it a try!			"

												This game is a fun RPG experience with lots of depth to it, the main quest is fun but can get a bit repetitve, the minigames are fun and require practice. I like this game. Overall 6/10			"

												Really nice game! I started with a sloop with 8-10 cannons and few upgrades, but eventually stole a ""New Warship"" from the Spanish with cool upgrades like cotton sails and bronze cannons. The ship had 32 cannons. I took a Spanish city, gave it to the French, and got a 13500 bounty on myself from the Spanish. I highly recomend this game, especially if you like to make everybody hate you (The French are the only ones who like me).			"

												ok so this game is just straight good it reminds me of mount and blade warband but anyway so you play as  a man who's family is btraryed by a evil villan or antaginist and must find and rescue them from him but in order to do that you must go to the new world by signing up with 1 of four factions the brits the smelly french the ducth or the spaish ech with its own ships and ports so when you are on a boat to the new world you mutiny with the rest of the crew and from there you are free to do whatever you want become a trader or a pirate or my favoutie climb the ladder of milatary service to one of the faction while seducing the dughters of govenors for information and l o v e but there is another way that is the harrdest becomeing a pirate and climbing the ladder of notoriousness to the top fighting blakbeard along the way. but this is getting too long but just buy it for the B 0 0 T Y			"

												I love this game and all about it. The artstyle and gameplay, just the feeling of this game. But there's just to many glitches.. I have played this game a lot lately and noticed that its really easy to get stuck on the islands. Like when i got caught and sendt to prision, i broke out and spawned stuck on the beach/island next to the San Juan port. And one time i docked in a pirate haven, i got stuck in the little peninsula where the haven was located. I have encountered a lot of this small glitches that really bugs me out. Can you guys plis fix this for us all? I think many of us would be happy if you did. Alltho there's a lot of bugs who needs fixing, i really enjoi it and i give it a thunbs up!			"

												Old Classic yet fulfilling. Getting myself a Large Frigate from Henry Morgan and upgrade it, the best ship in the game for me. Fast, 40 guns, manageable with 110 crews.... Until I found about Ship of the Line. Wasted years raiding English port to spawn it.Game is great, got myself a French wife and retires as Magistrate. But you never get enough.It's time to be a pirate again!			"

												I played this game off steam for hours and hours over a period of several years.Old as hell but still the best pirates themed game ever made.Sid Meier can really craft a word to immerse you into. Fight other pirates, raide collonial ships, capture wanted criminals for prize money, find lost relatives, dig up burried treasure, charm governors daughters, engage in swordfights..... Pirate's work is never done.			"

												I absolutely love this game, but take it with a grain of salt because I love every pirate game ever made. The main story was fairly engaging, the trading system is surprisingly fun, and the scripted fights are usually fun and visually cool (you can throw a guy out a window!). That said, on the higher difficulties ship battles, dances, and fights can become a huge trial to get through. A ton of aspects in the game rely on a sort of quicktime click x to do the right thing mechanic that is sometimes cool because it’s so simple but can get rather boring and frustrating after a while. If you’re interested in playing a pirate and exploring the world, then give this one a try. 8/10 best pirate game I’ve seen in a long time.			"

												For an aging game it is still a very playable game, the game runs with no crashing on Windows 10.  The resolution is a bit low but still looks ok. The game play can be a bit same old but it can throw up a challenge every now and then to keep your interest.   The only two gripes I personally have is when in battle and your on the left of the enemy they can escape easily, you seem to not be able to go right as the wind stops you dead, annoying  but you can get around it by making sure your on the righthand side of the enemy before going in to battle.  The other bit I dont like is the dancing sequence to please the lady, boring and not enjoyable so I tend to not bother! however it is funny to make yourself fall around all over the place if you do it wrong on purpose but even then, once doing that is enough for one giggle.  If this game is on sale, this is a bargain and a must buy if your into pirate games as it is a good few hours of fun, however if at full price, I would not have bought this game, I'd definetly wait until it is on offer on steam.
