												Banned from the forum after criticizing the update that added mana to the game and deleted the inventory.No explanation of the ban on reason.Patiently helped many open doors for the multiplayer game could flow .Simply sorry to have made ​​the purchase .Negative reviews result in a ban. Other players go through the same.			"

												This game used to be fun before the mana system and item wipe, it is no longer good.Most classes have been rendered useless and higher level characters are struggling to get items to even cast skills, (my 108 redneck has ~400 max mana and 3 of his 4 skills cost over 500)The game now constanly crashes if someone leaves the party leaving any items you found in that session gone.

												If you are considering buying this game, even on sale: DON'T!Long story short: devs are incompetent and painfully amateur.I had high hopes for this game, played it a lot, bought copies for friends, posted in the forums, the whole nine yards.But patch after patch was ridiculous, drastic, buggy, game changing updates from the devs along with constant item wipes. They have no concept of game design and no idea what they want. They are also vindicative and immature when they delete negative forum threads and insult their user base.This game should STILL be early access, 2 years after release. Crying shame that it's considered ""finished"". Oh well, I guess I expected too much. At least I know to avoid these devs and Panic Art Studios.EDIT: Haha the developer response, I just can't stop laughing. Hero Siege still needs to be early access, just look at the patch notes to see what I mean. Seriously take a read, or check the forums, the perpetual churn is STILL happening.A ""final product on Steam"" doesn't drastically change core mechanics and systems 2 years after release (just figure out mana, attack speed, item progression, HUD style, levelling, and waves, etc. already). Also excellent strategy to blame the community, I'm happy to see you guys are still unprofessional, immature, and rude.Nice try Panic Art Studios, but your game is still junk and this review is still 100% accurate.

												First of I recommend to read this review. I'm not that good in English. That dude just said what I wanted. And after that, read my review. http://steamcommunity.com/id/synnth/recommended/269210/I played this game for the first time and it was AWESOME. I've updated it and...they've ruined everything they've made before. This mana system, this inventory thing....sadly I have 10 hours played...no refunds for me. But you, mate, you...move along...don't buy it.UPDDevelopers are saying that they are a small team and by bad reviews we are ruining their motivation. And we must stop pushing them...they working hard.HELL with your motivation! I know about 10 developers(fast guess...there is alot more of those) who are working all alone and developing\developed masterpieces. Go look at Unepic game made by one person....for example. It is awesome!Pathetic.Banned me? For complaining? You'll regret that.UPDFrom the last chat conversation I understood next(thing it not in the money):We will sell you BMW for 100 000 EURO and after will replace it with FORD for 5 000 EURO without any refund. You will like it! Devs guaranteed! You just need to get used to it)UPDNow I am permanently banned from multyplayer because of truth. Nice move,  devs) bunch of spoiled kids)UPDSome explanation about how did things gone so bad in my case:Game updated and I saw these things that made me madI've written on community something like ""what the hell? I've bought this game and it is illegal to change things after release so dramatically!"". After some arguing with devs, they've let me know they do not care about reviews that come after the release and that I have to go and ask for refund. They DID know that it is impossible and Valve do not give rerund after 2 hours ingame. I've promised they'll pay me with their reputation. After some insults from devs I was banned in the community and in the multiplayer game. I am developer myself and no matter how rude people can be sometimes I am not letting myself to behave even close to that.I've made some steps to stain their rep. It was nothing, but given me some good things)One of many usual answers from the dev:""VeXoRiAnNNNnn [Developer]False arguments:- ""Boohoo no more fast attack speed""- ""boohoo lost my items""- ""boohoo mana system is broken i cant cast spells cus manacost too high""and other stuff like this."" And""Go get refund. We don't care."" After you've played over(much over) 2 hours.Wanna have some fun? - buy that one instead - It has DEMO, in which you can try CO-OP and other things.No port forwardingNo childish developers, who does not know what is COMMUNITY MANAGEMENTFun CO-OP. When HERO SIEGE was f***ed up, I was looking for something to replace it. And found it.PSHah, look at the Void! He've got VAC ban. Tells me alot about ""developer"" void.			"

												TL;DR : That game is entertaining but appart from some imbalance and annoying random deaths, what I strongly dislike about that game is that when you buy, you only get 75% of the game. That being said, the game also deserve his positives reviews.The Game is designed to be played with the DLCs, so basicly it's not additionnal content, it's the rest of the game developers are offering you to buy. I have no problem with that kind of merchandising if the game is free to play but it is not.If you only buy the incomplete game, you can't have the best loot (unless you play enough to get 5000 rare crytals and beat a very strong boss with your low level stuff, after almost 50 hours and if I kept all my crytals I still don't half the crytals required to fight him) AND you can't play in multiplayer.Even when you check the achievements you'll see some you can only get if you own the DLCs, if I had seen this in the review instead of positive ones, if would not have bought this game.

This game is like girl - you loved it, you hailed it, but then SUDDENLY those days happenedIt was cool. Rlly. It was like Isaac meets diablo with ability to make it bullet hell (you can summon all waves of enemies at once). Then devs added online multiplayer.""What happens?"" - you can ask. Devs f*cked community.Actually it feels like they dont know what to do and how to do it:- Multiplayer didnt work for half year and right now its almost empty, cuz all, who wanted to play it online, dropped it. - Rogue-lite part with permadeath moved to optional hardcore mode, pseudo-randomly generation still broken (monsters and minions spawns outside of map). Also there is no more challenge, cuz they unlocked every difficult and zone since start. Isaac fans dropped it.- Bullet-hell part killed by adding unbalanced MP. Rlly - one skill uses 60%+ of your mana - its annoying.So... who still plays it? 2.5 fans of cheap 2D diablo clones?It was fun. But devs forgot, its not early access and not free game. Every thread on forum, where community tries to criticism, closes so fast by moderators, authors of them get permabans like I did. Sad.R.I.P Hero Siege. 29.01.2014 - 27.10.2015			"

												The developers of this game should hire a proper PR team, as well as a community liaison. Not only do they refuse to listen to ideas that would improve them game for everyone, but they dismiss anyone with even the most courteous of criticisms. Be wary of speaking out against them if you wish to continue to have access to the online portions of the game.Remember, when you buy a game, you are not only paying for the experience, you are supporting the developers and their practices. Even for .89 USD, I would recommend you spend your money elsewhere.P.S. Even if you do ignore this and buy the game anyways, the other reviewers are right when they say the base game is nowhere near the full experience. If you thought recent AAA games were incomplete at launch and only cash grabs for DLC and season passes, this game and it's developers present to you more of the same.			"

I've written a review which is too long, therefore I'm posting only the most relevant part. For full review, please see comments below. Thanks.TL;DR - game is released as ""complete"" with 4 DLCs while still being unplayable beyond single playerUPDATE 21 January 2016: now with hilarious developer comments belowUPDATE 3 March 2016: this about sums up what the dev says about ""vocal minority"" of not satisfied players http://steamcommunity.com/id/gomical/recommended/269210/Multi playerOK, so this is the part that, after many hours in-game and countless patches released by developers, made me write this review.Long story short: I bought the game mid-June 2015, noticing a fun indie title with overwhelmingly positive (back then) reviews. Well, ♥♥♥♥ me, I bought a 4-pack to play with friends, bought the DLCs, told friends to buy DLCs (or bought them myself then gifted) so we can play the whole thing together, that sort of thing - you know the drill. Tried playing - nope, had to portforward, as peer-to-peer wasn't available back then. OK, no big deal, added one rule to firewall and all is good. Tried again - massive synchronisation problems, invisible monsters, traps working out of sync from the server. Game was basically unplayable, because it seemed like each player was seeing different game. So the game was shelved, hoping that errors will be patched, network protocol will be fixed and so on.Fast-forward to 2016: things are unbelievably and utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't think I've ever seen more horribly broken piece of network software than Hero Siege and believe me, I've seen some seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up brain-damaged♥♥♥♥♥♥working as a professional and fairly low-level programmer and hobbyist gamedev. Out of morbid curiosity, I would like to peer into this abyss of shoddy sourcecode, knowingly that there could be an unspeakable, lovecraftian horror lurking inside, waiting for another soul to consume.Think about everything that can go wrong with synchronising the state of two game clients (or rather: client and server) in a game like this and it will go wrong, plus a lot more. Everything listed below (and more...) was observed while playing on LAN with wired Ethernet connection. No other active machines on network but a server and single client. There can be hardly an environment closer to perfection in multiplayer gaming, and still developers are bullcrapping people that the cause lies in lags and packet loss - see their posting from 8 Jan 2016. Monsters appearing out of nowhere and ♥♥♥♥ing you up? Check. Invisible ranged attacks (arrows, acid) from monsters ♥♥♥♥ing you up? You bet, check. Seeing traps in one place or state, while on the server they're somewhere else or in another state, therefore impaling you, smashing you around or otherwise ♥♥♥♥ing you up? Double ♥♥♥♥ing check. Seeing monsters in one place and attacking them, and seeing hits registering while in actuality they're somewhere else entirely and ♥♥♥♥ing you or someone else up? Oh my ♥♥♥♥ing Gaben...check! Not seeing special monster perks like ""punisher"" (spiky balls orbiting around monster, making melee attacks dangerous and usually fatal for the attacker) while you try to melee the undying♥♥♥♥♥♥out of that skeleton, unknowingly ♥♥♥♥ing yourself up? Kamikaze says: check. Not seeing pools of acid (map-based, not monster-attack-based) and similar stuff so that maneuvering in frantic combat can ♥♥♥♥ you up out of the blue? Yep, check. Standing in place while the other game instance (server) sees you as shuffling a bit around, therefore potentially making you get hit with attack, that would otherwise not connect? Less dangerous, but still - check. Remember that server is the authority (for now, read below...) on deciding which attack connects and which does not. Broken quests, where quest items don't spawn and quests are therefore unsolvable, but game registers them as done and you can get your reward instantly? Hm, this is actually rewarding and not punishing, but still a bug, so check please. Seeing entirely different map from the server? You think I'm joking, right? That I'm smoking some unhealthy♥♥♥♥♥♥and seeing weird things. Tell you what - triple-down XXL mother♥♥♥♥ing check with side order of fries. This was most easily reproduced in fight with V Act boss (Karp of Doom DLC).All of this was observed while playing side by side, so that I could compare in what state the server sees the world to what is displayed on the client by looking directly on neighboring computer screen.What's really fun is that some of these problems are directly caused by game engine sucking big time on efficiency front and that networking is seemingly tied to the graphics engine, doing stuff like positions recalculations with each frame redraw. When FPS on server starts dropping for some reason (many monsters and items on the screen) while on the client FPS stays high,♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan in the most spectacular fashion. Rule number two: you don't tie calculations of your world to how fast can you redraw this world on screen.And don't get me started on playing on properly powerful machine. I comfortably played Diablo 2 (which looks better than Hero Siege BTW) on PentiumII 333 MHz. ♥♥♥♥ing hell, even on 6-core 3.2 GHz CPU this game can noticeably lag while opening chests (when many coins are being spawned on screen) or starting another wave of monsters! We have GPUs for a reason, and that reason is not ""standing idly while CPU works its♥♥♥♥♥off on graphics processing"".What's even more disconcerting is the current idea of dealing with the problems of desynchronisation. In news posting from 8 Jan 2016, developers stated that they want to move the responsibility of checking whether client was hit by a trap or a monster to the client itself.Seriously. Let that thought sink in for a while.Rule number one: you do not trust the input from the client.Rule number zero: you DO NOT trust the input FROM THE CLIENT.Or else you'll be having immortal players all around, faster than you'll be able to say ""you are free to cheat as you like and we won't even bother checking♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.To add insult to injury, developers are incompetent on the security front. They got hacked (cracked), not once but twice and it resulted in mass banning of players by the crackers. I do not condone cracking, though it made me think about security practices applied in Panic Art Studios and whether they, for example, store players' passwords in plaintext. Though seeing how they want to fix problems with their networking by blindly believing input from clients, maybe I shouldn't be surprised.Oh, did I mention that sometimes you'll spawn in town as another character class? E.g. you play a Pyromancer and someone else is Viking. Then sometimes when moving to town you'll become a Viking. Luckily this is only temporary but still it boggles the mind on how deep is the rabbit hole.			"

 Hero Siege	Hero Siege is a fun bullet hell game that issimilar to the Binding of Issac and has that nice rpg feel. Graphics	As you can guess this game is pixelated like the olden times of games. Gameplay	The gameplay for hero siege is massively enjoyable as a fun yet difficult twin stick shooter with a lot to offer. When you start off you will not have much at all but as you play the game you will recieve relics, equipment, and even potions, each adding to your abilities. The game has 7 base classes each with its own skill tree to discover and enjoy. Singleplayer	 So far I have only had the chance to enjoy singleplayer and the necromancer class (so this review will focus on the necromancer class). The necromancer starts off with a skill tree where you can pick to have dead hands rise from the grave around you dealing damage or having the ability to summon 3 undead maruaders to your aid. As you level up you gain new points to invest in your skills with new tiers unlocking occassionally. The maps are somewhat randomly generated and contain traps that can damage both you and you enemies. Once you beat a certain # of enemies a boss will spawn. Sometimes the boss will be easy while others are much more difficult. Once you beat a boss a portal will open to continue to the next area and the boss will sometimes leave treasure chests and a relic for you to collect. Relics/Chests	 ok so there are 3 types of chest you can find throughout the game. Wood Chest	- as you can expect not that great loot but sometimes will drop a key Gold Chest	- to open this chest you require a key and it wil usually have pretty decent items to find Crystal Chest	-contains great loot and items to collect and require a crystal key to openOk now back to relics.Relics are items you find in your game that can greatly help you. You gain relics after defeating a boss, buying from a shopkeeper or looting from a crypt/dungeon. There is an immense amount of relics that aid you throughout your journey from a hat that shoots out the symbol π at enemies to a fly swatter that does nothing but spawn a prop fly. There is an immense amount of relics so i recomment you check the wiki or the guide here on steam. Rating	 Pros	+ 7 classes with good possibilites+ smooth gameplay with nice controls+ i can summon the dead+ pixelated and has nice rpg feel+ equipment is useful+ relics soooo many fun relics Cons	- lagged immensly whenever i got an achievemt- dlc a bit pricey Final Thoughts	Hero siege is an amazing game with alot to offer. It has been a while since i have been able to enjoy a game like this. If you love the old pixelated rpg styles and love the binding of issac or bullet hell type games give Hero Siege a shot. Final Rating 9/10	 "

												I bought this game because the video on the main store page says online multiplayer. I start to play and there is no online multiplayer. You currently have to pay for a DLC in order to get features that are advertised on the games main store page. I expect that when I purchase two copies of the game, one for me and one for my wife, that I’m simply going to be able to start the game and play multi player like they are all over the store video. As a matter of fact online multiplayer is mentioned at least twice in the video. So I am not recommending the game because it does not come with the features that are advertised at the time of advertisement.Note: Since the original posting of this review the video that advertised features the game does not poses has been removed from the store page. So currently the review really just serves as a warning that the developers have misrepresented information in the past so you should make sure to do proper research before making a purchasing decision based on what is posted on the store page. And if you really want to have some fun read the comments but start at the bottom and read up so you get the oldest first.In response to a comment about their bad customer service practices one of the developers had this to say“Also we are not a company, we are just guys making games. there is absolutely no business or marketing in our setting. We just made the game, put it on steam and haven't done anything else about it.”So you might want to keep that in mind as well.			"

Hero Siege is like Diablo stripped to its core, with some The Binding of Isaac-like rogue elements added as spices. It's a top-down action hack 'n slash with 16-bit graphics, to be played as one of seven distinct characters, each with their own abilities and skills. During one's walk around the arena, there's gold and (some) loot to be picked up, there are (many) monsters to be slain, and every six levels, a boss (some amazingly easy, some excruciatingly difficult) awaits you. Levels and enemies are random-generated from a relatively large numer of possibilities, which guarentees a lot of differentiation. There are - very Diablo-like.. - several chapters, each chapter having 30 (!!) levels. So far, so good: the idea is sound, the graphics are fun although a bit blurred, and the gameplay - if using an Xbox 360-like controller - is as fluid as one could hope for.But Hero Siege also has its share of problems. The ""rpg-light""-like leveling system, with stats- and skill-points to be distributed as one levels up, is way too unbalanced. Stats go only up by fractions of percentages, making it fairly useless to upgrade them, except maybe from level 50 or so on. Action skills are sometimes VERY powerful after a time, which will be necessary - but some are really over-the-top. Opposed to this, the amount of damage one can get while playing, is completely unpredictable. This is by itself a good thing, but some bullet-firing skulls deal such an amount of damage, that during the first six levels at least, you can die in an instant without even knowing what hit you. The graphics tend to hide these skulls sometimes, and that makes it really frustrating. It's not funny to get killed out-of-the-blue without even having a hint of what hit you. Though I have to admit, once at a certain level (certainly from 31 upwards), these devils can be survived better. Power-ups, dropped by the bosses, are really essential to survive for a longer time - but since they drop randomly as well, some games are fun because of the great assets they give, others are really disappointing since you didn't get anything worthwhile for a long time.The good thing is that the developers are still finetuning things, and taking comments from the community into consideration, as far as I can see. That's why I give this game a thumbs-up, even if I've cried out sometimes in frustration when my poor newly-made marksman got out of the blue hit once more by a deadly bullet. What should really be implemented is a better save system: relics (power-ups) tend to get lost once I quit the game, and saving is actually only possible every act (30 levels).This game has potential, is strangely addictive (although the 152 (!!!) Steam achievements seem like impossible to get), but still has serious flaws. Luckily, the developers are still finetuning and working on it.UPDATE (08/15)Being curious about how the game looks and plays now, almost I year later, I started it up again, to find out some things have been improved indeed. The levelling system seems much more balanced now, there are new chapters & classes and the overall feel is more polished. However, once in-game I quickly stumbled upon the ""old problems"": some enemies/bullets can still kill you instantly, and since you can't always see them coming through the mayhem this really is bothering. Overall though, I find the game to have improved significantly over the past year.The large amount of achievements has been turned down a notch or two, so that it's easier to get a reasonable number of achievements overall.Conclusion: recommended, but not for the casual gamer looking for some easy fun "

												Hmm, interesting alpha. Might be promising when it comes out of Early Access.It's not in Early Access?Oh.Alright.-Almost all the text in the game needs proofread. I know this isn't really much of a point because English isn't everyone's native language, but getting someone whose primary language IS English to look at the game once and say ""Yeah that's alright I guess."" is not nearly as hard as learning an entire language.-Unstable FPS. Huge FPS drops. I'm running a rig that plays most modern games at 60 FPS on max graphics.-Mouse doesn't work on some menus. For no reason.-""Beautiful sprite art"" means 5 or so average looking models for enemies which aren't even palette swapped.-Balance is an alien, nebulous concept in this game. Grinding for an hour to make your character capable of doing anything is REQUIRED.-Classes are flat and uninteresting, often with abilities that are blatantly not worth putting points in. There's an objectively optimal path for every class to skill in, so every class ends up as a copypaste. It takes an hour literally to obtain your second ability.-Character control is clunky at best. Your character feels like they are moving through glue and diarrhea.-Picking up an item does not add it to your inventory or pause the game. It vomits a comparison window over your screen, under which enemies are still murdering your♥♥♥♥♥ while you look at the vendor trash that has dropped because it still provides this nonsense for items which it highlights in red as WORSE than your current stats, yet it still asks you if you want to PERMANENTLY DISCARD YOUR CURRENT ITEM IN EXCHANGE FOR IT.-Temporary buffs that last for that life are a nice idea, except that they spiral wildly out of control after a point where you are now indestructable and kill enemies in a single shot. Losing ALL of your items on death is a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Losing ALL of your MONEY, KEYS AND ITEMS is past ""Roguelike elements"" and into Roguelite territory.-None of the stats tell you what they do. OR EVEN WHAT THEY'RE CALLED. Yes, you can figure most of it out with a little experimentation, or familiarity with the genre really. That's still not an excuse for failing to educate the player. -There are altars that upon interacting, can give you permanent upgrades to stats. Or downgrades. The first of which I found gave me nothing. The second gave nothing. The third gave me +20 Toughness (or whatever it is in this), which grotesquely overbalanced the game because the timing of which I got it made me able to instakill everything, including bosses. The next gave -40 Agility. MINUS 40. Every level up gives TWO attribute points, meaning I just lost TWENTY LEVELS' WORTH OF STATS. AT LEVEL 12. Permanently. Why not just have a background RNG that deletes your character on a 1:1000 chance every minute?-Please stop wholesale ripping off Diablo's font. It was cute the first few games, it stopped being so once we reached double figures.-NPCs in town that have ""TALK TO ME"" style blips on their head, yet have no interactions.-The Options menu has no Options. Well, that's not true, your options are ""Want at the very least resolution configuration but accept it isn't there"", or ""eat♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. -The volume slider can be DRAGGED OFF THE SLIDER BAR. This doesn't sound like a big issue except that trying to turn the game's godforsaken audio down causes it to jump off the bar and hover over the other buttons in the menu, which take priority over it rendering it stuck at what feels like 200% volume.-Restart button gives NO CONFIRMATION, especially considering it's the exact same as dying sans the ""KILLED BY *disjointed sprite*"" screen.-Text is blurry and hard to read.-You get the ONLY TUTORIAL MESSAGE in the game EVERY TIME YOU START AN ACT. Which doesn't even cover all the controls.-It seems to have some kind of premium currency crystals which they forgot to add the Pay to Win aspect because there's not an option to buy them, yet they behave exactly like say Gems in Clash of Clans.-Entering a bonus dungeon RESETS YOUR PROGRESS ON THAT LEVEL. WHY.-Why do you explode like you die every time you go through a doorway/portal?-Crates and pots bleed.-The random map generation can sometimes, and by sometimes I mean quite regularly, spawn enemies outside the map. You have to kill them to progress. Go figure. Trying to leave the map via the gates the enemies walk in through teleports you to the spawn instead.-I SEE ITEMS BLATANTLY STOLEN FROM BINDING OF ISAAC.-One voiceover for all characters. With really crappy effects.-Ambiance effects should not run at different framerates from each other and the main entites. It looks awful.-Hitboxes for enemies seem to sometimes run on bullet hell rules where they only count as hits if it touches their source pixel.-Pirate's shots are so staggered that firing at an enemy results in every second shot passing them because the Pirate can't aim.This game feels like another one of those games that needed a sane person sitting on the chair beside the developer, overseeing the game's creation, so that they could slap the dev every time they suggested something like ""wut if we made the abilitys asplod so big dat u canit c anythin ye"". The fact that it's attempting to sell extra characters as DLC is actually repulsive. Please finish your game before you sell it. PLEASE PLEASE finish your game before you make DLC. "

												Brutally difficult dual-stick shooting done addictively right!Two things first: 1) This is a singleplayer review. If you're curious about multiplayer, read another review.2) I didn't really care for Binding of Isaac, was moderately engaged by Hammerwatch, but mostly don't dabble in dual-stick shooters. What attracts me to this game is how it demands players to strive to a high level of skill while still maintaining the unforgiving difficulty that characterizes classic roguelikes. You're gonna die a lot and it's gonna suck, but the juice is worth the squeeze.3) If you're ♥♥♥♥♥ing about not being able to shoot diagonally, I recommend you play a SNES game or two and suck it up, big boy.PROS- Wide variety of monsters and bosses, with nice touches of randomized customizations- Surprisingly large selection of fully developed character classes- One metric @#$%-ton of chievies (yeah, c'mon, nobody's going to play 150 hours)- Sweet procedurally generated level designs with a delicious crunchy pixel-art style- Loads of relics, potions, and blessings, with a well-integrated dungeon shopCONS / Devs, please take note:- Bosses are pretty uneven. Sometimes you'll get hulking brutes you can easily down, sometimes you'll get one-shotted instantly. Would be nice if they were a bit easier, but maybe it gets a bit more reasonable after leveling up a bit.- PLEASE PUT IN A MINIMAP. I absolutely @#$%ing hate being chased around the map by the last monster of a wave just because I want to find that statue or dungeon that spawned. It's not a huge fix, won't break the game, and trust me, a lot of people will really appreciate it.~~ Note for Roguelike Aficionados ~~Stats and skills carry over after death (except temporary boosts, of which there are many varieties). I know what you're thinking, ""Son, I am disappoint! I raised you to be a godlike 1337 rogue hardcore permadeath maximum difficulty pro, not some respawning filthy casul!"" That's what I thought too, at first. Then after my 50th death without even getting to the second stage (and with a fair bit of skill, mind you!), I realized that I needed those XP levels to just... stick with me. You can probably guess that it does turn into a bit of a grind at that point, but that's where the game's charm kicks in.Each character class has 4 unique abilities to learn and over twice as many passive skills. I tried the Viking and the Pirate, but ended up playing as a Pyromancer who I named ""Solitary Eye"". There is something distinctly gratifying about kiting around a bunch of high level monsters who could kill you in 3 or 4 hits and then igniting the ground around you in an enormous inferno while you spray jets of fire from your fingers at the largest beasts and summon meteors to crash down all around from the heavens... and they all die at once. You get XP, wade around in some blood, maybe grab a health orb if you're lucky (you won't need 'em though, you dangerous kiting expert, you), and pray for some of the more powerful basterds to drop keys.Keys: keys are what you want. But be warned, having a bunch of keys and then finding no loot caves or chests to open, then getting merked by a stray lightning bolt you weren't paying attention to... that's gonna tick you off. A lot. Especially when you find 3 chests in your next play through and no keys. The loot dungeons, puzzle (and insanely dangerous) dungeons, and crypts filled with coins or crazy bosses... mayne, they're just really sexily implemented.If you DO play the game in hardcore mode, you're probably Steven Hawking. Get a life.~~ Opinionated Stance ~~I waited until this game was on sale to buy it because I am below the poverty line. If I were more financially privileged, I would buy this at full price with no hesitation. I don't know much about the devs other than that this is a port that used to be based on a cash shop, but if they manage to smooth out the remnants of cash shop grind features, I would happily buy the DLC as well.8.5 / 10for fans of - Hammerwatch- frustrating roguelikes- dual-stick fantasyA+ would fight giant rat with speech impediment again			"

												I've played this game in ANDROID, and now in the PC just got better!This game is very addictive and hard.You choose a character and must defeat waves of monsters, after a few waves of creatures you face bosses!Each character has its advantages and disadvantages, as well as their own weapons / spells.It has a good amount of different monsters to confront, and collect money to buy potions and stuff. And of course also has the relics that can give you an optimal help in your battle. This game is very simple, but very fun.  "

												Game WAS good actually when I started to play it BUT with updates (especially 27th oct. one) it's just another Diablo II clone with LOTS of bugs. Still gotta say, devs are working on the game and updating periodically. MAYBE in the future they manage to lessen number of bugs and make this different than D2.Edit after giving another shot: Your HP is like a binary value(0 or 1). Either you are at full hp or die in instant. %99 of the times you kill enemies with ease but then one weird trap comes out of nowhere and boom, you are dead. I've finished Isaac with Lost so I know how to dodge a bullet or two but this game is just ridiculous.			"

												After almost 100 hours of time in this game, and even purchasing it BEFORE the DLC even came out, I must say, I can't recommend it. Unfortunately the reason I can't recommend this game at least anymore is because of the updates they keep pushing. The good:Fun game full of different ways of playingGood amount of playability and replayabilityUpdates still being madeContent still being addedMany classes with their own unique builds and skillsEdit: Great devs who do respond to feedback in a positive and kind manorThe bad:While still being updated, more often than not the updates are worsening the gameClasses unlocked by purchasing DLCVery slow gameplay in the beginningBUGS. Lots and lots of bugs.As far as bugs go, one major part of this game is to have Wormholes (dungeons available by purchasing a key with in-game gold) useable, unfortunately a bug that has yet to be fixed that a few people have (including myself) is that players cannot use our wormhole keys. Relics are limited now, stats nerfed, classes buffed, then nerfed, then buffed, item stats nerfed, etc. I cannot recommend it until balance issues have been resolved to the point where there's not constant change. Edit: reworded last section, removed a certain section.			"

												Having played over 100 hours in this game, I feel that I can give an adequate review.The game is addictive and fun up to a certain point.  Then, like all the other reviewers with negative reviews have said, the game mechanics break due to incredibly large numbers of things (your health, your damage, monster count, and massive amounts of everything flying across the screen).The game definitely has glitches that will make you table flip and rage quit.  I left because I managed to score a winning combo of relics (homing attacks, vampirism, and money increases damage).  But then the game crashed and I lost it all.  For those of you who have played D3, imagine getting your character with his entire build all set up with the best build, then Blizzard not fixing a crash that takes it all away and you have to do it again.  How long will you play that game?The dev's need to fix these game breaking bugs before continuing to release DLC to milk money from their customers (like me and all the negative reviewers).  Now that you know, feel free to buy on sale and blow hours and hours on it.  Just realize that at some point, you will hit that frustration wall and just...stop.			"

												This game has potential, yes. And initially, I really liked it.So it is quite sad to see that so much potential is simply wasted by such a sloppy bug and change management. Taking into account that the developer team is quite small I can live with some minor bugs.What I cannot accept, however, is the amount of serious, unnerving bugs which occur although the game has been released in January 2014. There seems to be no ""stable branch"" and ""nightly branch"" support for this game like e.g. Starbound offers. Vexorian says (quote):""We have sat down to read the most ""helpful"" reviews which are mostly negative since there have been problems in the game. We really worked hard and took action to fix all those, and have managed to iron them out! ""Some bugs I found in yesterday's build :- coins have the same value (1 Gold) - characters in multiplayer get mixed up- game terminates to main screen without explanation- there are numerous issues regarding synchronization of multiplayer games (e.g. in crypts when solving the puzzles with movable pillars, when entering dungeons, etc.).- mutliplayer has been taken offline due to bug fixing / testing todaySo, IMHO the problems have not been ironed out at all. I wonder why such a patch is even released where it certainly could not have been tested throughly. I cannot shake the feeling that paying customers are treated as pre-alpha testers.It is really sad, because many good ideas have found their way into this game already.Sorry, but all things considered I have to give this a ""thumbs down"".Maybe my opinion will change when the game has finally become more stable.

												I expected a different game when I first started playing Hero Siege. Here I was thinking it was an action RPG, you know, with quests and loot, but I guess it was the name that fooled me. Hero Siege is actually a fun, difficult but very, very addicting game that mixes RPG mechanics together with roguelike gameplay. The game generates a random level for you, even though all of the levels are always large rectangles with randomly placed objects in it. The enemies will come from the north, south, east and west and they come in waves. Defeat a wave and you'll have time to upgrade your stats and skills, find health orbs, find hidden dungeons or buy items. Or just idle, it's totally up to you. You can also find and unlock chests for more money and random items. And there are potions to be found as well, but they can have a negative effect as well as a positive effect. Same goes for shrines. In other words, there's plenty to be found in these, seemlingly small, levels.After every fifth wave comes a boss fight, but because you'll have properly upgraded stats and items by then they're usually a piece of cake. Defeat the boss and you're awarded money and/or chests, a random item (these items are very similar to the ones found in The Binding Of Isaac) and a portal. Enter the portal and you'll enter the next area, with full health, and the game continues again, except with more and more difficult enemies this time around. And after many, many waves you'll enter a new world. If you die you can start from there, but it's more difficult right from the start and you won't have any of your previously gathered items this time. Still, it can be done with a little practice.That's pretty much what Hero Siege is all about. The graphics aren't great; they're pixelated, especially in full screen and things can get a bit hectic with all the stuff that's going on but it's definitely better than 3D graphics. They just wouldn't fit the game. There's no voice acting except for a few phrases and the sounds consist mostly of little soundbites. But that's not what's important here. The fact is that Hero Siege is a fabulous game that you desperately need to play. Trust me.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Sloppy coding, lazy programming, and a heaping pile of bonus content to make playtime longer rather than better render this title a definitive thumbs down.While the base gameplay is fun, the game is so rife with nearly year-old bugs, UI errors, typos, bad hitbox detection, and just overall lazy development that it reeks of a developer trying to cash in on Skinner-box style addiction than a truly compelling game experience.

												I'd give this game a 9/10:Overall this game is really fun to play. It's not too easy and has a frustration factor, but the gameplay is good enough to keep you entertained.You pick your hero and run around the arena killing monsters, which come in 6 waves per stage, the 6th one containing a  boss. Repeat that 5 times and you'll end up finding the big chapter boss.There are multiple classes, from swordfighters to rangers to magic types.You level up by killing monsters and upgrade your skills and your stats (Attack, defense, health, mana).Some monsters have certain enhancements or special abilities and there are champion versions.If you keep going you will find relics granting you special abilities to help you out as well as keys that open chests which contain gold to buy stuff, armor and weapons, potions or crystals which can be used to unlock (mostly cosmetic) stuff.There are also armor and weapon items to be found, which don't have any cosmetic effect, though they increase your stats and can give you special abilities.Sometimes, bigger versions of monsters will drop a bomb or a circling laser thing after they die to finish you off when you least expect it. That's really annoying sometimes.You have to avoid certain traps (or you can use them to your advantage against monsters), for example spike traps or arrow turrets. Sometimes they can be hidden behind a tree or something, so you have to be aware of your surroundings.The controls are good with a 360 controller, you can move in any direction while attacking in any other direction you want (only 90° angles though). I have not tried keyboard controls.There are multiple difficulties and areas, but you have to unlock them first.Most of the passive skills seem a bit useless at first, it takes quite a few skill points for them to be really useful, while the active skills seem a lot more viable.For online multiplayer you have to register with some service, but theres also local multiplayer for 2 players, haven't tried that yet, however.The DLC is rather decent and recommended if you enjoy the base game.

												First I'd like to state a whiny review/warning about bugs as almost every game on here gets:In the games current state (Patch 1.4.2.3) I would not reccomend purchasing this game AT LEAST IF YOU WANT TO PLAY ONLINE OR LOCAL 2P. I've played my fair share of buggy co-op games (Far Cry 4's co-op is hilariously buggy for me) and still have fun with them either way. But this game is crashing at every corner for the online and local, and suffering some odd bugs i.e not being able to see other player's corpses or revive them. The single player seems to run smoother as I have yet to crash, but because I purchased this to play with my fiancee and friends, it's dissapointing me in its current state. Brief Gameplay review (from the perspective of my minor 5hr playtime):The gameplay is fun, kill waves of enemies in a retro diablo III style hack and slash with some minor ""rouge-like"" elements. The skill trees are small and offer a large number of abilities that have a chance to cast on hit that do the majority of your damage. There is a decently large selection of classes (ten in total) that will increase shortly. There's a decent amount of loot from the usual armor/weapons fare to the relics which add numerous on hit abilities, stats, or act as an activatable item to cast something (or make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fly if you're lucky enough to get a specific one, I like it). If you enjoy action hack n slash RPGs then I'd reccomend certainly keeping my eye on this until the bugs and game crashes clear up. But for now, steer clear if you want to play with friends without having the game bug out like a coke-head. (sorry devs)			"

												Patch 1.4.2.3!Thanks for ruining the game (for me). I really started enjoying it and was on my way to finish ""Nightmare"" difficulty and it was fun. But my motivation to climb is now gone while opening all difficulties to all Players...gna! Also that Mana System ruined some classes royally, Paladin is somewhat not playable now, same for Marksman (which were the two classes i've played mostly).I know that you guys are working hard on this game, but those changes ruined at least my game experience. I will keep watching the development of this and probably change my review at a later date if i'm satified with the changes. I have hope here as the guys behind this game look like they want to develop a nice game and they hopefully will have an ear out on their community...Don't get me wrong, there were also good changes (like the inventory system) but for now, i will rest a while since it is overall not fun anymore. The game WAS really good and i enjoyed every hour i've played it ... until now. Please guys...fix it ;)			"

												This game is full of bugs. Basically, this is a game that is copying Diablo 2, which is a good copy but very rough. Fortunately it is only $1.49 when I bought it, otherwise it is totally a waste of money.1. This game is changing every patch. You would lose all your items after each patch, which means it is pointless to farm. 2. If you change your resolution into full screen, it does not help for your next time playing. The game wont memorize your setup and still opens a new window. 3. If you change your video or audio setup in game, there is an 'exit' button right after you hit back, so probably you would hit exit and then you close the entire game, which is pretty frustrating.4. The pick up and use shortcut is the same key, which makes you easy to make mistakes.There are tons of bugs that I meet. All in all, this is a good sub to Diablo 2 but it may not worth the money.			"

												This review was made, back in July, when such things as multiplayer did not exist.  There may have been changes to the game since then. But it did not enthrall me when I played it, and I will not be taking a crack at it again until my RNG that determines what games I play tells me it's up. Make of that tidbit what you will.At first look this game seemed like it could have been interesting, but as I began to play further, it shows the true colors rather fast.  The leveling system never makes you feel like you are strong, the waves take forever, and there's so many of them that what should be a good idea, isn't. It's hours of repititious backpeddalling, and hoping that something random doesn't fall on your head.I started a run in Hardcore mode, thinking it may add some to it, and I bought an item out the gate. That item turned out to be so incredibly overpowered that it allowed me to cruise through the game one shotting everything all the way to wave 80 something. Until, randomly, I was insta gibbed by three orbs popping out blocking me.  Sure, randomness can be fun, and death can be as well. But when you have spent oh so much time, doing the same thing, over, and over, and over again... it kinda loses value.  And fast. TL:DR:  It's repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, random, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive.  Leveling is useless.			"

												I played this game for a couple weeks and had a great time. Now it's a totally different game. ""optimized for endgame"" my♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥until I reach endgame because it's crap. Not only did I buy a 4 pack and gift it to my friends, I even recommended it so hard they all bought the DLC. My brother just found time last night to play, and bought all three dlc at full price. Luckily, we played less than 2 hours before we went on Path of Exile, so he can still return his copy and get refunds for the DLC. The 48 hours I played in the last weeks were great, but I won't be adding any time to that until the ""optimizations"" are reversed.Here are some ""optimizations"": Mana mechanic replaced the Cooldown mechanic.Introduced health regeneration (so now instead of risking killing an enemy to get HP and putting everything on the line, you can just run away for 3minutes until you are full. Boring.)One more attribute, energy. However no extra attribute points on level up.Skill synergies (how attributes affect skills) have been reduced down to 4% of their original value. Good job... So now not only do some skills deal no damage, they also cost precious mana. Swiftness (Attack speed) attribute removed and replaced by a stat only available through ""Mystic"" weapons. Garbage.The didn't change proc chance of skills, so one skill point is either 200 damage on an active skill (that didn't need to be skilled for damage because of synergies) , or 1% chance to proc. Since you can't skill into attack speed, proc builds aren't worth investing in. Since skills cost more mana per level, you can't level skills unless you dump stat points into energy.Obligatory Viking quote: ""War never changes... THANK THE GODS FOR THAT""He was wrong. ♥♥♥♥ the gods.Game was 9/10Now it's Diablo 3/10			"

												There are plenty of games out there that aren't bad per se, but don't give a particularly compelling reason to play them. Loot-based games can run afoul of this issue if the loot is no good, and combat-heavy ones have the same issue if the combat is boring or repetitive. I'm bringing this up because Hero Siege isn't really a bad game, but it fails to do anything that isn't done better elsewhere. It's built out of a potent combination of systems, and just never achieves anything of note with them.The story is... okay I honestly have no idea what the story is, or if there even really is one. You play one of a dozen or so heroes sent to some town to slay infinite monsters that are aggressively milling around the area. These fights take place in randomly-generated arenas where waves of foes approach from the cardinal directions to menace you. Beating five waves of monsters summons a boss, and every five levels ends with a face-off against a world boss. You'll score piles of gold, gear, potions, and artifacts for your trouble, as well as experience to level up with.What you end up with is a funky mix of Diablo, Binding of Isaac, and Robotron. Defeating enemy waves is your primary concern; there are usually additional monsters and hazards around the map but you only have to kill the wave-spawned critters to progress. The map elements are all randomly generated and include optional mini-dungeons that contain potent artifacts which can boost your stats or skills. Equipping gear is important but the artifacts provide the most benefit, and are also what you lose when you die. Experience and gear stays with you but dying means starting over from the village with no artifacts.This all sounds like a good way to kill an evening or two, but the trouble lies in the execution. Unlike the games I alluded to earlier, Hero Siege is sloooooooooow. You're slow, your attacks are slow, enemies are slow, abilities are slow, everything happens at a glacial, uninteresting pace. In fact, you can manually trigger new waves whenever you want and there's almost no reason not to pop them all at once, because the enemies take so long to reach you and attack that you can whittle them down in relative safety. I say ""almost"" because you need decent gear to make this work but the balance of levels and equipment is so out of whack that it's entirely possible to become functionally immortal not halfway through a full run.There's 20 or so arenas to battle through (with more to unlock) and some ridiculous number of difficulties for when one gets too easy, but the flawed formula never changes. You're ALWAYS going to be hacking or blasting away at snail-crawling enemies with weapons that either one-shot them or take ages to wear them down. There might be ways to spice things up in the town but I wouldn't know how, because all the residents there offer goods or services I've never heard of in exchange for things I don't have. I suppose it's all endgame stuff which does me no good in the boring stretch I'm at, and renders the town essentially pointless.The graphics are decent enough 2D with some meaty effects and dense monster packs, but there's nothing particularly memorable about any of it. The voiceovers for the different classes stand out for being super cheesy and over-the-top at least, and the rest of the sound design does what it needs to without much impact. Really the whole game is a very safe, unambitious loot grind that fails to offer anything to keep you invested. Even if you're a fan of endlessly growing numbers the mindless, boring combat is bound to turn you off. Hero Siege isn't bad, but I can't find anything really GOOD to say about it and that wouldn't make much of a recommendation.			"

												TL;DR - don't waste your time with this♥♥♥♥♥♥the concept is fun and somewhat addicting, graphics are fancy and the whole game is pretty well made (done in GameMaker, pretty impressive). but i hate it to the depths of my soul. here's why: 1) bugs galore! ridiculous oneshot-deaths, crashes, disconnects, animation failures, various multiplayer priority conflicts, fps drops, missing items, i don't remember having a smooth online expirience ever in this game. 2) paid trash DLCs! ""oh hey we made a new♥♥♥♥♥♥class and map retextures you gotta pay for"". you're not obligated but still feels wrong. instead of fixing the core they chip in some more crap for your cash. 3) major rollbacks my dudes! grind those wormholes overnight for better loot just for the sake of it, get hero levels, grow stronger - only to lose it all because reasons! they have ""seasonal"" characters that get wiped after season ends (and it's ticked for you upon new character creation - lovely huh?), but it's not even that. they rollback before events, on new♥♥♥♥♥♥updates, and yadayada - whenever they feel like it. who cares about progress right? 4) hey yo new layouts and♥♥♥♥♥♥ moving your furniture around while also rollbacking you every ♥♥♥♥ing month (approx.). the thing was there and now it's somwhere else, also some hud changes, map rescales, number reductions and stuff - all so you would never accustom yourself to anything. 5) here's mana! it was just cooldowns on your skills back in the day, but now we have mana which never even ends and means nothing in the game but there you have it! just a fancy example of poor choices devs don't think twice about. bugged, constantly changing (one day it's a race sim the other it's tetris) piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that doesn't care about you at all, as instead the whole purpose of it is to ♥♥♥♥ you up. stay away. P.S. don't join Sarcaster's coffee club, let him drink his♥♥♥♥♥♥alone, maybe then he'll learn some basic respect.			"

												Hero Siege is like an abusive relationship. As it goes on, it beats and abuses of you, but you still feel like coming back for more, until you realize it's not good for you and just end it.As I progressed through the game, I noticed an ungodly amount of glitches everywhere. It honestly felt like playing an early access game, even though it was released in... 2014. Wow.Here I'm gonna list the good things about this game:- Feels good to blast your way through countless waves of enemies.- Voice acting is cool. Most of the times.Here I'm gonna list the (most relevant) bad things about this game:- A good portion of the relics are useless once you reach end-game.- Most boss battles are bland and boring. One Firenova was enough to kill every boss until Destruction difficulty, where I needed maybe two or three. The only interesting bosses are the ones inside the Wormhole. But you'll go through a lot of tears and frustration until you reach that point.- Cheap deaths. It feels like the game gives you everything so you can just rush through it, but then it sticks its foot in front of you and makes you faceplant on the floor. Most times you can barely notice what killed you, but it's usually a tiny bullet that deals trillions of damage amidst the clusterf*ck of things in the screen. I know you're still supposed to die even when you're god mode, but the game doesn't give you any time to react to threats at all.- Awful humor. Childish, to say the least.- Maps are crowded with sh*t. It's SO MANY obstacles placed literally anywhere that it gets easy to just get stuck between them and... Die.I would recommend this game because I actually enjoyed playing it, but I gave up playing after dying unfairly so many times. It's not worth the frustration you go through. This game feels like a DLC bait. If you still wanna have a quick hack & slash fun, at least have the decency to wait for this game to go on sale. It's not worth it's full prize.I'm hoping to go back to this game in the future and see it fixed.*Post 1.7 update edit*They tweaked some things here and there, added more stuff, but nothing changed. It's still a bug ridden game. And the devs still have the balls to say ""they're fighting against the triple A industry of games"". For someone fighting the triple A gaming companies, you guys aren't even trying. Leaving the game with so many bugs while stating such a thing is despicably unprofessional.Also, the new chests are bullsh*t. 1k crystals for a bunch of keys? F*ck yeah!			"

												After 3 rounds of updates and reworks, I can't recomend this game. The OG version was fun and enjoyable it was a simple hack and slash bullet hell, but now the devs are trying to hard to make this game into Diablo; with the introduction of mana and the reduced rate of finding treasure, and the rediculous prices in the shop, the devs have effectively shot themselves in the foot. Stay away from this game until they learn that these ""new"" changes are unneeded and game ruining.			"

												I stopped playing the game when I got to the point where tiny invisible pellets that I could not see among all of the gore dealt a trillion damage to you. I wouldn't be giving this game a negative review if those things were actually visible and not so damn cheap. Completely ruined the gaming experience for me time after time after time after time. What makes it even worse it is something they can't even fix, I'm not joking, the damage bug is like hard baked into the code, so when you gain super high health the enemies damage is upped as well, to an unimaginable amount, which is something they have been proven not able to correct. They still haven't been able to fix placing projectiles above all the sprites so that you can see them. Devs need to go back to school and learn Game Maker all over again.			"

												Repetitive and frustratingly unrewarding. As a mathematician and game programmer, I tried for hours to understand how this game's maths work. This was all in vain: 100% chance to throw sand, yet does nothing more than half the time; 40 dmg somehow becomes 300 damage (with no crit). The value of attack speed is never explained and makes no sense (it's not attacks per second, nor attacks per 1/10th of second). Considering that levelling and talenting your character tends to make little difference in the game due to artifacts being so powerful in comparison, this makes it very hard to enjoy the game or customize/optimize characters to your liking.There's also a large amount of easy-to-fix bugs which make the game even more frustrating, such as dungeons or crypts spawning at the same time a boss does, leaving you no way of accessing it (not exactly pleasing when it happens twice and you have gotten no crypts or dungeons for the past 30 mins or so), particles getting stuck on the map, arrow indicator pointing to non-existent mobs, boss spawning with entire waves, and the worst of all, save files getting corrupt.The game also only gives you 6 character slots, meaning you can't even get all of the achievements without deleting at least 4 characters (5 classes + optional hardcore mode = 10 characters).Glad I got this off a cheap bundle. Really not worth the price on Steam.			"

												I would have reccomended this game in a heartbeat. But the recent update screws up everything that made this game unique. No mana system I actually enjoyed with simply cooldown. now if you don't invest in mana your characters are screwed. Next up. Characters randomly are gone. Level 100 paladin? Gone. Level 70 samurai might as well be gone because they removed swiftness and all his items so everything I invested is gone. Wasted a lot of money on dlc and time on this game. Unless they allow you to play the old version (Which still removes my equipment) I would never recommend this game anymore. Seriously. I am♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Giving a review of this game for me is pretty hard at this point. On one hand, it's not bad per se. It's got very nice pixel art graphics which are pretty much how Diablo II would have looked like had it been an 8-bit game. It's smooth and fast-paced and the gameplay is overall fun. Music is nice, classes are diverse and original, and enemies and items aplenty.HOWEVER.I really feel like Hero Siege is a textbook example of how to get the general picture right and then ruin everything by screwing up the details. The main problem the game has is: it's hard in an unfair way. It's not like Binding of Isaac, where difficulty feels like a progression. No, here you can become a powerhouse, slaughtering enemies with so much ease it gets boring - and then still die because THAT ONE enemy is able to deliver insane amounts of damage in one hit, despite it being an utter weakling under all other respects. This means you'll get stuck repeating the same levels over and over, getting more and more powerful thanks to the leveling up system, so that the 99% of the time you spend fighting manageable enemies becomes utterly uneventful - but then something happens and you still die. It's an addictive mechanism but it doesn't work because it's fun, only because it makes you come back in rage and frustration.Another really annoying thing is how the updates work. Despite being nominally a released game, Hero Siege keeps getting major changes on a regular basis. This isn't limited to small balancing tweaks. Entire classes are nerfed or powered up. Skills are taken out, then put back in, or their effect is changed. I've leveled up a character disregarding its close-range skills only to find them transformed into ranged attacks the next update. One class had its entire appearance changed for no reason. Rules change on a daily basis sometimes - money doesn't persist after death? Well now it does. Got used to that? TOO BAD NOW IT DOESN'T AGAIN. And no matter how broken it gets, you still manage to die in stupid ways because of that one deadly bullet with one pixel wide hitbox.The third problem is input bugs. Press a button too long, it will be taken in twice. This is especially jarring since in some instances this can lead to stuff like you losing a legendary item just because you wanted to check out an alternative on the ground (items, once discarded, are lost forever, and the button to look at the drop and to equip it is the same). There's stuff like using events that only fire when a key is pressed for a reason, people.Overall, it's a rather unpolished game, and one that changes way too often to offer a consistent playing experience. I got it in a Humble Bundle so it wasn't a big deal, but full price, I'd seriously suggest you give this a pass and play Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead.			"

Pros: -Easy gameplay to pick up and put down casually, makes for great short bursts of fun-addicting gameplay-The ability to spawn up to five waves at once, making it as hack and slashy/bullet hell as you choose.-Great entry point at 60 centsNeutral:-Contains meme and game reference voice acting, this can be a pro or a con depending on the person.Cons:-Multiplayer is not synced, not even over LAN/Ethernet at less than 10ms, mobs seem to teleport as the clients send each other conflicting data on positions, the official servers currently do not work and without proper netcode they shouldn't bother fixing them.-Typing in multiplayer (even though MP barely works) will open random menus and interactions such as trade, items and skills.-There is no semblance of balance, some relics such as Winners Drug make you basically immortal with stacking buffs that don't decay ) while others don't even proc after you change maps (hand of midas)-Item rarity and level scaling seems wrong and level seems to barely affect the stats of an item compared to the rarity , in the aspects of that at level 50 and act 4 my drops are usually less than level 20, yellow/orange 40 weapons are worse than my 21 purple i got in the first act.-Primitive mob damage system, being too close to an enemy will instantly hurt you without an animation, even on ranged enemies, this severely hinders melee classes and forces you to strafe backwards for a considerable amount of your time playing, although some argue this is a design decision.-Half the game is locked away behind DLC, which arguably is justified now considering base price is on sale at 60 cents-mob spawning seems to happen quite often outside the boundaries of the map and they do not enter the map, i've had rare encounters and loot goblins spawn outside the boundaries, which can be quite frustrating to see but never reach.-I have been teleported(item proc) out of boundaries, as well as dashing through map boundaries, in overworld maps it teleports you back almost 100% but in dungeons you're stuck, forcing you to end your run completely.-You can use skills such as Demon Hunter's Dash to cut half way through dungeons, I'm not sure if this is a perk/incentive to buy DLC characters or a bug, but I use it to skip most puzzles and gates.-seemingly random types of projectiles fly through walls (DH sword throw proc for example)-melee attacks seem to clip corners and edges of walls, making one way vantage points to funnel mobs, this could be called strategy but its a clear oversight of code or collision-Unable to remap controls leaves me sometimes summoning a portal when I am navigating the inventory when using a controller.Conclusion: even though I bought this thinking multiplayer was functional and that my friends and I would be able to play together, the singleplayer is an okay experience and it wont hurt to buy the base game now to enjoy the singleplayer content, but if you're someone who enjoys balance or multiplayer, I would strongly recommend waiting for future changes.

												I'm at the grocery store, trying to buy whatever it is I always buy, and I'm walking around lost...dazed. It's the numbers, they're everywhere. Ever since I started playing Hero Siege that's all I ever see. Red numbers, white numbers, green numbers, yellow numbers, spinning and twirling and dancing in front of me. This has never happened before, I used to be NORMAL.Hero Siege combines a rogue-like and Diablo to create something positively maddeningly addictive. Each act is divided into several stages, which are further broken up into waves. The goals are simple; survive and kill all of the monsters. The promise of phat loot, powerful relics, and numbers beyond comprehension await. Oh and I guess you save the world too? hurray. When I started the game, there were six playable heroes. The character-limit is unfortunately a little short, which cuts off some of the names I give my heroes. Irvin - He's a viking, capable of slashing foes with his mighty axe. Melee classes seem to be underpowered in this game. This is partly due to the mechanics. A monster doesn't actually have to touch to do damage. They do this little lunge, and even if it looks like the hero is a space away, they take damage. Still, Irvin gets my ""not bad"" rating. AllUpInnz - The nomad. So far this guy hasn't been any fun to use. He's a melee class, and one of his skills allows him to do more damage if he doesn't swing his sword for awhile. Ehh..This is a game where 30+ monsters can attack at a time; it's way too chaotic for sneaky assassin-type moves. Maybe he gets better after collecting certain skills.LargeBootyHo - She's a pirate. Her name is supposed to be LargeBootyHoistingExtremePirate but it's like I said, the character-limit is too short. She uses guns, although she's also capable of firing cannonballs, summoning a pirate ship, and all sorts of other fun abilities. Ranged-heroes definitely have the advantage. Couple one with equipment that increase fire-rate, a few relics that proc randomly, and you've got a beast.Commodork64 - Redneck. My favorite melee class. This is due to useful skills like flaming tires, and the ability to spill damaging oil everywhere. The thing is though, there are five difficulty settings. The usefulness of each class can fluctuate wildly depending on their DPS, and how close they have to do get to do the most damage. Also, certain relics (like the one that grants life-steal) are insanely useful, while others (the angel that knocks enemies away for no damage) are just obnoxiously useless. BurnBurnBu - The pyromancer. Actually his name is supposed to be BurnBurnBurnBurnBurnBu but again, character-limit. He throws a ton of fire around like a living INFERNO. He's altogether solid.RomanceNec - Necromancer. He summons undead, throws a few projectiles around. I'm still uncertain about his value. This is mainly because the close-combat skeletons have a habit of mashing together. This causes three to become one, which severely lessens their damage output and protective coverage. The jury's still out on this clown.Frank Phil- Ah yes, Frank Philips McGannon...the archer. He's my hero of choice. His arsenal includes a spread shot, homing missiles, screen-filling ballista, turrets, and even land-mines. Also, his exceptional range allows him the freedom to stay far away.But none of that matters now, because all I see are numbers. High-level Hero Siege can become difficult to follow. Adorned with 20+ relics, and doing millions of damage a second, I start to lose track of things. After a long enough period of time, certain stats (ARMOR) become irrelevant. DPS is never really a concern, because most bosses go down in 1-2 seconds. Instead, you're better off worrying about being frozen, or killed in the second stage of Act 3. This stage combines poison-spewing worms with exploding-pygmies. Exploding-pygmies are a NIGHTMARE in Diablo 2. Starting off can be painful, due to lack of health and weak weapons. With a few upgrades and a few choice relics, flying through most of the difficulties isn't that hard. If necessary, acts can be repeated to accumulate more stuff. Even the INFERNO setting isn't much more difficult than those before. Multiplayer is also available, though I've never been able to make the time for it.I'm still stumbling through the grocery store, my eyes rolling into the back of my head and then around again. I think people are staring, but I can't see them. All I see are the numbers jumping out of the shelves, snaking through my groceries, beating against the doors in the frozen food aisle. Finally I'm at checkout. As the cashier scans my groceries, the bag lady says ""Did you know that the amount of force necessary to bite into a carrot is equivalent to biting off a finger?"" The cashier gives her the strangest look, and I -still absorbed in numbers- say ""Thanks! That was enlightening.""As I push the cart outside I take a close look at my fingers. What have they done for me lately? Especially the thumbs, damn them to HELL. It's because of these digits that I've been playing Hero Siege non-stop. I'm not even finished with the game, but I know it'll destroy me. I still have to-In the parking lot, I stop. The numbers are accumulating, they're forming a circle. A portal?! The numbers have created a door. A man steps out. He has a mohawk, and he's carrying a bow.""Frank?! FRANK!""""Greetings...""""Y...you're supposed to be dead!""""I am dead. You killed me.""How could I forget? This AGONY has been plaguing me, since I stopped playing the game. On the highest difficulty, Frank Philips McGannon was killed by the Son of Lucifer. It was an attack I've seen a dozen times, but I was so distracted by the numbers that he was blasted. This destructive force did twice the damage of his HP. It killed him, and it broke me. Sure, I wasn't playing on hardcore, but all relics are lost upon death. There was no way I was grinding all that crap for another attempt. Hero Siege is great, but the end-game is just absurd. That said...""Look Frank. I was going to come back. We were going to finish this...together."" I plead.""It's too late.""He aims an arrow at me, before I can say any----------I awake in a hospital bed. I think I'm alive, but I feel strange. A nurse enters my room.""I'm happy to see that you're alright."" she exclaims. ""Somebody found you passed-out in a grocery store parking lot.""""...Thanks. Can I get something for this headache?"" As I move my hand toward my forehead I notice something...off.""You bit off every single one of your fingers before you lost conciousness. Thankfully these advanced prosthetic armored-fingers are just as good."" The nurse states.Before I could find an expression for my shock and confusion, she continues. ""Unfortunately, with the bill you're getting for this surgery, you won't be able to afford any more videogames. It looks like you'll have to play Hero Siege forever!""She laughs as she leaves the room. As soon as the door closes, I notice the numbers creep towards me.			"

												This is a surprisingly good, simple to play, yet deep wave based game along the lines of Zelda meets Gauntlet and Smash TV wrapped up in a gorgeous old school shell. You start by selecting from 4+ classes. For the most part they play the same, some are melee, some are ranged classes. Then you get dumped into a randomly generated area and forced to fight 6 or so waves of enemies. Very simple controls that are basically dual stick, only 4 direction shooting instead of 8 direction or true aiming. There is a button to use an item you have, but you can only carry 1 at a time. The item is generally potions that you pick up or buy. Then the other 2 buttons are to call the store and view the character screen where you spend your level up points on strength, speed, defense and health. You also spend points on special skills, such as 1% extra critical chance. The upgrades system is pretty nice, but really, devote everything into strength.After 6 or so waves, you face a giant bullet sponge of a random boss. It is a lot of fun and there are a lot of bosses, but some will insta kill you if you're in the wrong place. After that, you get a random item, and go on your way to the next area. The areas look different and there are even side areas you can unlock that will take you to randomly generated dungeons that seem to have simple puzzles. Its a very nice touch that most games would have ignored.From all of the enemies you kill, boxes you destroy and treasure chests you open, you will get gold. Lots of gold. The problem is gold feels worthless. You can buy potions and temporary power ups. All of which just seems inconsequential. There is another kind of shop too. One that you can buy visual items such as top hats and so on. Those items require crystals to buy and crystals seem like they'll be the micro transaction to the game, especially since this was a game made for mobile gaming. But for now you get crystals by getting achievements, which seem simple enough to get. Nothing really costs all that many crystals either.The game looks very super Nintendo or 90s arcade and I mean that as a huge compliment. Other games try for the 90s Nintendo feel and just end up looking crappy, but this looks awesome. The only real downside to the game is that I feel this is belongs in an arcade. Its oddly fun, but without an actual quest, it feels right at home popping quarters in. Sure you can progress your character, level them up where when you die, you keep the level you had (unless the game glitches and loses your save file). When you've played 10 minutes of this game, you've played hours of it. The game does try to switch it up with different colored and different sized monsters, but its the same all the way through, just with different environments. The game even adds random death 'bombs' too that will spray you with poison, blue lasers or something creative.In all, its a lot of fun, probably even worth $10, but with it feeling like such an arcade game, I say wait for a sale. Especially since it looks like the game has micro transactions.			"

												This game was one of my favorite games in the later months.I would play this constantly and have even bought some full price copies for friends who would enjoy the game.Sadly it came to be that they and I no longer enjoy this due to the recent updates butchering the ENTIRE playstyle and individuality that the game offered.Random, unannounced item wipe/character wipe and a system overhaul that made every character you grinded to level XX completely useless because they have NO armor on.It's unplayable as it stands, and I don't think it's reverting any time soon. So, even for $1.49, you should pass on this shell of a gem.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I'm quite a fan of rogue-likes and action rpg's so I figured this would be perfect for me. Sadly the game is nothing more than one boring continuous grind. There's not much more to it than keep walking backwards from enemy mobs and holding the attack keys in their direction. At one point I saved up a whole lot of items by simply playing the first act over and over again and the game became stupidly easy. Then after beating the final boss I tried to play the more difficult mode which only included the same mobs with more hp and damage. It's a good concept, but it has way more flaws than good points. I don't recommend it.			"

												Was nearly to the point of giving up on this game; Crappy graphics, can't shoot diagonally and hard as hell . . . once you start.  3 or 4 hours in, my chosen character was leveled and I started getting further in waves.  Now I’m hooked.  Eventually gonna level up at least half of the 8 characters because it’s just plain fun.  Highly recommended at full price.Most of my games bore me after 20 minutes of playing and they never get touched again.  Not Hero Siege.  It’s good action and controller friendly. "

												The game gave me a good first impression. Graphics are not great, but good enough especially for the price. The characters all seem quite interesting, and are more original than common fighter/mage/thief classes in many games. I wanted to try all of them!When you start to play the game, you will be faced with some very basic issues right away though. Some of them so simple, that you wonder if they tested the game at all. For example, in local coop, player 2 can talk with people, check his inventory, etc... but he cannot quit those menus! Player 1 has to cancel all actions player 2 started. Beside such silliness, game is full of major bugs. Enemy attacks crushing you inside wall so you have to restart the game, your character teleporting below the game field, items disappearing in coop play every time you die but reappearing when you enter new area (this is not a feature, its obvious bug), etc. Most of them are not just bugs, but common functionality issues that should be working before a public release.Game has good sides too. Getting items is catchy, it has huge ammount of relics and powers, large ammount of different enemies etc. Fields are varied in graphics and styles. Yet, AI, enemy attack patterns and animations are all quite basic and lame. You cannot really dodge majority of attacks. Its not skill based combat, but DPS fight based on the items you have. And when you get few good items, or only even 1, the game becomes a cakewalk from an impossible. A single piece of good equipment can easily give you more stats than leveling your character to level 100 will, and you can get such item in few minutes of play, no kidding.All said, the game is cheap and still quite enjoyable in coop. Id give it a nice B- and a thumb for a good effort. I would be able to look past some of the problems, for the low price of the game and probably inexperienced developers.Yet, the worst problem of the game is something I dispice so much, that I regret the day supporting these greedy mobile phone developers. You don`t buy the whole game when you buy this, you buy part of it. You have to buy the rest in DLC`s. I am not even a hater of DLC`s . They are usuallly a good way to add more to a good game. But the way DLC is implemented in this game, is the system from those lousy mobile games. There is no closure to the game unless you buy all DLC`s. You never face the last boss or enter all the areas in the game, even though those are displayed in the field and in the menus. They are displayed to tease you to buy more. This is not even an issue about money. I woudn`t complain if the game costed 2X the ammount it does now, and woudln`t require DLC`s. It`s the bad aftertaste I got from the system the game abuses that makes me angry.For a less greedy, more polished, bug free, more skill based game of similar style, go buy Hammerwatch, if you don`t have it allready.

												Review based on updated version 1.6.2.2Even though I played 40 hours in 1 week, I can't say I recommend this game, at least for those who want to play it in multiplayer. The game itself is great, fun and has a good pace, unfortunately it doesn't end there. You may see other reviews saying it is unbalanced, but that is not what my review is about (and yes, I personally consider the characters very unbalanced).After a 10 hour session on multiplayer, my reward was an item wipeout after reloging into the game. I searched for people who had those problems and waht to do. Apparently this issue goes back to at least 2014. This is serious.I know it is not easy to create a game and keep updating it over the years with a 3 people team. You can search in forums and it is clear that the developers do listen to players ideas and feedback. There's even a website where you can post your issues so that they can keep track of problems still going on. Nonetheless, I expect them to prioritize things.They keep releasing DLC containing new chapters and characters instead of solving gamaplay issues of two years ago. If the game was supposed to be like this, ok, but since it is a know issue, it clearly wasn't.After losing my items I decided to try one more time. After a 7 hour session, as I click in 'quit' the game stops responding and crashes. I had sold all my unequiped items to avoid lost item issues, but this time's reward was unexpected. Relics wipeout. Earlier this same week one of my characters bugged and it changed class and got to lvl 0. Since I didn't really like him, I figured I'd just delete him.Looking back to one hell of a buggy week, which bugs are all described in the mentioned website, I can't recommend this game for people searching for multiplayer games, at least not until they solve those often reoccurring problems.

												After 10 hours, I sadly think I'm done with this game.  It had potential, but it feels awfully repetive and very grind-y as a solo experience.  I haven't taken this online, but if my character feels underwhelming after 10 hours, that's not good news seeing as how I couldn't use my campaign character in online mode.			"

												This is the sort of game that you either stomp into oblivion, or struggle vainly against. Having played for a few hours, the skill factor of this game seems nonexistent; there are simply so many enemies on screen that it's impossible to dodge everything, and often enemies spawn from underground beneath you. Now while that may seem like an allure, every death I've experienced has been an instant kill on one hit, making the Stamina stat completely worthless unless you devote an excess of points to leveling it, or get the right items. Doing that won't be an option, however, as you deal out so little damage to enemies that without dumping points into pure attack or swiftness for ranged characters that even though you survive longer, you'll find it impossible to defeat most basic enemies at higher waves.Here's the paradox, though. Depending on the items you pick up, you'll either become so massively overpowered that the game is trivialized as soon as the first wave of the game, or you'll die before you get your first item. The first item I received was a blood wave which deals so much damage that I haven't seen a single boss on screen for more than about five seconds, which is because of the death animation. I'm on my 90th wave total, and thanks to items, it's now completely implausible that my character will ever be killed by anything other than an intentional effort on my part, and with that, any sense of tension or challenge is gone, and Hero Siege becomes a slog to the end driven by curiosity about what broken item I'll get next.For the record, if you do buy the game, just play as the archer. From what I've seen, he has the best skills.			"

												I hadn't heard or seen anything of this game. And then it was on sale and a couple friends of mine got it. It was quite cheap, looked interesting and so I gave it a try.And what can I say? I've since gifted it to my brother and played three hours straight in multiplayer with him (you'll need to get the DLC to have access to the MP alpha). I absolutely love this game! It is easy to get into but almost impossible to master. I still honestly don't know how one should ever be able to get the hardcore achievements as I see ourselves dying so damn often. This game is basically Diablo in 2D. And it's absolutely not at the same time! I tried all classes and they all play quite differently. They can be divided into melee (can take quite a punch) and ranged classes (glass cannon). But that's just the basic (in terms of how far does your ""attack"" reach). Further more every class has something making it unique like summoning minions of dead corpses with the necromancer or doing more damage on your next attack when having walked a bit since the last one with the nomad etc.. Each act is composed of several ""stages"" of the same setting (like the first act being the forest in different taints, then the castle garden and then the castle). The second one is a snow theme (we just finished the first act, so not much more I can tell about the rest). So you fight waves of enemies in these ""arenas"". Sometimes (I think when you call the next wave early but Im not sure) there are ""drops"" like crypts, dungeons, vendors and so on. These make for a nice change of scenery and gameplay (as they are more riddle focused than slaying monsters). All in all I am very excited what's there to come in further DLCs. This seems like the first game I really want to have all DLCs of because they add something new to the game and not just gimmicks.			"

												This game is a lot of fun but the bugs are the worst kinds. Diffculties don't unlock correctly, wasting hours of playtime. Save ruining game crashes, again wasting hours of playtime.Classes that have broken talents, making them 100% unplayable. Even after a scaling and damage re-tweek there are still some extremely unbalanced bosses and attacks, leading to rare but super frustrating deaths that you could not avoid.All of these things have happened to me multiple times.The Devs are working on patches but honestly each new patch introduces more problems than the last or just fails to fix what it set out to fix!Unless you are ready for a frustrating (in a good way) game with frustrating (in a horrible unacceptable way) bugs, stay away.

												The game is interesting and has potential to be fun. BUT the technical side is terrible. Game crashes all the time, freezes, wormholes makes you lag like theres no tomorrow. I can run Gta 5 on 1080p with no lag, and yet i lag if theres a lot of going on in this game. Servers do not work most of the time. You collect relics, you crash or dc and lose them all.

												I liked this game a lot, and it would be one of my go to games to play around and have fun in; i even learned everything necessary to play with my friends online: then they added a new mechanic, mana. Having a mana bar instead of just cooldowns on abilities made all the characters i had fun playing nearly useless. Even now characters that are focused around abilities are terrible in comparison to the ones who have passive damage after x amount of attacks. It makes the game a lot less fun, and variety is almost non-existant. If there was a way to go back to what it was i would in a heart beat.			"

												If just buying the game for 6 bucks wasnt enough, there are also ""exclusive"" characters whom you need to buy for extra cash. They removed the only stable way to get rubies, the only (useful) in game currency. The gold you earn will not have anything to be spent on except for ""wormholes"" which are crazy expensive. After some time, you are gonna get tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that the developers stuff into your mouth.			"

												Bottom line: I loved this game... until it all fell apart.It was simple in design with limitless playability.When I first entered this game, i was hooked. My friends and I played round after round and got alot of recordings out of it. Not soon after,  the updates started: my online account became impossible to log into.When I had reported it, response was quick and the report was labeled right away as a must fix. I felt relieved by the quick response and believed it would be handled quickly. Two months later I get a message saying because they did several updates for dlc patches, they assumed my problem didnt exist anymore and canceled my report. Still not solved i sent another report, and didnt get a response at all. Recently I attempted to go back and give it another shot, only to be given yet another error, leading me to have to reinstall... only to not be able to install it again at all... with yet another error.Bottom line, the game had potential. It was fun as what it used to be before update after update, but fell short when it came down to major fixes needed, when event patches for dlc are given priority instead.As for anyone reading this, I apologize for the brief rant.

												Hero siege is a 3rd person Rogue-like RPG where you fight different creatures and bosses over a variety of waves. There really isn't much more to say that that. There are a lot of different item drops, and tons of loot(potions and gold) to collect as you kill enemies and explore dungeons. There is a Nice variety of classes in the game, althought I've only played with the viking so far. I'm sure adapting to the other classes will bring further challenge. The game is a lot of fun, and at its sale price of 4.99 I would highly recommend it. I would even recommend it at its 9.99 price tag, I think the game is lots of hack and slash fun going through waves of enemies. A few complains, but they are minor. I really wish they would have just left the voice acting out. Its absolutely terrible and not needed. I don't mean to insult anyone but the voice acting game is literally the worst I've ever heard. Hearing it at some points kind of takes away from the experience for me. I don't need to hear the viking say ""Damn, now I need to clean my axe"" in a very hushed tone with little effort put into it after every boss fight. I could do without that. The other complaint is some items are just so much more valuable than others. Some items can almost guarentee a long run by themselves. I think items being more balanced would bring something more to the game.There isn't much to say, but I do recommend this game because while the combat is simple, it still feels good and substantial. Pick this up if you're a fan of RPG's or just simple rouglelikes, you'll have a good time for at least a few hours, which is well worth the price tag.UPDATE: Apparently people are experiencing insta-death moments and game breaking bugs. I have not experienced this but I will keep this in this review to warn you until there is a patch put out that fixes these problems for most people.Pros:-Fun combat-Loads of enemy types-Fun boss fights, if not a bit easy sometimes-Lots of waves to go through-Plenty of classes-LOOT!Cons:-Voice acting-Clunky interface-Imbalanced items			"

												Summary: The game concept is solid but the execution is terribly poor. The developers seemed to have ignored all lessons they could have learned from other games within the genre.PositivesArt Style I like their choice, it's simple and avoids looking outdated.Cheap: I've seen it on sale often; I got it for $0.56Environment and Traps Matter: Traps can kill monsters at a good rate, it was refreshingDevelopers are Still Active: They are still around releasing DLC content and game patches. I applaud them and their ability to stick with their game. Often to many developers take money and run.NegativesNo Mechanical Explanations: There is zero explanation about what you are supposed to do or what things are. You have to Google it and get info from other players.Collision is Spotty: There seems to be no pattern for what can go through a solid wall and what can’t. That’s a very important detail, especially for a game like this where using the environment matters.Illogical Game Designs: For example, when you’re in a desert there are monsters that freeze you in a block of ice. The monsters and levels frequently make little sense.Game Breaking Bugs: Once my Strength went into the negative and all my attacks gave monster's health well beyond their normal cap.No Real RPG Element:  There isn't much of a story, you go through levels with no given reason and you find out the name of the place you're playing in only after you beat the game.The Starting Town: It's large but empty and serves very little purpose.Pointless Account Shop: The typical rogue shops where you buy things to add things to your overall account and help you through each knew playthrough is none existent; you can only buy cosmetic items.RNG Loot Table: The RNG loot table is to relaxed. I was still getting lvl 15 gear when I was level 80. RNG can be fine if the tables are properly adjusted. These are not.Game Looks Incomplete: The game is built in such a way that if you don't buy the DLC  the game looks more like a demo. They shouldn't have added spots for all the classes you don't own nor leave portals for content you can't access.The full review can be found on my blog, http://theapatheticgamer.com or you can click  here[theapatheticgamer.com] to go to straight to the Hero Siege review			"

												Prior to the new update I enjoyed playing the game. The most recent update has removed the shop (which was accessible during gameplay) and made randomly spawning shops, increasing the element of luck required to play the game. As seen in the discussion section, a substantial portion of the fanbase is upset; developers have responded that they will not reinstate the shop and that it was bad that way.The most basic statement that could capture the essence of this game is as follows:A mediocre diablo clone with The Binding of Isaac controls.

												Have you ever built something that was Pretty Good?  Not Perfect, but pretty good.  And you step back, look at it, and say to yourself ""Oh, that bit's not quite right.  I can fix that, I can make it better.""  If you had your friends there, they would pull you away and say ""No, fix it on the next one; leave this one alone!""  But you're alone in the room.  And so you start poking, prodding, trimming, shifting, breaking, and glueing.  And somehow it's now worse than what you started with?  What was once a simple science fair project is now an 8 foot tall Paper Mache Volcano you can't even get out the door.  And where did that glitter come from?  Do I smell Bleach?We all have.  This game, this game is where the Dev's have done that.  I would love to recommend this game.  And at several points during the game's life, I would have.  But noone's been there to slap the Dev's hands as they swoop back in to fix one last thing.A tinkering here, a balance pass there.  Add an entirely new layer of stats. An accidental character wipe.  A purposeful gear wipe.  Break all the stats.  More tinkering.  Fix A, Break B!  Redo the stats again.  Redo the Gear again. Base a balance pass off of a very narrow range of statistics.  Be suprised when there are unintended consequences for the other 80% of the players.If you liked the game a month ago, you won't recognize it now.If you buy it and like it today, don't expect it to live in the current itteration very long.Sure the game's cheap.  You'll probably get your money's worth if you put a solid week into it.  Just don't expect anything to work a month from now.Edit:I put this game down quite a while back for all the reasons I listed above.  Steam's front page redesign brought recent patches to my attention.  It appears all my previous gripes still stand as several of the last 4 patches are listed as having wild balance changes to various characters and specific portions of the game.			"

												Review available in english.I've loved and been addicting to this game since the very moment i started playing it 3 months ago or so.It went better the more i learned about it.As one may say it's ""easy to play but hard to master"", it's that kind of game.It's a diablo-like with it's hack & slash gameplay, frenzy action, many ennemies assaulting our heroes but we can fight back with our hero skills and the powers of the 150+ relics we can find during a run, each one giving unique powers/bonuses.Most classes are fun and balanced, the devs are still working actively on the balance part while being very close to the community's suggestions through steam forums.Speaking about the steam forums, i was a player like any other just a few days ago but thanks to my dedication and because i asked them i became the moderator of the forums.It is now more lively, more organized and the community is getting bigger and closer everyday.It is a binding of isaac like in the way that our heroes fight in an arena closed by walls and entrances that monsters use to get to us.Maps are way bigger than BoI, randomly generated for most of them.The game with the 2 Dlcs contains 6 acts and each acts has got it's own maps themes and unique finall bosses.it's a roguelike in the way maps are randomly generated, we can also find potions that either strenghten or weaken our hero, statues that has the same kind of effects.There are more than 150 relics once one has the game + the two Dlcs, they are also randomly generated on maps and shops, making everyrun feeling different.Many classes to pick in melee and ranged categories, one hero can go up to lvl 250 which requires lots of farming.farming in this game doesn't feel like farming in some standard mmorpgs, you're not always fighting the same monsters the same way.Randomness in finding potions, relics, statues really makes every game different but most of all read this:One of the thing i prefer in this game is the feeling of power you can get during a run, starting from act I.Even if you're a low level hero you will feel so powerfull once you have some relics with crazy effects.This is true that you will feel Overpowered, i often felt overpowered.Still you can die very quickly because some monsters' skills or traps on the map are OP too but that's fair.They will one shot you or almost, it can happen in ealry difficulties but most likely in harder difficulties.This is where ""Skill"" comes in, learn your opponents attacks, how to dodge it, how to fight it.You'll still die and feel sad because once you're dead you lose all relics collected during the run but you'll have learned a new way to die and thus and new way to avoid death.This is a die and retry game, much like Dark soul in a way.There is a single player mode that is fun and stable, good for learning the ropes of the game before joining the...Multiplayer game!This is where things get really fun for me, meeting people, playing with mates, communication and teamed killing spree are great.Like in Diablo from which this game is inspired, the more players there are in a multiplayer game, the stronger ennemies get. It scales only on their HP and this is hard enough!Multiplayer sessions are up to 4 players.Servers are hosted by players and need a portforward to work, some people like me got it to work so it's fine and others just can't figure out how to get it working, wether they've done the router settings right or wrong.Dedicated servers may arrive in the future if there is enough interest for it so join us and help us achieve this goal!Actually there are not many servers but, as a host, i rarely have difficulties finding mates to play with especially now that i have friends with whom i play often.Another game mode added recently is siege mode.It's much like a tower defense mode.You are in a small map and it never changes, continuous waves of ennemies attack you and your mates and you have to defend a base like in a Moba, this is a fun and hard mode on high difficulties.It can be refreshing when one doesn't want to play the Classic adventure mode.Speaking of the classic mode, a run through act 1 to Act 6 actually lasts about 3 hours, it depends on the player in singleplayer or the plaeyrs in multi of course.Devs and the community are working together to make a full run shorter, the thing here is that it's not possible to save a run in multiplayer, it's only possible in single player.To summarize, this game is:-One where Devs actually listen to their players-Rich in content, more will be added in the next months-Community is getting bigger and is very friendly-Tons of fun-Tons of hours of farming, experimenting builds-Tons of humour from the devs with bosses, relics, heroes' voice-Still in a beta multiplayer, it's not bugfree but still enjoyable! -Getting better every patch that comes out-So much more!If you're interested just buy the standard game at least, try and beat the single player campaign, get help from the forum community if you have questions and you'll probably have. There are also guides available.When you'll be hooked by the game you'll have to buy the two Dlcs to enjoy the added relics and the two new acts ( V and VI) that adds replay value over an already great game!Feel free to visit the forum if you have any questions prior to buying the game!Grilvhor, Hero Siege fan and Steam Forum Moderator.

												The game does not fully work with Windows 10.  From testing on this side, my Nvidia based hardware machines do not load.  You can go into the processes and see the game sitting there, churnig 15% of my CPU cycles but the game never loads.  On AMD Machines here the RX 200 series loads fine every time, but the RX 300 series only loads about half the time.  This can be indicative of inherent compatibilities with the underlying structure of the OS or a code incompatibility.  I cannot say, But I have three machines on windows 10 here with NVidia hardware and none of them load.  I find it confusing and mildly irritating.  Top it off, the company themselves present themselves as being unsympathetic to people asking for help with the game not functioning, saying ""It works fine for 'X' person on our team, and they use Windows 10, so it's your fault."".  It may be something with the way I configure my windows, maybe because I disable all of the functions in the OS that snoop, and the same in my browser?  I cannot tell you.  All I can say is that, for me, the game does not load in Windows 10 except for on my AMD hardware, which aren't always set up to use.  So as such I cannot recommend this game to others at this current state.  Which is a shame really, as the game is fun.			"

												Up until just recently I found the game very enjoyable, even after the new update that has been upsetting a lot of fans I found a lot of enjoyment out of it. However, after the disrespect the developer has shown toward the fanbase who are upset about the recent changes, I cannot recommend this game at all.When you put money toward a game or DLC or whatever, it supports the game as well as the developer. The developers of this don't deserve any of our support until they can change his attitude. Don't buy this game for any price, whether it's $9.99 or $0.99.In the 'About This Game' section on the store page it says ""we developers are interested in your feedback,"" well obviously not considering how they're treating their fans' critisism.

												It hurts me to write a negative review of Hero Siege, Since I love this game (130+ hours played).Well, the game itself is awesome. It's a fast-paced roguelike with RPG elements, where you must eliminate all enemies, which comes in waves, then kill a miniboss and proceed through the stages and acts, upgrading your skills and collecting loot. Simply awesome.The game is constantly updated, which is nice, since there's a few bugs to be corrected. Unfortunately, there is a bug in particular that is extremely annoying, and it's the reason for my negative review. Every time that I restart the game, I completely lose all my equips, and that's really sad, since sometimes I managed to find nice gear.I'll keep playing cause I love this game, and I hope the devs take care of this problem. I'll change my review as soon as it's corrected. "

												I remember having such a blast with this game a little over a year ago. I discovered it on my phone and liked it so much I bought it again on steam. It was fast paced and every class was very fun. I come back to it now and I am left utterly confused at why the developers ruined this game. The simplicity of the gameplay also gave it a great charm and replay value, while the difficulty of the game was fair and pushed me to to better as a player. Now it is litterally all a grind and for a unfulfilling game. There are loads of reviews with hundreds of hours played that go into every reason this game is now bad that makes me feel really bad for the whole community. All I have to say is 'If it aint broke, don't fix it'. I wish I had said this about one year ago.If there is any way of getting the older version of this game I am down for it.			"

												I rarely review games on Steam, but this was a special case. I got this game nearly a year ago and loved it. It was just the right amount of challenge, very rewarding, and pretty well-made, if with a few bugs. As the months went on, however, update after update ruined the game for me. Not only do I now have to pay more just to fully experience the game, but new systems such as the inventory system and mana system make the game much less accessible and enjoyable and have undone hard work I put into my character. The items also changed around significantly, as well as small but useful elements of the game such as the ability to destroy bushes and crates with queued spells. Portals regularly spawn near my character bringing him to the new and confusing level select hub (what happened to just playing through until death?) and undoing my progress in the middle of waves!In short I would not advise buying this game or getting new DLCs unless they bring it significantly closer to how it was in early 2015. I truly loved the earlier versions of Hero Siege and am so disappointed to see these updates ruin it so badly.			"

												The Mana system got updated, making it worse. If you don't completely invest in Mana, you won't be able to use your character's final move. I've racked up 200+ hours on this game, so I've been through most of the drama (bad PR on the dev's parts, resulting in pushback from the fanbase). I can't, in good faith, recommend this game at its current state. Please steer cleer of this game.			"

												This game isn't that bad, it has solid controls, decent atmospheric visuals and a pretty good gameplay loop. The problem I have with it is the pacing, it just feels really slow. I haven't played much of the game and I've only played a few classes, but the classes that I did play seemed underpowered at the beginning stages of the game. 2 of the 3 characters I tried had slow attacks that were pretty weak at the beginning of the game. The other character had a faster attack that still seemed pretty weak. It's just hard for me to get interested in a game which requires replaying the same level over and over to farm for experience points.I mean, maybe I just suck and other people have no problems at all getting past the first waves, I don't know. This game feels to me like it was balanced and designed around multiplayer, so playing it singleplayer I just ended up dying a lot to enemies who have aoe attacks which one-shot low level characters and having to start all over. This wouldn't be as annoying if you actually got sent to the first wave after the last miniboss you beat, but you don't. You get sent back to the beginning of the level and you have to slowly beat all of the other waves to get back to the one you're having troubles with. I honestly can't reccomend it because even though I did have some fun playing it, it kind of felt like a chore, and it's just not a game that I see myself playing again.			"

												TLDR: Great twin stick shooter with loot and stat progression.About 6 worlds, each with 5 levels and a lot of difficulty settings. This game is a 4 direction twin stick shooter.  There is lots of loot (Diablo, Titan Quest etc) for you to get and rare monsters to kill to get it. You get special relics along the way that increase your stats or give bonus attack options. There are stats you can level (strength, magic etc) and a basic skill tree to put points in to. There are also a lot of classes to play. Some of them are available with DLC (keep an eye on sales to pick them up) and they are all really worth it. This game is alot of fun and there is alot of replayability. Well worth the buy.			"

												Before the recent patch, i was obsessed with this game and i played it every day. I then came home from work to an update and i was curious what was changing as it was taking longer than a few seconds so i checked the patch notes. I didnt see anything bad so i just went into the game as normal on my level 111 Samurai and was heart broken by what i was welcomed with. ""Swiftness"" - 0 .... erm excuse me ? That is like a main skill in the game, everyone needs attack speed. I attack so slow, i move slow, and the mana system ? what a joke. This game was so fun to play, and last week i thought of writing a positive review to tell everyone to buy it as i highly recommended it, i'm glad i didnt, because now the game sucks, not to everyone but to me and as i can see quite a few others it does. If the Devs could just revert to the patch prior to this 1.4.2.3 patch then the game would be back at its peak where it was really addictive and fun to play. I'm really sorry devs but im rating this game a thumbs down until you remove the mana system and bring back the speed and atmosphere that made this game fun. I have really high hopes for this game in the future, but if it is to keep going in the direction it is heading in currently, it's going to hit a brick wall, really fast ( not like it didnt just hit one after the latest patch ) Please fix this mess and bring back ""Hero Siege"" we all want you too so please, just listen to the community like you have always done and remove the mana system.

												EDIT: I am still steamrolling as a level 80 in the Nightmare difficulty, already haven beaten the rare version of Damien. Anubis may be difficult, but this is still just a massive steamroll.TL;DR: easy grind that's irritating while still easy, just takes agesThis game has so many pros. It's just that it's easy & annoying in different aspects.This game is too easy in some ways. I'm a level 29 (30?) Pyromancer at the moment. All I do is spam the 2nd special attack whenever it gets too hot (pun unintended) and it wipes out everything next to me in seconds. The enemies will never do enough damage to put me in any actual danger, and it's never fun. The 2nd Throne Boss (death) died in less than a second, i'm not lying. If you really want me to prove it, add me and i'll put a video of it on Twitch. And the voice acting is just plain irritating. (and before you tell me that I should mute it, stop. i already did.) The Pyromancer has such an irritating voice. ""YOU... ARE... FIRED"" This wasn't even funny the first time. ""THIS DUNGEON SHALL TURN TO ASHES..."" Even MORE irritating. And he says this EVERY time he goes into a dungeon. The voice acting is annoying and has no variety, and it just ruins the feel of it.The music is okay, I guess. But it just plays the same track for each act over & over again. It doesn't have multiple tracks for each act, just one per Act. And while you spent a ton of time on each act, it gets unoriginal. I forgot to say, there's a ton of acts. And you can't get all of the achievements without buying the DLC (yes, that's correct, rare achievement hunters). Each act starts rather difficult, but the more you level up it gets so easy it's boring. And you just steamroll through it so quickly. This game's too easy, it's just one massive long grind. And I never thought an easy grind existed.			"

												Item interface is excruciatingly badly designed.  On lower difficulties, bosses literally die in .025 seconds after spawning (because the dev's didn't scale any of your abilities in strength, and it looks like the game was ""Designed"" around just one difficulty)Enemies are mostly stupid slow and not present in large enough numbers to pose a threat.  The only slightly threatening enemies are random traps you can't see due to weather effects or poison shooting slugs that slow you.  Every other enemy sedately walks into you.  This game would be challenging to people who have problems fending off the denizens of the local alzheimers home because that's about how fast waves of enemies move and spawn.Summoned creature AI lags and bugs out in multiplayer. my necromancer had skeletons frequently not follow him and just do whatever they wanted.Harder difficulties are literally just MORE HP MORE DAMAGE with no apparent changes.  Enemy variation is no different, and pack size seems to remain similar to what it was.Did i mention the item interface?  It's the most back asswards thing i have ever seen, with stupid unchangable hotkeys like "" F D and G"" for navigating the menus (which are also extremely frustrating in layout).   Quick swapping to a new piece of gear in a level is legit impossible because of the 16 steps you need to take to do so which will kill you.Game is described as ""rogue like"" - which is a flat out ♥♥♥♥ing lie.  It's got pre-set levels and difficulty.  An occasional mini-game puzzle popping up as a ""Dungeon"" doesn't make this wanna be bullet hell a ♥♥♥♥ing rogue like.Honestly trash game do NOT recommend.

												This game was good, I had fun playing it, got my necromancer to level 48 in one day, but the recent update implemented mana, which was important to a necromancer as it need mana to summon minions, and summoning minions was necromancers most important thing. Thats the thing I hated, I rather have the cooldown then using mana, it retricted a lot of stuff of what a necromancer can do, and the thing is, my level 48 necromancer had attributes that starts at level one, and the attributes i spent on ATTACK SPEED is all gone.

												Before you buy this game, keep in mind that the developers have a history of forum and in-game banning people who have civilly argued with them, remove paid content from the inventory of their entire player base and treat their game as an Early Access product, making substantial and arbitrary changes that overhaul the mechanics drastically, wiping the players in-game progress, characters and items, so you can acquire Hero Siege today being one thing, but tomorrow you would have another game.More info in the Anti-Consumer Practice Report group thread:29/02/2016 update, which wiped character levels, with the developers saying ""thats the reason its still beta"":

												In short, a bug-ridden game is hard to love and/or recommend.Flashy effects and fun graphics. During many moments, you as a player can enjoy the excitement for trashing the mobs or speed-slaying a boss monster. The relic system in this game (little boost artifacts that you pick up from boss/chest/dungeons) have paid homage to fellow rogue-like games and some of the reference really gave me smile.With that said, this game has been out for alost three years, and the amount of bugs that I experience are at times ruining this fun experience. Quest-line bug, relics disappear upon save & exit, the game going into ""slow motion"" on some levels... With a ton more posted in bug report session that has not been heard of since. I have seen many posts regarding MP which I did not bother testing. I wonder what's in the dev's head as they push out new updates without keeping track of old issues.

It looked like they saw the idea of pills from Binding of Isaac and just stiched it in.Gold is pretty useless.Picking up an item off the ground destroys the item it replaces which is pretty dumb.You don't see the affects of your stat points until you add them in but then you cant change it unless you pay for a reset.Skills have synergies (scaling) but you dont get to see the scaling.You dont get to see what artifacts do.The game progression is really poor.

												Spending $5 (sale) on this wasn't a terrible decision, but it could've been put to better use.Pros:Easy to pick upYou can level up and get new skills that do things like stun or summon minionsBosses are good and reasonable, their AoE attacks are flashy but fair. Surprisingly, ones with ranged immunity are also reasonable, even if you're playing a purely-ranged class due to how common traps are.Cons:Simple and repetitive gameplay - Walk away from hordes of monsters while attacking them with sword/bow/magic/whatever, while also using skills whenever their cooldowns run out. This gets mixed up at times due to enemies with unique attacks ('maggot' enemies can poison a small area so it damages you if you walk on it), and the fact that melee classes involve a bit more skill since you have to be close to enemies, but it's not enough.Some skills are bugged or awkward to use - My Viking has a Stun skill that you have to stop walking away from an enemy to hit them with instead of walk-away-while-hitting which melee classes should be doing and a 'charge' skill that makes him run in a seemingly random direction (usually towards an enemy at least).You will die in one hit to an arbitrarily high-damage projectile or trap while enemies normally only do about a tenth of your health in damage. It will be unexpected and stupid.Getting the right beneficial potions, which randomly drop, will make you win too easilyA few potions will suddenly KILL YOU INSTANTLY when you have half health. Especially annoying because I've also wasted tons of full-healing potions because I don't want to die to a negative one.Devil Statues. Another terrible mechanic. They don't give you some kind of upside-and-drawback like 'evil' themed mechanics should, they can just PERMANENTLY lower one of your stats by 2, basically making you a level-5 character that levels up as slowly as a level-6 character, and so on for the rest of the game. Might as well just abandon that character to quickly level a different one up to 5.			"

												Disclaimer: I purchased this game using my own funds, and I do not write a review on a game that I have not paid for myself, because I believe they should be fair and unbiased. I don't believe you can get that unless you invest your own funds and support developers, and provide a personal sense of ""value"".UPDATE - I have been informed by two people on Steam that they were offered a free copy of this game if they would 'downvote' my review. Whether or not this is true is beyond my care level. It is a true and honest review, and I still recommended it, so don't know why this would have been the case. Was tempted to contact the developer and see if it was true, but as I despise drama, I let it be for what it is. Everyone has an agenda I guess?This is a great rogue-like hack and slash title that is sure to waste some free time. If you are a fan of Diablo, World of Warcraft, Torchlight, The Binding of Isaac, Fate, Legend of Zelda and many others, you will have some fun with this, as you can see elements of each game brought into this in their own unique ways. You have skills and talents to level up to further make your character unique, as you progress through various acts, all with unique background layouts that are quite fun. The comments your character makes from time to time are fun, and in 3 hours didn't get old or too overused to detract from gameplay. It has relics you collect that further enhance your skills as you play, all with unique effects. And hey - Trading Cards! Achievements!I originally bought this game on sale for $2 and with that being said, is probably where the price point should be.  The DLC is also way overpriced for the content that it delivers. While I fully appreciate the time and effort and creativity that these developers put into this game (and they *are* active), I experienced quite a few glitches with online play in just 3 hours. I also found the UI to be a bit un-intuitive, and it takes a short while to figure out how things work. But once you do, play progresses rather smoothly.There are quite a few regular glitches (that they are currently working on), but I really feel it has earned its very positive rating. It really does have quite a bit going for it!I can't speak much for single player play, as my experience thus far has solely been multiplayer, and aside from the glitches, I would recommend this game on sale. It has its own unique charm and blend of so many elements, the fun it provides was well worth the $2 I spent. When the bugs get worked out, and the price of the DLC drops to maybe $.99 each, I might put some more time into it. Honestly, we may just play it again a little more tomorrow....it was pretty fun.At $5.99 I would not purchase this game in its current state. Once all the bugs are worked out, and if the DLC gets included into that price, it would be a solid buy. If you catch it on sale, though, it will be a much better value.			"

												It was fun for a few hours- reached 150 and full ""Satanic"" gear.. now it is all about using the normal weapon swing in ""Wormholes"" (what you would call the HS equivalent of Diablo 3 Greater Rifts) and keep progressing in wormhole levels.Abilities becomes useless for some classes since you lose 10 swings due to the minor cast effect.Barely any content (especially end-game), very unbalanced, expensive expansions and mulit-player seems very flawed.Just go with the standard edition of the game and save those bucks (5 bucks should be the absolute highest price for the full bundle with all expansions) if you are just looking for a new game to try out.

												Only recommended on sale.The basic game barely worth the money, but the price of the DLC's are insane.Pros:- Easy to use.- Good music and audio.- Not so good and not so bad graphics.Cons:- Not enough explanations or tooltips for anything in game.- No campaing, no quest, no story, not a single piece of content more than kill for no reasson.- Clunky and stupid inventory system, made mainly for gamepads.- Bad use of the computer resources, some maps goes like on slow motion.- Variety of maps inexistent, 99% of the time you are enclosed in a square with some repetitive traps.- Skills, you have only 4 and you will keep using only one, the most upgraded of them.- Totally unbalanced items, skills and difficults levels, that get you mad trying to figure out something.- A lot of fails, like having enemies out of range to kill them (out of the walls), relics or items that falls on unreachable             places frustrating you.- Game mechanics and physics useless, bullets that passes through walls, stupid IA, combat mechanics just like a ""bullet-hell"" game.Enjoy.

Product received for free
												I already complained about the 1.7.1.9/1.7.2.0 release being bugged on its GNU/Linux and OS X versions and making cross-platform multiplayer impossible due to the developer probably not giving a fug about anything else than Windows, but at least it was playable in singleplayer.Not anymore. The game no longer launches on platforms other than Windows as of 1.7.5.3, so Steam OS and OS X users are SoL. It's been SEVERAL days since the update, with many reports on their bug report forum, and despite attending other unrelated bug reports from Windows users, they remain silent on these. They just don't give a fug.I could understand why would a small indie developer not test on OS X since Apple computers are expensive (they probably made enough money off this game already to buy several Mac minis at least), but releasing for GNU/Linux without testing is just unexcusable. I don't understand why are they still selling this game as multiplatform when it's clearly not. It's dishonest.			"

												This is the first time ever than a game I bought on steam changed genre with updates. What do I mean?The game was initially marketed as a ""roguelike"" and after DLCs and updates over the years it's turned into a fully fledged diablolike rpg.That's not exactly a bad thing per se, the game is stiill pretty good and the overall experience has improved since the first versions, but I would like other devs to learn from this game that you probably don't want to turn your back on half your userbase by changing the target user after you already sold the game.

Fact is though: it does not run on a Mac with Sierra 10.12 and I've seen tons of other people with the same problem, so if you own a Mac, save your time and money...Update: it's been two weeks now... the Dev first wrote something about the game not running on MAC was not his fault but rather some development-engine issue or whatever (well thank god it's not your fault, that helps a lot, really! But maybe it IS your fault, that you advertised and sold the game as MAC-compatible? Lemme guess...). Then there was an update proclaiming that the MAC-issue was adressed... well... read the comments on that one... still not running. Like I wrote before: save your time...			"

												I really want to recommend this game, because it's a very fun indie game. The problem is, it's broken. A few times now, after beating bosses, my character has taken continuous damage until death - with no source. There is no red damage popup, there is nothing on screen to hit me, and im not standing on any traps. I'll just die, and lose all my buffs. For no reason.Additionally, half the time the game makes left click (the attack button) the skip wave button at the same time. My finger is nowhere near the space bar, but it will just start skipping waves when i attack anything. It's ridiculous. Like I said, I want to recommend this game. But it has some very serious bugs that sap the enjoyment right out of it. Until the devs fix this crap, do not buy.			"

												This game is good and creative, but there are several missing aspects into this game. The multiplayer part about this game is very buggy right now, even I haven't got the chance to play with my friend yet. And the port fowarding... blah blah blah blah, it is very confusing to just set up something that we don't do very often as Steam players. I hope it is true that the hero siege people will be working on this game everyday asap to get this game working properly as it should be. Even though I couldn't play with my friend, I tried single player and it worked out a bit, but later on when you die, it seems that whenever you make progress into different stages or maps and die, it would restart the whole thing and set you back from the first beginning stage. The only thing I would like change in this game the most is setting up the multiplayer, I don't like port fowarding whatever you have to do, because it is really irritating, even when I tried to look up and do the port fowarding myself in Youtube, it doesnt work since it is not really up-to-date videos, but I hope this multiplayer part of the game changes soon, so you could be able to create a lobby and just join your friends, without no problem, I hope this get change soon, if it does get change soon, I might even consider buying the DLCS.

												Trying to be as neutral as possible, I still find myself echoing many of the comments made by others. The game is a fast and fun roguelike with enough customization to be enjoyable without being overwhelming. It's good for a few hours of fun.That said, it has gone through several changes to mechanics since I bought it, some of which affect balance and playability DRAMATICALLY. The mana system complaints are valid; it's frustrating to have high-level characters, into which you have invested much, suddenly become unplayable because their skills cost more than their maximum mana. The changes to skill synergies and itemization also significantly changed the game, though some may appreciate the changes. I enjoyed the speed of the game...the changes have increased the depth, which some players may like, but the game has lost its easy-going charm to me.All that to say: the game has been fun in the past, and may continue to be so. Be aware, though, that MAJOR changes have come since release, and may continue to come, that may completely change your enjoyment of the game.I have not have any contact with the devs, so I cannot comment on professionalism.

												Game is awful for so many reasons.  Stay away from this game like the plague.  Developers are just making a quick cashgrab.  I only played as much as I have in order to properly list all the things wrong with this game.  Insane amount of glitches that are never going to be fixed.  If you play with someone else as the host, be prepared to not see certain enemies or attacks coming your way.  I got killed by flame throwers, poison puddles, and enemy mobs that just never appeared on the screen for me but if I'm host, the other player will complain about the same thing.  The UI on the starting screen doesn't respond sometimes when you are inputting passwords.  I've had plenty of enemies that got stuck outside the map and so the game couldn't continue.Recent game changes have made lots of characters pretty much useless since they are limited by mana.  The developers did not bother to scale the character's mana accordingly and so you have a bunch of characters who can do ♥♥♥♥-all.			"

												having owned this product for a decent while, I really don't feel like it's changed much. The leveling system is still the same - at first, it feels important, but you will quickly realize that the gear you find randomly by killing enemies makes the leveling system almost completely pointless, save the special abilities it grants you. Even the different weapons and gear really don't make a huge difference - very few enemies deal enough damage to be more than an annoyance, meaning traps are the only real threat to you. As your damage increases so does the health of your enemies, so it never really feels like you are doing more damage. Progression feels more like repetition than anything else. Not to mention the problem with keys - as you play, you'll find gold and diamond chests that I assume contain better loot. Not that'd I know, as keys are incredibly rare even for the iron chests, and nearly non-existant for the diamond ones. Half the characters are locked behind a dlc paywall for a game that already costs money, and already isn't really worth it.There is also the annoying problem of enemies and chests spawning outside of the boundaries of the map. There are often rat nests and ogre dens sitting just outside of reach, and in the case of ogre dens the ""bonerang"" ability can still hit you despite you not being able to hit its user, which is rather frustrating.Overall, this game feels like a good idea made out of a whole lot of bad ones, and the design choices are nothing to be proud of. I sincerely regret not having refunded this game when I had the chance.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but it just falls short in so many areas that I just cannot recommend it. There were times when I was playing it and had to wonder if the developers ever played the singleplayer of their own game. It's simply unfair to any of the melee classes. You are pretty much required to get the starting item then play and die 10s of times to get to a high enough level to deal with most of the bosses who will simply rush and outright kill you. It had/still has some potential I guess, but they would need to do an overhaul.On another note I was hoping the ""Coming soon!"" characters and levels would be normal update, but then it turns out to be DLC that is half the cost of the game. This simply annoyed me as it felt I had to pay to get the rest of the game I already bought.Edit: There is a possibility I am just REALLY bad at the game, but I don't see it that way. I've beaten the game a couple times and I found the game started stupid hard then got exponencialy easier as you played a character. I am also fairly good at topdown rougelike games as well, eg Binding of Isaac.			"

												I really did enjoy this game at first, I even scrounged up the last I had to purchase all the dlc's and even the new one when it came out. But in the end they updated. These updates were more like downdates. They may have added a couple new features (Which are terrible btw, the mana system is trash.) But in the end they end up breaking the rest of their game half of the classes aren't currently even playable because you can't use skills. In overall I'd give the game a 3/10 wish I could get a refund for it but alas I put too many hours into the game when it was good.TL;DR Don't buy the game. Updates actually break the game. 3/10			"

												This game was okay for the first few hours or so. Then the game became a hold left click and try to get through the game as fast as possible. Until my temporary items were wiped mid-playthrough, so you might as well just restart on a new character. The temporary items are that important.The game has HORRIBLE itemization. Getting a pair of boots at level 24 that I didn't receive a single upgrade for until level 120 or so.Same with weapon, the best weapon I found until level 109 was a level 35 one.The screen is absolutely cluttered with effects and you have no idea what will or will not kill you.Traps and MANY monster effects deal % of your HP in damage, as such there's almost no point in getting HP or damage reduction. Putting out stat points makes no difference above level 10 or so, because the majority of it will come from temporary effects, and by most, I mean 99% of it.The end-game feels the same as level 1 through 10. Except if you die in the end-game you might as well restart your character as your temporary items (relics) are wiped.TL;DR versionThe game is an RNGfest with no proper itemization (level 24 items might be better than 100 items of the same quality), and no point in building your character in a specific way.

												Game Maker is a tool, and like any tool, you can use it well to create fantastic things, and you can use it poorly and make utter trainwrecks. The fact that I'm explaining this means you probably know what side of the line Hero Siege falls on.Hero Siege wants to be Diablo, on a basic level. It wants this BADLY. It breaks itself into 'acts' (with a new, fifth one in DLC form!), it has a bunch of classes with skill trees of their own, it involves semi-random world generation, and loot plays in heavily, with a smattering of crafting. Heck, it comes as close to ripping off the Diablo font as one can without a C&D being involved (if it's not actually just stolen outright - I haven't compared directly). The big problem is that the game's everything is a muddled, broken husk.The gameplay isn't mouse-based, and in fact, the mouse barely functions in the game. It's more like a twin-stick shooter, except you only have the four cardinal directions to work with (you can combine them to move diagonally, but if you can fire diagonally in any way, I didn't get it to work). Random 'traps' appear on the ground and around the world, and this is problem number one: the art doesn't convey things well. Things which appeared to be scenery would suddenly spit out a bullet and BAM, half my life gone. Even worse: bullets don't appear as the top layer of graphics, meaning they might hide behind other objects and suddenly go right through you. Instead of exploration being key, you're mostly in arenas which spawn enemies in waves. Sometimes you spend gold on items between, or level up with an incredibly pedestrian character skills tree here and there. (Fun fact about the level up screen: tooltips do not always work, so have fun figuring out if something is a trap or not!)To top it all off, this week there was DLC released for the game, which adds multiplayer. ""Early Access"" multiplayer, according to the in-game menus, but really the entire DLC is half-baked: for most of us, it doesn't work. At all. You can purchase it but if it doesn't allow you to unlock anything? Well, according to the devs, that's Steam's fault. It totally happened to a dev's copy of Indie Game the Movie, so that means they didn't code things poorly, you guys. (This is an actual excuse.) You don't want it, just like you don't want this game, but I really figured the technical problems were best summarized by that. Or the fact that options don't save/kick in unless you visit their screen, in which case it remembers ""Oh yeah, you turned the volume down"" or ""Oh yeah, I'm set to Windowed mode!"" and suddenly picks up on the thing that it saved to a file it refuses to load on boot? Also be careful dying if you're playing with keyboard! The mouse cursor can vanish (read: stop working entirely) on the death screen, making you force-quit the game to reload.I know I'm a harsh grader sometimes, but this is an honest plea from me to you: Hero Siege is a bad game made by people who are, at best, first-time developers way in over their heads. Please do not buy or support this title. It has been in enough bundles I've given out around 3-5 keys on my own now, if you MUST play it, wait for another deal of that sort. It's very bad, and not in a funny ""it's better with friends"" way. (Remember: online multiplayer is a DLC-only feature, so you're getting overcharged to screw around with pals who aren't at your place.) Everything it attempts is done better by another game, and most of those are just as cheap or entirely free.			"

												This game truly, truly has the worst voice-acting I've ever heard. I mean, it's unbelievable. I literally feel sick when I hear the voices it's like a surreal fever nightmare of a cringey roleplay session with people speaking in their character voices.- Inventory is outrageously clunky- Certain things do way too much damage- Some skills are objectively useless from the first glance and never get better- A lot of content feels ripped off. I don't mind an 'inspired' kind of feeling to items, but it looks like copy-pasta- Extremely unprofessional Developers. Childish and foul. It's a shame :(The game has life in, it has potential. It was quite playable at a certain point, a lot of people liked it before they started changing things. They literally made it worse and then handled fair criticism poorly. It's ridiculous.- Lack of tutorials or helpful information, which people really like. I mean it's not rocket science dude! I don't get why they just fail to explain things. What is this Dark Souls? Just feels lazy.- Shop prices are absolutely crazy imbalanced. The stat potions are stupidly cheap, etc.- Curse shrines are a massive blunder on the Dev's part. *edit* and I was tripping out about permanent stat reductions, they aren't as bad as I previously thought!I can't even be bothered to write the rest of this, there's so much wrong. There's so much potential and small great things in the game just gone to waste. I'm so sad man. Why devs...			"

Often enemies seem to hit you from afar, as if some kind of attack animation should be taking place but was removed or isnt working as intended.There is no hit recover either, so many attacks like acid on the ground will kill you in short order.Then there are the little niggles such as your health bar not showing how much health you currently have or classes that use abilities in the direction you are facing rather than the direction you are shooting or monsters displaying 0 health but are yet still being alive.This isn't a game that is so bad you have to share it, its just bad.Avoid.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

That is why Touhou became popular.The online doesn't work for a start so the only reaso I bought it, to play with a friend, went out the window!Hit boxes are all over the place infact I died from looking at a giant ball. Its shockwave killed me apparently, although I dispute the fact since the ball was in the center of the bridge and I hadn't stepped foot on the bridge yet! Often enemies seem to hit you from afar, as if some kind of attack animation should be taking place but was removed or isnt working as intended.There is no hit recover either, so many attacks like acid on the ground will kill you in short order.Then there are the little niggles such as your health bar not showing how much health you currently have or classes that use abilities in the direction you are facing rather than the direction you are shooting or monsters displaying 0 health but are yet still being alive.This isn't a game that is so bad you have to share it, its just bad.Avoid.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												This is an incredibly fun, addicting game that I nonetheless can only give a heavily qualified recommendation. Why? Because it's the buggiest, most poorly-balanced and playtested game I have ever played, and I beat Fallout 2 before ever patching the damn thing. For example: certain power-ups will teleport you outside of the playable area, leaving you no way to get back, forcing either a restart or a trip to town; Key items for quests will spawn outside of the playable area; quests are utterly broken and don't seem to ""flag"" properly, so if you beat one, save your game, and restart, it'll still be in your quest log; certain skills have literally no effect on gameplay; character progression becomes completely meaningless in the endgame because the 100 or so attribute points you put into say, strength, will be rendered completely moot when you get an item that gives 10000+ points to a stat; there's no way to play certain melee classes at a high level because everything is an insta-kill; you move far too slow for a game with no way to avoid damage other than avoidance; etc.. There are others that I'm surely forgetting, but you get the point. Bugged. To. ****. Basically, you have to have an incredibly high threshold for utter nonsense to enjoy this game, but if you can get past the innumerable faults you'll find a fast-paced, enjoyable rogue-like with permanent progression and fun, varied classes to play with -- some of which are, as mentioned before, rendered useless once you start running wormholes and Toxic difficulty.

												A very fun game, although it's got quite a few bugs at the moment. Still manages to be enjoyable though!EDIT: Latest update broke things really badly. Added mana, which isn't at all balanced. Inventory system was added, yay, but is awful to use and was actually better without. And the crashes, oh god the crashes. Just all the time. Plus weird bugs, like items that don't load for all players and dying from things you can't see. It was so good before too! We're all taking a break from playing until things are patched because it's just a mess right now.			"

												* Please note my Hero Siege experience includes owning additional three DLCs: The Karp of Doom, The Depths of Hell and Wrath of Melvius. Every now and then I get an urge to participate in senseless acts of violence. And it can't get more senseless than hack'n'slash games. Please, don't even try to defy my logic here - RPG take on action genre is mostly ridicolous, yet I admit - it is also strangely satisfying.I've decided to pick Hero Siege and three available 'rift' DLCs while on discount - I got the whole package for less than four Euros, which is only a fragment of price of, let's say, Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2 full price. Of course, you can get good games for free if you want. See Path of Exile for more details.However, Hero Siege is not strictly an ARPG game, but a combination of genres. Part RPG, part twin-stick shooter, part bullet hell arcade, Hero Siege allows you to waste a lot of your time fighting various creatures in different arenas. Truth be told, Hero Siege doesn't even try to tell a story. There's none of it, unless you count some gibberish on Steam's store page which was probably written in around five minutes. After you create your character, you appear in typical RPG village. NPCs here don't tell anything interesting nor they give you any clues why you are there and what's your mission. Base game allows you to choose between one of seven available classes and DLC content unlocks several more. You can even unlock more classes with character DLCs which are unreasonably overpriced (spare me 'support the dev' stories unless you're part of MuHa Games team). Base game consists of four acts. These acts are being unlocked as you play, aside for DLC content which is unlocked as you're buying it. Each act is a rift consisting of five stages; four stages are ending with mini boss fight, while the fifth lets you fight the act boss. Levels are randomly generated arenas, mostly rectangle shaped, although some wild shapes appear in game later. Various dungeons and crypts appear in the game with interesting Sokoban-styled puzzles providing a refreshing variety to usual slaughter. Enemies are being dispersed in waves. Between the waves you can organize your inventory or search for healing orbs. Basically, fighting the hordes seems satisfying. Twin stick shooter mechanics are forcing you to always move and circle the enemies, trying to evade being caught in the middle. Beside enemies, you need to watch out for different environmental hazards such as flying spikes, acid rain, bullet spitting skulls etc. Every character can upgrade his skill tree which allows him/her to use different skills and fight more efficiently. Two of game currencies, crystals and gold, can be used for different purchases. Crystals are good enough for stats resetting, name changing, new hero skins and AI minion unlocking, while gold can be used to pay for items and Wormhole access which is nothing more but Diablo 3 Rift style dungeon where you fight the same fight for much better loot.However, there are few crippling problems with Hero Siege. First of all, after trudging through five and half acts and two of them in multiplayer mode, I don't find Hero Siege interesting enough to continue playing. Yes, you can turn up the heat and raise the difficulty level; you can grind all night long to finally unlock all the rifts and all the difficulties; yes, you can collect that gold, unlock those achievements and fight your way through various wormholes, but it is being boring the same way that D3 grinding is boring. There are games out there that disguise grinding as activity vital to the game, yet Hero Siege openly confesses you've seen it all and variations of the same ol', same ol' are all that's left. As I've stated previously, this game relies solely on its players will to waste time and kill senselessly, without the need to ask any kind of questions about anything. Yes, that might work in Binding of Isaac, but that's the thing with Binding of Isaac - it IS Binding of Isaac.Various bugs are also a serious problem for Hero Siege. Your enemies are getting stuck beyond your reach and unable to come back. Same goes with the items exploding out of arena walls and disappearing forever. An invisible walls will block your movement at the crucial moments. You will die and die again, while the frustration levels keep on rising. Inventory categorizing, equiping, dropping and selling is programmed with controller in mind and it's excruciatingly painful to interact with it using keyboard and mouse. Actually, using only keybord, since you can't use mouse to navigate the inventory. Did I mention severe lag in certain arenas that makes you move in slow motion? There you go.The main problem with ARPG aspect of Hero Siege is its lack of progress. There's no actual progress if you're able to get epic or legendary item early in the game. And that's what happened to me and, appearantly, several other players who reviewed this game. Overpowered items gained early in the game make players lose their interest early.Last, but not the least, I have to rate graphics as cute and sounds as damn repetitive.So, another one of those 'how the ♥♥♥♥ to rate this one' games. Truth be told, in nine hours that I've played, I had some fun because that's what I was aiming for - a senseless, turn off your brain and click game. If you're not a demanding player, lookin' for quick and cheap fix, get Hero Siege, but wait for sale - its lack of content (story, lore, original ideas), replayability and progress scale are actually ruining the fun aspects such as interesting controlling options and bullethell mechanics.If you're an ARPG veteran or roguelike champion and you're lookin' for a new addiction, you will not find one here. Hero Siege will probably leave you hungry, thirsty and frustrated.  ***You have reached the end of a review. However, there's more, plus giveaways, plus cool community of great gamers right at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews Follow the curator's page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/10953338/ "

												This game had a lot of potential, however, where the potential is there, it has been squandered.Hero Siege is a mix between Binding of Isaac and the class system of Risk of Rain. Hero Siege is targeted as a randomly generated evironment, and its gameplay is played in waves.Where you may be playing the game, you may think that it is very fun, but then, out of nowhere, you are instantly killed. From here, the problems start. The game has a great build system, unfortunately, youll find putting more of your stats into health and armor is better then anything else. The game starts to become a huge grind to level as your character struggles to keep up in damage to the enemies you face in the waves. At times, there is too much of a gap inbetween the enemies DPS and your DPS. Another problm is HP in that the increase does not scale well to the DPS intake from enemies.The game relies heavily on the player gathering relics to have a fighting chance. Unfortunately, relics typically are only found in dungeons, crypts and shops mid-round. To new players, crypts and dungeons often have enemies that are of higher level and have higher DPS than you do and it is not uncommon to be cornered and die to the swarm. The bosses in each of these locations can also one shot you unexpectedly, such as, Annie for example.At the end of a chapter there is a throne dungeon, it is in these dungeons I discovered the most game breaking bug of all. Save manipulation. My guide on it is here. After the player finishes the game, the game displays a message that the player has unlocked the next difficulty, but for many players, the difficulty does not unlock. There have been cases of players characters deleting themselves on updates, and lost data when playing. The DLC, Karp of Doom, adds little to the game. It is a Japanese-esque inspired chapter and it adds multiplayer to the game. Yes, multiplayer is paid for.I do not recommend this game, get BoI and RoR, you'll like them far more and not be frustrated in a bad purchase.

GameplayHero Siege is a hack & slash game. That means the whole game is about slaying endless throngs of foes to get better equipment and to earn experience points to level up, which yields points to spend on stats and skills. The first thing you notice when you start the game, is the lack of information Hero Siege provides. You need to choose a class for your avatar but you get no information whatsoever about the classes: what are their strengths and weaknesses, what skills will they learn, what kind of equipment can they wear, and so on. So you either pick a class at random or you start googling for some basic information on each class and their respective skill tree.If you only bought the base game, the second thing you notice is how DLC heavy this game is. There are 14 classes to choose from, but 6 of those are locked out. When you click on these classes, a pop-up tells you which DLC you need to buy to play that class.You have an option to play the game on 'hardcore' mode, meaning if your avatar dies, it dies for good (aka 'perma-death').When you have decided on a class, you begin the game in a town. Here you find one NPC who triggers a Steam Achievement and one NPC you can sell stuff to. There are no merchants to buy equipment from and no NPCs to give you quests. To get ahead of myself a bit: Hero Siege has no quests and no story whatsoever. It's really all about the hacking & slashing & looting.You see 7 portals in the town, labeled act 1 through 7. Each act has 5 areas. You have to start at area 1 of act 1 and unlock each next area and eventually each next act. Again, if you only bought the base game you notice how DLC heavy this game is: 3 of the 7 portals are inactive because act 5 through 7 is DLC content. So almost half of the game. Before entering the portal to start your adventure, the last decision to make is the difficulty setting. Hero Siege has 7 difficulties. Of course, you won't be able to tangle the most difficult modes until you have gained some levels and found some decent equipment.I started playing the game using keyboard and mouse but almost immediately switched to a controller. You see, this game plays like a 'twin stick game': you need 4 keys (or 1 stick) to move your avatar in a certain direction and another 4 keys (or another stick) to have your avatar attack in a certain direction. Add to that another 4 keys (or 4 buttons) you'll need for skills and... suffice to say, a controller is optional but highly recommended for this game.Once you get to it, Hero Siege turns out to be a decent slayerfest. You find yourself in a small area. The opponents come in waves. You see a counter telling you how many opponents of the current wave are left. When you've killed them all, a new timer counts down to the arrival of the next wave. You can press a button (default: space) to skip the countdown and have the next wave spawn immediately.But you may want to use the time between waves to explore the area a bit. You'll find chests to loot, crates and bushes to smash and see if they contain any loot, more foes to slay and most notably: sometimes you'll come across a dungeon. These dungeons provide more foes, more loot and sometimes a miniboss. After about five waves of foes, a miniboss spawns. When you defeat this miniboss, you've cleared the map and can move on to the next area. The fifth and final area of each act doesn't spawn a miniboss but a full-fledged boss.You can return to the town at any time. Also, when you die you get sent back to town, unless of course you decided to play the game on hardcore mode.Like all hack & slash games, Hero Siege is all about loot drops. There are 5 qualities of items: white, blue, yellow, orange and purple. A real flaw is the item labels do not show the colour to indicate the quality of the item. All labels have plain white text. If you don't want to pick up every useless item (and you won't want to do that because inventory space is limited and white quality items sell for almost no gold), you need to look for a very thin glow on the edge of the item which shows the colour that corresponds with the quality of the item. Depending on where the item drops, i.e. the colour of the background, it can be easy or hard to spot the colour.There's a bug in the game that often causes loot to drop through dungeon floors and disappear. Sometimes, you see a purple quality item drop... through the floor and it's gone. In a game that revolves around loot drops, a bug like that is unforgivable.The interesting part of Hero Siege's loot drops are the relics. Relics are special items that boost your stats or give you an offensive or defensive bonus. You can gather and carry as many relics as you want and the total boost to your stats will grow... until you die. When you die, you lose all the relics you had on you. This an interesting mechanic because it motivates the player to be careful and try not to die when he has collected some useful relics. There are almost 200 relics in the game, so plenty of variety there, too.Once you finished the game on normal mode, or sooner if you feel up to it or want to grind some more levels before continuing your campaign, you can change the game's difficulty and replay areas you finished before. In that case, you'll find harder opponents and better loot in those areas. What I couldn't figure out is how to choose a difficulty and an area to make sure the loot that'll drop will be about the same level as your avatar. I've seen level 20-25 loot drop in the same area where level 80-85 loot dropped, which makes no sense.Another thing I couldn't figure out is what to do with gold. You build up a nice amount of gold but find nothing to spend it on. Sometimes, you'll come across a merchant NPC in a dungeon where you can buy a relic for a couple of thousand of gold coins but that's it.Graphics and soundThe game has very nice pixel art graphics. They look detailed, vibrant and colourful but not overly cartoonish. The music of Hero Siege sounds great. On the other hand, the quality of the sound effects is just so-so. There also seems to be a lack of sound effects sometimes, or maybe they're just too subtle to be noticeable. VerdictHero Siege is a decent hack & slash game. It's not the same level as the great ones like Titan Quest and Diablo, and it does have some problems and rough edges, but it is an above average experience, especially considering its low price when it's on sale or in a bundle. If you can appreciate the genre, you'll get up to a dozen of hours of fun out of Hero Siege. People who fall in love with the game and buy the DLC and/or play Hero Siege multiplayer (co-op) will get a lot more hours of playtime out of it.On Steam's extra featuresHero Siege has 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.Although it's certainly possible, it's extremely difficult to unlock all 60 Steam Achievements for Hero Siege. The main reason for that is RNG. For example, there is an achievement for slaying each of the 'alternate versions' of every boss. The chance of one of those bosses spawning is very rare. Also, there are quite a few achievements for DLC content and for online play. Lastly, there are some achievements that only people who play Hero Siege for many, many hours will attain, for example 'slay 50,000 monsters', 'collect 1,000,000 gold' and 'demolish 5000 bushes'. To give you an idea: having finished the base game (no DLC), I had about 70,000 gold. And after dabbling in the other difficulties for a couple more hours, I still haven't triggered the 'slay 6400 monsters' achievement.Although there are a lot of achievements that revolve around numbers like that, Hero Siege does not have achievement counters to show your progress (you know: '412/500' for example), which is a shame.

												I've put a lot of hours into this game. It's unbalanced, buggy, crashes way too often, and as of the 1.8 patch, broken to the point where it is now impossible to progress into the endgame meta.Health pools recently got nerfed to the point where nearly every hit will kill you from full health.Developers have zero understanding of what they are doing at this point, and I even question whether they've ever played a game before.Take your money elsewhere.

												The game has a lot of stuff I do like. It's has some aspects of Diable2, however it's based on small levels with waves. It's a nice and easy RPG that's fun to play around with for the first one or two hours.After defeating second boss, I had a crystal key, I opened a chest and had 3 legendaries + a 500str relic. After that I was one-hitting everything, also the bosses.It lacks a purpose. There's one quest to finish, if not two, and they're boring and doesn't bring any extra gameplay.You basically just grind the same things over and over again, I managed to have the same dungeon four times in a row.I was so overpowered I became lvl 40 within an hour, which kind of ruined it.Overall the game seemed like it was fun, and it does have a lot of potential, unfortunately it fails to fulfill my requirements to such a game.

												I bought this game for when it was on sale for around 50 cents. That's all this game is worth in my opinion, it's been out at least 4 years and it's still not complete. It's alright fun until you start encountering bugs that literally break the game (i.e. using certain SKILLS of the 4 you have) and the scaling of anything makes no sense.The talents you level up with are essentially worthless since you'll end up getting items that drawf the max points by the thousand. Not that it seems to matter though because even with 96% damage reduction and 3k+ armor you still die in one hit by just about anything on the levels you're meant to be playing.You can't even play the most fun mode because it's bugged. Devs posted an apology that they were hungover when writing code so they ""patched it."" The new patch has even more bugs, didnt' fix the old ones or seem to do anything positive at all.This game SEEMS like it's worth it, honestly after seeing the dozens of GAME BREAKING bugs (still around 4 years later) I don't think this game should be sold on Steam. Any redeeming factors this game has shouldn't be addressed until they can fix random crashes or have the attribute system make sense. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME for more than 50 cents.			"

												I would first like to start off by saying i actually enjoy the game's single player aspect. Though upon purchase of the dlc it was stated that it would have multiplayer early access. I understand it can be early access though fact is, it is almost entirely unplayable. Sure you can join another players game, but it does not mean you can use your skills or even connect properly. On top of that upon attempting to inquire on forums what is going to happen and why it isnt functional, i am promptly informed that the multiplayer isn't a priority and I was silly for buying it expecting it to work. TL:DRSingle player - pretty solidmultiplayer - complete jokeDo not buy with expectations for multiplayer though it is stated on steam that it should be included			"

												I love this game !But come on, it's buggy as hell. Spells mechanics act different if you host or join a game. Do you devs have implemented the functions twice ??The endgame lack of balance between both classes and  type (closed vs ranged). They event add poison that spawn when you kill stuff...The Wormhole reset when you play with other people, each new combinaison of characters make the WH reset. That make pick-up group pain in a**.If you stun mobs during cast, they seem counter-spelled, but they aren't...When you up your attack speed, you will see that only ~10% of your attacks are touching.I love this game, but I can't recommend it for now. Maybe if new patchs solve theses issues I will change my recommendation.			"

Played again after several patches now and crashed out before I was even able to clear a single act.If just the crash-handling would be a little more userfriendly. I'm thinking of something like backup-savegames which at least just make you lose the last... 3 minutes of gameplay or something.10/10 not.			"

												It's not a bad game, but it's just too much grinding and too unbalanced.You can enter a dungeon in the first level and encounter enemies with 10k+ health while you deal around 50 damage per hit. While you don't have to enter dungeons it's the best chance of finding artifacts other than defeating the boss enemies every 5-6 waves. So it's a real gamble if you will be able to survive the dungeon or just end your run that way. I choose the viking as my first character and got an archer skeleton as my minion. The minion AI is horrible or better almost non existent. He doesn't follow you, but instead wanders around aimlessly. Yet he does 4-5 times as much damage as I do. So I lure the enemies to him and hide behind him while he shoots the enemies (and bosses). I pretty much just gather coins and revive him if he dies.When you level up you get 2 stat points which can increase your attack-per-second speed in the 0.01-0.02 range each point, your damage around 1 point, your armor percentage rating around 0.1% or your health for around 30-40 points. Investing in health seems to be the only viable option. It's a lot of grinding to gain a level and you only get a very minimal increase in you stats for that. You can find potions that increase your stats for this run, but they are randomized each run so you never know what a potion does until you try it for the first time. Of course there are a lot of potions with negative effects too so again it's just gambling.The presentation is nice yet simple. The different level have their unique setting and there's a good amount of different enemies. Some of the bosses are much harder to defeat than others and again it's completely random which one you'll encounter. Only the amount of hit points changes depending in which level you face them.Overall it's not a bad game, but it just doesn't feel balanced enough to be engaging. You can hit a lucky streak and get quite far or you'll just hit a brick wall in the first level. It's not skill, but pure luck.			"

												I had fun with this game, but it's too broken for me to tell people they should spend money on it. There's a lot of glitches, such as enemies spawning behind walls you can't get past, callouts for dungeons and health shrines either ending up to not be anything or being something completely different, and players being able to completely skip to the last wave before the boss by spamming the hotkey for starting the next round inbetween waves. Sure it's still kinda functional, and a good time to an extent, but things like that and other bs like bosses randomly being able to oneshot you gets old after a while. Would not recommend.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale.I like supporting indie developers,and I tought that this game looked like Binding of Isaac,which i really like.I have enjoyed the few hours of fun it had to give,I didnt expect much,I get bored of games easily.When I bought it,the games page said,that there will be an online multiplayer mod too.Cool,I tought,i love online muliplayer games,and it is a great investment,so that I can play multiplayer later.This was my main reason to buy the game.And now i see,you added the multiplayer...AS A DLC?!Are you kidding me?What is this?This is a disgrace.I wish I could get a refound,i would rather buy a bag of chips and a coca cola than to give it to someone too greedy to include multiplayer in a game THAT I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR!!!1/10,multiplayer as a dlc,its a bad joke...

												[My logged online hours do not reflect hours played offline.]There should really be a sideways thumb for games like this, but previously before all the recent updates I would have gladly given the game a thumbs up.  From when I personally had played the game, the mana update had come out and the game - as it was - was perfectly fine by me.  Arena-style, RPG elements, the overworld, etc. had a pretty alright feeling to it so I have nothing to ♥♥♥♥♥ about there.  Graphically it's quite pleasing on the eyes.  HOWEVER, I have noticed that the devs don't quite know what to do with their updates.The constant updates keep changing things about the game nearly every time.  You barely have time to get used to the new update before something else gets changed, whether minimally or completely.  There is no constant ""making the game better"" through slight changes or community advice.  It's game-changing changes that have kept me off from playing Hero Siege further.  Oh, and it's nice that you can't even complete every act because someone thought it'd be cute to release the rest of the game as DLC.  Cause that makes sense, am I right?  It's like if Stephen King wrote a book but only release the first two-thirds and released every chapter as a full-length book thereafter.But here are the positives that I previously enjoyed:+ The mana system was FINE.  ([-] HOWEVER, acking up the skills' use of mana is pointless for having said skills at said level if you can't even use them.)+ The overworld is alright.  Has portals per act.  Rather pointless to have though, not much to do other than sell equipment from a vendor you can't buy things from so you're left to hunt EVERYTHING down yourself (not that that's bad but it is tiresome after a while)+ Graphically pleasing.  Would not be surprised if they degraded it back to 8-bit or 16-bit graphics because we were all about 8 years old when the first Pokemon games came out anyway and that's how old the devs are acting.+ Bosses were fun... ish.  Getting through an area and mindlessly mass-murdering creatures with families and waging genocide to get to the next area left me with a tingly feeling all in my body that made me feel fuzzy.  It's kept me out of prison.- THE DAMN UPDATES.- THE DAMN UPDATES.-THE DAMN UPDATES.- Oh, did I mention the updates?Would I buy this game again?  If you like math, the probability of me buying this game ever again is 2 to the power of infinity minus one to one against.  So... no.			"

												To be very brief for those who don't like a lot of reading...If you're thinking of getting this game and expect it to run well in multiplayer with friends... Go elsewhere right now and don't look back... This game has been horrible in the multiplayer in the times I have tried playing it since I first got the game up until I got banned from Online.I tried messaging the devs but couldn't get any good response about why I was banned in general since it had been ages since I had played Multiplayer but when I got back I was banned for cheating? Dont' understand it to be honest...Anyway, The game itself had stuttering and random glitches through out that made the game slightly less enjoyable every time it happened since it could result to a death which means losing all your relics or your character if you play Hardcore characters like I always do.It's annoyingly hard to get high level equipment when playing on your own in Single Player and in Online I found out very fast that the community itself doesn't feel like being too friendly in the lobby chat or in-game if they join your game or you join just about anyone elses...Hoping the devs actually stands up and fixes everything that's wrong with the game, including their weird random bans that seems to be given out (yes I am saying random bans since I hadn't played online for a while and some of my friends had gotten a ban for supposedly cheating as well some time before me)Take what you want from my review but I'm just listing out my pesonal opinion on the game as a whole...

												The game is... Okay.Its a rogue-like so expect to die a lot and to get upgrades. It's a mobile game ported to PC... So don't expect much to come out of this game I guess.Pros:+ Art and Sound is pretty good.+ Game is pretty fun.+ Game has pretty fun multiplayer (co-op).. But.. (I'll get to that later)+ Game has a lot of content... But.. (I'll get to that later)Cons:- Bosses are pretty unbalanced. Some are 1 hit kill, and others 1 hit kill you.- The game devs DESPERATELY wants to buy its DLC. The game doesn't feel complete without it.- You HAVE to buy a DLC pack to play the co-op multiplayer.- The game always seems to have bugs, they let out small patches all the time but they don't seem to help at all.- Game gets dull pretty fast, no grabbing point.Overall, its an alright game. But they make you think you're missing something all the time. You won't enjoy this game unless you buy all the DLC (which is what they want). I honestly can't really recommend this game. You'll be annoyed with all the constant patches that don't matter. So no, I don't recommend this game. What I recommend the devs to do is remove the ""Pay for DLC for multiplayer"" thing. I don't know how hard it is to code and design games, but I'd also try remaking the game's engine or something, because it's very buggy.			"

												I bought this when there were just a few classes, no runes, and the game looked hella old. Now, there are a few more classes, the game looks INCREDIBLE, and it's all a  very solid experience. Each class is unique , making you adapt a new style of play for each and every one. The enemies are challanging , but not too challanging. The dungeons can be randomly be impossible to beat depending on your class, but that's no biggie.  They are CONSTANTLY updating the game and making it better . I play this occasionaly , and nearly every time I log on there is something new or it looks just a little bit better. I highly recommend getting this. It's a nice game to kill some time (while waiting for queues in WoW) , or it can become challanging and intense if you choose to push forward to later levels. 8/10 , solid.			"

For a 2d, top down game with four players max!!?!?* Tried single player to see if it was going to be rad. You can only shoot in 4 directions.

												Played with 3 friends.  Game was buggy in a lot of areas; one puzzle was unsolvable because only 3/4 of the pieces I needed spawned (friends saw all of them on their own screens).  A lot of strange design decisions; your character freezes and poses when picking up a potion but can still be damaged, the inventory system is clunky, and it becomes difficult to tell what flying projectiles belong to you and what belongs to your friends, especially when you each have waves of objects coming off of you.  Bosses didn't have different behaviors and were extremely easy to tear through in multi.Lots of in-app purchases, even for things like changing your character's name.  You get 10k of the real-money resource with your purchase, but I figure that Feels like it wanted to be another Binding of Isaac twin stick shooter, but it's not very satisfying and the controls aren't nearly as tight.  Very little variety in how you'll approach different waves of enemies because the random buffs you pick up don't change the game very much.  Wouldn't recommend.			"

												An almost very fun arcade style game with a lot of attacks, effects and events (crypts, treasure caves, traps) etc to keep something interesting always going on. However there are a few very bad flaws that turned this from a solid recommendation to a warning: - the game has no regular multiplayer. The menu screen has an option for multiplayer and then makes you buy DLC. Multiplayer should be part of the main game, trying to surprise you with required DLC is beyond sleezy. I'd rather have spent a few bucks extra on the main game than to have DLC for an essential part of the game forced down my throat. And many reviews say multiplayer is buggy and doesn't really work anyways.- there isn't really any balance. I like hard enemies, I like dying as I figure out a challenge. I don't like leveling so I can one shot almost everyone than a random boss/champion/trap appears out of nowhere with an unavoidable attack that squishes me. You keep your character level but have to repeat everything from the very first wave when you die which turns into wading through the early waves of weak enemies over and over again so get back to the boss that one shot you.

Truly a letdown, as it could have been every bit as good as the things it's trying so desperately to copy if only it strived to do more than dance in their shadow, loudly proclaiming that it thinks they are utter perfection and never striving to be an identity unto itself.

												tl;dr don't buy this game, even if they sell it for one penny. I'm sad. This is the first negative review I've written of a game on Steam. This game upon release was promising, character design still sucked and there were issues from hell to back (literally) on sprite models, items in game that'd break the game in your favor or make the last 10 hours you spent with a character meaningless (I get it, rogue-like elements, just wish someone would ♥♥♥♥ing tell me when I'm playing a Battletoads 3.) Multiplayer was NEVER remotely an option, unless you wanted to go to college for a four year degree in ♥♥♥♥ing with your router and your buddy's router settings, which for most of you underage folk just isn't an option. I see people comparing this game to Diablo 2, mostly because they blatantly ripped off the text from Diablo, but that's not a fair comparison. Blizzard communicated all major changes with the playerbase during that time, multiplayer thrived, there was a big competitive scene, it is still remarked as a masterpiece of the CRPG genre. In an attempt to seemingly fit into this genre, the devs have tried to add mana, but due to the nature of the abilities you use ingame, take up anywhere from 5-80% of your mana bar, so even though almost all melee characters had to dump points into brainless abilities and skillpoints like attack speed and strength, because the big bosses would whoop your♥♥♥♥♥♥from kingdom come unless you had an OP item or dodge all the seemingly random attacks (looking at you, Ra.) I wanted to love this game. I did. After the devs having no idea which direction to take it, blatantly stealing content from other games, refusing to work with a successful multiplayer game, banning everyone who tried to discuss content negatively on their site, the game not remotely being finished and ACTUAL parts of the game being sold for DLC and..well, the list goes on and on.

												Oh boy, where to start?Well, Hero Siege is a pixel-art Diablo clone. Great idea, looks promising, right?So at the outset, you need to pick a class before you can go dungeon crawling, leveling up and collecting procedurally generated loot. Something that bothered me right off the bat was the fact that nearly half the classes aren't available unless you pay some extra cash. Call me old fashioned, but I miss the times when you got 100% of the content when you purchased a game. This is particularly aggravating, if you consider that the multiplayer function is BUGGY AS HELL and simply doesn't work. Oh, sorry, I meant to say it's still ""open beta"", that's what they're calling it these days...Look, I know I'm coming off as an angry jerk, but the fact is - THIS IS AN UNFINISHED GAME. In its current state, it should be sold as ""early access"", and not as a finished product. I mean, come on! How many people purchased Diablo because of the single player campaign? My point being: This kind of game is quintessentially a multiplayer game, and therefore - if multiplayer doesn't work, the game is broken, unfinished.""Shut up, Mordamir, it's good value for the money you paid."" I don't care. You shut up.It's not about the price, it's about false advertising. Not only that, but there's a bunch of DLC available, while the multiplayer function isn't even working. There's a perfect example of misplaced priorities, in my opinion.But even if multiplayer were fully functional, I don't know if I would recommend this game. In all honesty, battle is reasonably fun, and there seems to be a good variety of enemies, and all that good stuff you expect to find in a Diablo clone. But the inventory system... I have no words, I really don't. It's  the stuff of nightmares. I remember PC games FROM THE EARLY 90s with better inventory systems than the one in this game. The mind boggles.Anyway, I'm really sorry I can't recommend this game, there's so much potential and even - dare I say - 'personality' in it. It all goes to waste because of yet-to-be-made-functional  multiplayer and an inventory system from the depths of R'lyeh.			"

												This game had potential, but it's too simplistic. There's no real strategy except for ""kill everything and hope for good gear"". There's no tutorial of any kind, you just have to guess everything for yourself. Also it is way too slow-paced to be fun. The game gets fun in the later levels, but getting there is just a chore. The leveling system is just a joke, you get 2 stat points to distribute among the... 4 stats possible, though buying 4 stat points to a shopkeeper costs nothing. Also getting curses that gives you -40 strength when you only have 20 is not funny.			"

												Uninspiring, unfun, unlikable.Pick a class, make a name, and jump right in to...nothing. There is close to zero actual substance to this game. Enemys are largely the same, the tougher ones have resisitances or more health or have a ranged attack, but are still only rats, skeletons, worms, or spiders. The actual combat is an absolute bore. Left thumbstick to move, right to attack, and other buttons to use abilities (which take a decent amount of time to unlock). Combat is also excruciatingly slow. It's as though they wanted to combine of Binding of Izzac with a dungeon crawler, but forgot to include the entertainment. I found that even playing this game with friends became a chore after the first 5 minutes. Don't buy this game at on sale, and certainly do not buy it at full price. You would do good to just take a pass on this one.			"

												This is a bad game.The base game is Local Co-op only, to get Online Co-op you need DLC.Two of the classes in the game require DLC to use.The game runs like♥♥♥♥♥ for the simplicity of the game it should run smooth on most PCs, my PC is no beast but I have more than enough specs for this game and it runs like♥♥♥♥♥ even on the lowest settings I get extreme slowdown all the time.The gameplay is really easy, I was breezing through the game, killing bosses in two hits.The game is full of crashes, for instance I had completed the level, I went to open a chest and the game crashed and I was met with an error telling me the game couldn't process a certain animation for my character, and the game broke.Good concept, poorly executed, fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥and get rid of your ♥♥♥♥ing DLC, let us play online without needing to spend the extra shekels when we've already bought your ♥♥♥♥ing game.

												This game needs work and lots of it, the game lacks alot of things that would create a better game play. There is no sprint mechanic, you are basically walking to killing monsters, and in addition, there is no way to dodge or sheild yourself from traps. The game gets frustrating when you have lightning based monsters or other enhanced monsters. The different classes are all slow paced and are virtually the same thing. Not even a good soundtrack is available to make you feel pumped up. The only decent character are in the dlc, which btw was the samurai in the trailer of half of the video. Basically i feel they fixed on the look rather than actually working game. Was the game amusing, oh yes it was, does it need work, lots of it. I'll admit i cracked a smile at the weiner shooting volcano. Should you play this game, sure if your in a mood of a game that takes no effort since how slow it is, then by all means play it.			"

												Hero Siege is a game heavily inspired by Diablo and others. You play as one of many classes and beat waves after waves of Enemies until you finish the game. There are relics which increase some of your powers, various temporary items which are lost upon death which give stats or skills, statues that increase your stats permanently and potions with temporary buffs/debuffs. The game tends to be fun, however it takes time to get used to controls and the chaos going on. It depends a lot on luck and lucky generation of items, or else you're going to die for sure and restart all over again. Once you get a hang of it, it becomes fun but a bit boring as you're so strong it's no longer a challenge. Be wary after finishing a game on one difficulty you restart with no items on the next diff.>I'd give it a 8.5/10>Pros: Fun, lots of randomization, lots of items, good if you're a fan of rogue-likes and Diablo clones, graphics are neat. I previously stated bugs and imbalances as negative sides, however most of them are now fixed and they keep being fixed as reports come in.>Cons: Campaign acts which will come out in the future are all PAID DLC, also dislike the concept of not only having a DLC but an even more expensive ""Collector's Edition"". (DLC with acts and rest of the game should be free, collector's edition should be the purchase to support the developer rather than having it all paid for)			"

												Game is a lot of fun. Can't go wrong for the price. The DLC is a bit over priced for what it's worth, and without it you're basically playing the ""Demo"" of the game.The game is far too heavily reliant on gear though, which is a shame. I went from having a +15, to +86, to a +2000 damage weapon within 10 levels, kind of explosively exponential growth.It is however extremely fun! I def recommend it.			"

												I love, love, loved this game! It's a great call back to Smash TV, with RPG elements, and rogue-like ""die and you must start over"" style. I have something like 45 hours clocked, and had no plans on stopping, but then Devs decided they needed to continue to tinker with the game.The HUD is now a clone of Diablo's HUD, but without the understanding of how and why that HUD works. They also recently added fog. They did not add ""fog of war."" No. They just added random fog. Adding such a thing to this style of game makes no machanical sense. They keep tinkering with things, but give no option to use the old style. This went from my current favorite game, to one I'm not sure I'll go back to as much, because they keep introducing things that change how you interact with the game on a fundemental level. This is not good design. This is terrible upkeep.What a shame.			"

												This game interested me and sat in my wishlist for a while. I finally get to play it and was filled with disappointment as I struggled to just play it. There is usually a learning curve for games and this one has none to be found. Not to mention that special recourse is needed to rename a single player character that isn't even remotely usable in a multiplayer setting. As a capable player in similar games, this one makes me sad. And having learned a little too late, this game seems to still be in alpha/beta mode still. I have a town full of NPCs that do nothing, not even a shopkeeper or an explanation or anything. I'm not even sure what gold is for if anything at all. Also, the wave system seemed cool and novel at first, but quickly became tedious as death comes so easily. I'm sure there might be something to this if the positive reveiws are true, but I'm not seeing it.			"

												This game used to be a fun random roguelike top-down shooter. Now the difficulty has been ramped up so much you are forced to die over and over and over just to slowly grind levels.Before you could get tons of cool stacking random equipment, now they treat your character like a persistent RPG character with a single inventory and limited equipment slots.I think most of this was done for the co-op players who probably thought the game was too easy but if you play solo prepare for a ridiculous grind and millions of completely unfair deaths.The UI has also regone surgery and is horribly unintuitive, you will find yourself pushing random buttons to get through menus mid-game which will get you killed. Previously their in-game UI was so simple all you had was one button to go to your skill page and another to open the store and buy stats/items/hp.Now you have to find everything, even the useless NPCs in town have nothing for sale.I tried giving the game a chance I even bought the Amazon cuz I figured I used to like this game. Now it just feels like a chore, death will happen over and over and it's not your fault. Volcanoes pop up out of random boxes, enemies explode in your face, your companion wanders outside the map boundry and dies. And when you die you just get to start over from the beginning of the Act.Maybe this game is fun for certain ""hardcore"" gamers out there but I am not recommending it based on how much it has changed. This is not the game I bought two years ago. Not even close. (It's sad too because it looks the same and wants to be the same, but it's completely different.)			"

												Here, my opinion after going through a couple giga-threads about the game:From me: I like the game. I love the style and the mechanics. I am such a sucker for roguelikes and random generation, and that may have biased me into getting the game. Single-player was crazy good for me, and that was enough. I started delving in the community and the forums to see if the DLCs were worth my pennies. There are some major, glaring flaws in it: multiplayer has been a problem since launch and I never bothered playing online because it is buggy and devastatingly disappointing; the mana mechanic is well intended, but it is not balanced yet (there is a reason most successful roguelikes adopt cooldowns, skills are the best part of every character); some new items lack in the originality department and in more than one occasion the devs were disgustingly rude to the community.I could care less about Multiplayer. I gave up on that front. This game would be lovely with friends, but there are too many problems in the execution of it. Mechanics: I have my own bickering with the mana resource and with the amount of points allocated with every level, and I think it is not the optimal approach to the game. I usually leave attribute points unallocated because they don't even matter when compared to item and potion bonuses and onuses (eg. -40 strength). I hope this gets reworked soon.But that all was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for me - I like the game and single-player, even with these flaws, made me happy. I like that experiments are being made to the game and, even when they are not well-implemented, it gives the chance of growth and evolution! To learn from mistakes made and get the good parts of it in other iterations! I love the new animations for the enemies!What killed the game and the possibility of buying DLC for me was a thread where a dev answered one of the many call-outs to the flawed mechanics with irony and disrespect. ""boohoo mana boohoo equipments stop crying"". No. This is NOT OK! There is no ♥♥♥♥ing reason for this ♥♥♥♥ing nonsense of disrespecting the fanbase that is playing a game that is in the same genre and niche of several better indie roguelikes! Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Rogue Legacy, Eldritch, A Wizard's Lizard, Cardinal Quest, Teleglitch, even ♥♥♥♥ing Rogue Shooter! FTL gave for free a major update that revamped and added things to the mix! Devs for most up-and-coming indies are constantly listening their fanbase and testing things before making gameplay changes! It is NOT OK to just fall down and ♥♥♥♥ on your fans! I will not support this!I know many of the players share my POV. And I hope the devs get down from their high horses and start listening to the community that supported and helped the game get on the limelights. This is a good game for those who like to grind and to be merrily repeating stages, and has potential! But I would not recommend it to anyone now.I'm really sorry. I'm terribly disappointed.			"

Now the difficulty has been ramped up so much you are forced to die over and over and over just to slowly grind levels.Before you could get tons of cool stacking random equipment, now they treat your character like a persistent RPG character with a single inventory and limited equipment slots.I think most of this was done for the co-op players who probably thought the game was too easy but if you play solo prepare for a ridiculous grind and millions of completely unfair deaths.The UI has also regone surgery and is horribly unintuitive, you will find yourself pushing random buttons to get through menus mid-game which will get you killed. Previously their in-game UI was so simple all you had was one button to go to your skill page and another to open the store and buy stats/items/hp.Now you have to find everything, even the useless NPCs in town have nothing for sale.I tried giving the game a chance I even bought the Amazon cuz I figured I used to like this game. Now it just feels like a chore, death will happen over and over and it's not your fault. Volcanoes pop up out of random boxes, enemies explode in your face, your companion wanders outside the map boundry and dies. And when you die you just get to start over from the beginning of the Act.Maybe this game is fun for certain ""hardcore"" gamers out there but I am not recommending it based on how much it has changed. This is not the game I bought two years ago. Not even close. (It's sad too because it looks the same and wants to be the same, but it's completely different.)			"

												Let me start my review with ""If it would be an early access game..."":- ""... then there would be hope that devs would fix unfinished/broken game mechanics"". Let me detail this a bit more. The devs are still asking the players to report bugs. Devs this is your job before you release a game! There are plenty of game breaking bugs in there. For example, you may just die by running through a monster that is casting a mass attack because each bullet is counted. This keeps happening if you play a melee hero. Another annoying thing is, if monsters do not die within the ""walls"" items may just be dropped out of reach (happened a lot to me, mythics and legendaries just a leap away but you will never be able to collect them). Another problem are the ""talents"" and stats. During the game you may collect relics that boost your stats but in the very beginning you will have to guess which stat maps to the stats displayed in the character screen (strength <-> damage, energy <-> mana). Skills are just, ... usesless, most of the time the passives are the skills you will have to pick up (esp. paladin). The synergy of some skills is very simple and they do not really have synergies with other skills.- ""... one may expect a working multiplayer part after EA."" PanicNet vs. BattleNet. Well, there is not much to say. It is one server handling all the accounts... If this server crashes you will just have to wait until it is restarted and you have to hope that your items found in the last minutes are not wiped. One ♥♥♥♥ing server, are you serious devs? - This buggy♥♥♥♥♥♥of a dedicated server...I cannot recommend this game. It is a typical Game Maker game. Made by people who have not a little idea of software engineering, and testing. This game is a mess. It is fun but not worth the trouble...			"

												TL;DR at the end of this Review.Absolut legit professional C++ coding at it`s finest !The game iself is a Diablo-Rogue-like-Bullet Storm-hack'n'slay mix up game with horrible balancing, lots of DLC's and boring skills.The devs say that theyr goal is to bring retro game titles back and challenge AAA games and hey they seem to have sold out mortal combat! So this Game must be awesome right?!(Doesn't mean that anyone actually plays it. Seeing max 300 online players at best) Well here`s what i think about it:Classes are unbalanced as hell. Some classes are just outright overpowered while others are simply useless. At early levels you will curse and rage due to constant dieing to some unbalanced poison wich will one hit kill you all the time. And don't even get me started on early Level progession of melee classes. Yet you will keep leveling up to the point where you won't even care anymore but will still only find level 7 gear because it's not scaling with your level rather than the difficulty your'e playing on, wich can only be normal since you have to play thru all of the game to unlock the next difficulty.Leading to you beeing level 50 by the end of act 2-3.Then you go and rush thru the rest of the game wich is then ridiculously easy just to unlock the next difficulty. This will keep on going until you're either too bored of laggy maps when summoning all waves at once (wich you easily can because you are level 50 now and the difficulty curve is like non existant at this point) or until you reach the difficulty you should actually be playing with your level.You will then realize that there are DLCs for this buggy mess of a game (i'm not going deep into that hole because i don't want to write a book here.) wich are exactly 5! Right now. You could of course go ahead and buy them to get access to more laggy maps, and all those fancy legendaries and stuff that comes with those. Oh and you also get a bunch of other classes wich nobody seems to play?And with all those DLC's and the Purchase of this amazingly well made game (wich is clearly early access. or IS IT?!) you are now ready for the onslaught of your life on the perfectly coded Servers!Unless theyr provider decides to not let you i guess? last time i checked you needed about 15 minutes to actually log in. make a character, get kicked, try to login again.Check out what the shop has to offer, leave shop, get kicked again, login for another year.If you are still sane and managed to make the character you hopefully like you can either play on a dedicated server wich didn't work anyways or you can grab up your own actually working connection, fire up your toaster and host the game by your own and finally ! Get your friend on it.But wait a sec! They also have to do this torture of login in! and hopefully they dont get caught in the login queue they've set up as a temporal (hopefully) solution to this stuff.I don't know if they fixed this yet and i honestly don't even care anymore. I reworked this review due to theyr way of handling criticism.""quote""The Void  [Entwickler]  - The Servers are coded just fine, we have a server expert who made them with c++. Its the server provider that sucks, not the actual programming of the software. I love you pseudo-programmers who know everything about everything and call out ""amateurs"" when you probably have no clue how making games in this scale works, well not probably, you dont know how this works and what problems there are behind the curtains. You just dont know, ok? The Void  [Entwickler]   - ""The devs say that theyr goal is to bring retro game titles back and challenge AAA games (good joke) while not beeing able to even handle the basics of theyr game."" ^We have out sold mortal kombat on steam by 800,000 copies. I call that success and competing with AAA. The Void  [Entwickler] Vor 1 Stunde  Some corrections to your ""pulled from the hat -facts"".- First of all you dont need DLC's to enjoy the full game, because the full game is what you buy when you buy hero siege. the DLC's are simply extra content as in Expansions for the game, just like in any other game (WoW has like 6 expansions, Diablo has expansions, starcraft has expansions and the list goes on). And the Expansion amount is 3, not 8.""quote end""So long story short:This Game is for all you people out there who like professional C++ coding combined with the feel of an unfinished early access Game. (because we all love early access don't we?)P.S. (this is not an Early access game)			"

												Hero Siege combines the gamefeel of Gauntlet with the combat mechanics of Binding of Isaac. While the gameplay at its core is solid enough, Hero Siege has some very rough edges. Multiple currencies and an impossible-to-afford item shop reek of a bad mobile pay-to-win port, while an unconscionable number of assets are lifted verbatim from the games that supposedly inspired this one. Hero Siege goes beyond homage to straight-up theft, and for this alone it cannot be recommended.Still, the many unique classes and multiple difficulty levels offer a lot of replayability, and there is a unique sense of frantic and overwhelming odds which will push the player to build the most efficient character possible. For those who love grinding through waves of enemies and have no qualms about the use of stolen assets, Hero Siege will definitely offer a few hours of fun. For others however, the repetition will quickly accumulate into manifest boredom.			"

												Great potential, but it gets really boring after the first 6 waves. And little things are super annoying -- game doesn't auto-pause when I pick up an item, so a random trap will kill me as I'm looking at the stats? Marksmans first ability works based on the direction you are walking as opposed to the direction you are shooting? All the gold I collected disappears when I die, and I have to trade 1k gold for 10 gems, then it takes like 1k-5k gems to get any items from folks in town?Not really worth spending too much time playing. Maybe a 20-30 minute session every few weeks in order to remind you that the other game you have been playing for hours isn't really as boring as it has been seeming in the past couple days.			"

												I absolutely love this game, but it's a complete piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Game is extremely unbalanced, a complete nightmare from that perspective.Character classes are mostly same-ey and undifferentiated since you only get 4 active skills and the rest are generally on proc passive skills. You'll struggle and die a lot in the beginning until you randomly happen to get a purple rarity item that literally multiplies all your stats hundredfold, and then since there's no level requirements on items you'll basically never have anything else to put in that equipment slot except for another purple with marginally better stats way down the road. There's literally one artifact that doubles your character's damage. Was breezing through the game until I died and lost it, and now I can't do enough damage to stay alive. Some levels are poorly designed and force you into tight hallways in a game that's all about dodging. Some stuff kills you instantly no matter how much health you have. Certain attacks will stun you long enough to cause everything in the map to converge on you and eat your face. Other times you find yourself breezing through bosses you kill in two hits. DLC basically just makes more levels and more enemies to fight, no new items, character options, or content except new classes to play. Game is often extremely buggy and chugs at times on my gaming desktop.Kind of fun if you can get a friend to play with, but then you have to go through the trouble of setting up port forwarding to host an online game.There's plenty of potential for good stuff here, but nothing in the game works the way it's supposed to. Really puts a damper on all of it. As other reviewers have noted, developers focus on putting out new DLC (which adds nothing substantial) rather than fixing the base issues with the game or finding some way to balance it. It's just one huge, hot ugly mess. Basically just a levelling/loot gathering treadmill where the treadmill keeps alternating between 90mph and 0.5mph without telling you what's going on.			"

												Hero Siege is a (paywalled) Hack 'n' Slash game with (pathetically)roguelike- & (loot grind) RPG elements. Annihilate hordes of (Bad AI) enemies, grow your (mostly pointless) talent tree, grind (player inventory and ui for) better loot and explore up to 6 (DLC) Acts enhanced with (THE MOST!!) beautiful Pixel Art graphics (2 hours with game maker studio can offer)! This game offers countless (a few) hours of (worthwhile) gameplay and up to 4 player online multiplayer (accurate)!If you play hardcore and you die, you can exit the game before it saves your death.  11/10 free flash games have nothing on this.

												I walk into the portal that takes you into the next part of the act, on NORMAL difficulty, I am level 144, and as I'm going through the animation I die due to a poison hidden behind the portal that takes 20% of my a Hp a tick, dang near every quarter of a second.  Ten out of ten. Please fix.(Edit March 4th, 2016)As an ammendment to the first part of this review I would like to say there was a time when I enjoyed this game, and that was when it was a mindless hack and slasher dungeon crawl type game, a little bit like diabolo, however with the mana updates and those being broken I cannot give praise to this game, nor can I recommend (I can recommend it on sale for cheap tho); however, with that said I still support the game (by that I mean buying the expansions), and hold out hope that it will get better then before the addition of mana, that they will fix the broken mana system, the lag and framerate issues, etc. But right now it isn't either fun or enjoyable, and it saddens me greatly. However if it's on sale for 60 cents go for it and buy it.			"

												Honestly, wait for the game to mature. I realize it's on sale at time of posting for 90% off. Maybe pick it up and don't play for a while. The whole game seems to be fluctuating on a regular basis, and I wouldn't say I've seen the most mature responses from the development team in their update posts, or forum activity.If you want to drop a couple bucks on it and romp around a little while, have fun, and hopefully you feel the cost-benefit works out in your favor. I'll probably play some more, but I can't say I plan on investing much time or effort into speccing a character until they work out how to apply balances, and stop rubberbanding.Additional notes at time of writing:In-game button prompts and icons are only for Xbox controller. Trying to play with keyboard alone is pretty terrible, and frankly controller controls are wonky due to it being setup to play as a wasd/arrow twin-stick style shooter.Controller vibration, which is on by default, seem to occur whenever you kill an enemy, or get hit yourself. Given the bullet hell and swarm nature of the game, your controller almost never stops rumbling.Melee attack animations on enemies do not seem to line up with visual effects, leading to confusion as to why you take damage.In-game HUD for inventory is unintuitive beyond belief. Current equips on the left, with a center column that displays other equal-typed items (such as other helmets) when you're hovering over an equip slot. While hovering over an equipped item, the far right panel displays that item's detailed description. Selecting into an equip slot lets you navigate the middle pane and swap an equipped item with the item you're selecting (note, the details pane remains pointed towards the currently equipped item). Comparing the actual stats between items requires an additional button press to change the middle navigation into a detail description of the inventory item that is not equipped. Sound confusing? It's equally weird to navigate on your own.Overall, feels like a slap-dash pixel-art port of diablo, and not really in a good way.I plan to keep an eye on it for a while, but it's certainly not great.

												This game is so insanely frustrating.I have played quite a lot, but still haven´t gotten past the first act, you´d think that leveling up would make a difference, no. You might as well be level 1 the entire game, since the stuff that will kill you will one-shot you even if you´re at full health of 2k. Should the first act really require a top-level character?No invinciblility-frames, ever.Numerous times I´ve been killed by arrows or something else the first frame when teleporting in to a new area, after killing a boss. Before I even have time to move, let alone react.Especially one boss (the one with the red beams in a rotating cross pattern) is damn near impossible to dodge if you´re not in a good spot to begin with, so he will kill you as soon as he appears on-screen, before you even can see what boss it is. Since you can´t fire diagonally, you´ll have to stand at a straight angle, bam you´re dead.I had this boss on wave 6, 5 times in a row, that didn´t feel very random.Forget about exploring the dungeons, they´re cramped to all hell, and (usually) filled with mobs with 8k health that hit like a ton of bricks. Forget about buying anything in the ""Treasure room"" anything other than stat boosts will be 1k gold or more, and from my experience those rooms only appear when you don´t have enough money.If you get a good relic or wo, you´ll breeze through wave after wave, until something random and unavoidable kills you, sending you back to square one. Very rarely do I die and not have a ""That´s bulls**t""-feeling.Played a little co-op with a friend, after 10 minutes he said "" I will never, ever play this again""What´s even cheaper than the 1-hit kills, randomness and outrageously OP dungeons is the developers adding online multiplayer as DLC, even if it doesn´t cost alot, that´s just weak. ""Fututre updates are only for the DLC"" wow, yeah this is getting uninstalled asapI can´t believe this game has a ""Very Positive"" rating.			"

Enemies are different but after a few hours of gameplay you will be bored watching their variations again and again.Multiplayer chars and single player chars are totally different. Like if you spend over9000 hours and get your hero to maximal level and then want to go multiplayer, you will be dissapointed because you must create new character and grind all your levels again. Game does not allow you to import your hero to multiplayer.Also, graphics are cool and detailed.Also, all DLCs require previous DLC.			"

												I bought this on sale for 7 friends and I, and after playing it for quite a few hours here I find this game turns into a grind.  I actually like the playstyle, reminds me of the old D2.  But the game has glitches that are frustrating when you are grinding.  I do not mind grinding but when the glitches make it impossible, its time to find a new game.  I played on a pc with my husband sitting next to me and we found the puddles are not the same size on our screens.  So one of us would die coming close without actually touching a puddle because it looked smaller.   There is no end to the game, no end to the ilevel as we can see.  Grind levels in wormholes to get better gear, to grind higher wormholes, to get better gear.  I feel we got our money worth with this many hours of play out of 50 cents, but replay value is zero, and the game is not worth it at full price.			"

												It was quite good! A decent mindless hack-and-slash with some cool classes and cute visuals....Then a recent patch completely obliterated the gameplay balance and changed 90% of the major mechanics, so now it's actually pretty terrible. There's some hope for the recent expansion or future patches to fix their mistakes, but right now the game is punishingly difficult relative to the actual amount of fun you can have overcoming that ""difficulty"" (which often amounts to unpredictable / unavoidable massive damage spikes, one shots, disables, and other fakeness).Bad game, don't buy, but if it seemed intriguing? Keep an eye on it, see if it shapes up.			"

												I liked when it first came out. It was fun to play at least twice a week me and my friends woud play it. But up-date after up-date and the game just went down the drain. To begin with i dont like rpg's that much. So when i seen what type of style it was like i didn't know if i would like it. Played about 30 mins of it and i loved it. I would play it when ever i had free time. But then the up-dates came that took all my stuff/added mana to the game and thats when it got ruined. So right now my game is just collecting dust in my steam library. If you are thinking about buying this game DON'T it was the best before the mana update. Your 6.00 USD are better spent else where than here. All you would get is a dissapointment.			"

												When I first met my cousin who lives on the other side of the world-it turned out we were both PC Gamers. He showed me Hero Siege for the for the first time and we both really enjoyed it. I buy the game a few months later. I realized there was no more attack speed available for upgrading and it was replaced by mana. I was a bit mad at first but decided to shrug it off because the game was still really good. I was enjoying playing as samuri because I bought all DLC that was available at the time. Later on Wrath of Mevius came out and I coughed up my 3$.Now everything was going fine until todays update. Now my samuri build can not be used. Hours of work crashed and burned because I can not use a single skill because of the overwhelming cost. Even the cheapest skill cost a few hundred more points then I have. They are gonna fix this in around a day I thought. But then I saw the ""act 8 under construction"" area. You are telling me they are making another DLC? When the already partailly broken game due to new updates, now unplayable because of todays is being ingnored because of a DLC we never asked for? Also when they promised Wrath Of Mevius is the last one. WHAT THE F***??? They took out, attack speed. They took out skill charging/cooldown system and replaced with mana. No one liked mana. Then today they took A HATED SYSTEM AND BROKE IT?? AND THEY DON'T TRY AND EVEN FIX PAST PROBLEMS BUT WORK ON MORE $ GRABBING DLCS WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE 4 FOR A SIMPLE ROUGE-LIKE? I'm sorry. I loved this game. Developers ruined it. Please, may a develper respond to this and address what I said here. That would be highly appriciated and the first step to fixing your currently broken game.EDIT 1:The develpors have realized their mistake, and are currently working on the problems created in the last couple of days.

												I was gifted this game a day or two ago by a friend, so my review is in no way biased from a point of feeling like I wasted my money.Pros:-Not very PC intensive, which means my craptop (only computer I have right now) can run it-Cute graphics, reminds me heavily of The Minish Cap (a zelda game)Cons:-You have to buy it, and there's still a lot of microtransactions. If the game was free, I would be able to let this slide - a company has to make money somehow - but you still have to pay, even if the price is absurdly low. Us gamers have made it very clear that we don't like this type of thing (looking at YOU, EA)-No in game tutorials or instructions or how to play option. Game literally just plops you down without telling you what it is your supposed to be doing-Awful voice acting that (as far as I can tell) can't be disabled-No HUD/GUI customization-No story. This one's just a personal preference, but it's still a con. Since the game appears to be a Diablo-esque game on the tin, I figured it would have at least some type of readily apparent story.-GUI is clunky and visibly unappealingOverall score: 2/10. Would not recommend.			"

												This game is extremely entertaining, but there are a number of bugs that you'll come across that are just extremely annoying. In multiplayer you'll lose your relics without any explanation. Friend dies when you're in a portal queue? Let me take them relics boy. It's random minor bugs like this that make the game annoying. One HUGE issue with the game is the multiplayer syncronization. What you see isn't what your friends see. When you're doing small tasks like dungeon puzzles, your teammates can mess that up really easily without knowing it, because instead of being a co-op task its four separate singleplayer tasks with invisible multiplayer interactions (wtf?)It's fun to play casually, but for the price you're better off getting a fully developed Loot RPG.I would recommend thsi to the casual player.For players such as myself who love to dive deep into an Loot Hack and Slash RPG, well; Classes are unbalanced to a large degree (scalings on some characters are non existant)Classes you purchase through DLC are often underwhelming (I payed extra pls gimme more)There are tons of glitches and bugs that you'll find annoying.Multiplayer is lots of fun, but the bugs really ruin it.There is no ingame Archive of relics. Anything would help, a log that keeps track of the relic and the description maybe.The main personal thing I'm salty about is the amazon. Why the hell do none of her skills scale? Wtf?			"

												Do I recommend Hero Siege?Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh No, not really.The gameplay is decent, a little hard to start, but okay nonetheless. The issues are the following:PriceOk, FIRST OF ALL, I do not have all of the DLC. Why? Because I'm not keen on spending, what? $3~$5 on another arena that has similar layouts as other arenas. Pardon me, they are called ""Acts."" You know, that name developers give to parts of a STORY and not what seems like parts of a continent. Is there a lore or story at all? Yeah, sure, there are games that don't really have a plot where one isn't needed, such as survival games, but there are exceptions (Starbound). But plot can make a game more intriguing while you are bashing away at baddies or farming or whatever. What am I reviewing again? Oh that's right, price. There are uncanny purchases when shopping for Hero Siege. $3 for a new character (and maybe an act), then for $2 more you can get ♥♥♥♥ing cosmetics that you have to look for in their terrible menus. 5 of the DLCs that cost $5 are just ♥♥♥♥ing cosmetics, seriously. (And yes, I do know that people buy it to support the developers, but if you want to have some way to support a game, just have a damn patreon. Steam gets a portion of the purchases and sales won't help.) I thought TF2 was the king of♥♥♥♥♥♥faced cosmetics, but atleast in TF2, when you spend $5 dollars on a cosmetic, you can ACTUALLY see detail instead of a pixelized version of it. I bought 2 DLCs and already spent more than what the game's worth, and I bought this before the price drop from $10, then again, I got it on sale for 95% off or something.BugsGotta love crashing, am I right? It is unbearable, the creatures will sometimes spawn outside the boundaries and their pathfinding won't update, so I'll be walking around trying to look for something that's stopping me from advancing to the next wave. Heck, sometimes crypts, dungeons, statues of my bum will spawn outside the boundaries[steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net], just ♥♥♥♥ing out of my reach since you get teleported to the middle of the arena if you try to pass a gate. One gate teleports you if you just touch it. It's really funny to walk into a dungeon and get smeared to the wind because your character is too underleveled. Sure, melee characters have sort of an AoE attack that causes them to hit behind them sometimes, but even with the melee attack, you still get ground up and used on salads and plants as fertilizer.Here's a joke, what happens when your friend crashes in a multiplayer game with you, but you are still connected? Their character turns into you[steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net] and you have control over it while you are still in the same area.Too long so you didn't read itA buggy game with overpriced, useless DLCs.

												This game crosses the line from being inspired to trying too hard to mimic the success of another game. It's clear to anyone that's played or heard about Blizzard's Diablo series that this game takes many things from it, Diablo III in particular. Just from my limited amount of time playing it, I found that it steals too many things from Diablo III for me to look the other way. The rather pathetic copying of material disgusts me, but the overall product coupled with the total lack of creativity makes me unable to enjoy just about anything about this game. I understand that the developers' goal of wanting to make games that harkon to the legendary games of old, but, like I said, this crosses the line from the land of the inspired into lazy money-grab territory.Diablo font? Check. Diablo's names for difficulties (Normal, Nightmare, Hell, Inferno)? Check. Diablo III's champion/elite modifier of spawning stationery rotating lasers? Check. Secret level named and themed around a form of livestock? Check. Treasure goblins that function serve the same purpose as DIII's? Check. What's worse is that I painfully predicted that they would open a portal and disappear if I was unable to kill them, and as soon as it did as I predicted, I sighed in anger. All of these painfully obvious thefts, on top of a game that has very random spikes in difficulty, very little room for skill to play a factor, and poorly designed random elements make for a game that'll also steal your mood and sour it. Anyone who tries to compare this game to The Binding of Isaac does nothing but shame Edmund McMillen's game. The Binding of Isaac has a much better system in place to allow for players' skills to be developed while providing an environment of adequate pace with well-scaling challenge and the expected mystery of randomized rooms.

												It took me 17 hours to realize the entirety of this game is done in the first 15 minutes. I had a goal set in mind though.I tried to make it to lvl 150. Through my minions, enemies, chests, and special areas spawning outside of bounds and in fences, walls, torches, etc. Through the random take aways of all your items. Through the crap bosses that take LITERALLY less than a second to beat if you play halfway right, I made it to lvl 124, Inferno, last wave next to the final boss, stacked with relics (Even though he's gonna last five seconds anyway).Screen freezes, but the audio plays the sound of your character in their death gurgles.But this is a ""finished"" game.4/10 More repetitive than a facebook game.

												My god, the game creators just keep on nerfing everything in this game. So many things have got nerfed to the point were you are under powerd. Max relics are now only 20 instead of being in the 30's, life steal has been reduced to 2.5! WTF. Also mana per hit has gone down to 1 from 5... Life steal has gotten nerfed, you now can lose your WH key from starting a new season. This is ♥♥♥♥ing insane, they are just nerfing everything so hard to the point were the game isnt even fun anymore. The bosses have gotten nerfed, some of the rare enemys have gotten nerfed, a ton of items and relics have gotten nerfed, selling items for gold has gotten nerfed! But they did increase the damage that level 1 players do... which didnt even need the buff. The damage was perfectly fine in my eyes, I would be able to take out a enemy in about 4 hits. Also the skills did great damage as well, but the buffed the damage on level 1 characters. This makes no sense...			"

												Edit: Multiplayer has been added for free so most below is now moot. Haven't been able to return to game since, but I'm not going to change the negative review because the fact remains that the game was sold in a 4 pack with multiplayer locked behind DLC, so this old review should serve as an indicator of the developers you may or may not be dealing with. READ THIS BEFORE BUYINGIf you  are buying this game to play multiplayer, don't bother. Not only do you have to pay another $3 to buy the DLC in order to access the online component, but the servers are so awful it doesn't even work once you do. I saw this game on sale, bought the 4 pack to gift to three other friends and essentially just provided them with a bill.Why is this even offered in a 4 pack if you're buying a game you can't play with others? At the very least the 4 pack should be complete editions of the game.			"

												Most of what you are reading is basically ""MANA UPDATE AND ITEM WIPE RUINED IT"". Now this consistency might sound circlejerky and immature at first examination. But it is completely true, and it is why a game I used to play for multiple hours at a time, I can now only muster 15-20 minutes of before I drop it for at least a month. It hurts that a game that I was once addicted too, that I've bought all the DLC for, now is completely unsatisfying. Please don't let the ""Very Positive"" label fool you, those positive reviews are outdated.Early game:Basically a top down fast hack slash with RPG elements that took a lot of design choices from The Binding of Isaac (I highly recommend TBOI, go play any version of that instead, it is what you are looking for if you like a game like this.) You would fight five waves and a boss in areas, and after five areas you would move on to an act boss and finally the next act. Dungeons and shops have the chance to spawn after each wave in each area. (This hasn't changed) Each character has a skill tree and stats to apply. Among the character tree are both passive and active skills with level requirements. Active skills could always be activated whenever off cooldown, encouraging expirimentation with how they combo together and how best to use them in sequence. The skills are binded a bit akwardly, but can be gotten used to, taking up 1234 slots and not slots closer to the WASD buttons like Q, E, R, and F, or something similar.  Honestly the game took some grinding, as even though skill and stat points applied are permanent, they serve more to augment which of your characters stats or skills does end up more prominent than others. Relics found in dungeons, bought in shops, or picked up at the end of areas heavily help your character, giving certain passive or active skills, or even just certain stat boosts. The actual combat was pretty fun in a lot of ways, so the difficulty due to health/armor constraints disappeared the longer you play or the farther you get. An inventory with items [still constricted to your current run I think?] was introduced. It didn't have too much depth, but it was just starting and there were some items that made getting skills above your level requirement possible, so it was pretty nice. It doesn't pause the game for it though, so you have to be fast. It is made easy by the side by side comparison of the currrent and new item, and the simplicity of the choice of either replacing or dropping. Definitely wasn't perfect, and didn't have the greatest balance, but it still managed to be fun, at least for me, so w/e. :) Multiplayer was in development, quite buggy, but it was exciting to think that online co-op was coming.Changes:I had dropped the game for a bit due to other games grabbing my attention (Dota 2, TF2, Half-Life series, etc.), nothing I mentioned before really forced me away. But the combination of all this new stuff is ....eh. SUDDENLY MANA. Not only does this add a constraint to gameplay that maintained a lot of its fun due to fast combos of spells for some classes or spammable spells for others, mana costs grow exponentially for all skills per points put into them. This means gameplay is nearly permanently slower forever. Fun crashes to lowest levels yet. Pre-existing characters suffer the most, as the  more skill points they have, the more trouble they have now that they have nowhere near enough points into this new attribute that controls mana. Experience for levels also still grows exponentially it seems, so it isn't easy to grind the stat points needed.Items you had are wiped as the inventory is complicated. You can hold onto items now however, you can't just walk over items to pick them up (this might of been how it was in the original actually so scratch that?), the inventory controls are now clunkier and laggy to accomadate, and you still aren't paused, meaning you can still die while struggling to navigate your even more complicated interface. You can't just add more button presses to just equip an item without allowing the player more time to do so. This can be circumvented with only fiddling with your inventory at the end of areas, but it still is slow and a bit frustrating. From what I've noticed, the grinding and difficulty issues haven't been really fixed, but I can hardly play this for any comparable duration, so what do I know? I guess I only have my complete disinterest in the game as of now to control my decision making  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ KappaMultiplayer is a bit more playable, but there are still many issues.... yuck.There is now a town warp that helps with reaching end game content which might help some with grinding and has some odd stuff (A beach ball and a probable boss rush maybe?). Has some pale excuses for NPC's, and an acheivement for not ignoring this new yet bare bones looking feature. Could work if I could stand playing this for longer...?Okay, I'm definitely being repetitive with how it isn't as enjoyable, but it is a main part of why I liked this so much. The balancing is awkward, the controls are a bit weird, and the grinding has always been a bit of tedium. But there was also the satisfying times of sequencing or spamming spells, and finding more and more relics to majorly augment my run kept me hooked despite it not being a ""great game"". This was a guilty pleasure of mine. But I now I feel with these changes I've been pushed back into the grinding, and it will be even harder for me to find enjoyment in it to the same extent due to the limitations of the new game. I mean, I haven't even had personal experience with the apparently horrible staff. (All I know is that from the time I followed the creator's twitter he was often quite bratty) Play something else. Save yourself the time.			"

												What wasn't told here: This is not a full game. Despite the 7 portals (acts) at the town, this game has only 4 acts and then it finishes and unlocks nightmare mode and so on. You will not fight Damian, the villain on the trailer, unless you buy the DLCs (I saw at least 3). There is also a 8 act described as ""under construction"".There are 12 classes, but 5 are locked due it's exclusiveness.There are 8 NPCs on town, but only 2 will be usefull for trade purposes. The others are probably from DLC's quests.I bought it on a sale, VERY VERY cheap. The normal price is just unworthy. Wait for a sale if you are curious.Other topics:Gameplay: It's just a regular hack n' slash/shooter game in 8 bits style. Attack anything that moves (and also what doesn't), collect loot, upgrade, repeat all three steps forever. You can't shoot diagonally (what is awful). As you level up, the screen gets more and more crowded with enemies and traps. The AI is dumb and monsters get stucked on walls or outside the playable zone.Story: It doesn't has. There is a couple of NPCs just for trade purposes.Customization: New gear don't change character's appearance, there is a shop outside the game, where you can buy gear just for sake of style. The skill tree doesn't allow character building, it's linear.That is it.			"

												Game concept is nice but...- Enemy hitboxes are ridiculous small (usually the enemy hitbox is around one third of the enemy sprite, so you see your ranged character shots passing through the enemy and you have to adjust pixel by pixel your position for it to hit)- Game map is full of obstacles and enemies come from all sides but your ranged attacks can only be 4-directional (ie: no diagonal shot)- UI is completely awful (seriously, it's hard to see an UI so bad)- Basicaly no explanation of anything. You just have to figure everything by yourself- Multiplayer is slow, buggy, breaks often and almost never does it provides error messages			"

												Poor game in my opinion.Hero Siege isn't worth your money, even for 1.49 usd.The combat, regerdless of the class you pick, is boring and repetitive. You just walk backwards in a small, square level trying to fight enemies by holding down the same button/key, occasionally using a special ability. And every level is like this, with a boss battle once in awhile.The game is just an android app badly ported to PC. The menus are clearly optimized for phone screens, and look horribly bulky on PC screens.But the worst part of this game is trap spawning. I keep getting killed when I'm walking around due to a trap spawning under my feet. I have no control over this, and it makes for a pretty bad rage quit.2/10, would not reccomend.If I could give three words to describe this game, they would be boring, repetitive, and aggrivating.

												The game was fun. The key is WAS. When I first bought the game I thought it was super fun. It was challenging, it was not based around gear and more so of the skill of your character. Then the game became less challenging and everything started to spiral downward from there. The dev messed around with it way too much so I cannot recommend the game anymore. If I would have bought it today I would refund it same day. It is a completely different game then it was when I bought it about a year ago. It is more worth while to spend your money on food then this game.			"

												By answering No in the question if I would recommend this, don't be mistaken, I'm not saying that Hero Siege is a bad game.The reasons that I do not recommend it is that it is not a complete product, the game still evolves and feels like an early access, even in core mechanics (by the time Im writing this, its about a month since they added mana as resourse to all characters). Quite many stuff need further work, eg: many maps are fixed, meaning while some early maps have random elements and feel that are generated others in later acts are fixxed and no matter what, eg: the lava river pattern, will always be the same). Heroes start as weaklings and eveolve into gods, doing more that enough damage to clear the monsters, but you will find occasionaly the random monter that may/can/will oneshot you, with you having little to no resposne to that, even while you are trampling over the hordes of enemies. Bosses still need a lot of work since they die quite fast and few big monsters can be more durable than hem. Lastly a big negative is the dlc policy, given that extra acts/heroes and a multyplayer game mode are part of dlcsThat been said I do enjoy Hero siege (given that I've played quite some time) but having the knowledge about the game I have now i wouldn't probably buy it. If you do love almost-meaningless hack n slash with rng elements then by all means I do recommend hero siege.			"

												Definitely worth the less than dollar I paid for it. Full price, probably not.I'm not entirely sure what the point is. The story is quite weak. The gameplay is just wave after wave of enemies with a few bosses and dungeon instances thrown in. But every time you do an instance, the entire world regenerates when you come back out. If you wanted to dive into both of those dungeons that have appeared, you're out of luck. Maybe I just got lucky on my third guy, but I played for 3 hours straight and the game was laughably easy. It took less time to get the mini-bosses (which you encounter after every handful of waves and at the end of dungeons) down to 0 HP than it did for the game to do the death animation (they have a drawn out death animation where lightning strikes all over and an angelic choir sings and the boss goes ""AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!"" for like 10 seconds).The gameplay is fun, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The ""rouge-like"" aspect of it is a stretch. You just lose some of your stuff. ""With RPG Elements"" means there's XP, Leveling, Skill Points, and an inventory. The inventory is confusing. The control scheme is weird and inconsistent (F is the action button? But sometimes you have to press Enter... Wat?). Um... the good stuff about it is that I sank a bunch of time into it without really feeling it very much (except for the ""too easy"" bit).It seems quite a bit of content is missing from the base game. Evidently, the DLC portions of the game are each worth at least 50% of the base game cost even though it doesn't seem like each adds 50% more game. I haven't purchased them so take that with a grain of salt. There's enough wrong with the base game that it didn't seem worth it to dish out $10 (full price) for DLC (that's more than the game!).The multiplayer was down and I didn't want to make an account with these people, so I didn't experience that aspect of it. Maybe multiplayer is where the game really shines, but from what I played the game just wasn't compelling enough for me to want to keep giving it my time. For that reason, and because of it's faults, I can't recommend you buy it at full price.5/10 because I want my roguelikes to kill me. And because it lacks polish where it counts (balance, core game systems, multiplayer servers...).			"

												I keep WANTING to like this game. But every time I get a few hours in, something goes wrong, and now I'm just getting rid of it.I've played the (ludicrously buggy) multiplayer with 2-4 people. The interface is like something youd see from the EARLY 90s, both in the multiplayer and the game in general. I haven't been on the forums or heard all this dev drama, so I know nothing of the vindictiveness, but the amateurish programming? Oh yeah.Several fun ways you can die (losing all the relics youve worked hours for) include:- 1-shot instantly. As a ""death recap"" all you have is a black screen and the template pixel of the projectile that killed you. One of the recent patch notes I read said this should not be possible from full health. It's happened twice in two days.- Game crash for some sort of bug. Still. After over 2 years, there's no getting returned to lobby or menus, just time for good ole task manager.- Popping a chest on a water level, then getting chain-rooted in place by potions until you run out of breath, because picking up a potion takes priority over moving or BREATHING.- Getting locked in place while trying to pick up an on-use relic as it constantly switches with your current on-use relic, much like potions.After hours spent building up your temporary stats and relics, the amount of times I've thought: ""ah, okay that was good progress, I'm done playing for now,"" is maybe 10% of the time. The other 90%? Great, another bug. Screw this I'm done.Now, I'm just done for good. Pretty sure a friend got me this game after buying a 4-pack for something like $3 on a sale. There are plenty of cheap toys you can buy for less than a dollar, and this game fits right in with them.			"

												I suggest that you all stay away from this game if you are thinking about playing multiplayer. It's by far the most bugged game i have ever played. Sometimes stats dont load, Sometimes stats are randomized, Sometimes u randomly die, Some things are invisible and will kill you in 1 hit, Sometimes your entire character gets deleted (Happend to me at level 80), Sometimes your character dies when you logout etc. I can go on for days.

												I can't reccomend this game...I bought this game thinking to myself it would be similar to ""Diablo 3"" but more pixel like. after having played the game for 30 min or so, i found myself rather bored.The game revolves around slaying enemies, receiving xp to level up. And collecting potion and other trinkets to further upgrade your character. Quite simple.So you would think they would make the slaugter of foes to be enjoyable. Considering that the game is about ""kill, collect, repeat""""NO!""My one and only issue with this game is the combat.It persist with walking backwards while shooting at the enemy, and accasanoly dodge fire balls or lasers. Thats it.There are a variety of different classes. most of which are dlcsBut that doesn't change how you play whatsoever. Whether you choose the Pyromancer who shoots fire balls and meteorites. Or the Nomad with a giant (badass) sword and a towel around his head. The game will still persist of walking backwards, and slowly chip away health from the cluster of enemis who walks aimlesly in a straight line towards you(Bought this game while it was 90% off. and i still asked for a refund)+Pros+You can buy sweet♥♥♥♥♥hats and customize your character +There's full controller support+It has co-op and massively multiplayer+Visualy, it's a very deasent looking game (i'm a sucker for retro looking games)-Cons-Overall combat. Considering it's a ""hack and slash"" game and the only thing you are gonna do is battle hords of foes. that ain't a good sign------------------------------------UPDATE!!!------------------------------------Recently several of my friends have bought this game due to ""Steam Summer Sale""Bless Gabe, I know.Playing this with another 2-3 buds Is actually quite enjoyable.i still belive in what i've written above. but multiplayer, it's pretty alright(ps: After i refunded, One of my lads gifted me the game. Don't know if the intention was to make me happy or purposely making me mad.Considering I refunded the game and all. but thanks to ""you"", you've changed my opinion about this game slight tincy wincy bit.So thank you ""min lill willy""you know who ""you"" are ^^			"

												- Paid dlcs are pretty much the only way to unlock more content. (greedy devs?)- Multiplayer is broken in many ways and probably will always be. (Unplayable, trust me.)- Interface is uh.. I don't know.- Again, multiplayer sucks.  Lots of bugs that's been there for months.. don't buy this just for multiplayer. You will regret.Singleplayer is great tho. I had lots of fun with it.Want mainly multiplayer? Don't buy it. I also highly recommend you to not pay full price for it.			"

												Avoid like the plague, incompetent devs break the game further and further with each new patch.Turned it into endless brainless grind, everyone just switching from one ridiculously overpowered class to the next and each patch is delayed for 2 weeks for ""testing and making sure everything works"" after which everything doesn't work. The game just keeps getting worse and worse the more they toy around with it.The game has a hardcore mode, use this only if you don't mind dropping dead randomly due to bugs, crashes and lag.EDIT:  Came back to the game after half a year, game still sucks. Bugs still not fixed after half a year, only 2-3 classes are actually viable to play, more cosmetic♥♥♥♥♥♥added to blind the stupid masses into thinking it's being worked on.As of this moment the EU servers have been down for more than 2 days but devs are too busy playing Overwatch to fix it, that says all there is to say about this game.Even free this game is too expensive for what it offers.

												Binding of Isaac-like random powerups, level progression and hack'n'slash, sounds great!Too bad the basic gameplay is crazy repetitive and the feeling of progression is not there with the current skill/attribute system. Example: The Viking has a skill Stoneskin unlocked somewhere around level 18, which gives you 1% chance to ""gain a massive boost"" to armor. This massive boost is 5 points of armor, which translates into 1% damage reduction. The skill doesn't mention when does this happen, nor how long does the effect last. Most of the skills and attributes are equally underwhelming and most of the information is either hidden or wrong (Pirate lvl1 skill at rank 1 claims to do 25000 damage, lvl28 skill at rank 1 claims to do around 40, neither is even near correct).The main thing you're collecting is money, but the only place to spend it appears randomly (high chance that you'll get too much money to spend). Most of the items sold are just minor stat gains for this particular run. When your Pirate has a good chance to shoot a cannonball for 1000 damage, you really don't care about that +5 strength which would give you about 2 damage per attack.Chances are, that the game is balanced for ""end game"", but I can't seem to find the fun in trying to reach there. Was fun for a few hours, could've been way better (and apparently has been, if other reviews can be believed).TL;DR: Your generic minion available to all classes hits harder than you. If you don't care about any details how the game progression works and like hacking away, this game might still suit your needs. "

												I do not reccommend this game at all, unless it goes on sale for less then $4. The so-called ""twin-stick, gauntlet style/diablo/binding of isaac/etc"" gameplay is not at all relateable, and the game turns into a hold an attack direction and wait for either an ability to go off cooldown (every 15 or so seconds) or have an ability proc an additional effect when you hit an enemy with a basic attack.When you level up in this game, you get a tiny bit of health, and a tiny bit of damage. The game jokingly gives you the option of increasing Health, Attack Speed, Defense, and Damage. You can dump every point into damage, defense or attack speed, and you will notice zero difference. What kind of damage increment is a FRACTION of one point of damage, when monsters have increasingly high scaling health in the thousands and tens of thousands within a few hours of gameplay? What is 0.01% damage protection and attack speed?? Why would they have increments so damn minor they don't even matter?? At least with the health upgrade, you can maybe survive another hit with enough points... but therein lies the next problem.This game has no difficulty curve, especially on one player. Eventually, you will be put in a situation where an attack is unnavoidable, because a projectile/enemy ability will FLASH across the screen (or off-screen) and hit you, which causes immediate death . Worse yet, enemies are capable of stunning and freezing you, even some common enemies, and they may continue to keep you locked in place permanantly until death. Virtually every boss in the game has an ability that kills you in one hit from what I've found in my three hours of gameplay. It's so horribly painful to spend so much time grinding, just to be one-shot by something you couldn't avoid. Bosses are not fun to fight. ...With all that being said, the reason why I -do- like this game, is because it can be fun if you are looking for some silly mindless gameplay, especially if you are the sort that likes to grind for items. Don't get me wrong, the game is still horrible through-and-through, but random luck streaks are always exciting. But the time and price investment simply do not outweigh the issuesOn a final note, multiplayer is still broken. So I guess it's permanantly single-player for a lot of folks in any case.			"

Deceptive and shady as hell to not have it clearly marked as such.Seeing as I only got this for the multiplayer aspect, it's now useless.

												Needs dlc to be actually played. Got it in some sort of bundle. Idled the cards. Would uninstall again 5/7EDIT:Oh,a developer response! wow! Jokes aside then, since this is a hack and slash game where ultimatively the end game represents gearing up your character to the maximum level, not finishing up the levels. For me at least.While the game does a good job at hooking you up to this, just the idea that i would have to pay for dlc's to reach what i want from this game is off-putting.I understand that dlc's are a productive marketing strategy and I have nothing against that. Coming from a dota 2 background, i like to have everything available right when i play the game, not behind another paywall. I personally think dlc and ingame purchases are best used for cosmetics and not actual content. And i did pay for compendiums and cosmetics in dota 2 because i felt the game is worth supporting.That is the main reason i don't want to play the game right now. Perhaps when i see the dlc bundled in some kind of steam sale and get them for cheap i will want to play the game :) I am a fan of hack and slash games, ever since Diablo 1 hooked me to the genre.Just to note, regarding my review, it is supposed to be for fun, i cannot objectively review a game i did not actually play.

It's incredibly frustrating and I don't understand how a game could have so many problems and be deemed 'completed', I have played games in Beta that run better than this and they're not just indie graphics with basic commands.Also, it's definitely not my computer/internet and as I understand many MANY others have had the exact same issues.It's a great game otherwise (when I  actually play and I'm not swearing in frustration at another white screen) and hope the the developers fix these issues before putting out any more DLC.

												This game has an incredible amount of potential. That said, IT IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT by far.  To begin, I have the DLC so I can't tell if the release has changed the fact that YOU MUST BUY DLC FOR MULTI-PLAYER.  If it has that's an awesome improvement, since when I bought the game opened to play it I found myself curious as to where the ♥♥♥♥ the multi-player listed had vanished to.  It isn't abandoned yet like a lot of seemingly money hungry indie devs, there is always updates. A lot of people are complaining about difficulty, I found how hard the game was to be refreshing. Sure you can be one shot, you're not supposed to get hit.  The problems start with the updates ALWAYS breaking something far worse than the original problem.  At first the bugs I was getting in multi-player were things like random CTD's or Random server disconnects. Things like the clicking through the server list would put you into a random server instead of the one you wanted.  Useless Skins since they don't show up (you'll see it but others will not) in multi-player, Glad I paid for the collectors edition.  Also dungeons and traps were a little misplaced and unreachable for anyone other than the host (It really sucked seeing a trap in one area thinking you're safe and your buddy being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because on his screen you just ran full speed into a trap).  Also various Item bugs surrounding relics. My buddy and I decided it was a game worth looking into after some updates.  A month later we hopped back in and seen the  Server list was fixed and got our hopes up from there.  We begin playing and (He's hosting) I'm running around and BAM 'm dead nothing around wave 1. I'm like ok must have been a trap I'm just bad. Happens again and again and my buddy is resurrecting me saying "" Dude wtf why do you keep standing on top of these traps?""  Turns out the misplaced traps are now invisible.  On to the updated dungeons.  Go into the dungeons buddy hits said button to activate said bridge runs across and the bridge never activates for me (tried several different dungeons activation only registers on hosts game client).  The skins now don't even show up for you (Extra glad I bought the collectors edition >.>). I think the worst part is that the Dev. actively responds to the community claiming that he has fixed something that is still very much broken or worse.  Or that his companies facebook is consistently updated concerning his league of legend rage.  Also seeing how much he rages about league of legends and looking at this almost $10 game on my steam really, really pisses me off. Plus I think he has got to be pretty horrible like silver ranking cause it is so much rage.			"

												Game is worth trying if you don't know what to do with your 5 euro.The idea of mixing Diablo and The binding of isaac (2 of my favourite games) should make this game one of the best retro/rpg/roguelike game on Steam. BUT it's also the most bugged game I've ever played. It shouldn't be ever released, it's almost unplayable. It should be in closed beta stage. Even MInecraft in ALPHA had less bugs than this.Unfortunatelly it seems that Develpopers don't give a f. and prefer to make DLC's to make more money they don't deserve. They forgot that first of all they should FINISH the basic version of the game and THEN start making DLC's or whatever they want.As long as devs won't fix bugs in this game definitely not gonna buy any DLC's. Maybe someday.. ehh hope the mother of fools..			"

												Meh.I'm surprised by the ""very positive"" reviews.You grind and grind the same area box over and over until you get the right class level, and get the right items on this life to beat the boss then move on to the next stage. You can't shoot diagonally, while the enemies can. The power selection for each class is pretty limited. (edit added: However the variety of classes, all with different skillsets, is pretty good and have nice flavor. This is one of the highlights of the game.) Wait until a sale and the game with all DLC is a couple bucks. It's underwhelming but not ""bad"". Mediocre. (edit added: Fun for a few minutes every now and then. Something I might play in between other games when I'm burned out on my other arcade-style/rogue-like games. This review is based on playing single splayer only. I cannot speak about aspects of multiplayer.)Plus the devs and moderators on the forum are the type to delete posts and love controlling others.I guess they got tired of people questioning their decisions and just deleted all replies and locked the thread.

												If you want something to play that'll pass the time or crave a game with the classic RPG feeling to it, then Hero Siege is the perfect game for you. It's, in my opinion, a fantastic little gem of a game. Gameplay wise it feels as though the developer stuffed Diablo’s more reserved brother into a blender with The Binding of Issac, and added in a pinch of Killing Floor for good measure. In more sensible terms, it’s got a great number of rogue-like and RPG elements to it. There are a number of different levels, ranging from forests to snowy tundras, deserts and many more. At the end of each of these levels you can collect random pieces of loot, or relics as they’re called, which grant you varying stats and abilities. These relics come in four different flavours; weapon enhancing ones, which, as the name suggests, enhances your weapon giving it extra powers. For example an item called the Basilisk's Tooth makes it so that you have a 2% chance to turn enemies to stone. There are also passive relics as well, which improve your character’s skills. One example is the Cactus, which periodically spawns a cactus on the nearest enemy. The third relic type is active, which, after pressing the use key, will activate the effect of the relic. The Candy Crusher, one example of an active relic, launches candy in a ring around the player that explodes on landing. And the last relic type is orbiting, which float around the player and help during fights. One example is the Almighty Fedora which rapidly shoots projectiles.All these and many more can be obtained by progressing through the game, and surviving the large waves of enemies the game throws at you.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Talking about enemies, there are a large number of different types. Ranging from axe throwing skeletons to towering yeti-like beasts. Also there are several “elite” type enemies that have particular skills that happen once they die. For example creating a large laser that spins in a circle or an X shaped explosion, which both appear where the “elite” was slain.There are also a number of RPG elements in the game too. For one, there are unique skill trees for each class, providing varying passive and active abilities, depending on which class you choose out of the possible seven, or ten (depending on whether you own the DLC). They also all have their own sort of personalities and quotes as well.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphically the game looks a lot like your typical indie, rogue-like affair. But it fits nicely. The characters are easily distinguishable from each other and the varying levels all look pixel pretty with their individual themes and settings. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the game feels enjoyable to play. The classes and their skills vary enough for the game to be replayed time and time again. Not to mention the seemingly endless number of experience levels you can rack up on a single class. The enemies vary in difficultly, depending on the level, and the boss battles, for the most part, feel fairly satisfying once they eventually kick the bucket.To Conclude, I’d say that Hero Siege is worth a play, whether it’s a rogue-like or an RPG you're after, or just a quick bit of fun. It’s a satisfying game to play and well worth a go. Good Day!			"

 When Binding of Isaac meets Diablo TLDR; Hero Siege is incredibly fun alone or with a group of friends. I played non-stop and even though some relics are coming from The Binding of Isaac, Hero Siege is a great alternative to some of his most serious contenders.  Pros: + Replay value+ Price (less than 1$!)Cons: - Short-lived- Servers are really unstable- Class seems quite unbalanced General : 7/10Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtK  Steamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamship ----------------------------------------------I've only played for a day or two and I became an instant-fan. This rogue-like is also mixed with elements of Hack n' Slash. Very quickly, if you manage to get passed the bugged servers you will have to pick a class, some are free, some aren't.You end up in a map and have to kill monsters for 5 waves and then a mini-boss will follow. There are going to be traps, chests, small dungeons or events will happen during your adventure.With the same idea in mind than The Binding of Isaac, you will drop Relics that make you stronger and will lose them upon death.This is the main idea of the game, and you repeat for a few acts. The difficulty can be adjusted and will let you have a good challenge in hands.Overall, this is a very cheap, cool game that ends up being super addictive !General : 7/10Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtK  Steamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamship  "

												I got this for rather cheap so luckly it paid for itself but at its regular price just be careful.In this game you fight waves after waves of monsters using a rather scant diablo like set up, and hillariously terrible voice acting which is a plus (though judging by the lumberjack with a chainsaw, that may be intentional). The monsters generally just walk into you and deal their damage, they don't attack you so to speak. After completing enough of a stage certain features will open up such as dungeons and level features, inside they are usually puzzles, boss fights, and trap guantlets.Each character has about 4 action skills (mostly attacks) and usually a few buffs that either enhance their attack or one of their skills. Some of the characters are pretty creative with their attack skills and some feel oddly basic. Don't expect long and complicated trees.But the shortcommings of this game make itself apperant. Some abilities do not have an obvious use but most of all what should be a serious test of skill. Difficult enemies almost always have a death attack that is difficult to avoid, in otherwords to make the game tougher they intentionally try to get a few cheap hits in. There is no real inventory to speak of... You can do the dungeons but they might just outright kill you with no hope for you to win. Collecting potions is the most deadly thing you can do as you will stand still for a second, enough time to be hit by a trap or boss.Add in that this game has a cash shop, and you will see where they will be trying to earn some cash off of you... and a lot in this game costs crystals and they constantly have it up in front. For example renaming your character costs crystal and respecing your character costs crystal. You can earn crystal in game but don't expect to earn anywhere close to enough. You start off with a generous amount, assuming my 750 was typical, so getting to the end of the game and then respecing might be a good idea. The fact that 50% of the options menu is cash shop (with bright flashing crystals showing to draw your eyes)... can get on your nerves.All in all this game is alright... but there are a lot of diablo-like games and even ""Waves and waves of enemies you must kill"" and even ""trap guantlet"" games that do this genre so much better that even for the price I got it for (a dollar) I can't recommend it.However, this feels like a game that I dislike but that others will enjoy. So please consult other reviews.			"

												Obviously, the game is not finished and very raw. Likewise, I certainly feel absolute disrespect of developers to their players.First and foremost, the game is full of bugs. At every step, at every option you can run into a bug and lost hours of playing, joy, and temper. A lot of crushes, disappearing of items, random generation collisions, menu bugs, ...The second thing is gameplay dis-balance. In fact, there are no any balance. It's a mess of features, monsters, skills, ... Some of skills are totally useless, some of character's features can easily kill any monster or boss. Items are random and it means that in some cases you won't have keys to open a door and no chance to get it. Likewise, you can occasionally get extremely powerful item in the beginning or completely loss some of skills (for example, speed in two times).The third one is the graphic. Some people name it pixel. But it is not a pixel. It's a collection of schoolboy scribbles. There are no any style, clutter of colours, discrepancy everywhere, total disproportion of everything, ... This mess really hurts my eyes.The fourth one is the music and the sound. I suppose it's personal, but I couldn't play with music and sound of the game. I turned it off. It's hard for me. I know a few people who like music like that, but it's not my cup of tea.From my perspective, the best description of the game is the trash. Total Trash. (it's not bad or good, maybe you like trash)I really tried to understand the game, but I failed. Sorry.			"

												本体+鲤鱼王DLC原价党表示转投差评游戏频繁更新，更新到几乎没有原样，我并不是玩了半天突然嫌弃。时隔半年我再重新捡起它的时候让我觉得，不仅一心二用，还逐渐变得快餐，整个游戏简直就是不伦不类。+比旧版本相比已经丰富了很多元素，例如装备、地牢和洞穴的随机生成、装备、丰富地图布局等等，再也不是当初那种简单的手游移植。+练级时候先苦后甜的感觉+自带宝物图鉴+不会再纯粹留意怪物是否走到你的身边，怪物有各自的的攻击方式和附加效果-以我个人经验，60级之后整个游戏变得很无聊，除了刷就是刷，成就内容还是要你刷-你获得的宝物、药水大部分只是换个面孔给你增加各项属性。更何况有些宝物真的没什么用，道具复活跟手动重启没有两样，但是上次拿到的宝宝还存在，lol wtf？-更新了快两年bug依旧不断变化机关乱摆放，额外地图挑战失败code error，金币兑换蓝宝石的商人点开对话后无法切换继续毫无征兆的code error -连装备也是给你加各项属性，种类甚至多种多样到懒得画细节-DLC地图和本体地图相连，买多少DLC你就该打完多少才能解锁下一个模式-居然可以中途返回基地，我看已经没心思做rougelike了-这个就算了，你为了让别人买你的dlc，每个dlc画一个人物立绘，我很是佩服有些东西真的还不如旧版本，不过你花2块钱（92off）体验网游般刷怪练级的快感（升级速度简直堪比三流网游）还真是不错（笑）			"

												This game got boring fast. It is an autoattacking game where the items you pick up only affect the strength and speed of your autoattacks. There are no abilities, and the few active items that exist seem to just be different additional autoattacks. That being said, it gets boring fast. The reviews that are drawing comparisons to Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy are seriously unrating the game mechanics of those two games. This game is extremely shallow in terms of depth -- it doesn't come close to comparing. I can only guess this is why there are no let's plays of this game on YouTube or reviews anywhere; it is boring to play and EXTREMELY boring to watch.It would be an amusing $1 purchase on a phone or tablet (or free with ads), but I could never recommend this to anyone anywhere near the $10 asking price on the PC when there are much better games available.(Also the voice work is laughibly bad. Not enough to detract from the game but it is amusing to me how terrible it is.)			"

												Got sent this game by a friend, however I have subsiquently bought it an additional 3 times for other people, as it's currently only £0.47, and also because it's an amazingly fun game.Obviously Diablo 2 inspired, from the game play to the sojs and the shakos (which if you've played D2 I'm sure you'll understand). And like a lot of games inspired by D2, the gameplay is really fun. Reminicant not just of D2 but also Torchlight and a few others, this game has all the best bits of a few cool games and frankly is a steal for the current price (or any).There are some bugs where you'll join and be the wrong character or be unable to see a friends game ect, but most of the bugs are solved by going through any portal.There have been some issues with servers being down or crashing, but frankly, a little patience and a few minutes is really all it takes to get round these, I've been playing most of the day and other than crashing once or twice and having to wait a few minutes here and there for servers to come back up to be able to create a game, it's worked perfectly, dispite the occassional ""server unresponsive"" message that occassionally pops up in chat.All in all, I've no reason not to recomment this game, if you like the indie style and you enjoyed D2 I'm sure you'll really enjoy it, and if you haven't, you probably still will.

EditIt's been a while since this review's been up and originally I'd given this a negative review. I had people commenting and messaging me telling me the game's been changed quite a bit and I should check it out. And I did. This is what I've discovered.The difficulty has evened out quite a bit. My main gripe wasn't so much the difficulty itself as much as it was it's erratic curve. I made a new guy, a necromancer, and decided to play as far as I could, noting how far I've gotten each time I died. First time I died was to the first boss which is understandable. I was playing a squishy character and I'll admit the death was my fault. Second time I died I'd just killed the first boss and didn't notice all the skeleton archers. Third time I died was at the second boss. Each time I died I learned from my mistake, got stronger and got farther every time. It's tough but it's my kinda tough. I like it. Good job fixing that up fellas. I also enjoy how easy it is to get right back into the game and breeze through the easy waves. You can skip a bunch of waves at one time and take on all the monsters at once to quickly get to the boss. This is perfect for a game this difficult.I still have a bit of a problem with the voice acting. I've said this before but if you can't get great voice acting then don't get voice acting at all. Sound effects or just simple grunts and yells would do just fine. I do however love the sound design. In a game where you're killing things ad nauseam it's really important to make it feel good when you defeat an enemy. They make good gorey sounds and explode in a huge mess. The music doesn't get repetative either but it sure as hell gets stuck in my head. So yeah. Great sound design, bad voice acting. All in all it's a good game. I was completely on the fence about it before but the changes they've made had me changing my mind. I promised I'd update my review and here it is. Don't wanna leave a bad review on a good game. Especially one that doesn't deserve it. I'll keep my old review here up for posterity. I find it really hard to recommend this game. I'm completely on the fence about it. I'm having fun playing it but there's just too many things wrong with it. It gets constantly updated and it seems every time there's a serious flaw someone writes it off as ""I'm sure the devs will fix it eventually!"". What people don't seem to realise is that this game isn't early access. This is a complete game. So any flaws in its design are absolutely relevant. My biggest gripe is with this game's difficulty. I'm all about hard games. I've clocked in hundreds of hours in Dark Souls 1 and 2 and have played my fair share of roguelikes. I'm a huge fan of the genre. But the difference is when you die its your fault. You get right back up and learn from your mistakes. This game, however, throws that out the window. It's difficult for the wrong reasons. I chose a marksman and granted I know they're a bit squishy but dear god half of what hits me just outright kills me. A lot of the creatures deal a pretty decent amount of damage and they drop health orbs when they die. That is until there's a boss or some kind of special monster. Every single boss I fight outright kills me in a single hit. Every. Single. Boss. Even the very first one. The difference in difficulty between the first and third boss I fought was nonexistant. They're completely random so hope to god you're fighting a melee boss because if he's ranged or has an AOE of any type at all then you may as well just jump off a cliff and save yourself the trouble. The problem with this is my marksman is level 20 and I'm still in the first act and STILL GETTING KILLED IN ONE HIT! Now I have played the melee classes a bit and they're not much less squishy. I find myself dying just as much. The first few levels of your character you may as well be throwing tissue paper at the enemies because you're not gonna do jack. Your best bet is to just lead the enemies to traps until your leveled up enough to get the one or two important skills that'll win you the game. Just don't get hit! By anything! Ever! Also every point you put into defense only raises damage reduction by .2%. So unless you invest a ridiculous amount of points into it, it's not going to help you at all. Skill points add a very negligible benefit to your character. The online multiplayer is absolute garbage at this point. Online multiplayer is in its alpha stage and you can definitely see it when you play. Joining games is a hit and miss. 90% of the time I join one the game just freezes for 2 minutes and just takes me back to the main lobby. That and sometimes the lobby says certain games have a negative amount of players in them (-1/4) or completely lie about the ping. All this I can understand. It's hard to just add in online multiplayer. It's a huge thing. The only reason I'm mentioning it is because you guys deserve to know its current state. My only real concerns about it are two-fold. Multiplayer is ESSENTIAL to beating this game and YOU HAVE TO BUY DLC JUST TO PLAY ONLINE! That's right. You have to purchase a $3 or $5 dlc just to play this game's god-awful online multiplayer. I'm thankful I bought this when it was on sale because I feel horrible for the people that actually paid full price for this mess. This sort of business strategy just infuriates me.I actually like this game's graphics and sound design. The music is fitting, the pixel-art is decent and stylized pretty well and the sound effects are great which is a lot more important than people might imagine. In a game where you're fighting huge waves of enemies it's imperative that you make it feel good to kill things. Enemies explode in a satisfying pile of gore and it sounds great! However.. this game has some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard. The writing is god-awful and it sounds like the same guy did the voices for everyone. This game does not need voice acting. There's no story. Dialogue is completely useless. Voice acting is one of those things that you either get right or just not have at all and I think this game would actually do far better if the characters just grunted or screamed rather than have full lines of dialogue.All in all, will you enjoy this game? Probably. It is a lot of fun. I've been craving a diablo-like multiplayer arena game for a long time and this one fulfills that desire. It's hard to find good things about it with all that's wrong with it though but something keeps bringing me back. Maybe you'll enjoy this type of game. If you can put up with the awkward difficulty then I'd say you'll probably like it too.  "

												Hero Siege, where do i start.First off, i found this game a while ago and wasn't very interested in it because of the price, graphics and looked like a cheap knockoff of Diablo 3.A few days ago i saw it on sale for $0.99, so i went and bought the 4 pack for $1.99 and gave 2 copies to my gaming friends. We tried it, one of them lost interest in about a hour and half of gameplay, while me and another friend somehow got hooked to this game even with it's really bad start. What do i mean a really bad start? Well in the 2 hours of trying the game my friend and i came across 3 bugs that really made us wonder if we should sink time into this mess. The biggest bug being when we did a puzzle and when i hit the reset button my friend the was next to the wall and standing on where the stone piece resetted, he got pushed out of bounds and couldn't do anything but walk around and watch me for the rest of the dungeon. Another being sometimes missions sometimes have a tendency to spawn objective items (even mobs and loot that you cant reach) outside the map and you just have to sit there looking at it, although going to the next stage of the act will respawn the last piece for the mission.With that said, you'd think to yourself, this game seems so broken, why would i ever play this? Well, the answer my friend is the grinding and loot that you would normally get in diablo, just a bit more rampaging bloodshed than diablo.Here are my pros and cons:Pros:-Fun if your into one shotting everything from 1-150-Your friend can join you (my friend made a new character and i brought him through Inferno difficulty and got him to 70+ in levels)-LOOT-Neat and useful, sometimes funny relics (#StickmanSteveForMVP)-Classes are for the most part distinctive in playstyles-You can play with up to 3 other friends in a PRIVATE AND OFFICIAL SERVER (yes pls)-You can also host an open server for people to join (good luck getting people to)-You can name your character anything, and you can reset your skills, talents and even rename your character for an ingame currency called rubies.-There's a leaderboard for Wormholes (endgame stuff)-There's a chat section you can talk to people while you wait for your slow as hell friend to turn on what feels like his 1998 windows computer, get his dial-up running, and spend forever getting on skype and finally the damn game.-There are many difficulties to go through while you level up which includes, Normal, Nightmare, Hell, Inferno, Agony, Destruction, and Toxic. Right now my paladin is level 145 and im finally moving to Destruction to hopefully get to 150.-The devs seem to care at least a little bit about the players which is good enough for me.-And most importantly, they have the best relic, Stickman Steve. His quotes are amazing, and his voice is that perfect type of annoying that you'll love.Cons:-Many glitches, but can be fixed by going to the next section of an Act (The game is divided into Act 1-7  and Chapters 1-5 for each Act)-Your items not appearing when you get ingame (which ONLY happens if the server is down and you connect on peer-to-peer, since the items are saved server side, until the server is back up, you have no items)-Server crashes happen 3-4 times in the past few days, but the devs said ti was because alot of new players joined and it crashed the servers, so they are upgrading it over the next little while to hold more players-The damn animation for picking up potions that end up getting me killed once. At least there is a relic to insta-pickup items so it cancels the animation for picking up potions and relics.-Dying resets ALL the relics you collected (when your playing with 1 or more people this only occurs if both/all players die.-You only really need to put your skill points into health as items will increase your skills for you and Damage/Mana has an awful scaling per point you allocate to it, so it is only beneficial to allocate them into health.-There is only one active guild i see on US that has a decent playerbase, and that is 3G, although i've made my own guild with just my friend and i, and we're having fun playing as the underdogs.Overall, as bad as this game looks, i kinda have fallen for it. If your like me and dont mind the grind, even if it's 150 levels and like 6-7 playthroughs of the same maps and Act bosses, you should give this game a shot, especially if its on sale. And if you see me in chat (The Boss), feel free to join my guild or to start up a convo, cause we both know i'm just waiting for my 1998 windows, dial-up, slow as hell friend to finally get on.			"

												Hero Siege is a good idea with really poor execution in so many areas that shows some fundamental lack of ability about what it takes to polish a game in 2015.It has probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game in recent memory.- inconsistent behaviour, it pauses when stat upgrading but not when changing inventory? Some items auto-pick up but not others?- no tool tips or tutorial behavoiur of any sort, nor is there any tutorial for even basic things like how to pick up items. There isn't even a controls screen so you can see what controls are available. And there are WAY too many. I'm pretty sure a PC flight sim in 1994 had fewer buttons to remember.- lack of feedback on so many things. You can select any dialogue options you want and there is no confirmation that it does anything.- double-randomness involving requring a random chance to get keys and to get chests. So you end up finding a bunch of chests you can't open, with no way to go back to them once you have a key. Who ever thought that was a great idea?- keyboard controls are basically so busted the game is unplayable.- mouse operates only some things, but is otherwise inconsistent.- inventory select screen is about as bad as you can make one. Why even have 'inspect' as a seperate opion? So dumb, it makes you press buttons all over trying to figure out what your best inventory item is. On top of this, not pausing the game during this fullscreen dialogue means you can easily die if you ever try to change items in the game. Compared to diablo where you would just highlight to inspect and double-click something to equip it if it was better, this game you have to nagivate with the keyboard and F and G keys, then press R and G to inspect and leave the inspect screen.. for every item. It's just insane, how could they ever think this was ok when diablo 2, one of the clear inspirations for them, solved this so much better over 15 years ago.- Finally know that it's basically a free-to-play game they charge up front for, the base game should really be free with how much content is behind a paywall.On the plus side the art style is very appealing. It's just a shame it can't be enjoyed to it's full potential.In order to like this game you have to have a large tolerance for going on forums to learn how anything works.Looking at some youtube reviews of what it used to look like... wow they really did wreck their game. It used to be much more simplified and straighforward and actually tell you what buttons you need to press to do things. All abilities used to be passive so there were fewer buttons to press too.

												While the concept of the game is great, it does get boring quick. I was able to get the game for a $1 through a game sale site. After playing the game, I would not be able to justify spending $10 for it and would convince others to avoid doing so as well. While there are multiple classes to choose from and a decent amount of content, the game is limited. Like others have said, there is no depth. Run around and shoot, pick up some gold (which is pointless in my opinion, the shop has only temporary items), and find relics which increase attack/speed or give additional passive attack types. I was excited to get into the game, but being able to go through the Normal difficulty in about two hours, the only other thing to do it go through the game at a higher difficulty. Not worth the trouble or time, but worth the play once or twice if you can get it cheaper.			"

												I’ll be as brief as possible.I hate this game and I regret spending money on this thing. Reasons being as followed.- It takes way too many points invested in stats before you see meaningful changes in anything but damage, and even then it fails to scale well compared to the nonsense starting the second region. Also your stats do NOT passively scale with level, making it worse!- The game is an utter crapshoot. You do well or poorly purely on chance.- You spend the majority of the game running from people and shooting as you go backwards. Running towards stuff is never a choice.The last one is a nit pick that I have with all twin stick shooters I’ve played and have yet to play one that encourages an aggressive approach of running towards the foes rather than away. Then again, I DETEST playing passively and I hate it even more when its the ONLY VALID WAY TO WIN! For those reasons I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore or determined twin stick shooter gamers.As for me, I’m going to uninstall this and never look back. To fix all the issues would require a total overhaul of the game. And I doubt the development team is willing to put in the work. Otherwise this incompetently put together product wouldn’t exist in its current form.			"

												Nice distraction if you want to play it on your phone or something, but this is a casual game lacking in depth. The ""roguelike"" tag is pretty much a joke. The random elements have very little impact on how you will play the game (hold the attack button constantly and kite enemies.)The production values are surprisingly good - it's a well-crafted game and doesn't feel cheap, so I've got to give them credit for that. The explosions/gold pickups are satisfying. Still, leveling up feels unimportant and there's no real strategy or metagame like Binding of Isaac etc. Pretty much NEEDS multiplayer to be fun, which they say they're working on. As it is, I got bored after about an hour. I might've enjoyed nightmare/hell difficulty more, but they don't let you select them right away like I wanted to, so I don't know. Normal is too easy for too long, which contributed to the boredom.I paid a dollar for Hero Siege on IndieGameStand, and I don't regret my purchase... But I would have if I paid the ""official"" asking price of $10.			"

												I both like and don't like this game so its hard to pick between a simple yes or no.  Do i regret the $1 I spent, no.  Will I play it much, no.  I seen this and thought, hey.. its like realm of the mad god and it kind of is but mad god has a very clear view so you can easily see what your dodging and better worlds to explore.  This one has better character development choices and random items that are interesting.  The biggest problem I have with this one that makes me have a really hard time giving it the thumbs up is that theres so many trees and such that its hard to see everything you need to dodge.  Bullet hell games should have a very clear view so one doesn't feel robbed because they instantly died to something they could not see.My only other problem is that theres nothing worth while to spend my gold on.  The pirate class has skills specifically designed to help her get more gold but everything I can buy with it is a temp buff or consumable so the pirate has to give up a useful skill in her tree for one that doesn't actually do anything and her first active skil scales on it so one needs to level it anyway.  This isn't a very big deal to me but I still wish I could use the gold to actually increase her power to make up for her giving up power so she would snowball enough to overcome it.  If the dmg or atk speed potions were permanent but smaller buffs and simply got more expensive after buying them then I would like it better for all the classes.Overall, its a decent game at the sale price but for the full price of this game or less I can get paper sorcerer, evilquest, plants vs zombies, binding of issac, ghost master, dungeons of dreadmor or classics like sudeki, septerra core, etc.  Thats just to name a few and with the typical steam sales and free to play titles that are worth playing..  I just can't recommend this game but I've certainly spent a buck in worse ways.			"

												Game is a buggy mess. And it isn't even fun when it works. Can't play co-op with M+KB and XBox controller setup; needs two XBox controllers plugged in (which we have). Characters get wiped for no reason: created a pirate, which became a different class when starting the game (and got saved as that class when exiting and re-entering the hero select screen), and created a necromancer which stayed permanently dead, with no HP, but could still be controlled. Even deleting and re-creating a new necromancer did not fix the problem. Not to mention the gigantic HUD and lack of game settings in the options page. Avoid like the plague.			"

												I got on board with this game way back when it was on a Pay What You Want deal on indiegamestand.Back then, I promoted it as a fantastic 2d homage to Blizzard games, specifically the Diablo series, with some callbacks to the better raids in WoW as well.It was a simple game back then. The single player amounted to simply fighting waves and waves of enemies and occasionally being amazed if you got a Frostmourne. It was Diablo 2 meets 2d tower defense. It was a blast.Multiplayer added a host of problems. It's nearly impossible to navigate the server browser now. Bugs are common, whether in the game or at the menu. You can join a game and randomly get 1 shot and there go all your items- if you manage to join a game at all.I will update my review if the game significantly improves. It was a good game when it comes out, but as it stands now, I would not suggest someone buy it.			"

												Horrible menu, no tutorial or description about any of the elements in the game, enemies can one hit and its impossible to see which enemy is which and it makes dodging one of the hardest possible tasks. Game crashes repetedly, multiplayer is bugged with loads of crashes, logging in to the ""online"" takes forever and the characters aren't shared between multiplayer and singleplayer. Bosses aren't put together witha single thought that some classes might be useless against them, for example skeleton summoner whos skeletons dissappear when entering a boss room where there are no minions to summon skeletons from. None of the ingame windows have close buttions, you have to navigate with wasd, f, g and r, game does not pause while in inventory. Overall this might be worse than ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaur hunt africa, totally horrible diablo ripoff without decency to even work properly, worst purchase ever made.			"

												First off, Hero Siege itself is a pretty decent game good for some mindless bloodsoaked action. I've had fun with it, I got to say that the bugs were tolerable and it's easy to pick up. Just don't expect too much depth, HS is not aiming to be more than mindless fun.BUT as somebody who bought this game to play with friends (which I expect a lot of people did), I sort of feel a little cheated by the publisher. Yes now they have multiplayer as it was announced. Yes now they have a lot of different classes. But paying actually more money for a dlc than I originally paid for the game which, frankly was not very long, to get more content and exclusive acces to a multiplayer alpha? Come on, that's just weak. Not to mention that after advertising the new character for a month, you realise that you have to pay for him as well.So in comparison, it might be worth the ten bucks if you do not own it already, give a loot of monster slashing fun, but as for I feel a little played with I do not recommend this game. For the price you could get Torchlight 2 or Binding of Isaac.			"

												Hero Siege, where do i start.First off, i found this game a while ago and wasn't very interested in it because of the price, graphics and looked like a cheap knockoff of Diablo 3.A few days ago i saw it on sale for $0.99, so i went and bought the 4 pack for $1.99 and gave 2 copies to my gaming friends. We tried it, one of them lost interest in about a hour and half of gameplay, while me and another friend somehow got hooked to this game even with it's really bad start. What do i mean a really bad start? Well in the 2 hours of trying the game my friend and i came across 3 bugs that really made us wonder if we should sink time into this mess. The biggest bug being when we did a puzzle and when i hit the reset button my friend the was next to the wall and standing on where the stone piece resetted, he got pushed out of bounds and couldn't do anything but walk around and watch me for the rest of the dungeon. Another being sometimes missions sometimes have a tendency to spawn objective items (even mobs and loot that you cant reach) outside the map and you just have to sit there looking at it, although going to the next stage of the act will respawn the last piece for the mission.With that said, you'd think to yourself, this game seems so broken, why would i ever play this? Well, the answer my friend is the grinding and loot that you would normally get in diablo, just a bit more rampaging bloodshed than diablo.Here are my pros and cons:Pros:-Fun if your into one shotting everything from 1-150-Your friend can join you (my friend made a new character and i brought him through Inferno difficulty and got him to 70+ in levels)-LOOT-Neat and useful, sometimes funny relics (#StickmanSteveForMVP)-Classes are for the most part distinctive in playstyles-You can play with up to 3 other friends in a PRIVATE AND OFFICIAL SERVER (yes pls)-You can also host an open server for people to join (good luck getting people to)-You can name your character anything, and you can reset your skills, talents and even rename your character for an ingame currency called rubies.-There's a leaderboard for Wormholes (endgame stuff)-There's a chat section you can talk to people while you wait for your slow as hell friend to turn on what feels like his 1998 windows computer, get his dial-up running, and spend forever getting on skype and finally the damn game.-There are many difficulties to go through while you level up which includes, Normal, Nightmare, Hell, Inferno, Agony, Destruction, and Toxic. Right now my paladin is level 145 and im finally moving to Destruction to hopefully get to 150.-The devs seem to care at least a little bit about the players which is good enough for me.-And most importantly, they have the best relic, Stickman Steve. His quotes are amazing, and his voice is that perfect type of annoying that you'll love.Cons:-Many glitches, but can be fixed by going to the next section of an Act (The game is divided into Act 1-7  and Chapters 1-5 for each Act)-Your items not appearing when you get ingame (which ONLY happens if the server is down and you connect on peer-to-peer, since the items are saved server side, until the server is back up, you have no items)-Server crashes happen 3-4 times in the past few days, but the devs said ti was because alot of new players joined and it crashed the servers, so they are upgrading it over the next little while to hold more players-The damn animation for picking up potions that end up getting me killed once. At least there is a relic to insta-pickup items so it cancels the animation for picking up potions and relics.-Dying resets ALL the relics you collected (when your playing with 1 or more people this only occurs if both/all players die.-You only really need to put your skill points into health as items will increase your skills for you and Damage/Mana has an awful scaling per point you allocate to it, so it is only beneficial to allocate them into health.-There is only one active guild i see on US that has a decent playerbase, and that is 3G, although i've made my own guild with just my friend and i, and we're having fun playing as the underdogs.Overall, as bad as this game looks, i kinda have fallen for it. If your like me and dont mind the grind, even if it's 150 levels and like 6-7 playthroughs of the same maps and Act bosses, you should give this game a shot, especially if its on sale. And if you see me in chat (The Boss), feel free to join my guild or to start up a convo, cause we both know i'm just waiting for my 1998 windows, dial-up, slow as hell friend to finally get on.			"

EditIt's been a while since this review's been up and originally I'd given this a negative review. I had people commenting and messaging me telling me the game's been changed quite a bit and I should check it out. And I did. This is what I've discovered.The difficulty has evened out quite a bit. My main gripe wasn't so much the difficulty itself as much as it was it's erratic curve. I made a new guy, a necromancer, and decided to play as far as I could, noting how far I've gotten each time I died. First time I died was to the first boss which is understandable. I was playing a squishy character and I'll admit the death was my fault. Second time I died I'd just killed the first boss and didn't notice all the skeleton archers. Third time I died was at the second boss. Each time I died I learned from my mistake, got stronger and got farther every time. It's tough but it's my kinda tough. I like it. Good job fixing that up fellas. I also enjoy how easy it is to get right back into the game and breeze through the easy waves. You can skip a bunch of waves at one time and take on all the monsters at once to quickly get to the boss. This is perfect for a game this difficult.I still have a bit of a problem with the voice acting. I've said this before but if you can't get great voice acting then don't get voice acting at all. Sound effects or just simple grunts and yells would do just fine. I do however love the sound design. In a game where you're killing things ad nauseam it's really important to make it feel good when you defeat an enemy. They make good gorey sounds and explode in a huge mess. The music doesn't get repetative either but it sure as hell gets stuck in my head. So yeah. Great sound design, bad voice acting. All in all it's a good game. I was completely on the fence about it before but the changes they've made had me changing my mind. I promised I'd update my review and here it is. Don't wanna leave a bad review on a good game. Especially one that doesn't deserve it. I'll keep my old review here up for posterity. I find it really hard to recommend this game. I'm completely on the fence about it. I'm having fun playing it but there's just too many things wrong with it. It gets constantly updated and it seems every time there's a serious flaw someone writes it off as ""I'm sure the devs will fix it eventually!"". What people don't seem to realise is that this game isn't early access. This is a complete game. So any flaws in its design are absolutely relevant. My biggest gripe is with this game's difficulty. I'm all about hard games. I've clocked in hundreds of hours in Dark Souls 1 and 2 and have played my fair share of roguelikes. I'm a huge fan of the genre. But the difference is when you die its your fault. You get right back up and learn from your mistakes. This game, however, throws that out the window. It's difficult for the wrong reasons. I chose a marksman and granted I know they're a bit squishy but dear god half of what hits me just outright kills me. A lot of the creatures deal a pretty decent amount of damage and they drop health orbs when they die. That is until there's a boss or some kind of special monster. Every single boss I fight outright kills me in a single hit. Every. Single. Boss. Even the very first one. The difference in difficulty between the first and third boss I fought was nonexistant. They're completely random so hope to god you're fighting a melee boss because if he's ranged or has an AOE of any type at all then you may as well just jump off a cliff and save yourself the trouble. The problem with this is my marksman is level 20 and I'm still in the first act and STILL GETTING KILLED IN ONE HIT! Now I have played the melee classes a bit and they're not much less squishy. I find myself dying just as much. The first few levels of your character you may as well be throwing tissue paper at the enemies because you're not gonna do jack. Your best bet is to just lead the enemies to traps until your leveled up enough to get the one or two important skills that'll win you the game. Just don't get hit! By anything! Ever! Also every point you put into defense only raises damage reduction by .2%. So unless you invest a ridiculous amount of points into it, it's not going to help you at all. Skill points add a very negligible benefit to your character. The online multiplayer is absolute garbage at this point. Online multiplayer is in its alpha stage and you can definitely see it when you play. Joining games is a hit and miss. 90% of the time I join one the game just freezes for 2 minutes and just takes me back to the main lobby. That and sometimes the lobby says certain games have a negative amount of players in them (-1/4) or completely lie about the ping. All this I can understand. It's hard to just add in online multiplayer. It's a huge thing. The only reason I'm mentioning it is because you guys deserve to know its current state. My only real concerns about it are two-fold. Multiplayer is ESSENTIAL to beating this game and YOU HAVE TO BUY DLC JUST TO PLAY ONLINE! That's right. You have to purchase a $3 or $5 dlc just to play this game's god-awful online multiplayer. I'm thankful I bought this when it was on sale because I feel horrible for the people that actually paid full price for this mess. This sort of business strategy just infuriates me.I actually like this game's graphics and sound design. The music is fitting, the pixel-art is decent and stylized pretty well and the sound effects are great which is a lot more important than people might imagine. In a game where you're fighting huge waves of enemies it's imperative that you make it feel good to kill things. Enemies explode in a satisfying pile of gore and it sounds great! However.. this game has some of the worst voice acting I have ever heard. The writing is god-awful and it sounds like the same guy did the voices for everyone. This game does not need voice acting. There's no story. Dialogue is completely useless. Voice acting is one of those things that you either get right or just not have at all and I think this game would actually do far better if the characters just grunted or screamed rather than have full lines of dialogue.All in all, will you enjoy this game? Probably. It is a lot of fun. I've been craving a diablo-like multiplayer arena game for a long time and this one fulfills that desire. It's hard to find good things about it with all that's wrong with it though but something keeps bringing me back. Maybe you'll enjoy this type of game. If you can put up with the awkward difficulty then I'd say you'll probably like it too.  "

												Utterly fun for a couple of runs, at least.  Not a strict roguelike: Unless you check the ""Hardcore"" option, your character will continue to level between runs, setting you off stronger each time you play.  Multiple characters, with very different ways to play, and several difficulty levels means tons of replayability.  Only criticism: The items make the run.  I picked up a single powerful item, and it carried me from Act 1 through 3 straight hours to the end of the expansion Act.  If you're looking for an instance-based game in the vein of Diablo or Torchlight, I can't think of anything better.			"

												Both the base game and DLC are worth the full price purchase. I have enjoyed 99% of my gametime with this game. The other 1% comes from seemingly instant deaths out of nowhere. Not sure if that is related to me or a bug. The gameplay is very solid and the graphics are nice. It is a little slow to start out the game (especially with melee based characters) but once you get some levels under your belt it gets a little easier... then the game smacks you in the mouth and tells you to sit in a corner. There is always a more powerful enemy. Be aware of what is happening on your screen and you'll probably survive.			"

												While the concept of the game is great, it does get boring quick. I was able to get the game for a $1 through a game sale site. After playing the game, I would not be able to justify spending $10 for it and would convince others to avoid doing so as well. While there are multiple classes to choose from and a decent amount of content, the game is limited. Like others have said, there is no depth. Run around and shoot, pick up some gold (which is pointless in my opinion, the shop has only temporary items), and find relics which increase attack/speed or give additional passive attack types. I was excited to get into the game, but being able to go through the Normal difficulty in about two hours, the only other thing to do it go through the game at a higher difficulty. Not worth the trouble or time, but worth the play once or twice if you can get it cheaper.			"

												I’ll be as brief as possible.I hate this game and I regret spending money on this thing. Reasons being as followed.- It takes way too many points invested in stats before you see meaningful changes in anything but damage, and even then it fails to scale well compared to the nonsense starting the second region. Also your stats do NOT passively scale with level, making it worse!- The game is an utter crapshoot. You do well or poorly purely on chance.- You spend the majority of the game running from people and shooting as you go backwards. Running towards stuff is never a choice.The last one is a nit pick that I have with all twin stick shooters I’ve played and have yet to play one that encourages an aggressive approach of running towards the foes rather than away. Then again, I DETEST playing passively and I hate it even more when its the ONLY VALID WAY TO WIN! For those reasons I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore or determined twin stick shooter gamers.As for me, I’m going to uninstall this and never look back. To fix all the issues would require a total overhaul of the game. And I doubt the development team is willing to put in the work. Otherwise this incompetently put together product wouldn’t exist in its current form.			"

												Nice distraction if you want to play it on your phone or something, but this is a casual game lacking in depth. The ""roguelike"" tag is pretty much a joke. The random elements have very little impact on how you will play the game (hold the attack button constantly and kite enemies.)The production values are surprisingly good - it's a well-crafted game and doesn't feel cheap, so I've got to give them credit for that. The explosions/gold pickups are satisfying. Still, leveling up feels unimportant and there's no real strategy or metagame like Binding of Isaac etc. Pretty much NEEDS multiplayer to be fun, which they say they're working on. As it is, I got bored after about an hour. I might've enjoyed nightmare/hell difficulty more, but they don't let you select them right away like I wanted to, so I don't know. Normal is too easy for too long, which contributed to the boredom.I paid a dollar for Hero Siege on IndieGameStand, and I don't regret my purchase... But I would have if I paid the ""official"" asking price of $10.			"

												I both like and don't like this game so its hard to pick between a simple yes or no.  Do i regret the $1 I spent, no.  Will I play it much, no.  I seen this and thought, hey.. its like realm of the mad god and it kind of is but mad god has a very clear view so you can easily see what your dodging and better worlds to explore.  This one has better character development choices and random items that are interesting.  The biggest problem I have with this one that makes me have a really hard time giving it the thumbs up is that theres so many trees and such that its hard to see everything you need to dodge.  Bullet hell games should have a very clear view so one doesn't feel robbed because they instantly died to something they could not see.My only other problem is that theres nothing worth while to spend my gold on.  The pirate class has skills specifically designed to help her get more gold but everything I can buy with it is a temp buff or consumable so the pirate has to give up a useful skill in her tree for one that doesn't actually do anything and her first active skil scales on it so one needs to level it anyway.  This isn't a very big deal to me but I still wish I could use the gold to actually increase her power to make up for her giving up power so she would snowball enough to overcome it.  If the dmg or atk speed potions were permanent but smaller buffs and simply got more expensive after buying them then I would like it better for all the classes.Overall, its a decent game at the sale price but for the full price of this game or less I can get paper sorcerer, evilquest, plants vs zombies, binding of issac, ghost master, dungeons of dreadmor or classics like sudeki, septerra core, etc.  Thats just to name a few and with the typical steam sales and free to play titles that are worth playing..  I just can't recommend this game but I've certainly spent a buck in worse ways.			"

												Game is a buggy mess. And it isn't even fun when it works. Can't play co-op with M+KB and XBox controller setup; needs two XBox controllers plugged in (which we have). Characters get wiped for no reason: created a pirate, which became a different class when starting the game (and got saved as that class when exiting and re-entering the hero select screen), and created a necromancer which stayed permanently dead, with no HP, but could still be controlled. Even deleting and re-creating a new necromancer did not fix the problem. Not to mention the gigantic HUD and lack of game settings in the options page. Avoid like the plague.			"

												Hero Siege is a good idea with really poor execution in so many areas that shows some fundamental lack of ability about what it takes to polish a game in 2015.It has probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game in recent memory.- inconsistent behaviour, it pauses when stat upgrading but not when changing inventory? Some items auto-pick up but not others?- no tool tips or tutorial behavoiur of any sort, nor is there any tutorial for even basic things like how to pick up items. There isn't even a controls screen so you can see what controls are available. And there are WAY too many. I'm pretty sure a PC flight sim in 1994 had fewer buttons to remember.- lack of feedback on so many things. You can select any dialogue options you want and there is no confirmation that it does anything.- double-randomness involving requring a random chance to get keys and to get chests. So you end up finding a bunch of chests you can't open, with no way to go back to them once you have a key. Who ever thought that was a great idea?- keyboard controls are basically so busted the game is unplayable.- mouse operates only some things, but is otherwise inconsistent.- inventory select screen is about as bad as you can make one. Why even have 'inspect' as a seperate opion? So dumb, it makes you press buttons all over trying to figure out what your best inventory item is. On top of this, not pausing the game during this fullscreen dialogue means you can easily die if you ever try to change items in the game. Compared to diablo where you would just highlight to inspect and double-click something to equip it if it was better, this game you have to nagivate with the keyboard and F and G keys, then press R and G to inspect and leave the inspect screen.. for every item. It's just insane, how could they ever think this was ok when diablo 2, one of the clear inspirations for them, solved this so much better over 15 years ago.- Finally know that it's basically a free-to-play game they charge up front for, the base game should really be free with how much content is behind a paywall.On the plus side the art style is very appealing. It's just a shame it can't be enjoyed to it's full potential.In order to like this game you have to have a large tolerance for going on forums to learn how anything works.Looking at some youtube reviews of what it used to look like... wow they really did wreck their game. It used to be much more simplified and straighforward and actually tell you what buttons you need to press to do things. All abilities used to be passive so there were fewer buttons to press too.

												What a gem! Dont get me wrong its got its good and bad points but ive wasted hours on this for a meager amount of money. Its a good tough little game with (from whats worked so far) a good player base. However the main bad point is you need at least the stand alone game and the expansion to play online, which as hinted to above does have some minor connection issues.  Its a nice little game think 16bit diablo. just needs some love and attention that it seems to be getting.			"

												It was a low-key kinda broken, but also kinda awesome game. Ever since some update, everything got messed up. There's a weird inventory system, some kind of skill thing, way too much UI mess. It used to be you just sign in, you're playing and slaying in 15 seconds. Now there's an overworld, and all this complicated barriers. Would not recommend.			"

												Far blander than I expected. Looks to be something similar to Binding of Isaac with an RPG system surrounding it but in my opinion falls flat on its face. There seems to be a lot of content but all of it is rather dull, the myriad of classes all seem to be approximately the same and its just rather boring. The art looks uninspired and the music is mediocre.			"

												Having given up on the daily review writing game,  I have come to realize that this means I can actually take time to play and enjoy games that I really wouldn't have been able to sit down and enjoy had I continued.  It's actually surprising now how I can open up one or two of these new games and find myself enjoying playing them far more than I would have if I had a too-short deadline in front of me.  I guess this means that when I write new reviews, they will probably be much more authentic.Hero Siege is no exception to this statement.  I opened this up a week or so ago, thinking I would find a fairly simplistic top down bullet hell-ish bore, and i found myself actually surprised.  Surprised enough to not realize five hours had passed and I had finished my first playthrough of the base game, and with enough relics to make me effectively unstoppable, and I still didnt really want to put it down.  This, to me, is the definition of a truly good game, one that keep s your interest over time, even as you get to the end of it.Now I will say, that officially I have 'completed' the base game in that five hours, but that doesnt mean I stopped playing.  The game is basically an odd combination of bullet hell, tower defense, and binding of isaac roguelike, and for all its entertainment is actually fairly short.  What you get by playing a character however is the ability to play the same levels over on harder difficulty levels, though with your massively overpowered character dealing hot death to scores of mindlessly wandering foes.  The characters are simple enough to control, use your base attack most of the time then deal massive death with special moves when the cluster of baddies gets to dense for your base attack to be worthwhile.  As you progress, your experience grows your levels and base stats, and you also get random powerups which add unique powers in a binding of isaac like fashion, which you lose if you die, meaning you have  an increasing sense of protectiveness of your character the more difficult the game becomes.  The intent behind this I have to assume is that it keeps you on par with the difficulty level, which unfortunately it didnt seem to have done.  I was basically unstoppable until half way through my playthrough on the third difficulty level, whereupon I happened to hit a brick wall in a particular boss that apparently doesnt seem to understand that exponential difficulty increases only work if you go up one exponent at a time.  Afterwards, I lost all my relic powerups and quicly realized that my character though quick at reaping destruction before, was apparently not as powerful as i had been led to believe.  Curse you Hero Siege for such slanderous lies.All that being said, do I recommend this game?  Basically the answer there would be yes, though I will say that it doesn't have a lot of things that make it unique among the roguelike genre, and if you are already knee deep in things like isaac or Enter the Gungeon, it may be best to give a pass on this one, at least until you get sick of those and want to try something slightly different but still the same.

												Been Playing the Hell out of this one since I bought it during the Winter Sale of 2014, its Basically a combination of a Horde mode and Binding of Isaac since the Items you can get are pretty much the same (even the names) Takes you through 5 Whole Chapters with 5 stages in each. so 25 levels in total, complete with optional Dungeons, Crypts, and Shops to go to between Enemy Waves which you must survive around 6 to 8 waves per stage. with the final wave of each stage being a mini boss. Now the game does have a lot of replayability. lots of characters to go through and can grind your way all the way up to level 200 I'm sure. but it does get pretty damn stale at times. since you basically just kill wave after wave after wave of enemies for hours on ends. until you reach the end of a Chapter to fight a Real Boss and proceed until you complete the game. Now this took me a while to figure out, but if you want to succeed in this game in one go. Grab everything in sight, break every possible thing in the level. That means use all types of Potions so you know which ones to use throughout your run, break leaves and pots for cash, and go through Dungeons and Crypts for free items or gold at the end of each one. Without doing so the game will be a Hugh Pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ enemies will start to be very difficult to kill and you will most likely die in one or two hits if you are not careful. and the game is FILLED with bugs and glitches. some that can help you, and some that can♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.Overall the game is Pretty damn fun if you want to spend a lot of time playing a game for a good grind. but its really hard at first, and The Melee Characters are almost useless. but once you get a crap load of items the game is pretty simple at that point, even on harder difficultys. So Yeah Give it a shot if it interests you			"

												The game is good enough. It performs its function - it brings joy. Except for one thing:Were purchased by the DLC from Collector's Edithion, and after 8-10 hours of play all the content just disappeared. The reinstallation of the game did not yield results. In the support service, my protests were ignored in both my native language and in English. I did not even bother to return the DLC to me, if it was taken from me because of my mistakes, possible attempts to get into game files and so onTherefore, the reason for my angry comments is the absolute incompetence of the support service. Absolutely not advise buying this game, even if you really want.			"

												Has so much potential but it falls short. The game just gets so repetitive and boring after a while. To get to the point i just think more content will help such as: More Content in The Town of Inoya. The reason i say this is because it is just so ""boring"". It has nothing to even offer to the player considering the player is constantly forced to go there when out of combat. It has absolutely nothing to offer besides the somewhat non variety of shops and just useless NPC's. If anything to make the game better i think a more compact resting area with some cool stuff to look at with more content would be nice. Another thing that really bothers me is the currency in the game. First i will start with gold. Gold is essential to the player but i feel like use for gold has not much variety. Yeah you could buy relics and buffs with gold and wormhole keys yeah. But i just feel that there could be more use just like The Town of Inoya. Another currency is those blue crystals and i have to admit that the blue crystals are so useless after you have purchased what you wanted and will maintain for the rest of the game. Yeah you can use the blue crystals to go to Sheeponia but even that only gives like one equipment you cant even use since youre underleveled.Sometimes attributes and skills for characters can be such a confusion too. One example is the Berserk skill for Viking in which the description says that it has a chance to ignite enemies around you but it doesnt say what is the percent. Plus investing in hp late game is also just a waste of time since it only gives like 100 hp per click but that becomes useless too.Also another one big one is those golden health bar bosses. They are just so broken that it is stupid. They can one shot you and you wont be able to do anything back which is just stupidly broken for the game. When you die you have to re accumulate relics but that is just so damn boring since youre most likely grinding lower level acts. However i am certain that developers would spend some time to fix these issues. But there are also some really good stuff about the game such as combat. Really fun to just smash everything in your way and im pretty sure everyone likes doing that. But it can be unnecessarily overly difficult which takes away from the fun sometimes. Even though i put a bunch of complaints about the game i do recommend it for the extremely cheap price to content ratio if you want to be technical for that. But disregarding price probably not the best game to pick up as of now.			"

												I really like this game, there are quite a few glitches and crashes but from a small company this game is enjoyable.This game really reminds me of Relm of the mad God, The Binding of Issac and a little bit of d3. A lot of people will just criticize games because their "" A Copy "" or "" Clone "" of a game you have seens or played. Unfortunetly there will always be a game thats made before one that can remind you of or is similar, this I don't understand becasue creator's can always find a way to slip around this Copy or Clone status to make an enjoyable game. If it goes under its our job to let them know what they need to improve on instead of just yelling and ♥♥♥♥♥ing constantly at what their not doing. I enjoy this game quite a lot and would reccomend this to friends, once the dedicated multiplater servers are fixed im sure a lot of people will feel relieved but until then, I would reccomend learning how to port-forward. (You do not need to pay for port-forwarding as its only opening a port on your router thats outgoing so people can connect to you)			"

Posted: October 19, 2014
												   Hero Siege is a game that stands somewhere between a roguelike (most notably, The Binding of Isaac) and a dungeon-crawler (like Zelda, or Diablo).It certainly takes many aspects of those games, but turns them into something of its own.    I've only finished the game twice on normal mode, with a melee and a ranged class. I did try 2 others classes, but didn't beat the game with those, just wanted to try them out.   It's a weird game to review, actually. I don't consider it a good game. At all. However, if you manage to overcome all of its faults, it becomes a very fun game where you feel like a God and everything explodes around you. It's not well designed, but it surely is a lot of fun, at times!   There's quite a bit to mention about the game, so I'll try to write a brief overview of the game's systems, and then give an extended opinion about certain design concepts. Graphically, it has a 16bit style, very similar to how JRPGs look, only on a bigger scale. I liked it. Take into account though, that there is A LOT of things on the screen all at once, between enemies, destructable terrain, or permanent objects like trees. These often obstruct your vision of traps and enemy bullets, which makes it a bit too hard to dodge, early in the game. As I said, late in the game, you're God, so you will not worry about such petty matters.   I didn't pay much attention to the Music. Not that it was bad, but I play these games while zoning out with my own music, or podcasts. From what I've heard, it wasn't bad, but didn't really add to the experience.   The SoundEffects were actually pretty satisfying. Perhaps not on their own, but controller vibration was very well used to make you feel like you're actually exploding everything around you. The combination of these 2 was very good!   However! There's a problem inherent to this: when you're very aware that you're doing damage, you're not aware that you're taking it... The game doesn't give you much feedback when you're close to dying, and early on, it can mean your death. And prepare to die a lot, as the game is very unbalanced. More on that later.   Now, I'll try to just explain what the game actually is, mechanically.   You go from map to map, fighting waves of enemies. At the end of each map (6 waves), there's a random Boss fight, with a random item reward. Every 3 (or 5) Bosses, there will be a fixed Boss, marking the end of an Act. There are 4 Acts in the main game, with an additional 5th on the DLC (which I don't own).    While it is very similar to TBoI, it's much longer, and less structured. On each map, here's what you aim for:   - ActiveItems - you have 1 slot. You press a button to use it. It can go from healing you, droping a bomb, a barrage of missiles, giving you a potion, etc.   - PassiveItems - these are far more important. They often give you very powerful attributes, or perhaps a passive ability (like a chance of doing a long range attack along with you basic attacks, etc), or defensive/offensive orbital companions. This is where the meat of your progression is, aside from upgrading your skills.   - Chests - there are 3 chests. Some are common, and require no key. They contain keys, potions, or coins inside. There are Golden chests, that require a normal key (with a generally higher pay rate), and also Crystal Chests, that require a crystal key (and generally reward you with an item).   - Crypts - these are mini-dungeons, without a boss. Sometimes, they'll appear on the map. You'll usually find lots of traps and/or a puzzle inside. If you overcome it, you'll get a free item.   - Dungeons - these are similar to crypts, but they have a bigger focus on combat. More enemies, and also a Boss fight. It will also reward your with an item.   - Shops - these will have one item, one potion, and 4 stat upgrades, for different prices. It's hard to make use of them early on, but they're useful when you get enough money.   - Potions - these function like pills in TBoI. Their effect is unknown to you, until you try it. After that, you can use its color to recognize its effect (which is different in every run). These can grant you upgrades and downgrades, but they're essential to your success, since there will be a lot of them. It's your biggest source of attribute upgrades, aside from items, despite carrying a risk.   - Destructable objects can include crates, pots, or just vegetation. All of these drop something of potential use.   While there seem to be many options, the game has a very hard difficulty wall. Once you pass it, however, you'll snowball out of control, and reach the end of the game so overpowered that you don't need to dodge anything and you won't lose more than 5% of your HP, even walking over every trap and enemy.    The other important aspect of this game is your character.   There are a bunch of different classes (maybe 9? didn't count), some melee, some ranged. You gain XP by killing enemies, and are able to spend 2 attribute points, and 1 skill point. The attributes are the same for all classes (Damage, Attack Speed, Damage Reduction, and Health). The skills vary from class to class, but there are a few common features.   Every character you create has permanent progression (leveling is permanent). However, as I said, items and potions are the most important part of progression, and those are contained in the run itself. Each character is also level up individually.   The combat is more old-school than I was expecting, which I'm not sure it fits into what it's going for in terms of structure. But more on that later.    Most of it is passive abilities. Each character has 4 active skills, but they have a cooldown associated with, and while useful, they don't make as much of an impact as the passive ones. A lot of your skill tree is having a %chance of doing *action* when you attack. I actually liked that aspect of the game, but it also makes gameplay closer between classes.   With all of this, I can see people milking this game for hundreds of hours, between classes and different difficulties. However, it doesn't seem to be as replayable as, say, TBoI, due to its length. Each run may take 3 hours, and is long enough for you to get most of the items.    The game has many flaws (which I failed to mention), but it can be a fun game, if you overcome its difficulty. It's not expensive, so sure, give it a try!---I keep screwing it up. I need to summarize these reviews more to have space to actual discuss design decision. Anyway, here's what I think is wrong with the game.   The most important aspect here, is balance, which this game lacks a lot! There are inumerous different enemies, and these have modifiers as well, so there's quite a bit to consider when you're early in the game. Some of them are fine, while others explode on death, or do damage around them when they're hit... This isn't good at all with melee characters, for example. Early on, you'll die over and over and over again, because of this aspect. Another, is traps that are often obstructed by terrain, or even enemy projectiles. This, coupled with the lack of feedback, makes your life really freakin' hard.   It reminded my of NES Castlevanias, almost. Everything needed to be methodical. Which I love! However, those games were much shorter. In a roguelike of this length, I don't think it works as well.   Well, more in the comments. Sorry about this! I'll try to revise my writing in future reviews.

												The game is good enough. It performs its function - it brings joy. Except for one thing:Were purchased by the DLC from Collector's Edithion, and after 8-10 hours of play all the content just disappeared. The reinstallation of the game did not yield results. In the support service, my protests were ignored in both my native language and in English. I did not even bother to return the DLC to me, if it was taken from me because of my mistakes, possible attempts to get into game files and so onTherefore, the reason for my angry comments is the absolute incompetence of the support service. Absolutely not advise buying this game, even if you really want.			"

												Has so much potential but it falls short. The game just gets so repetitive and boring after a while. To get to the point i just think more content will help such as: More Content in The Town of Inoya. The reason i say this is because it is just so ""boring"". It has nothing to even offer to the player considering the player is constantly forced to go there when out of combat. It has absolutely nothing to offer besides the somewhat non variety of shops and just useless NPC's. If anything to make the game better i think a more compact resting area with some cool stuff to look at with more content would be nice. Another thing that really bothers me is the currency in the game. First i will start with gold. Gold is essential to the player but i feel like use for gold has not much variety. Yeah you could buy relics and buffs with gold and wormhole keys yeah. But i just feel that there could be more use just like The Town of Inoya. Another currency is those blue crystals and i have to admit that the blue crystals are so useless after you have purchased what you wanted and will maintain for the rest of the game. Yeah you can use the blue crystals to go to Sheeponia but even that only gives like one equipment you cant even use since youre underleveled.Sometimes attributes and skills for characters can be such a confusion too. One example is the Berserk skill for Viking in which the description says that it has a chance to ignite enemies around you but it doesnt say what is the percent. Plus investing in hp late game is also just a waste of time since it only gives like 100 hp per click but that becomes useless too.Also another one big one is those golden health bar bosses. They are just so broken that it is stupid. They can one shot you and you wont be able to do anything back which is just stupidly broken for the game. When you die you have to re accumulate relics but that is just so damn boring since youre most likely grinding lower level acts. However i am certain that developers would spend some time to fix these issues. But there are also some really good stuff about the game such as combat. Really fun to just smash everything in your way and im pretty sure everyone likes doing that. But it can be unnecessarily overly difficult which takes away from the fun sometimes. Even though i put a bunch of complaints about the game i do recommend it for the extremely cheap price to content ratio if you want to be technical for that. But disregarding price probably not the best game to pick up as of now.			"

												As it turns out, the game is still jsut as fun and awesome as it was BEFORE the Mana update. I highly recommend this game--it is like Diablo or Torchlight, but with more classes and roguelike elements :DHOWEVER, it is worth warning people with low-power computers, that this game is poorly programmed. It has lag and framerate drops even with a couple dozen enemies on screen, and at high difficulties, those enemies will be using attacks with large visual effects, which can even make the game crash. I have a decent gaming computer, and this game--with 16-bit graphics--crashes on account of a couple of fireballs. Just throwing that out there.			"

Decided to give the game another shot, and finally understood the controls after awhile (too bad you can't view the controls within the game, only on the the main menu of the overall game).This game doesnt seem complete to me, its missing an objective and it has bug issues.

												I've been playing this game for so long, it's hard to pin down exactly where the game is at. It's changed massively in the year and a half since I got Hero Siege (the first DLC came out the day I got it), and in many ways for better and for worse. Before they added Mana, the game was pretty solid; the mana update has been rough, but it's clearly getting better. The devs are pretty dedicated to this game, and they want to improve it as much as possible. It's fun, but it does take a good amount of persistence to get the hang of the game. It's very hard, but I definitely recommend it.			"

												I've played two characters so far: Viking and Pyromancer. I've played with an Xbox gamepad.Pros:+ Nice graphics+ Nice sounds+ Large selection of charactersCons:- The in-game options screen is incomplete. You can't change certain options in-game, you need to go back to the main menu.- Scenario gets in the way (visually). Sometimes you can't see stuff because it is behind a house, or a tree. Okay, trees get transparent when you move behind them, but houses don't. Still, it requires moving behind it. It is annoying.- Scenario gets in the way (movement). Sometimes when I'm running walking away from enemies, I get stuck and end up dying. Then I noticed that there was a pillar or tree that I couldn't see because it was transparent.- Pyromancer attack is ranged. However, even though it can move in any direction (analog stick), it can ONLY shoot in 4 straight directions (even with the analog stick!).- Pyromancer attacks miss enemies even though visually I believe they should have hit.- First boss while playing Pyromancer: a skeleton that is immune to ranged attacks.- While playing a melee character inside a dungeon, both one enemy and the boss were knocked back to behind the dungeon walls. They stayed there, at the ""void"", outside the dungeon, a location that was supposed to be solid and that no enemy or item should be at.- Pressing B to quit the inventory screen also counts as ""advance to the next wave"".- Pressing D-pad down to move in the inventory screen also counts as ""open teleport spell"".- Grinding. Grinding. Lots of grinding.- Each character requires grinding separately.- Walking speed is relatively slow. But I know you can grind for items to improve it.- Feels a bit confusing without a tutorial. What's the objective? What do I keep when I die?- The inventory screen is confusing. It took me a while to figure out that each empty square is an equippable slot.- Two currencies? In-game gold and in-game crystals? What's that? Is this a freemium game? I bought this game! This is confusing, even more so without a tutorial.- All those NPCs in the main area seem confusing. I don't know what they do. And I don't want to waste time walking from one to another (why is walking so slow? why are they so far apart?).It looks a very polished game.But if feels very unpolished.After some grinding to increase the attack strength a lot, playing feels a bit fun. But still confusing and pointless. Without increasing the attack, it feels very boring and repetitive.			"

												At it's currenty state I can not and will not reccomend, before this last update this game was flawless with no bugs, or glitchs. However now even when playing your Items will vanish and never return. Same with relics you earn. After a few times of this happening to me I have put the game in the closet to collect dust waiting for a new fix. Also FPS frame dropping and some random lag issues. If I can run  the new games on ultra settings with no hitch. this game is def in needs of some new optimzation.Like I said prior to this update I would reccomend this game.

												If you're reading this, you already know the basic gameplay: it's a shmup with RPG elements. One thing that you can't tell from the videos and screen shots is how confusing it can be when you start. You're thrust into the game world with very little explanation, and you have to figure stuff out as you fight and die and die and die. Some people will find this fun (including me, which surprised me) and some people will find this frustrating and quit. It's up to you to guess which category you'll fall into.I haven't experienced any bugs, but I have run into some.. unusual balance decisions. Enemy melee attacks seem to be much weaker than their projectiles, which in turn are much weaker than the projectiles spawned when they die, so you have to be more afraid of enemies when they die than when they chase you. Like I said, kind of odd, but once you notice that pattern and get used to it, it's no less fun.Skills don't look very balanced to me, either, but respeccing is cheap so that's not necessarily a big deal.Graphics and sound are pretty subjective, and you can check them for yourself in the above video, but FWIW I really like them. The one exception is the voice acting, which I didn't think was the 'so bad it's good' type. I thought it was the 'so bad it's really terrible' type.			"

												Bought this a while ago, I think when it was on sale. Finally got around to playing it over a year later. What I found was a bunch of locked content barred behind DLC doors, a painfully difficult start (my first few runs died in the first minute of gameplay until I was finally able to find some equipment), no ingame explanation of how to even play, and a glaring UI bug -- the numerical portion of your health gauge doesn't change no matter how much damage you take. (The actual bar works, and the mana gauge works fine, but not the numerical part of the health gauge -- it always reads full) Seriously, that kind of a glitch indicates nobody's ever even bothered to playtest this thing. Then there's also rat nests spawning outside the reachable gameplay area. And then there's the fact if you get unlucky with a statue early on, you can take a -40 penalty to Strength, which can make it go negative -- and moreover, make your damage output become negative. That's right, your main attack heals enemies while you're below 0 Strength.It's also rather chilling to see the first five reviews on this page being all negative, and three out of five of them blaming the developers for being vindictive, deleting criticisms from the forum, and even banning said critics from both the forums AND the game's multiplayer -- all for the supposed purpose of maintaining their 'motivation'. This is very bad PR, and bad PR leaves permanent black marks on a developer's reputation. Far worse than losing motivation for working on a single game, as that reputation can carry over to future created games.Also... is it just me or are there a lot of ripped ideas from The Binding of Isaac in this game? I'm seeing too many similarities for it to be mere coincidence or marked up to 'inspiration'.It's kinda fun although parts of it are on the tedious side, but I'll play it because I've already paid for it. But for most players I would advise against buying it, as I personally do not want to see negligent debugging, DLC onslaughts, and developers banning criticisms supported further.			"

												This review is based on online co-op (I have not bothered with single player).  The game itself is fun (especially with friends), but the game has been out for 2 years yet there is a ridiculous amount of crashes, some infuriating bugs, and many server issues.  It's uncommon be able to finish the 30 waves per Act in one go without one of my party mermbers or myself crashing (and since there is no hot-join, you will have to exit and remake the game and restart the Act).  The bugs I mentioned before are Relic pickup glitches and even sometimes items/relics lost upon reloading (rare but has occured with 2 friends of mine) which is enough to make any gamer rage. The most frustratng was figuring out how to connect with friends online.  The dedicated servers and even peer-to-peer are inconsistent for visibility of friends games in the lobby.TL;DR The game itself is probably worth it for the $6 price tag, but DO NOT expect a smooth online experience until (if ever) the bugs/crashes have been fixed.  If you do choose to gamble on this game, the only reliable solution (from my experience) to connecting with friends is for the host to forward port 5610 and having your friends ""Connect to IP""			"

I played as Necromancer with a friend and found my low-level skeleton summon spell to easily handle just about anything on its own with no intervention, balanced only by the fact that my health would vanish in the blink of an eye to something I didn't even know existed until it killed me. This resulted in the ideal tactic being 'raise skeletons, run, don't fight and wait until you win'. Even when I did participate in combat, the enemy AI and my attacks alike were both dull and I very quickly grew tired of playing.			"

												A very good little game. The goal of the game is to kill enemys, level up, invest your levels into a skill tree and get a badass motha♥♥♥♥a :D. There are 7 classes which are very different and all with unic skills. every class can learn 4 abilitys. The game offers pretty cool bosses, dungeons, and crypts. There are also lots of different items to change the your character or items to activate, like a 5th ability. You can collect money to upgrade your health/shield/attack speed/damage. if you die, you will lost all of your items and the upgrades you bought with money. the skill points stay. Its a pretty good system.I would really recommend the game because you have much fun with it for a very low price!			"

First of all, you get to choose and upgrade your characters, equip them with hats, and when you die you keep your levels gained and thus your ability/stat upgrades as well. The characters themselves are all fairly diverse, with active abilities and different ways to upgrade your regular attacks. As the game is completely reliant on RNG you will definitely have a few ""wtf"" moments where you just die. In a lot of cases getting hit once or twice is insta-death. The tombs and crypts are usually so hard that I just ignore them. Some of the bosses are stupidly easy and some are nearly impossible with certain classes.The creativity factor is there. The enemies are fairly generic but the designs and sprites are not bad. The voice acting is unimpressive. Personally I have beat the first area boss (which is a random boss each time of course) several times but upon reaching the second area I just get overwhelmed and shortly die, every time.The game is fairly fun. I play it from time to time and I got it on sale for cheap. A week or two after I got this game they released the DLC which basically says ""Buy our DLC for $6 or you won't get any updates"" and it's a slap in the face. Another reviewer said that he noticed some of the artifacts are stolen straight from Binding of Isaac. I would say that this game is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, and i'd say to wait until the DLC goes on sale if you plan on buying it. If you want to support a real action roguelike, go check out Nuclear Throne.			"

												I am going to be completely honest. I really do believe this game is great. I think the introduction of the mana system balances out many abilities. And I've never really had the issue of running out of mana anyway. Continuing on, I have had lots of fun playing this game and still continue to do so. I play this for about 30 minutes everyday on my way to and from school. But I wouldn't really play this game at home and just sit there. This is more of a ""passing the time"" type of game. None the less I find overall this game to be extremely fun to play.			"

												Hard, addictive making you regret every death but still containing right amount of character progress. Unless you are masochist and playing on hardcore.This fast paced rpg from top down perspective have simplistic pixolated graphic, similar to clasics like zelda or god of thunder. Or jrpgs.Wide variety of characters, some of them original (chainsaw wielding redneck...?!?) some of them classc fantasy cliche (marksman, viking) provides just right playstyle for everyone.Pros:-adictive gameplay-swift pace-very nice controls-random bonuses, loot, artefacts-active and passive character skills in character develop tree-dungeons and simple questsCons:-not enough info about characters, everything have to be learned on a go (no info about their possible skills while choosing one, hidden character passives (ie viking and his every third whirlwind attack and similar)			"

												Hero Siege, simply put, is an extraordinarily affordable yet underwhelming title.Its gameplay intentionally carries heavy Diablo, and consequently Torchlight, vibes which is very pleasant for those seeking a bit of nostalgia but beyond that Hero Siege is severely lacking. The user interface is extremely clunky with awkard key commands in place of far more convenient cursor navigations seen in essentially every other game in existence. This factor alone prevents just about any enjoyment.Bottom line is that this game is appropriately priced but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone.			"

												I ♥♥♥♥in loved this game to pieces when i first bought this...it brought back some of the feelings i had for Diablo 2,  The massive amounts of monsters, the loot, spamming abilities, and getting one shot on the harder difficulties.  All fond memories to me in different ways.  What i didnt like about this game is the way the developer is a inconsistant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who changes WHOLE classes, UI and stats to be♥♥♥♥♥backwards...lets it sink in a few months and then CHANGES IT AGAIN. Heres a few examples of flawless game design: 1.) In the previous build of the game there was NO unit collision ( I can walk through any enemy ) to ALL units have collision. 2.) I go to pick up and look at a piece of gear side by side and either press F or G to equip or destroy, like in the old build, and it just picks up the armor?? how the ♥♥♥♥ do i equip it now? how do i throw it away? wheres the update that tells me that this game has been turned on its god DAMN head?** Edit ** The developer added in different keys that show you how to either equip or destroy things in your inventory so the world isnt completely over and you can call off the strike.  Its still kind of hard to get used to sweeping changes but thats basically all that happens during this games patches.  Ill edit in if anything else happens.3.) Now that you can see how to equip or drop items you have the very real chance to drop an item and while still in the menu pick up the item that you just dropped....but not just one a whole STACK if depending on how much you threw away....and so when you are fiddling around in the menu an enemy comes along and kills you because you have no ability to stop time or see past your characters inventory screen....awesome.If the dev was looking to model himself after Blizzard North (The dev team for Diablo 2) the thing i wouldnt try to emulate would be buffing the ♥♥♥♥ out of one class or ability and nerfing another to be almost unplayable and not even addressing the issues.This game definitely has some flaws that need to be worked out but if you have the patience of a saint and just love to wait for ridiculous and glaring issues to be worked out then this is the game for you.

												Let's be clear out of the gate, Hero Seige isn't a perfect game by any token. Many have complained about patches and this and that and how its ruined this and that and blah. I bought the game over the summer, and played it for a short spell. There were other games I was more into at the time, but caught a sale. I knew I'd return to it eventually. I did after the supposed patch and its whatever to me. The game can be a bit static, operating in small areas over a long period of time. Orcs Must Die comes to mind, aside from the trap-laying mechanic. Instead you've got just your wits and weaponry. The Isaac references are clear, the Diablo spirit echoes softly, and so long as you eyeball your stats wisely (and avoid the acid at all costs) random deaths aren't really an issue. Its usually pretty clear. Like I said, its not perfect. It can get a bit dull after a while since it IS so static. But with an hour to kill every here and there, its hard not to come back to the game, even if just with the desire to conquer one act with a new character or on a new difficulty. Make your own consideration when it comes to a buy, but if you catch it on sale, you're not losing nearly as much as people are claiming you are.			"

												This game is a lot of fun with a little bit of not. Class-based with roguelike elements, it has a few surprises up its sleeve to keep it interesting and enjoyable. Just when I think I'm pushing water uphill, I manage to pull myself out of a tight spot. Just when I feel like I'm cruising along too easily, I get my face pounded in with something spiky and mean. I've clocked almost 10 hours in three days, and I'm showing no signs of stopping anytime soon.I have a few problems with the game, however.While the blood of a roguelike is pumping fast through the heart of this game, it isn't passing through the brain as much as I'd like. Collecting a relic grants an effect, but very rarely does the description of the relic lend to an explanation of what that effect is. A mouse-over text would do wonders for telling the player what they've just gotten themselves into.Also...there's no nice way to say it. The voice acting is a crime against nature. Thus far I've played five of the available eight classes: Viking, Marksman, Redneck, Pirate and Samurai. Only one of these five (the Viking) hasn't made me wish I knew more about modding, and that didn't seem as though it lacked the attempt.How is it that the Marksman is more redneck than the Redneck? The Pirate is so obsessed with treasure (and climbing, for some reason) that it actually makes other pirates look charitable - seriously, we get it, you like gold and want it in your pockets. As for the Samurai...If you can imagine Antonio Banderas doing an impersonation of Christopher Lambert's Raiden from Mortal Kombat who is himself doing an impression of Mickey Rooney's character from Breakfast At Tiffany's, you've about got it. Seriously, Kyle Kinane's bit about Trader Joe's Asian counterpart Trader Ming was less racially insensitive, and it was mimicking a man who was doing a terrible Oriental accent. ""Trader Ming demand respect from forrorers!"" It's that bad.Oh, you don't want to buy the DLC and find out? That's okay, just whisper the following phrase in a very pensive, meaningful way: ""Your rack of barance was your reakness."" That's an actual line from the game, in all the glory it lacks. You get me? You get me.I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a strong love for games similar to The Binding of Isaac (same control scheme, even) but who have long patience for dying unnecessary while cringing at terrible, just terrible voice acting.Oh, and Akrea, the Lightning boss, talks like a six year old with a speech imediment.

												There is something here... Its like I'm 8 years old again and there's a big pile of leafs. God damn that'd be fun to jump in. But when you jump in its full of nails and broken glass and like... dirty siringes used by drug addicts who probably have hep B. Sure if they put this fun retro pile of leafs through the leaf filter and took all that crap out it'd be a lot of fun... EXAMPLE. I was in a skype call with a friend who I was playing with.  I thought to myself I'm going to turn down the Music volume to hear better. I click the option and go to move it down to zero. Instead what it does turn itself all the way up and the ball that you click goes off of the option menu waaaay over to the right. Turns out... this is the loudest volume. OH then you try to turn it down but for some reason you can never get it back down to even the original volume *which is plenty loud* so its stuck at blaring.NO PROBLEM! There's a master Volume Off button! *click* .... *click* *click* *click* Oh right.... doesn't work either.Literally have to leave the game change the setting then  you can start again.... joy. In conclusion... Fix Yo $#% This feels more like an alpha... Not a beta... Game companies are trying to get away with more and more now a days. You don't need a player base to regonize some of these OBVIOUS problems.			"

												Amazingly fun game to play with your significant other! While it may be somewhat buggy, it is still a ton of fun and is regularly updated every few weeks or so. Not a dead game and online multiplayer is being released! With bugs and all, it is a ton of fun solo or with a friend. Highly Recommended! :D			"

												A really fun game to play either solo or with friends.The only downfall with this game is that there are quite a few bugs in multiplayer, but i guess that is normal cause its only in beta.Overall this is a awesome game			"

												Hard, addictive making you regret every death but still containing right amount of character progress. Unless you are masochist and playing on hardcore.This fast paced rpg from top down perspective have simplistic pixolated graphic, similar to clasics like zelda or god of thunder. Or jrpgs.Wide variety of characters, some of them original (chainsaw wielding redneck...?!?) some of them classc fantasy cliche (marksman, viking) provides just right playstyle for everyone.Pros:-adictive gameplay-swift pace-very nice controls-random bonuses, loot, artefacts-active and passive character skills in character develop tree-dungeons and simple questsCons:-not enough info about characters, everything have to be learned on a go (no info about their possible skills while choosing one, hidden character passives (ie viking and his every third whirlwind attack and similar)			"

First of all, you get to choose and upgrade your characters, equip them with hats, and when you die you keep your levels gained and thus your ability/stat upgrades as well. The characters themselves are all fairly diverse, with active abilities and different ways to upgrade your regular attacks. As the game is completely reliant on RNG you will definitely have a few ""wtf"" moments where you just die. In a lot of cases getting hit once or twice is insta-death. The tombs and crypts are usually so hard that I just ignore them. Some of the bosses are stupidly easy and some are nearly impossible with certain classes.The creativity factor is there. The enemies are fairly generic but the designs and sprites are not bad. The voice acting is unimpressive. Personally I have beat the first area boss (which is a random boss each time of course) several times but upon reaching the second area I just get overwhelmed and shortly die, every time.The game is fairly fun. I play it from time to time and I got it on sale for cheap. A week or two after I got this game they released the DLC which basically says ""Buy our DLC for $6 or you won't get any updates"" and it's a slap in the face. Another reviewer said that he noticed some of the artifacts are stolen straight from Binding of Isaac. I would say that this game is definitely worth buying if it's on sale, and i'd say to wait until the DLC goes on sale if you plan on buying it. If you want to support a real action roguelike, go check out Nuclear Throne.			"

												I have not played this game for long. Not long when you compare how months I have owned this game.But, a penny game that keep queueing your steam downloads page once every week consistently for three years deserves your respect. The game is good and the team behind it is sincere. There is a very good chance that you will like the game.But even if you don't, purchase the game as a sign of respect for the team... really, they deserve it.Strongly Recommended!			"

Posted: December 16, 2016
												EDIT: At first, I did recommend the game however after hearing news about how the creators/mods/etc have treated their customers along with further progression showing me only terrible glitches that they, themselves, have denied existed or need to be fixed. Even going so far as saying that this game is still in beta.....after a full 2-3 years of being on steam. Even at 5$, don't buy this. Not even as a gag. Don't support the creators until they decide to fix their game. It's broken and shouldn't be up in such a bad condition along with blatently being rude to their customers and removing the posts of people giving critisms on their forums. * = an edit.Alright, so first off, lets just start with what you'll be introduced to first upon entering the game's world. These will be seperated into pros/cons respectively afterwards, but first I'm going to give you an explanation of how the game felt to me (and me alone. Obviously, this first bit will be biased.)You get your 5 minute download complete and you start the game up. The companys are shown before you're presented with the main menu. If you've played the 2nd Diablo game, you may feel some small vibes from the game, because I did personally. You're presented with Single Player and Multiplayer, along with options and the option to exit the game, along with the ""Hero Siege"" title presented above the selections. Most likely, you're going to hit Single Player.There are literally more character slots then there are characters. So go wild.Once you enter the character selection, you'll see hardcore mode and go ""Well there's the Diablo vibes he was talking about."" where if you die you're perma dead and have to make a new character. You select your character and enter. Again, you're going to feel very light Diablo II vibes. You check the shop and see you can only sell, but not buy. You go up and find a blue rift, so you enter it, then you go to the left and step on the roman numeral for 1 and enter the rift that pops up.Now, the combat.Also take note that the music cues and the announcer is just....PERFECT. Lol.Enemies at first seem a bit tanky. I'm gonna tell you this, with how OP items can get at only 15 (and yes, they are by definition Over Powered) enemies being tanky will be a mere memory and you'll be slaying everything with one shot and straight up rushing. Your character is level 35, and enemies are slightly becoming tanky again. You will most likely disregard it and still rush in thinking you're still the OP beast you once were, and you'll die from getting bashed from literally every angle from allowing yourself to get boxed in, along with enemies glitching via teleporting or simply making your screen freeze for a few seconds simply from spawning in.You then go to the main menu and almost click quit game, but then you notice the Multiplayer selection. You suddenly go ""Well....maybe it's more fun to play with others."" And then almost as soon as you login after a long loading screen, you eat your words as you enter the most laggiest lobbies even if you enter the region that you're in with just the best wifi around. Your teammates most likely rush a lot just because they know they aren't alone, and will die a lot. You spend 10 seconds to revive them and will average a total of one minute and 30 seconds out of every 15 minutes (if you even manage to stay connected that long.) Have fun being the opposite of the reaper for the entire multiplayer experience, or you can just make the person think you're a♥♥♥♥♥♥and go off somewhere else ignoring his revival circle.You get disconnected after spiking heavily, then say ""Eh, what the heck. It's just a minor d/c."" You then realise that the game doesn't auto save frequently, because before the d/c you were 45 and had a tonne of gear, now you're 35 and all of your gear is suddenly gone due to an irreversal loading error that cannot be fixed apparentally because I had this game for a good year and they haven't fixed it. The servers also seem like they got worse. You rage quit harder, and consider uninstalling, but you most likely enjoyed the singleplayer so you held onto it and waited for the next time you had literally nothing to do.SO! You got my biased part of the review out of the way. Here's the ""General"" review. I will take each piece of the puzzle and put it together next to a # rating. 1 = Bad | 10 = GoodGameplay - 4: It's fun! It's entertaining and is a nice grindy beat-em-up dungeon crawler/treasure hunter. It's like a discount Binding of Isaac if it had sex with discount Diablo. *Now, that's if you disregard the glitches. But with the glitches, the game just SUCKS. No way around it...*Multiplayer - (Official Server Hosting:2 Peer-To-Peer Hosting:4) The official servers suck so badly. That's all I can really say for that. Peer-To-Peer is pretty much hosting your own server, which for the most part fixes the lag issue to an extent. It at least makes it easier to play without disconnecting so frequently. I know this because I've played the majority with my girlfriend (all the way in Japan and we both still had good connectivity compared to the official server(s).) and we had plenty of fun playing together on there, however we both encountered the bug that makes our gear disappear and our levels drop due to rare auto-saves.Bug Free/Playability - (BF:1 Playability:*3*) Oh damn. It's bugged alright. *It is playable but....the glitches really ruin the mood as they're so frequent.* Nothing more to really add, just saying if you can ignore the mere gear/relic/level deletion, it really isn't that bad.Intruiging - 3.5: Honestly, I can't say it's boring at face value but it's definetally not attractive. I'll probably play it for 30 minutes then get off and do something else. But it's something I'll always come back to once in awhile, and maybe with my friends.Story - There isn't any. Unless you count slashing through mobs and randomly killing bosses as ""story"".DLC - (*) I haven't bought any DLC however some accessories and characters are locked behind them. I can't make even a biased review on them because I honestly don't really want to buy them. Technically, I'd rate the DLC at 1 from face value as I'm not really intruiged by any of the other characters. *The fact that they are being so rude to their customers and deciding to not fix bugs, in essence making the game a mere cash grab. Seriously. Just don't waste your money or time.*Community - 2: They are either silent or illiterate kids being angry in the lobby chat. If you're going to play, just go P-T-P with a friend. Overall - *1*: *This game is a nightmare. It's a wreck. It's a ruin. It's a cash grab. It's so. Very. Bad. I'm so sad that I can't get a refund so I don't have to fund the creators deciding to make such terrible broken games that are mere cash grabs, scams. I'm going to refund the gift I gave to my girlfriend so I can buy something else that's better and put heart into, even if the game is only 5$. Don't support the company until they learn to actually fix their coding.*			"

												This company gets a 0 in my book because of their deceptive DLC marketing.  Don't fall for the ""Online multiplayer"", they don't tell you the online multiplayer is in a very early alpha, and it doesn't even work for a majority of the people.   If you read the steam community posts, nobody can get it to work with online multiplayer.  It either doesn't let you register at all, or crashes after you pick a character.   Great game from deceptive advertisers.  Steam should NOT ALLOW it to say multiplayer when it's a blatant lie, I'm going to contact them to complain about this and demand a refund on this garbage.

These relics can help in many ways and will change your gameplay style when you collect them.  More characters are being added and with co-op on the way this game will have a good bit of replayability.

Now the game is unplayable except if you enjoy continous frustration from dieing and start over from the very beginning. And when you die you die extrem fast, there is no way to avoid it. On top of everything every 2nd/3rd boss is an insectothingy doing circling unavoidable lasers, and you cannot even circle it around (if you able reach it before you die) cos the your char just stuck into anything in the backround and you die anyway.

												It would take a real hero to make this game seem good.I tried to like this game, but it is very cluttered, confusing, and pay to play. Once I got the hang of it and got one of the many game breaking items/skills, i just ripped through it. Most of the game (around 50% of it) is only in the DLC's you can buy. Their trademark character, the fallen paladin, is only playable through a DLC! He is even on the banner of the game below the community hub button on the store page! There is multiplayer, but the servers lag too much for it to be fun, and mods and cheating are banned in them. You will be banned if you accept items from a cheater. Imagine if all plugins and mods were permenantly banned from a game like minecraft? It would be absolutely horrible! The base game without multiplayer is either boringly easy, or way too hard till you find OP items. I don't reccomend this game. I got it for less than a dollar, and i feel cheated. If I was into useless grinding and I wanted to buy the numerous DLC, than I don't think it would be that bad. Unless you like playing cookie clicker for hours, I can't reccomend this game. If I could increase the difficulty, than it wouldnt be too boring, but you can't do that without beating the whole game!			"

												Hero Siege is a hack and slash rpg from in indie game studio.  This game can be great fun, it helps to have friends to play with like most online games.  It seems that the Devs have a thing for the diablo series, the referances are abound(from Shakos to enigma armors and more) Like any normal RPG you go through levels beating minibosses and a final boss at the end of each act.  Once some one makes a game up to 3 others can join.  Max level is 150 but after that you get extra levels that increase your stats 1 level = 10 to each stat.  The extra levels go across all your max level charicters, so once you get a 150 with (13) extra levels any charicter you get to 150 will get the extra 130 stat boost ***note since update  The xp needed to gain a hlvl has gone up but the stat bonus has gone from 10 to 25.**Pros -Many classes to choose from (You get more with DLC)Fast quick action ingameEasy to learnVast amounts of gear and combosTons of Relics you pick up that do veriaty of things (these do go away once you die, but you get them at the end of levels and in shops)Cons-Online gameplay can be buggy (game crashing occurs too often)The community is hit or miss, meet some great people but there are alot of beggers and anoying people.Dev team is small so it can be a bit to get bugs fixedThe prices is alittle steep since all the DLCs are pricey tooI will point out that the Collectors editions include things like Skins and Eye Candies but the normal DLCs have the Classes and levels.  I was a Huge Diablo 2 nerd and this is a great new game for those that like D2.Over all I really enjoy the game.  I hope to see it grow.			"

												I don't do reviews really often, usually when a game is REALLY good or REALLY bad, do I feel like doing a review. This little game was a huge surprise! I expected it to just be a mediocre game that you play for 1-2 hours, to try it out, then kinda just shelf it 'for another day'.Not the case, this game is VERY good, simplistic in design, but has intrinsic depth. You can sit down and play this game, and quickly realize it is 3 hours later ! The game's levels are diverse enough to keep it fun, but not too diverse that you feel you need to keep learning how to play. All the items that drop in the game are actually useful ! This game is one that everyone should try, especially at the low price it always sells for, then when it goes on sale, it is a real steal !			"

												Before I start the reccomendation I want you to go to the negative ones and read them. What do you see? People ♥♥♥♥♥ing because the game is too hard. Guess what. It isn't, it takes time to get used to it, but it itsn't. Probaby the people writing those reviews are used to easy as hell games.The game is simply amazing. You can choose from a variety of classes all with different abilities and spells and as you go through the stages your hero becomes a lot stronger. You need to have dodging skills as well, and good eye coordinations because enemies appear out of nowhere. The DLCs that will come and came out will add many features as well, so I suggest you buy those for a better experience.There isn't much to say to be honest as it is still early access, but it is worth the money. I rate it 9/10.			"

												One of the best indie hack 'n slash games I ever played so far!It has tons of replay value.It's true that it has a little bugs, but the devs are constantly releasing updates and patches, so everything is good!After almost 40 hours of gameplay there is still content in the game (undiscovered items, trying new classes and the hardcore challenges) and the best part is that there are more to come in the future.New characters, chapters, acts, a story mode and multiplayer are planned for the future and even DLC content if everything goes well!I myself support the developers in all their work and will happily get everything new which this game will bring.Shortly the game is awesome and deserves a try!

												EDIT:: 1 year later, here I am still playing Hero SeigeOriginal Review: 7/18/14Edit: 7/18/15Hero Siege, the game about killing stuff that has more health than you.Then again, what roguelike isn't about that?After 3.5 hours of gameplay, I can strongly recommend you buy this title. Its not easy but not hard difficulty keeps you from sliding right through a level, but it also doesn't have you on your knees begging for mercy. The classes vary from something traditional like the Pyromancer, to something not so traditional, like the Redneck. Crypts, dungeons and statues can apprear, giving you chances at gold, keys to open chests, and experience to level up. I can't imagine the time it takes to get to level 210 (as seen in the screenshots), my Pyro is only a level 17, after 3.5 hours of playing.But here's the thing about roguelikes: no matter how much you play, or how much your practice, you're still going to suck. With a game like this, you just have to hope and pray you don't get hit with an arrow of get a potion that brings you down to no health. If you get hit by an arrow, that's it. You have to find some health or you'll get hit by another and die. Aside from that, no matter how many times the game pulls a kill out of it's ♥♥♥, the satisfying feeling of leveling up or killing a boss will always make up for it.Even after throwing my mouse at the wall, or tearing my headset off and throwing at my PC, Hero Siege will hold a place in my gaming life, known as the game that broke me. It will forever hold a place as my least favorite game, the game i play all the time. 10/10			"

												Simple mechanics, easy to learn hard to master, really enjoying it so far the blend of easy combat with tactical decisions keeps it engaging a variety of enemys and power ups, the better you are the better you perform the biggest power ups to your character are obtained by surviving various dungeons some with puzzle elements. The only improvements i could note are giving usable items tool tips as right now i dont understand what any of them do and maybe having an implementable speed increase through stats in the game rather than power ups. I'd very much recommend this game if your after a fast paced game thats easy to get grips on but difficult enough to keep you coming back. 8/10.			"

												If you're looking for a 16-bit era Diablo/Binding Of Isaac type game, look no further. Loot drops are plentiful and the relic system is a refreshing idea in the hack and slash framework of the game. The ins and outs of the game mechanics do take some time to understand, but once you do figure stuff out the game just gets better and better. I wish I had a game like this on my SNES when I was a kid.			"

												It's a nice game, don't get me wrong.But unfortunately, there are many bugs. I hope that maybe in 3-4 updates the devs will finally fix what is REALLY wrong (without adding more problems).If you can have it for a really low price and have some friends to play with you, it could be worth it as long as you don't go higher than destruction difficulty. Even in that case, do not buy all the dlcs.- Corrosive puddles are still a dumb and artificial way to add difficulty. I'm not against a more challenging game but here it's plain boring and game breaking for certain chars that just cannot play higher WH because of this only. No counterplay.- The drops are even worse than before - I'm amazed by this, didn't know it was possible. Less drops of Satanic gear and when it does, it seems like you have less luck to have the synergies.- The inconsistency of toxic mode: it is supposed to evolve with your WH level but you have all the hazards right from the start... sometimes it goes away to scale properly when you reset the map. Drop rates also seems to be worse. Basically not worth it to play this mode for ALL the char. How am I supposed to avoid the explosions/puddles in the tiny rooms of the dungeons/crypts?- Sometimes it is impossible to use the WH portal... always a pleasure to waste money.- Cheaters are roaming free.- The WH keys are so expensive while the WH in itself doesn't give much money... So basically you have to grind destructions bosses and pray to loo the keys. I love grinding but again it is not pleasant as you gain no xp, there is no fun.- If you want to fight higher level bosses in order to have a boost in gear level, it is really frustrating as again, some mechanics have no counterplay. I'm ok with being OneShoted by those bosses but sometimes you have to step back, so you don't know when they are going to use their abilities so you can't avoid them aaaaand you're dead.PS. don't keep your gear in your stash, you never know when it's going to be wiped.

												This game is good and very challenging because of its features and difficulty. If I were to rate this game probably 7/10, well its not that it has a bit like graphics but the gameplay and stuff are cool and exciting. giving it a 7/10 is the best rate I can give for it has more cons than pros =_= (im sorry).Pros:+Easily to Control - easy to control because of the basic keys like W A S D and Arrow Keys. well you may also use the mouse but keyboard and controller option is best for this game.+Different Mobs in every level - this is the one that I like! because mobs differ, other hack & slash games mobs dont differ you keep on fighting the same mob over and over again.+Items - Equipments and relic are found in every field, dungeon, crypt and also the shop which is not found in the town but in the field itself. damn monster i need to finish all of you before the shops opens.Cons:+Relics!!! - Relics are those items that helps your character! but when you die all those relics will vanish. 30+ relics your character has many buffs and effects but after you die back to normal.+Gold Coins - you need coins to buy stuffs - stat, items & relic. but when you die again all of it will vanish. spends 6hours looting and all then die.. ♥♥♥♥ it.+Shop - you can only open the shop after every wave... you also need a key to open it. without it you cannot buy any potion.. and stuff. GOOD LUCK+Potions - Some potion backfires!! haft health bar ... need to kill this monsters... drinks potion... Flies!! WHAT THE! -Died+RESTART - every time you die you restart... I hate it.. no continue.WELL this game is awesome but with some imperfection..I like the game..the items..hate relics..like the effects..I love Bit graphics..not so heavy game..(y) give it a shot! You will totally love this game!			"

												Many things can be said about this game, so I'll just go into the pros and cons.Pros: It's a well done roguelike game.It's spiced up enough that you don't have to stick to one class and be stuck only with that one class. (although...)The game is different each time, as you never know what items you are going to get.Cons: There is an abundant amount of issues with the game that are thankfully constantly being patch, but it can be bothersome from time to time.There is a bit of a paywall to access every single class, but it's slightly understandable.There is very little end game content. Once you've beaten every single boss and stage, it's just going back to grinding.All in all, it's a good game. It's not this special little snowflake of a roguelike, but it's a roguelike done well. 3/5 stars.			"

												I am painfuly giving this game a negative review, because i just can no recommend it anymore. It started out as a fun game, with fun mechanics, a bit varied playstyle, interesting environments and a cool concept, kinda like the binding of isaac. Now i can say for sure that it is just a grindfest. Despite me and my sister got enough playtime out of it and had our fair share of fun, i can not and probably will not play it further, and i dont see investing time in this game worthwhile, hence the negative review.

												Decent game overall with a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac. Like BOI, it has you progressing from area to area defeating monsters while collecting items and coins and building your stats to eventually take on the boss for that area. It also has a fair amount of replayability as you can attempt to go through the game on harder difficulties to unlock achievements. Unlike BOI, it lacks style and flair, as well as some sort of story or setting to hold the game together and to provide motivation to progress or some sort of end-goal to work towards. The latter is not necessarily a must-have for these types of games, but I think it certainly could have been an improvement in this case. In addition, the decision to not explain much and let you figure things out as you go along (again, like Isaac) is fine, but it has issues. The key to letting one figure things out is that one must actually be able to figure things out. In other words, the game doesn't have to hold your hand, but it needs to be intuitive to allow this learning process to happen. Things like referring to the same stat in different ways (mana and energy) will, in general, initially lead to confusion, and gameplay elements such as an empty unexplained chest forever in your inventory (that apparently is only relevant to some unique end-game boss or something) dont mesh well with the decision to let the player figure everything out on their own.There are a few things that I particularly like about the game. For one, I think I actually prefer the way the combat feels in Hero Siege over Binding of Isaac. The hits you land on enemies just feel a bit meatier and a bit more impactful. FIghting through waves of them can be both satisfying and addicting. It's because of this that I probably don't mind too much the grindy nature of the game (a complaint I often see). It's true that the game could use some rebalancing to avoid the need to revisit and battle through the same areas to build stats and items, but I enjoy the combat enough that it's doesn't feel too much like a chore. Building a beefed-up character, by the way, can also be quite satisfying. The other thing I like about the game is its art. I'm a sucker for well-done pixel art, and the visuals in the game are just that. It's not anything mind-blowing, but it gives the game a very clean and sharp look.Overall, I like Hero Siege. It's not amazing, but it's fun enough that I'll probably keep playing it for a while to try to get those achievements. If you like Binding of Isaac, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this to some degree.6/10			"

												PS: Pardon if you are the devs and are spending time trying to balance out and make this game better, just ignore my review and go on with your lives, work hard and make it a good game so I can recommend it. I will correct this review if the game makes up for my expectations in the future.PPS: This review will present some terms adherent to MMORPGs, other games, or just terms that I created since I am lazy to look out for the correct terms to be used. I am going to start this review by poiting out the good sides of this game and why someone would buy it. Then pointing out my opinions (which are mostly negative) on this game based on other similar games I've played, or games with similar mechanics that are pretty referenced within this game.First of all, this game looks very promising, it has many mechanics that may work in the future if more polished, it has many things that would work if the developers spent more time on it  has a pretty good presentation and a good amount of references hidden within, the Character creation looks like Diablo 2, the skill builds work similarly to Diablo 2 too, both mechanically and aesthetically, the way the light goes through the stage after finishing it looks a lot like the Den of Evil from the same game, the game makes lots of references of The Binding of Isaac too, which is another roguelike that has many similar mechanics. I would point both of them as being the main drivers of this game, along with Diablo 3, that has many mechanics ""referenced"", such as the elite enemies, some of them have similar powers, such as Cold Enchanted freezing the player character for some seconds that may kill him, while others may explode and send out a globe of laser that (will, most of the time, if unseen) kill the player character too. I like the way the developers tried to create many classes and how they try to work differently, the necromancer summons minions to aid him, while the Viking goes straight for melee combat doing hard crowd control. The game is separated in acts, just like the now-so-famous Action RPGs, it also resembles old time games such as Smash TV, you wait for the monsters to come, and exterminate them while trying to dodge them and stuff like that. Okay, end of the positive parts.If the developers were trying to make their game similar to The Binding of Isaac + Blizzard Stuff + Pixel Art + Original IdeasGold feels useless for most of the time, while crystals are just ""cash"" that can be used on some pretty cute/cool stuff like hats, it is also used for resetting the character or renaming it, these character features should be free or with small work needed by default to incentive players to change names and try new different builds, but are pretty expensive.Damage done by the player is extremely hard to see, numbers are small and travel too fast, and are also decimal.Hidden traps can be utterly strong without previous knowledge since the player couldn't see them, and are mostly luck based when they spawn, if it hits the player, the mobs or nothing. Grabbing potions on the ground may mean player's death if she happens to grab one that is among the gold/loot while a blood maggot/other strong mob is shooting at you. Since the players stops all animations for extremely valuable 0.5 sec.Some bosses will 1 shot a squishier character with no way to read how much damage they would deal, just like the ""girl spirits""  Annie or Samar, they just spawn going lightning speed toward the player while dealing like 50% damage in 1 hit, no clue what happened and just died. Also, their projectiles don't look like dealing THAT much damage.Voice acting is terrible, wish there was a way to shut it down completely, because there is no way.Now for the main part:The Game feels totally incomplete and unpolished, at times I thought it was a Early Access and had to go to the Store Page to check if it really wasn't. Most of the Controller based commands feel incomplete, e.g.: ""B"" is used to call a new wave, while ""B"" is also used to close the level up menu, if you press B to close the level up menu while you are able to call a wave, it'll do both.Trees and most of the props are just hindering player's vision too much, just too polluted, I know that the intention was to hinder the player, but since the player can't tell what is behind 100% of the trees, sometimes there is a ultra-strong 1 hit killing turret/statue trap and the player can't tell it, just killing the player by full surprise.Most of the ""spheres"" that monsters throw to the sky when dying are broken, blue, red, yellow, they are always off screen unless the player is north of the monster that throws it. Sometimes monsters have ""0"" HP on their bars but still alive, some monsters get stuck on their own paths and cannot reach me going forwards and backwards non-stop, somesome bosses are ridiculously easy, like Beketamun, while others need extremely high skill from the player to be able to kill him, like ones that laser around non-stop, bosses like that need a open-area for the player to be able to move, but they walk after the player and sometimes it just means death if summoned on the wrong place. Such as near a Statue Trap.dungeons are like rolling a d20 to see if you get out alive or not, some dungeons may present you with a screenful of godlike enemies on the instant you enter it, the area that the player has to deal with bosses inside dungeons is also pretty small, there is nigh-none space to fight bosses, and there are also bosses that are summoned that are ultra-strong for particularly enclosed spaces.

												It's pretty slow paced. That's the first thing I noticed when I started this game.This rogue like game, Hero Siege is a top down 3rd person shooter/fighter. There are several characters which contain but are not limited to, Viking, Pyromancer, Necromaniac, Lumberjack, Pirate, and more. Each of the classes sport a very unique play style while all typically having a base speed.Items in this game aren't very common to come by, and level progression is fairly simple. Pros:+Several unique classes+Game visuals look good+Interactive environment+Monsters are difficult(ish)+Music is alrightCons:-Voice acting is pretty bad-All dialogue is pretty poorly written-Interface and menus all work like they're meant for controller-Settings menu is pretty sparce-Slow (More of a preference)-Enemies that aren't tough mainly just have a lot of health or you just take too much damage-Progression is kind of slow-Item drop rateWhile the cons seem to outweigh the pros, it's not that bad of a game. It'd be way better if certain elements were fixed such as the shoddy voice acting, level progression, and things that kill you basically immediately without you being able to do much on your part, but I guess that's part of the rogue like genre. Overall, 6/10.			"

												Hero Siege is a good, solid game that doesn't take long to play- but certainly has an incentive for you to pour hours into it if you want. I'll let others talk about the gameplay, which is solid, and i'll focus on this instead-  the things I like about Hero Siege is that the developers are VERY open and responsive to player feedback. Updates/ fixes are frequent. But the guys behind this game also did something that's important to me- that is, the game closes FAST. One of my many points of frustration with a game like Battlefield 4 where spiders have been known to crawl on me and spin webs while i wait for it to fully close. Hero Siege and EVE Online both close within a blink of an eye- to which i am grateful.			"

												Hero Siege is an awesome game.  It is a great time killer with mindless hack n slash and rogue like looting similar to Binding of Isaac.  The melee characters are a little tough to play as a beginner, and ranged classes can be a little too easy for the active player.  Though there is no real story to this, the rpg elements are great.  Leveling, skill trees to costumize your build.  This is well worth the money for rogue like lovers.			"

												Got a 4 Pack and had mad fun for a few days with my friends.Then the devs dropped a big F**K YOU and made the game unplayable patch after patch, adding meaningless content without fixing what already was broken.Crashes, about 10 fps, skills and talents that stop working all the time and one of the worst inventory systems I've ever seen in a game.I'm more sad than angry.

												PS: Pardon if you are the devs and are spending time trying to balance out and make this game better, just ignore my review and go on with your lives, work hard and make it a good game so I can recommend it. I will correct this review if the game makes up for my expectations in the future.PPS: This review will present some terms adherent to MMORPGs, other games, or just terms that I created since I am lazy to look out for the correct terms to be used. I am going to start this review by poiting out the good sides of this game and why someone would buy it. Then pointing out my opinions (which are mostly negative) on this game based on other similar games I've played, or games with similar mechanics that are pretty referenced within this game.First of all, this game looks very promising, it has many mechanics that may work in the future if more polished, it has many things that would work if the developers spent more time on it  has a pretty good presentation and a good amount of references hidden within, the Character creation looks like Diablo 2, the skill builds work similarly to Diablo 2 too, both mechanically and aesthetically, the way the light goes through the stage after finishing it looks a lot like the Den of Evil from the same game, the game makes lots of references of The Binding of Isaac too, which is another roguelike that has many similar mechanics. I would point both of them as being the main drivers of this game, along with Diablo 3, that has many mechanics ""referenced"", such as the elite enemies, some of them have similar powers, such as Cold Enchanted freezing the player character for some seconds that may kill him, while others may explode and send out a globe of laser that (will, most of the time, if unseen) kill the player character too. I like the way the developers tried to create many classes and how they try to work differently, the necromancer summons minions to aid him, while the Viking goes straight for melee combat doing hard crowd control. The game is separated in acts, just like the now-so-famous Action RPGs, it also resembles old time games such as Smash TV, you wait for the monsters to come, and exterminate them while trying to dodge them and stuff like that. Okay, end of the positive parts.If the developers were trying to make their game similar to The Binding of Isaac + Blizzard Stuff + Pixel Art + Original IdeasGold feels useless for most of the time, while crystals are just ""cash"" that can be used on some pretty cute/cool stuff like hats, it is also used for resetting the character or renaming it, these character features should be free or with small work needed by default to incentive players to change names and try new different builds, but are pretty expensive.Damage done by the player is extremely hard to see, numbers are small and travel too fast, and are also decimal.Hidden traps can be utterly strong without previous knowledge since the player couldn't see them, and are mostly luck based when they spawn, if it hits the player, the mobs or nothing. Grabbing potions on the ground may mean player's death if she happens to grab one that is among the gold/loot while a blood maggot/other strong mob is shooting at you. Since the players stops all animations for extremely valuable 0.5 sec.Some bosses will 1 shot a squishier character with no way to read how much damage they would deal, just like the ""girl spirits""  Annie or Samar, they just spawn going lightning speed toward the player while dealing like 50% damage in 1 hit, no clue what happened and just died. Also, their projectiles don't look like dealing THAT much damage.Voice acting is terrible, wish there was a way to shut it down completely, because there is no way.Now for the main part:The Game feels totally incomplete and unpolished, at times I thought it was a Early Access and had to go to the Store Page to check if it really wasn't. Most of the Controller based commands feel incomplete, e.g.: ""B"" is used to call a new wave, while ""B"" is also used to close the level up menu, if you press B to close the level up menu while you are able to call a wave, it'll do both.Trees and most of the props are just hindering player's vision too much, just too polluted, I know that the intention was to hinder the player, but since the player can't tell what is behind 100% of the trees, sometimes there is a ultra-strong 1 hit killing turret/statue trap and the player can't tell it, just killing the player by full surprise.Most of the ""spheres"" that monsters throw to the sky when dying are broken, blue, red, yellow, they are always off screen unless the player is north of the monster that throws it. Sometimes monsters have ""0"" HP on their bars but still alive, some monsters get stuck on their own paths and cannot reach me going forwards and backwards non-stop, somesome bosses are ridiculously easy, like Beketamun, while others need extremely high skill from the player to be able to kill him, like ones that laser around non-stop, bosses like that need a open-area for the player to be able to move, but they walk after the player and sometimes it just means death if summoned on the wrong place. Such as near a Statue Trap.dungeons are like rolling a d20 to see if you get out alive or not, some dungeons may present you with a screenful of godlike enemies on the instant you enter it, the area that the player has to deal with bosses inside dungeons is also pretty small, there is nigh-none space to fight bosses, and there are also bosses that are summoned that are ultra-strong for particularly enclosed spaces. There are also other dungeons that may be empty with a free treasure for the player with just some small puzzle before it. Entering dungeons is just too high of a risk for lower leveled characters, since the chances of dying because of a unlucky boss or unlucky room are very high. While it may present free relics for higher leveled characters, it just stacks with the grind needed to become ""successful"".So far most of my deaths have been to the Blue Sphere on-kill effect from monsters, I've played plenty of Diablo 3 to know where this mechanic came from, so, In Diablo 3, sometimes monsters had the ""Arcane Enchanted"" property, which happens to be a similar mechanic, when they die, they leave a purple sphere on the place of their death, which exists for 1 second before firing a ""laser needle"" which spins and deals huge damage, the main problem with Hero Siege's ""Arcane Enchanted"" is that it is only a sphere that's thrown out of screen at the monster's death, when it comes back it is already firing the laser, seeing the shadow of the ball is pretty difficult considering the amount of trees, grass, monsters and shots on the screen, most of the time it is instant death for the player if it happens to fall on his head, that is if no traps spawn on the player's feet insta killing.- It seems to me that the Devs didn't play their own game before releasing 1.0, or if they did and enjoyed it, they must have a pretty taste for artificial difficulty. Some bosses can kill you while on their death animations, due to the lightning globes that keep spawning when the player damages them while they are dying.most sprites are far from being user friendly, since it's hard to tell what's ""friendly particle"" to a ""foe particle"".- There is no catalogue to check the item list, I know that the Twin Blades give me Critical Chance, but how much Crit%?

If this is intentional, it feels pretty odd when playing.There is almost no room for faults since most of the stuff will 1-hit the player, I know that the developers must've made it their way, but when playing on hardcore it is just too unforgiving.tl;dr: dont buy it, too luck/grind based instead of skill, unpolished, broken mechanics sluggishly borrowed from other games.

												I would like to recommend this, but honestly I can't. Even for its ""low"" price. Even if it's an indie game, assuming that indie games have lower budget and they can be imperfect. This game is far from perfect.I initially bought this game because of my friend who also bought it. There was a nice discount so I was like ""well, whatever"". I like rogue-like/rpg games (even when it comes to modern games of that genre). What's the worst that could happen, this game was cheaper than a pack of cigarettes.When I first played the game it was a really nice experience. There is a few classes to choose from (like 10), each with different skill/perk set and stats, look etc. It's nice to have this kind of diversity. So I started playing the game.This game is pretty simple and kinda reminds me of Binding of Isaac (it's not a carbon copy though, but you can see the inspiration). The difference is you don't get rooms with enemies, they come in waves, also you get levels. But still you get temporary boosts (potions) and 1-run boosts (relics). In addition you can also have a minion and a ""charm"" which is a stat item.Talking about gameplay: it's repetitive but a game can have replayability of sorts. You get few different bosses and enemies, they get tougher, some get affixes (special abilities), you develop your hero, get new relics and such. But there isn't really much fun about it. It's a shame, but I'll talk about a few things in detail in a second.Unlocks: Mostly consisting of areas and difficulty levels. The latter seems obvious, as for the first: often I feel like the areas are almost the same but with ground colored in white/green/yellow, even some statues/models are reused, and I really didn't expect that. You also get relics which are fun but some seem overpowered for the moment and often you feel like there's little control over them. Also I've never felt like ""gee I would like to get X now to make this run better/more fun"". Isn't that exactly the opposite of what SHOULD be happening?Hero development: You get levels and new skills abilities but the descriptions are really confusing and it often feels like some of the perks are underwhelming which shouldn't ever happen in such a game. Again, I didn't feel any urge to level up in any other way than ""this will maybe improve my fighting capabilities by 0.05% yay"". I get that some of the perks are better, some are worse, some will only work with enough attack speed/damage, but still...Mechanics/gameplay: Ok I thought the game was simple enough to never touch this subject,  but... Controls in the game are really sketchy, honestly. One of the things is that you get to use the mouse in game, you see the cursor while playing, but still you control and attack with WASD and arrows. Kinda strange, but ok, let's say that's the way this game is made, it's not bad, just a bit confusing at start. On the other hand you can go to the right and attack to the left, which is cool for kiting with ranged heroes (and melee as well). But if you use a directed active skill it will still shoot in the direction you're going, not the direction you're currently facing, which is REALLY annoying. Sometimes you can't tell if there's a wall on your way, or you're gonna pass right through.Audio: The voice acting is terrible and I feel it would be way better if they didn't even bother recording the voice lines. There's a few of them and you hear the same line over and over again. Most of the responses are super edgy even though it doesn't fit the design (that's the way I feel about it). Other than that the audible part of the game is OK, nothing to complain about.Graphics: It's ok, pseudo-retro-ish style like in many indie games released in past 3-4 years. But still, as mentioned before they could've made the areas a bit more interesting and varied. I didn't mention some of the projectiles are really tricky to see/recognize, but I'm not sure if that's how it was supposed to be. My humble opinion: they should be easy to spot, but hard to dodge/avoid.Multiplayer/additional content: This is where it gets really though... Due to lack of replayability factor (other than mindless grinding, which ends quickly because you have only 9 abilities per hero to discover) I wanted to ask myself what content is there waiting for me, but there isn't really much about the game. I was really so bored after playing for 1.5 hour (I felt like I've seen everything) I wanted some confirmation about this, and my friends actually confirmed there's not much more to this game than what I've already seen. Co-op would be fun, but you can either play local co-op or you have to... PAY FOR THE DLC. I mean jesus, the 2 DLCs this game has cost more than the game itself and one of them is pretty much a MUST HAVE if you want to play with your friends over the internet. This really sucks.Conclusion/TL;DR: It's not really that bad, it has a lot of flaws, but it's somewhat playable, just really boring after a short session, unless you LOVE doing the same thing over and over again, but you could be playing any other game of the genre and most probably have more fun. It's really repetitive, there isn't much of a reward for playing. There's a lot of stuff unlocked with the DLCs (like multiplayer) so consider the price for the game + dlcs as a full product price. I personally felt like the game I bought was just the demo and a way to ""hype"" me into buying the additional content. I didn't get hyped at all. Game sucks.			"

												Got this game in a Humble Bundle a while back. I've been playing it since before the online patch was added, and it's been a great experiance. For this companies first game, it has everything you look for in a fun top down roguelike-ish RPG. The classes are ballanced pretty well. The level/dungeon Randomization, items, and pickup's are great and make the game different with each playthough. The multiplayer can be buggy at times, but it's been improved with each patch, and is getting a lot better.8/10			"

												Man seriously this game is awesome,it really worth it's cheap price,but you need to think some things before buy it.It's a really dificult game,and is not an AAA game, it's been made by 2 people.But if you like roguelike and indie games it's really a good alternative when you don't have much money to spend on a game with a huge duration of gameplay,here i will leave the pros and cons of the game-It's cheap+-It's Dlc's are awesome,cheap and with really good content+-The multiplayer is really funy to play+-It's difficulty is awesome and defying+-Large amount of random items to pickup+-It's difficult(yes i'm putting this here because for casual players is annoying)--It's in dev so rarely will occour bugs-Multiplayer isn't finished-Sorry if i had an bad english i'm BR			"

												Difficult, unpredictable, gets worse with every update.I don't know at what point the developers for Hero Siege decided to make their game even more random than it already was, as well as severely nerfing skills (seriously Pyromancer now only has a CHANCE to fire an extra fireball instead of it happening constantly?) and generally making the game feel like a chore to play, but it has gone from being a genuinely fun roguelike-shooter hybrid to being a frustrating mess of a game.Why can't we use crystals anymore to buy a random item at the start of the game? Why if a dungeon or a crypt spawns at the start of the game can you not enter it when the wave finishes? Why are the enemy-kill reactive bombs still FAR too fast (seriously if I get 1-shot by a laser that I literally cannot avoid due to not being able to outrun it, then it is just outright unfair game design). Then we get to the issue whereby upgrading stats and skills is just a bit pointless. By the time they get to a place where they're having a significant effect on how the character plays with zero artifacts, I've already grown bored of playing that character because of the lack of variety in the first place.Used to be fun, now it's overly difficult to the point of frustration because of how random it can be at times.EDIT: Went back to play the game once after writing this review. Had pretty low health and a wave had just finished. Dune rat pops out of absolutely nowhere and kills me. Yeah, I'll catch up with this game in another year or so and hopefully they'll have added some serious balance changes/QOL changes to it.			"

												For any of you reluctant to buy this:Dude. This game is honestly the game i've been trying to find for months.1) Really fun and easy gameplay2) XP Based level-up systems3) Hidden stuff to find4) Actually has fairly good voice acting5) Addictive (I bought this and it immediately ate up 2 hrs of my time)6) The soundtrack and overall audio of this game is very well done and fitting7) The boss fights are fun to play, hard as ballz, but you level up often enough and get enough skills so you look at the boss and say ""awww f**k"" buy then look at your skills and say ""Get ready to get your sh*t rocked""8) The enemy designs are stylized (<- dunno how to spell that) and very pleasing 9) This game is exactly what i want. A pixelized game that isnt pixelized because lack of technology such as in the SNES or N64 era even, but because they can use *today's* tech and make a pixelated game that just runs smooth and is exceedingly fun to play. I had like $0.30 in my steam account since i bought other stuff beforehand, so i sold a few extra cards i had; no biggie. Then i found this game was only like $1.50 or so during steam sale. For a buck fifty; hell yeah this game is worth it. For it's normal $6 price? Completely worth it. Everytime i play and eventually die, it only makes me want to keep going because it was always my mistake. I've encountered no game-breaking or player-killing bugs, its only and always me using the wrong move or walking into a bad spot filled with enemies. Will i buy the DLC? I see no reason not too :DRating: 9.5/10My only gripe with this game? They really want you to buy the DLC XDThey show you cool characters (er, *cooler* characters) at the create-a-class screen and i was trying to click this one character before i realized the big fat ""DLC"" thing above it ;~;but you do get like 2 characters in addition to the maps and other items they added in the game, so you aren't buying *just* the character like some games *cough cough* mobile games *cough cough*I plan to buy the DLC not because i want the cool character (BY THE WAY all the characters are really cool and have skills and movesets that are applicable and fitting)  but bc i want those extra maps and items and stuff to mess around with in my downtime. All in all: for an indie game, this proves how much better this genre can be than mainstream/headline game companies. You will not regret buying it :3			"

TL;DR+ the game is ok- the dev have/had a questionable update and pr policy- the 0 tolerance against cheaters Dev ended up getting VACed- followed by cencorship and banning people in the forums without giving real reasons or explanations**to be fair, he tried to explain himself but I still haven't got an sufficient reason/explanationBut please read the whole review, to unterstand my standpoint. (WoT inc.)another user about this game: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012878741/recommended/269210/DISCLAIMER: My english sucks. sry, but I had to write this review ;)I owned this game for a long time, the summer sale reminded me to write a review about it.Not only have I played this game, but I also spent hours in the forums and got to know the dev behind the game.positiveFirst I have to say, that i like this kind of games. The first hours where really fun to play and back then, new updates where coming from time to time. (atleast in the beginning)Later the game was a bit of an grind, but many gameplay mechanics have changed since, so maybe this isn't true anymore. There where new and creative ideas and the community and devs seemed very nice at first.negative Now to the negative part and why I wouldn't recommend this game.First thing are the updates. Now It seems like they are updating this game again, but before they had a slightly different update policy.Back then they concentrated more on releasing DLC and didn't cared much about fixing major bugs. The last time I played this game they wheren't caring about bugfixes at all.This isn't the most significant point and probably I would even have given this game a good rating but here is the reason why I didn't:the dev(s)At first he seemed very nice (back then it was mostly VeXoriaN, who replied in the forums).I had a few discussions on the forum. One was about anti cheat and how they handle it.In the veginning, everyone seemed very objective and logic, but after some times, things got heated up.People where constantly swearing at each other (=toxic community (atleast in my eyes))The dev was always talking about how he is 100% against cheaters. And how strict he's about it.And then.., once there came the day where, the dev got VAC banned.After that, his behaviour drastically changed.1. He immediately switched the dev account for the game so none would see the ban.2. He deleted many threads and re created them with the new account to get the old one out of the systemAnd also to hide his and other peoples old discussions about cheating.3. He closed (nearly) all threads, so no one could comment about the incident without going off-topic4. When creating threads about it, with completeley objective, non offensive posts, he cencored (/deleted) them right away5. Even threads, asking about the cencorship got deleted in minutes6. He even banned people (including me) from the forums for demonstrably no reason.*And even after a Steam-Moderator asked him to atleast add a reason to the ban, he only gave a short insufficient answer, not answering any questions.Hopefully you can now understand better why i can't recommend this game.Hopefully this review doesn't get deleted in seconds. (Back then, they did all to keep their reputation up.)   For the ones, really interested in the accounts, here you go.OLD (VAC): http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198173985485NEW: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198275198996Rules and Guidelines For Steam Reviews:Flame or insult other membersPost personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, email, phone number, etc.)I think I'm not hurting any of these rules.These accounts are/where dev accounts. They are more the public representation of the company than their 'private' user-accounts.So posting them shouldn't be a problem.conclusionI finally want to close this. This review is my summary of the whole topic and how I think about it.Other people, other pinions..However, in spite of all that, they still are nice game(s), keep it up Vex :)			"

												Hero Siege is a great 2-player local coop game.In Hero Siege, you fight wave after wave of enemies, then fight a boss, then do it again in the next world.  While that sounds like a game that has been made 1000 times before, Hero Siege does it really well.  Each player can choose one of eight heroes, each with their own special abilities.  You level up your hero by killing enemies, increasing your stats and learning new abilities.  Those stats/abilities are permanent.Additionally, in each playthrough you find gold and artifacts.  The gold can be used to buy potions or increase your stats more (for that playthrough only), and the artifacts give you further stat-boosts, or sometimes special abilities.  These temporary stat boosts count much more than the permanent ones.  The net result is that, while leveling up your characters definitely does help, the outcome of a given playthrough depends much more on how well you played.  It's entirely possible (though extremely difficult) to beat the game on your first playthrough.There are enough different artifacts/enemies to keep the game interesting through multiple playthroughs.The downside is that the game is currently extremely buggy.  During 10 hours of gameplay, we encountered 3 game-breaking bugs which set us back several hours each, along with countless other less serious bugs.  We played local-coop; the developer recently (mid-July 2014) released an experimental online coop mode, which I've heard is even buggier.Fortunately, the developer is very active on the forums, and has promised to continue fixing the bugs people find.  The latest bugfix was currently 4 days ago, so he seemed to be making good on his word.EDIT April 2015: We tried playing again today.  The majority of the bugs we found a year ago have been fixed, but have unfortunately been replaced by a whole slew of new bugs.  The game is still unbeatable, entirely because the game still crashes after several hours of play, and doesn't correctly save your relics.The developer still seems to be active, which is good.  And this game is a TON of fun.  Just be prepared to lose your game at any time due to the massive number of bugs.			"

												Its a big  9.5/10.   TL;DR :    + Really really nice pixel art + Big variety of everything, you'll never get bored playing this game + Good mechanics, a little little wonky on gamepad but you customize it + Basically the perfect hack n' slash ++ Devs are always present and here to help you. You can tell how much they love the game. - DLC's, they add a lot, like new classes,maps relics etc. But they're cheap and it wont affect the game that much, really. You'll have the same amount of fun. - Bugs, crashes etc. A month ago a new patch screwed up the whole coding but they already fixed basically everything with the help of the community, again, the devs are present. Dont worry about bugs&etc.  Long/Detailed Review This might be one one my favorite games i own here. I played this game a lot offline/at friends houses but i eventually bought it because i was so fissured in it jesus christ help this game is so good.Basically you pick your hero and your only purpose is to live, and let me tell you, its going to be hard sometimes. You run around the stage, dodge some traps, kill monsters, get sweet relics and level up. All you need to do is to live trough all waves and beat the boss. And trust me, you'll do that for hours, the game really knows how to keep you entretained.There's a variety of everything here relics, stages, skills/builds, bosses, charms, buffs, mobs, costumes, everything. The game can be pretty hard, and pretty long. But not boring at all, you'll always be able to go to dungeons, crypts and special stages that gives a really nice touch to the game. The voice acting is kinda cool too, you really get what your class/character feels. The (pixel-)art is pretty, it really pays off very well in the scenario and on the character/game design in general. The mechanics are amazing too, the game is pretty simple but at the same time you need to be aware of everything that is happening, otherwise you'll end up dead because a giant spiked block hit you.   HOWEVER  Nothing is perfect, the only thing i cant not talk about here is that you WILL NEED patience with the game. There are lots of crashes and bugs that will drive you nuts, but dont worry. The  game devs  are always up to date and  present in the community .  They will quickly release a patch to fix anything, hell, some days they've even released 3 patchs.  I believe the game is on its way to be a 10/10. But really,  buy it. Its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.  "

												tl;dr - only the graphics are goodIt's another two-stick shooter where you try to survive waves of enemies and level up your abilities. The decent art disguises how amateurish the game feels. I tried playing as the redneck class (to take back 'Merrikuh from the monsters). There was no description of how the different classes play, so I was confused to find my controller vibrating at full power and the attack button (there IS at least a controller map) not working. I was eventually able to start attacking (the redneck swings his chainsaw just like a sword... did I mention how limited the animations are?) and figured out that the redneck has to take a minute to pull the ripcord on his chainsaw at the start of a fight. I think. Again, there's no warning about this, no cord-pulling animation, no proper sound effect of a chainsaw starting up, just vibration and a disabled attack button.Oh, and I unlocked a molotov cocktail attack that you use by aiming with the right thumbstick and then launch by clicking in the thumbstick. That sounds like a terrible, awkward way to aim an attack because it *IS*.I enjoy other games like this in small doses, and I don't mind simple graphics (I bought both of the Zombie Estate xbox indie games) but this has severe design flaws and just isn't fun. Many of the reviews are positive and one specifically mentions that it takes a few hours to get the feel of this game, but I'm not going to give it the benefit of the doubt.			"

												The game itself is kind of good, what annoys me about it is how the devs treat it.The changes in updates seem sometimes very random: remove Attackspeedboosts from items, add Attackspeedboosts to items again after noticing some characters do not work without such boosts and so on.This in itself would not a that big of a problem, BUT they wipe out your equipment nearly every update, instead of tweak their stats. In a game where items make up 99% of the power of your character, it's basically a characterwipe.This would be okay IF the game would be in Early Access, but it does not seem to be anymore, so wtf?

They claim to be ""against AAA"" but subscribe to all the same sketchy, borderline unethical, money grab tactics that AAA devs do. Dev is also a jerk in forums. A qoute:""There is way too much content in the game for us to keep track of, this is just standard stuff that happens with major patches. We do have a game tester but its really hard to keep everything in mind when working on something since we are more like hobbyists and have zero project management.""If you're selling something for money, you're not a hobbist.

												Here is a genre I like very much. You don’t need to solve puzzles or be scared of being lost on a big map, you don’t need to struggle with complex RPG elements… All you need to do is to focus on the carnage! It is said to be roguelike but doesn’t roguelike mean turn-based? Hero Siege is not turn-based, quite the opposite, it is a fast-paced game. There are some simple RPG elements; you level up when you earn enough experience killing monsters, you gain talent/ability points and spend them however you like when you level up, you can carry an item and you can buy something from hidden shops. It is just the way I like in such a game. I would define Hero Siege as hack and slash.			"

Don't deny it, though. You're willing to throw down another half hour, for another attempt at killing that first boss that you've only gotten through twice, only to be killed by a wave in the next zone minutes later.This game is fun, classes are unique, the idea is simple, and it has multplayer.

												Do you want to play Diablo 2, except with more monotony and terrible balance?  This game is for you.  It's good for a number of hours if you enjoy top-down hack'n'slash style games.  As as added bonus, this features an itemization system similar to Binding of Isaac, except with content ripped off from many other popular games (mostly Diablo).Haven't tried multiplayer, and I have no desire to until balance is fixed.  There's an option to start in a later act, but it's practically useless unless you're an absurdly high level and only serves to make beating the game more difficult, edging on impossible.I can't recommend this game until balance changes are made and original content is developed.  I feel like I'm playing a crappy Diablo 2, which is a travesty.			"

												You have to fight waves of monsters, dodge mean traps, clear dungeons and crypts, beat amazing bosses and avoid your own death!This is another great roguelike game which i want to recommend. You can choose between a couple of classes and some of them have a very different playstyle to each other. Beside this, you have a levelsystem with multiple possibilities to spend your abilitypoints. It has enough different difficulties, so that it wont get boring after the first few hours. I can really enjoy the graphics, it reminds me of some other old 2D-games. Also you will discover some refferences to other games, so maybe you will even get an extra smile, when you receive the next item from the last bossfight.More interesting than this is probably the fact, that it has a nice local coop mode (and its fully supported for xbox360 controllers and personally I really love to play Hero Siege with using them). But even when you cant get some friend over for a local session, theres still an online coop mode - so in worst case you can still play with some stranger around the world. Last but not least, the developers didnt abandon their game and they are updating all the time (fixing bugs but also granding new content).			"

												  This game is a blend of Diablo 2 and The Binding of Isaac, or, in other words, Hack 'n' Slash with Rogue-like elements. What I'm getting at is that it's got randomized enemies, dungeon-crawling and gold hoarding like from an old Diablo game, yet it has randomized ""pills"" (potions) and gameplay-changing relics as seen in The Binding of Isaac. I like it. The game is also light in content, meaning that it's not supposed to be taken seriously, e.g. such over-the-top serious voice-acting, that it makes you cringe, etc.Up-sides of the game:+Something new: Hack 'n' Slash meets Rogue-like+Humorous voice-acting (some may disagree with this one)+Randomized enemies, each stage may have different bosses, etc.+Randomized potions, powerful relics+Lots of character classes, each with their own skills and skill-builds  What I didn't like about the game is that it didn't have much to offer, as in, all levels were limited to a box-shaped fortress which you couldn't leave, all the gold you hoarded gave you little help (you may ocassionally buy a Full-Restore potion, which is by far the best use for gold, or buy an AttackSpeed-Boost potion to help you take down a boss quicker) but I'd really like to see some other use for the gold I gather rather than just spending it on potions. The game also has lots of grinding to get the higher levels of your character, and when you eventually get strong enough, the early levels become a total bore.Down-sides of the game:-Little use for gold-Game is a grindfest, but you overpower your foe fairly quickly-Boring base levels (Dungeons and Crypts are a bit more random)-Game doesn't keep giving you fresh content for longOverall I'd give this game about 5.5/10, it's pretty ""meh-diocre""My advice, if you sometimes need to waste a couple a' minutes and see this game for a cheap price, get it. Otherwise? No. I don't think buying this game will pay off as you won't play an hour for every buck you spent on it buying it full-priced.			"

												WELL, it's a fun enough game, if you can manage to play for a long time without experiencing a crash. I enjoyed this far more than Binding of Isaac, but it does have the same kind of feel.The characters are pretty interesting, as are the relics implemented. Your accessories, the aesthetic stuff, are purchased through crystals, not microtransaction based AFAIK.The downside to this game: well, there's many crashes, as I said earlier. I sunk 5 hours into my Marksman, and experienced my first freeze, had to close via Task Manager and lost everything. There's no autosave, so if you enter through a portal to the next level, you'd best hope you don't have a horde waiting for you, and have to pop all your cooldowns, because odds are, one of those times, you're going to crash. It has happened twice now, the other being after the annoyance at losing my stuff, only to see it happen again, this time as a fatal coding error.But, you know, for $2, it's a good time consumer. Takes me back to early hack'n'slash fun. Give it a shot, while it's on the severe discount, you may enjoy it and experience no crashes whatsoever.			"

												I would like to recommend this game. I really would.The concept and initial gameplay are fun. The characters are fun. There is some initial frustration with new characters, but level up a few times and everything usually starts to even out. And for a while, the game is fun.HOWEVER, the game is unstable and although the store page won't tell you this (at least not at the time of this writing), it's still in the beta development stage. The developer is still publishing updates that contain potentially crippling game changes. There are enough bugs and other issues to render this game entirely unplayable.So, no. I cannot recommend this game. If you must buy it, wait until it goes on sale at a deep discount.			"

												Hero siege is an awsome game. Honestly I didn't played Rogue-Like enough,but since I started HS,I was like why not. I had some problems at the beginning but I started to like the game.You just have to survive waves of monsters and kill a boss at the end. you collect equipments,weapons etc... you can compare the items you got in your inventory with stuff you have already equipped and that's really nice. you gain levels,you have stats,skills. you don't need to worry about them,you can reset. I recommand also the DLC because they have more stuff,well the Dlcs was kinda a bit bugged but now it's ok. I can go to act VI without any bug. The devs are only 3-4 people working on that and I can't blame them,they're doing great with regular updates(If someone say they don't fix their bugs,they are stupid). I bought that game long time ago,I was about to say : Oh my god so many bugs,I can't play ! then the updates came with major fix. I came back and i'm glad I did.-Multiplayer: I don't like the port forward stuff,because many people don't know how too,they use IP for host also,and i hope the official server for play with people will be ready soon			"

												To be honest. I think this game should be placed in category ""Serious-Sam-Like"" Instead of ""Rogue-Like"".I understand that you die and It's game over, start again from zero.The difficulty in this game isn't ""VERY HARD"". I would say It's more like ""SOFT-ROGUE-LIKE"" where you have a lot of space and you can go around.There is a customization menu where you can add a hat to your character. It's a good addition to the game (It's free).This game is of course an iOS port. This means, mobile version was first and now It's on Steam.There was a controversy about ""why game is expensive?"" or ""why do we have to pay more for something that is free?"" simply because Devs ""gently"" asks for support that they've made so far and going to make more.I'm not sure about iOS version being still updated (never played it). What It need is a Online-Coop and it might much better game.You decide If Its really worth your money.			"

												Hero Siege is a surprisingly fun & addictive game that I never expected to enjoy half as much as I have. It combined elements of old school arcade games with dungeon crawls and implements the grind factor in without making the game overly drab or repetitive. The level design are challenging and albeit frustrating as hell whilst the character design is charming and the enemies are plentiful in the variants for this neat little game. If you picked this up in a bundle, I recommend dumping a few hours on it when you feel a bit of casual play. If not, it’s not an awful RRP for the game but I’d say it was worth no more than it’s Appstore counterpart at $2-$3.  "

												What we have here is a fairly decent start to a roguelike that quickly gets consumed by its own weaknesses. You start every game at the beginning: great. You can upgrade your character through progression: super. Your upgrades stay with you when you restart: just what I wanted.After that though, we encounter the two biggest design flaws for the game. First, the ratio of player power to enemy power doesn't follow appropriately and you soon find yourself in a situation where the enemies are far too powerful. Second, the fact that you can only fire in four directions means you are severely limited in what you can hit at any given time; plus, enemies have no such restriction, making the design choice questionable at best. The combination of these two things means there is a definite ""correct build"" that you must go through to get very far into the game, which for this type of game reduces player agency in their progression.The graphics are very well done, with high-quality pixel art and a great palette. There's never any confusion because of graphics as to what's going on, with the slight exception that it can be difficult to see your character or other enemies when they're behind something, like a tree, even with the fade out of the object. Not sure what the fix is to this, but it's only just ""okay"" as it is.The sound feels powerful and the music is good, but not terribly memorable. All in all, the game starts off letting you feel like you're doing very well but quickly descends into an exercise in futility. After a point, you never really feel very powerful any more and you just see the progression as a chore. That's unfortunate because there's a lot of potential here.All in all I don't think I can recommend the game, not because it isn't fun for a while, but more because it should be fun for a lot longer and isn't. The difficulty curve doesn't track in a way that pushes you to keep coming back, but instead punishes you for doing well early on, punishes you for minor mistakes, punishes you for not being able to see behind objects, and punishes you if you've made the wrong build along the way.If there were a ""maybe"" button, I'd select that. Since I can't, I'd say skip this and go for any number of other games like it that are better.			"

												PC gaming and pc gamers in general have always been a very mature and humble crowd. For years we have been content with our simple and plain steam interface, and we sure as hell don't buy into the flashy advertisements or gold lettering of""Xbox live gold"". And you certainly never see advertisements tacked all over steams borders.So for me to open a PC game on steam and see two huge advertisements ""BUY NOW ON APPSTORE, BUY NOW ON ANDROID STORE"" really just rubs me the wrong way. Is this the begging of the end? Are we going to allow this? This is the heart of mobile appstore freemium brought right to our doorstep. Next we are probably going to start seeing all sorts of mobile apps make their way to steam (Have you seen greenlight lately?)...Heck we are probably start going to get free ""Lite"" versions of games as well.And im not just saying this because i saw an advertisement and jumped to conclusions, i saw first hand what a freemium deathtrap this game is. In fact, it's almost insulting how much of a freemium deathtrap this game is. This should never have surfaced to the pc. This belongs in the appstore for 9 year old to go crazy on spending their moms money. This game exists with the SOLE INTENTION of sucking every last hour and penny out of its player. It's strategically created to NEVER give the player the satisfaction they desire. It is  scientifically crafted to keep the user within an arms reach of recieving satisfaction at all time.. No matter how much you play this game it becomes very clear that the only way you will be able to sink your teeth into it is if you have 1. Hundreds of hours and a credit card locked and loaded.I purchased this game expecting it to be some quick and easy fun to get into without much hassle. And based on the way the game presented itself, i expected it to be a light weight simple RPG void of all the mundane and boring aspects of larger RPG games. I just thought it was going to be a cute small little RPG with fast leveling and simple perk choosing with quick and easy satisfaction.. NOPE.After just a short while of playing this game it becomes very clear that the only way you will ever get an ounce of satisfaction out of this game is if you invest THOUSANDS of hours and dollars into it.This is PC gaming folks, please open your eyes. Don't let this freemium app garbage invade our respectable PC community			"

												In Hero Siege, you play as a hero capable of destroying a vast amount of monsters while running backwards... It really is a heroic feat, and you should be proud of that little guy...Beside that, it's a great, fast, challenging rouge-like game I can recommend to almost everyone... It has great loot, very interesting boss battles and blood comparable only to Kill Bill movies... And every time you die, you will be ready for one more session... (just like old ""one more turn"" situations from Civ III)Only downside is probably graphics... Although I am a great fan of pixel graphics, there is something odd here, probably because it was just brought up from mobile devices...However, I absolutely recommend this game...P.S. It has hats!

												Let's skip the gameplay details of Hero Siege, you'll read them elsewhere.Here are my points why you shouldn't miss the opportunity to play this absolutely great (in many aspects) game:Highly addictive, you simply can't stop playing.Almost perfectly balanced for either casual play just for fun and experienced rogue-like players.Repeatitive in a good way, you get familiar with the mechanics and yet, you can change and try other classes.Actively supported by the devs with constant and substantial updates, not just cosmetic fixes.It's rather cheap in recurrent Steam sales.I struggle to find a strong argument against Hero Siege, so i'll mention the irregularly high priced DLCs and the multiplayer which seems to be a bit buggy or not responsive for quite some time. Highly recommended - [9/10]			"

												Initially, i was very hyped about this game, Spent lot of hours playing it, back then game was recently released and i was aware that some bugs may occur. After devs released first DLC for Hero Siege everything went down to drain. Bugs that ""should"" be for people who bought dlc, somehow got into vanilla version and then couldn't unlock new difficulty levels, later that month one of the devs stated that they released patch which ""will"" fix this issue for vanilla version, but in the end turned out to be lies. Stopped playing and took huge break from Hero Siege but i did not delete game.Today i decided to return and enjoy it once more, during break i noticed bunch of frequent updates for Hero Siege. Hopped that they actually fixed issue i had. Launched game, saw some improvements, picked my hero and what i see, all ACTS are locked, i thought okay lets do it, beat ACT I, then started ACT II died at first mini boss, that is fine i still wanted to continue to play, since ACT I is completed you can choose to start from ACT II, but what the hell, game did not register ACT II, which means i have start from ACT I. These are same bugs all over again. I'm so fed up with Hero Siege and will stop support these devs, why? Because it's been year since i got it and it still feels like an Early Access game. I might change this review at some point, but right now it will be as it is.- INTRODUCTION:When The Binding of Isaac meets Diablo 2.- GAMEPLAY:Hero Siege still counts as Rogue like game which means is very brutal, at first you will die a lot and that is normal. Just as soon you will hit first few levels and can get to ACT I boss, then game gets more enjoyable. Choose between 8 playable heroes, each hero has their own unique skills.Every level is like arena and is divided by Acts, at the end of each Act you fight powerful boss.- IS THAT ALL?:Yes, as i meantioned above ""when The Binding of Isaac meets Diablo 2. There is nothing more to be said.- OVERALL:Is it worth to buy Hero Siege? That depends, do you like to encounter obnoxious bugs every time you launch the game? "

												It's a stupid game for people who want to feel better. Waves of enemies are coming in wanting to be slain by you. There is no real challenge, but only leveling your uber character to unknown heights of immortality. You will find such OP items which will take the fun from the game. Imagine you can only just beat the round with 15 ATK and then you find a weapon which gives you +300 ATK ... u_u ... Just shred everything apart without thinking.You can only attack in four directions. Maps are small. I am disappointed, it looked so cool in the trailer. Not what I expected.			"

This review is very long, so skip to the conclusion if you're in a rush! Or you could read everything and know why I came to the conclusion I did.Hero Siege is a fun and wonderfully built game with appealing visuals and appealing music. Unfortunately, not all audio is as stunning as the epic tunes are, because the few voices sound like they were done by a couple people using Audacity to skew their voices to sound like different people, and the sound effects sound like they were done out of the mouth. It's not at all as bad as I'm probably making it sound, but the quality of the sound is no reason at all why you should turn away this game anyways, and allow me to explain why.This game has a steady and solid pace, magnificently enchanting to play at the speed it is, but of course you can change the difficulty. Starting out is the tough part, and even though you are taught mostly everything you should know, what you aren't taught is easily and quickly learned.This game is interesting in many ways. Once you die, you keep your character and the progress you've had with the character, but not your gold or items. You can choose from a set of classes when creating your character. As far as I can tell, the only things that are effected by the class you choose are the sets of powers you can achieve and upgrade, and your starting attributes. I did not see anything on the class select screen that showed you what class does what. Even then, you can level up whatever powers and attributes you'd like, with their respective points you gain after every level, allowing for you to play however you'd like! A great system for a great game.The maps aren't randomly generated, but the stuff inside them are. Once your epic journey is ended by a skeleton or a clay statue shooting beams at you, or a daring and death defying skid across spikes went awry, you'll know exactly what you've done wrong, and even though it was unfortunate and you'll have to start again from the beginning, you'll still be having fun. You'll be stronger this time around, since you keep your levels, and you'll easily be able to plow through the old enemies again, you'll quickly be where you were interrupted by death.In ConclusionIn the 1.3 hours that I've had with this game so far (as says the steam window), I've had epic and bloody fights with a colossal  eyeball, a mummified corpse with undying gaze, and some plain old rats, which still did not cease to be entertaining, for they all ended in a gory explosion of ribcages and blood scattered across my screen. Even when I died I knew exactly what I did wrong, and I made sure to fix my mistakes next time I got around to where I was.Pros:+ Appealing graphics+ Gameplay that could make Chuck Norris himself shed a tear, but only one because he's Chuck Norris.+ Very quick to learn+ Pick it up and play if you just want a quick game, just be sure not to get too involved or you'll be here for hours.+ Plenty of new monsters and items you'll be just finding out about even hours into the game.+ A lot of classes to pick from+ Most of the hats are references to games (Master Chief helmet, Payday mask, Minecraft head, Pyramid Head, Altair Hood)+ Simple yet complex+ Epic tunes+ There's a frog hat+ BUY THE GAME DUDE+ Fun gameplay+ Frog hatSide notes* Not sure how to get the gems/crystals to customize your character other than the random drop in game, which believe me, is not often. You start with 750 or so.* I saw a ""redeem code"" option in the settings menu. Not sure what the deal is with that.* The game has it's own font, which is super cool.Cons- Some of the audio's a bit ""odd"".- Have to make the trek back from where you died if you die, no matter how long it is, which can get tedious even if you one shot enemies- No character creation, just classesBuy this game. I was so surprised to see this magnificent game for only $5.99. I'm sure you'll hear this a lot, but trust me, this is the most true time you'll hear it: Buy this game, it's worth every penny. This is coming from a kid with no  job, it's the best purchase you'll have ever made on steam. Trust me. If you don't buy this game the next time it's on sale, then I'd be disappointed in you.Just screenshots from the game aren't enough to do it justice, see the game in action, buy it yourself.    tenouttaten![38.media.tumblr.com] "

												At first, I just bought this game because it was on halloween sale for about 1 buck. and trading cards :vFirst, you chose a class for your character, for me it's pirate. Then, you go to the game. Your character started with nothing. This can be pretty hard in the beginning until you level up a bit. The game divided into 6 waves each stage. After you cleared a wave, you got 30 seconds to prepare yourself. You can go to the dungeon and shop in this time. The shop and dungeon randomly generated on the map each time you cleared a stage. A shop requires silver key to open. When you died in the game, you can resume the game on the same wave with reduced HP. The key to clear this game is collecting the relics. The relics greatly boost your stats or give unique special effects, thus it's very important to get these relics. Relics can be obtained from chest (crystal chest has the higest chance to drop relics), clearing a stage, dungeon drop or from shop (usually obtainable for 1000 coins). Each time you level up, you get 2 stats point and a skill point. The objective of this game is to pass until the final wave. On the end of a stage (each 6 waves) you will face special bosses. Boss has special skills that will conduct after a specific time. Beating a boss is pretty easy if you have some relics with you. Pros :Great musicCrisp pixel graphic8 classes to chooseVariative skills and relic's effectsDiffrent difficulty to chooseCons :Online mode requires DLC to playGame turned out pretty easy after you collect the relicsCostumes are a bit hard to collect and some requires DLC to obtainI still reccomend this game even at it's full price.

												Hero Siege is fun for short bursts, but gets incredibly repetitive after a while. Theres not really much to the gameplay besides main attack, use skills,use item and move away from the enemies. Insta-kill traps and OP bosses are incredibly irritating as well. Most of my sessions were either obtaining an OP relic and just mowing down enemies or sudden death from BS traps and there are a LOT of traps. Also,when you pick up a potion it has a random effect and there are potions that reduced my stats permanently or killed me abruptly which adds to the frustration factor. Subsequently, my main complaint is that this game has balancing issues. There was also a glitch I encountered where I was playing local co op and went only to wave 17 I saved and exit then when I went to play solo it had overridden my stage unlocks so I would have to do 80 waves to get to where I was before. However, a part of me still wants to play Hero Siege because at its core its fun, but its plethora of issues make me think twice.   "

												I got into Hero Siege last year close to its release on Steam after seeing a Twitch streamer play it. At the time it was a lot of fun and had great potential. After a few updates and the addition of 2 classes, the game reached its zenith for me. At the time it was an appropriate mix of skill, character progression, and hopefully a little rng luck. However with a little skill and some patience, you could usually win through a run even if you didnt get lucky with items. Then the Karp of Doom expansion came out. I'm not entirely sure what the exact changes were, but i recall attempting to play a game on Normal with my lvl 70 Necromancer (who had previously been in the middle of a good Hell difficulty run which was reset by the update) and i couldnt make it to the first boss due to getting 1-2 shot by traps or the ""bombs"" some enimies drop. I tried to stick with it and give it another chance every couple updates, maybe try multiplayer. To this day, i havn't been able to get a successful multiplayer game started and the game feels more and more RNG luck based. Chars have been nerfed into uselessness, and most of the whole game has been ""rebalanced"" to a degree that i would consider it a different game entirely. I've decided to retire the game indefinately and remember the fun it used to be.			"

												Definetly Worth It!Ok, there are some bad reviews.  However if you look at the big picture, I think they are unjustified. This game is definitely worth the price of admission! First, this isn't a huge developing house pushing out games and running with the cash after the release.This is a small ( 2-3 man ) dedicated team working on sharing their passion with the public.  Second, for the price and replay value, you would be very hard pressed to find a better game.  My logged time ( probably twice what is shown since I play off-line more -- limited internet ) is proof that I keep coming back for more.Third, bug resolution, they do get fixed.  Some may gripe about this and that ( I have done some myself in the heat of the moment - I think we all get a little hot headed when something in a game changes how we play it ) but things do get fixed and changed.The ultimate things to consider are these....Do you have someone or someway to give feedback? -->  Yes Will someone on the other end actually listen to and consider the feedback? -->  Yes Will said feedback be implemented if enough people agree? -->  Yes Does the Development Team  actually care about their product and you? -->  Yes If the answers are  Yes   to the above ( In this case they really are!  Honest Abe! ) then you have found a true GEM!			"

And then the circle goes on and on... Its like they took of all that was fun on Diablo and left only the boring griding shɪt.

I expected alot more of this game, and theres much room for improvment. But for a whopping 0.64$ ( on sale ), you cant possibly go wrong. 6.49 on the other hand... id rather play H1Z1. i give this game a 2/10. Ive played much worse, but this game is pretty bad. This is coming from someone who loves hack and slash / Rogue like games. Buy it on sale, dont pay full price.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER. You cannot play Multiplayer even with something like Hamachi. Game will crash constantly. The monsters can be invisible as well as things like traps (spike balls, and spear traps) can move to the TOWN THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE PEACEFUL. As well as apparently game has had issues like this for a while. Ya it's 50 cents, but it's frustrating unless you're single player.			"

They don't take negative critisicm at all and they are trying to sell a buggy frankly unfinished game in 5 segments, not to mention for each DLC you can pay an extra 2 dollars each time for some lousy hats. It's just a free to play microtransaction game that you pay for to begin with anyway.			"

												Wonderful game! I love it!At first I wasn't sure, but when I load it first time, it looks with very nice graphics and it is this kind of games that begging to be played!So, I start with Nomad (which is really good!) and then went through the first ACT. I died within 5 seconds I think. Then I tried again and again, but still dying very fast!Then I got it!! It is like the old good games! Run Run, then hit, then run run, then hit. I also figured out to use the traps to kill the enemies. That's it, everything else depends on how you move your character!Then I bought the DLCs which add/unlock some contents in the game. So far, it has been a wonderful experience. I don't have any problem with stability or control. I use xbox 360 controller with Windows 10 and a budget nVidia card (GTX 750). Anyway, there is maybe a bug when I played Nomad after updating the game with the DLCs. The enemy’s health was increasing when I hit them!!! But, it might be a curse as I touched the Demon statue! The gameplay is fantastic really. There are many differences between the characters and this affect the way of attacking and defence. It also has many variations of elements and enemies. Well, I don't know why some others rated it negatively but for me (and I'm not that good in action games! ) it is an excellent game and I didn't find it difficult at all, of course at Normal difficulty!

												I have played this game for a short while with friends and will try to make a concise review. Here it goes...This game reflects a few aspects from Diablo and The Binding of Isaac but without the complexity, skill or even a story which those have. My friends and I have crashed several times, once so badly that I lost all of my Relics; gear which is obtained from boses and the shop, and ceased spawing for me after that point. From what I hear, it's normal to die instantly for no apparent reason. I have also crashed for inexplicable reasons for simply running into an item the incorrect way.The in-game servers are horrid if you're trying to play with close friends. Lobbies decide to appear and re-appear when they feel like. Best to use Hamachi or Port-forward if you know how to do so.The art in this game feels uninspired and the music is decent; it fits the mood but often becomes background noise.The character model will often get buried under followers you obtain from bosess and also enemies, explosions, your own abilites, Allies (whom can push you around until you get flight) and hazards which often kill you in a few hits.The Devs clearly want to cash in with he amount of DLC they create and massive lack of bug fixes. That or their incompetence is to blame for the amount of glitches I have seen.---Stay away from this title unless you're bored or masochistic or want to gift this to an enemy.			"

												This game is lots of fun. I don't own any of the DLC, and I'm nowhere near finishing. It's tons of fun and great to play with friends. IF YOU CAN CONNECT. The server system is crap. You can't refresh the list, and sometimes servers just won't be there. Just today one of my friends and I spent 15 minutes: launching servers, relaunching the game, logging in and out of the system, relaunching servers and getting nowhere. If the servers were through Steam, it'd be much better, but it's all run through the company that owns the game. You can't invite people through Steam, or join. This makes it impossible to find them sometimes. Other than that, the game is great. Great little way to mix an item system like Isaac's and the theme of Diablo. It's great fun alone and tons of fun with friends, if you can find them.			"

												Why the ♥♥♥♥ was mana added to this game? So I got the game back in june of 2015, I quite liked it then. My friends and I played it quite a bit, but forgot about it after a while. I come back and there's all this new stuff. Cool right? ♥♥♥♥ no, the mana system is awful. Most abilites take 70-80% of your mana to cast, and it regenerates painfully slow, and the mana pickups you get don't help much, because they usually fall in the middle of hordes of enemies and going to pick them up is suicide. Some people have even claimed their abilites cost more mana than they have (abilites costing 500 mana but only having 400 max). And the reports of devs banning people from forums for simple criticism are true.TL;DR stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game. It's not worth any amount of money.			"

												--- If it's on sale, give it a go. But be warned ---It seems this game has become a huge experiment for the developers. They change random things and then ""patch"" the changes when they realize something wasn't working with it. The player base has become the testers. With the type of no-research, random game-changing patches the devs are doing, this game should definitely be considered Early Access still.When I first played and bought the game and DLC it was fantastic. A friend and I played for hours together and enjoyed it a ton. I played multiplayer with random groups and had a great time leveling my character.Now, every time I play the game it is bugging out. Multiplayer and local coop both have all kinds of bugs where things aren't synced up for all players. The game randomly crashes (way too frequently). Players are dropped from party. Players load into different maps (one in town, one in dungeon, one in level, etc.)All of these kinds of things are CONSISTENTLY a problem with the game and have made it virtually unplayable in any multiplayer or coop capacity. The devs continue to put bandaids on old bugs and add random new things to the game that eventually become old bugs.It's truly sad. I think the game could be freaking amazing if the devs just sat down, wrote a GIGANTIC list of all of the past and current bugs that are still being talked about by players, and addressed ALL of them before continuing new development.I will continue to check back on this game, as I have been, from time to time to see if it has become a complete game. Sadly, it doesn't seem like that will become a reality.			"

												I would just like to thank PAS for helping me through anxiety and just hitting a nerve that is primal. Crack, nah. Heroine, s'aight. I have dreamt about this like it was Tetris. I have related this game to things in my life that really matter. All that aside....This is my favorite game of all time. It has so many subtle touches, when I play it I think I know what the heck is going on, trying to make sense out of the creative team of this game. I watched those guys live stream while they were tweaking some of the overall stats of the game. Just numbers to some but actually honing math to emulate other games. Not a copy, they capture the flow of some of the best out there. Diablo, Isaac, touch of Zelda. I don't know, delightful.There are some bad things. No story, repetitive, not the flashiest. Blah, blah. Who cares?If you feel like a great experience, buy this game. Side note, they ufcked us on the iOs version. It could be great, but the lack of updates, full abandonment of the product, and half-assing the MFi controls, which carried over from previous pc versions (I've spent more time trying to get this game to read a controller on my mac (pc even seems to glitch sometimes, probably my fault. Anyways it'd be nice to hear some accountability from somewhere.Anyways, its great. Deuces...[EDIT]: Support of ultra-wide resolution, perfect frame rate.

												Hero Siege is an interesting game. On the surface it sounds great and makes a lot of sense but the further into it you delve the more mish-mash the whole experience becomes.Graphically the game is great. Characters are designed well and fit the atmosphere niceley, the enemies are well drawn and so are the background elements. Problem is.... the background elements are totally placed randomly throughout the maps (which are poorly designed in and of themselves) which make the levels feel really.... dead. Which is the most serious problem plaguing this game. Nothing about it feels immersive or engaging.The leveling system is a fun twist to the roguelike formula but pretty much means you'll get hammered by the hordes of enemies until you're strong enough to progress. And regardless of how many levels you gain you'll find traps and certain moves constant headaches since they can potentially one-shot you ruining a hundred+ wave game. Furthermore the skills and stats, although novel, feel tacked on and pointless. Your stat points strengthen your character really really slowly, and the skills don't really offer much customization. Sure you can invest in one skill over another but you really don't feel very unique doing so. Maybe if the characters progressed through branching classes or something you'd feel more invested in how you build your character but the current system leaves you wanting more.There are also LOADS of things on the screen that clutter up the experience. Enemies come at you in big clumps and frequently have abilities that leave so many particle effects on the screen that you feel like you're stuck in some sort of horrible particle effect nightmare.Progression in the game is extremely boring, as well. Wave after wave after wave without any change. Sure you can do the occasional dungeon but I feel like the dungeons are way more fun/interesting than the core gameplay.Hero Siege is like a tower defense game with no home base to protect. It is like an RPG without equipment, classes, and storyline. It is a roguelike without unlockable content, mish-mashed graphics, clunky+boring progression and replay value only for the truly dedicated.Not to mention the bugs. Thinking of playing co-op? forget it, for now. The co-op is completely clunky and broken. Online multiplayer has never worked for me so I can't tell if it is more fun than offline (I'm sure it is, if it would work).Having said all that... it is a fun game.I recommend playing this ONLY if you can get it on sale. The 5.99 price point doesn't seem like much but in its current state there are loads of issues with the game. The developers seem interested in fixing things but the list is so long, and the core gameplay so mind-numbingly boring, it may be a long time before we see this product turn into something truly awesome (though the potential is there).

												The game is a pretty decent time killer, aside from the cheesy voice acting and bland writing of the dialogue, there is a lot about this game that irks me. Firstly, I don't have much respect for the fact that the leveling system is a direct rip off of Diablo II, I didn't really like it in D2 and I especially don't like a rip off of it. The games color pallete makes enemy attacks easily blend into the environment, which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't die in 4 hits, There is way too many things going on in the screen to allow the enemy attacks to not stand out very well. Even after completely stat dumping into armor I felt I was way too squishy, even in the early stages of the game. I also don't appreciate the fact that there is no invincibility frames to protect you from getting completely wiped because of a single mistake, due to creep damage or a marksman volley that lasts 7 seconds.One thing that is going to make me *really* want a refund is the fact that I can't revist a save after I exit out of the game, it gets locked and says ""thou shalt not cheat"", unless the game considers me taking a break wildy heinous and wants to completely block me from returning to a character that I just put 4 hours into. There are a few undefined things about this game that bother me, but I'm going to chalk those up to personal taste, this game gets a 3/10 from me.			"

												Great art, great execution, but servers are constantly hacked, the new mana update sucks, and playing online is just a pain. I really really love the style and gameplay here, but recent development choices have killed any interest I had in playing this game long term. A shame.			"

												Have you played Rogue Legacy? 2D side-scrolling action-adventure RPG with perhaps the best rogue-like feature I've seen, alongside The Binding of Isaac.Now here we have Hero Siege. You choose one of 8 playable classes, with many talents to choose from. Relic system similar to The Binding of Isaac can yield buffs for your toon or spell doom for you enemies. Dungeons, crypts, and many other secrets await you in one of four acts, each with multiple stages that never play the same way twice. Buy temporary buffs from gold drops or use it to buy potions to get back in the fray with a renewed thirst for violence. The evil that rises from the lands needs to be dealt with; can you turn the tide of darkness and bring peace through the visceral slaughter of all who stand against you?Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game now, dammit. Multiplayer beta is out.			"

												This is a nice casual past-time, looks like a top-down shooter, but you are confined to a single area and have to fight waves of enemies in order to progress. The game has easy controls that can be mapped, with seperate keys for movement, and another set for shooting (in all directions) so you can for example walk to the left but shoot to the right or downwards. You also can use a couple of specials which are unique per character. These are unlocked as you progress character level. When you die, you keep the character level. This works like in Rogue Legacy and other similar games.The downside of this system is, that for a long while you have to be grinding without making any significant progress. I had to level up my character to around level 18 before I could get past the second boss, ie. wave 12. But after that things went a bit faster. The enemy damage scales with your character level, but the enemies do not. So you can steamroll a couple of levels later on, as long as you avoind being hit.I can recommend the game for a quick in-between, but the grind can be a bit frustrating at times. :6.5/10:			"

												Fantastic game!  Funnest game I have played in a loooonnng time.  It's like Diablo/Fate/dungeon crawlers meets binding of issac.  This game however does have kinks beware!  BEWARE - you cannot gift this game to people from a select list of other countries.  Also the multiplayer is very bugged.  Can't join a party that has the port forwarded :( Also cannot join parties that have people in them already (ie parties with 2/4 or 3/4 players in the group already).  A bit of a bummer considering that this game would be perfect with friends.  Other than that fantastic game.  Wouldn't reccoment to people who want to play only for multiplayer tho, but if you like this kind of game GET IT! You won't be disapointed with the gameplay.Edit: we finally made it work and it was ultra fun but the crypts were ultra buggy so it felt a little rough - regardless was ultra fun in multiplayer too!

												Hero Siege PC –“If Diablo & Binding of Isaac made love, this would be the result”By Joshua Alexander – R Alexis WolfeThe first thing you will notice about Panic Art Studios Hero Siege is that it is saturated in tons of video game, pop culture, and movie references. The flies from Binding of Isaac, Various recreations of famous Diablo & Diablo 3 monsters just to name a few. Navigating the menu is simple either on keyboard and mouse or XBOX 360 controller. The options are limited as this is a “Retro” inspired game. You can change from full screen to windowed as well as tweak the graphics settings and resolution, and sound volumes. Upon pressing start you are asked to pick a character slot and choose a class. Each class has its plus and minuses, which a little play time, will have you figuring out your favorite fast.  Once you create and name your character you will be sent to the act/difficulty selection screen. Normal of course will be the only choice for starting followed by later difficulties being unlocked upon completion of the game.  For anyone expecting a AAA 3D APRG you will be disappointed. The sprites are all lovingly hand created, as well as the sound FX and Music. I found myself really enjoying the music as I battled endless waves of rats, undead minions and angry mages, only to run headfirst into the first randomly picked boss a floating eyeball. Bosses act like your typical raid boss as in they have special abilities and phases and a large life pool. With proper dodging and attacking you can win. Killing the final wave boss rewards you with a ton of gold and a new relic, which players of Binding of Isaac will be familiar with. Levels seem to be randomly generated from a pool of available layouts and the game is great for a quick pick up and play, Long time enjoyment is not a problem either but I can see this getting stale if you try to marathon it to completion. Simply put this is a game you pick up to kill a bunch of monsters spill a bunch of blood and feel better about yourself. And oh there is blood TONS of it. In fact so much blood is in this game that even the boxes bleed and explode into bloody chunks. I did find myself wondering why the hell the boxes bled but I laughed it off as this game is meant to be humorous anyways. With free copies available on the google and apple stores, as well as a currently discounted PC port on steam you can’t go wrong with picking this up. For those playing it on steam it comes with the favorite achievements and trading cards. No excuse to get this and support indie developers. If you are afraid of this becoming another early access DayZ issue you will be okay as the Developer regularly works on this and patches it.  So that brings us to the last part Bugs/issues. From my gameplay time I only noticed a couple non game breaking bugs, the first being that sometimes the character will refuse to attack and just run around doing no damage. This was solved by logging out of the game and restarting it. The second was not a bug but more of a design flaw in my opinion. The UI scales very well on larger screens but the HUD takes up a large portion of the playing field and led to several deaths for me. Maybe implementation of a Scaling option for the UI in the options menu could solve this? All in all I give this an 8.5/10 with most likely the upcoming DLC bringing it to a full 9! Thanks for reading and support the Developers in all their projects!  check out a 10 minute gameplay video here: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=4415977854790&l=7195181521437868516 "

												Fun game, but the coding and save system is really bad, you can cheat so easily :P don't have to buy DLC to play the new class, can unlock most achievements by changing some 0's to 1's.Also, blocking ALL future content behind DLC is really greedy. Extra class / act is fine, but knowing that the content we non-DLC owners have is the most we will get unless we buy DLC, is not good! - I feel that this will go on forever like a DLC every 6 months and a forced purchase if you want new content - DLC should be packed with content instead of this digital sign-up for future content. - Why not just call the DLC - HERO SIEGE 2 ?

												Being a fast-paced run, dodge and hit-game, Hero Siege does almost anything right it has to. I picked it up a while ago and thought I'd really have to look into it. That was an awesome decision! The game is pure fun! You create your character and start killing monsters. Leveling up unlocks various skills to upgrade your character and you can find some pretty nice weapons and trinkets. The game is always fair, you always know what you are up against or why you just died with the controls being very simple. All this together makes for an awesome amound of fun and the ""This time I'm gonan get one level further"" works pretty well.8/10 easily achieved!			"

I think a DLC almost at the same price as the game itself its not ok, and even more if i bought it a month ago, it adds a character, and a new chapter, and every future content, and i will be locked out from all of that (and you if you dont buy it too).Would not have bought it if i knew that, but its my fault for not checking it first.EDIT: AND I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY IT KEEPS DELETING MY FOURTH SLOT!

In my opinion, this game is definitely worth $10 and is a definite pickup!At first the game seems really repetitive and boring but I have seen a noticed subtle changes that make the game different every time.  This game brings an addictive formula that keeps you at your feet constantly.  People complain about the difficulty, which is really an overstatement considering the game is designed for a challange.  All in all, this game is constantly being update to fix any bugs and improving hour by hour.  I would say this game is an 8/10, heading towards 9/10 as it continues to improve.			"

												Overall the game deserves a 9.5/10:Why? Because it's a really enjoyable experience and a frustrating one at the same time, also a + because in a way it reminds me of Diablo. It's a top-down rogue-like experience that I really enjoy and anyone that likes a rogue-like from time to time or all the time will also enjoy. Great overall experience, really fun to play, can keep you entertained for hours so watch the clock when you play. And as I said, I give it a 9.5/10 because I fell in love with the game the first time I played.Would I recommend it? Yes.Is it worth the money? Definitely.Is the DLC any good? If you want more hats and a new class the it is.And another plus side is that multiplayer is being developed for the game so soon (or not that soon) you will be able to kill spiders, rats, tree ents, weird eye things and much more with friends. Do yourself a favour and buy the game.Also did I mention that the game is in a pixelart style? If thats your thing then even better.			"

												Have you played Rogue Legacy? 2D side-scrolling action-adventure RPG with perhaps the best rogue-like feature I've seen, alongside The Binding of Isaac.Now here we have Hero Siege. You choose one of 8 playable classes, with many talents to choose from. Relic system similar to The Binding of Isaac can yield buffs for your toon or spell doom for you enemies. Dungeons, crypts, and many other secrets await you in one of four acts, each with multiple stages that never play the same way twice. Buy temporary buffs from gold drops or use it to buy potions to get back in the fray with a renewed thirst for violence. The evil that rises from the lands needs to be dealt with; can you turn the tide of darkness and bring peace through the visceral slaughter of all who stand against you?Get this ♥♥♥♥ing game now, dammit. Multiplayer beta is out.			"

												I used to really enjoy this game, a bullet hell brawler with punishing difficulty but not too long ago I loaded up my lvl 150 pyro to find they've changed the game so much that I don't find it fun anymore.It used to be that loot dropped and you would have to either wait until the end of the wave(s) to decide whether to equip it or do it during battle.  Instinct told you whether an item was better and you would quickly press A or B to decide.  Now you pick up equipment, it's placed into storage and have to go through a tedious process of deciding whether to equip or sell it.  In theory this would work well except that the loot screen doesn't tell you the full stats for the item, some attributes are missing rendering the whole thing moot.  Also money in the game only has use in the shop so selling items is pretty much pointless since you get enough of it during the waves.The change to have an energy bar has destroyed your talents.  Instead of being on a cooldown timer they now have an energy cost and all draw from the same pool.  I can see that they are trying to go for ""carefully pick which one to use at the right time"" but in reality it means that you only try and use your strongest attack the other 3 are useless.  For a pyro this means you get 2 hydras and then have to wait ages to get another as the energy bar slowly refills.  Enemies will sometimes drop energy pills that refill the bar a little but there is so much flak on screen it's difficult to get to them.You can still get insta-killed by acid spitters and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one hits which is the reason why I stopped playing the game in the first place.Everything seems to be a lot easier as well, even with limited hydras I can still trigger all waves and get through with no hassle.The problem is that this seems to be change for the sake of it but it's still buggy and not well balanced.  There are still times when I wonder what killed me.  The relics still aren't explained.  Keys still drop far too infrequently.  Bosses are still way too easy (I haven't checked if you can still farm them by save scumming).  The energy system is a needless addition that prevents you from having ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments that spamming buttons gets you out of, it has also made useless 3 of your talents. The new loot mechanics are buggy, needless and add little.  You still can't have local multiple player on multiple monitors (so you can push each other off the screen).  Potions are still a hit and miss affair.  You still get killed by the environment more than enemies and the core game I originally enjoyed has gone.And wtf is a wormhole???  The game could explain these things a LOT better.			"

												I love this game. It's a fun, arcade-style roguelike-ish, quasi-twin-stick amalgamation of genres and styles that blends together very, very well. Like others, I was unimpressed at first, but something kept calling me back to the game. I cannot recall (nor find in my email) where I purchased this game, but I'm sure it was a promotion through Steam or an indie site. A gamble that paid off, I found a game that hooked me and kept me coming back. I bought a copy, full price, for a friend of mine. I sang its praises and told him we need to play multiplayer.Well, as you've probably come to find out, multiplayer is a DLC only option (even though it's a main-menu selection). We found that out the hard way, and then I felt like a chump for buying and gifting the game. Any customer experience that leaves the buyer feeling like a chump is just a bad way to do business. I like the game, but don't recommend supporting practices such as these. I'd expect a terrible experience from EA (or similar), but to get the same from a small indie dev is disheartening.			"

												Fun game, but the coding and save system is really bad, you can cheat so easily :P don't have to buy DLC to play the new class, can unlock most achievements by changing some 0's to 1's.Also, blocking ALL future content behind DLC is really greedy. Extra class / act is fine, but knowing that the content we non-DLC owners have is the most we will get unless we buy DLC, is not good! - I feel that this will go on forever like a DLC every 6 months and a forced purchase if you want new content - DLC should be packed with content instead of this digital sign-up for future content. - Why not just call the DLC - HERO SIEGE 2 ? Because the first game is not getting content updates anymore!			"

												Being a fast-paced run, dodge and hit-game, Hero Siege does almost anything right it has to. I picked it up a while ago and thought I'd really have to look into it. That was an awesome decision! The game is pure fun! You create your character and start killing monsters. Leveling up unlocks various skills to upgrade your character and you can find some pretty nice weapons and trinkets. The game is always fair, you always know what you are up against or why you just died with the controls being very simple. All this together makes for an awesome amound of fun and the ""This time I'm gonan get one level further"" works pretty well.8/10 easily achieved!			"

If you dont, pick it up in a sale if you can, its a nice little game.DLC - Some features require DLC, but nothing too massive.

The game is awfully unbalanced for starters. Some people may be turned off by the unbalance because of the way it happens to work. There is also no such thing as multi-player that is how broken that is. DO NOT buy this to play online with others you will cry. The game has a lot of cool stuff about it but it has some nasty issues holding it back as well so just know this before making the purchase.			"

												This game is a wonderful pick-up dungeon grinder. It offers unique and challenging landscapes that are randomly generated, so the fight is different every time. This certainly contributes to the replay value of the game, as does the diverse array of classes and easy-to-learn/impossible-to-master game play.The pixel art and RPG elements are also excellent. ps. A big thanks to Humble Bundle for making access to awesome games like this affordable while supporting a good cause! Check it out, www.humblebundle.com7.25/10			"

												It's fun for the first few hours then it just becomes overly repetitive. Terribly balanced, half of your skills are useful and half of them will become completely useless. Item drop system is horrible - nothing else but level 9~30 items drop for my 65 level character since the start of the game. Items that require level 29 are way worse than level 9 items (stat vise).Pink and pixeled spit on the ground kills you everytime you even touch it. Bosses are complete joke - you kill them within 2 seconds and they have less HP that standard wave enemies you are struggling to kill.90% of the game content and ideas are stolen from Diablo / Binding of Isaac / Warcraft even.If you are looking for something that entertains you for a few hours then buy this game. Otherwise, don't even bother.( Oh, and don't forget to buy all the DLCs aswell, the game is basically a demo without them. )			"

												The game is a pretty decent time killer, aside from the cheesy voice acting and bland writing of the dialogue, there is a lot about this game that irks me. Firstly, I don't have much respect for the fact that the leveling system is a direct rip off of Diablo II, I didn't really like it in D2 and I especially don't like a rip off of it. The games color pallete makes enemy attacks easily blend into the environment, which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't die in 4 hits, There is way too many things going on in the screen to allow the enemy attacks to not stand out very well. Even after completely stat dumping into armor I felt I was way too squishy, even in the early stages of the game. I also don't appreciate the fact that there is no invincibility frames to protect you from getting completely wiped because of a single mistake, due to creep damage or a marksman volley that lasts 7 seconds.One thing that is going to make me *really* want a refund is the fact that I can't revist a save after I exit out of the game, it gets locked and says ""thou shalt not cheat"", unless the game considers me taking a break wildy heinous and wants to completely block me from returning to a character that I just put 4 hours into. There are a few undefined things about this game that bother me, but I'm going to chalk those up to personal taste, this game gets a 3/10 from me.			"

												I love this game. It's like a mix from ""Binding of Isaac"" and ""Diablo"". You got some funny items that upgrade you and you need to clear every act of the game to get to next difficulty. 'Nuff said, Pro/Contra list inc.Pro:- Reminds me of ""Binding of Isaac"" with the items and so on.- Many itmes!- Everytime, there is a new gamble what which potion do to you (De-/Increasing your stats or some temp. boosts for Attackspeed or Damage)- Many enemies, such wave, wow- Special events like Crypts, Dungeons and Statues that buff you or even debuff youContra:- It really depends on your luck, if you get good items and good potions- Only local coop mode (pls, we need multiplayer online coop!)- Sometimes, you get like five-ish enemies, that's kinda lame :(- Some classes seem really OP, cause my marksman kills everything with his missiles only. - Damage should be seen. I would like to know how high I crit or even how high my normal damage can be.This is my first review, and also, I think my english is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed.

												Overall the game deserves a 9.5/10:Why? Because it's a really enjoyable experience and a frustrating one at the same time, also a + because in a way it reminds me of Diablo. It's a top-down rogue-like experience that I really enjoy and anyone that likes a rogue-like from time to time or all the time will also enjoy. Great overall experience, really fun to play, can keep you entertained for hours so watch the clock when you play. And as I said, I give it a 9.5/10 because I fell in love with the game the first time I played.Would I recommend it? Yes.Is it worth the money? Definitely.Is the DLC any good? If you want more hats and a new class the it is.And another plus side is that multiplayer is being developed for the game so soon (or not that soon) you will be able to kill spiders, rats, tree ents, weird eye things and much more with friends. Do yourself a favour and buy the game.Also did I mention that the game is in a pixelart style? If thats your thing then even better.			"

This game is frequently updated by the developers based on community feedback (that's a good thing), so this review is based on version 1.0.7.1 of the game.Hero Siege is an excellent time-killer. Twin-stick, randomly-generated, Roguelike gameplay with 5+ classes, customization, dozens of special items to find in dungeons for extra power... It scatches so many game itches for those of us who enjoy some action RPG (light RPG, mind you) fun. The basis of the game is fighting off wave after wave of enemies, leveling up as you do so and obtaining items of power (relics) on a periodic basis. This game screams for a gamepad; you move in eight directions and shoot in four independent directions, while also activating items, allocating stats at level and buying from shops. I don't want to imagine doing that on a keyboard.Like a true Roguelike, there's no telling what you'll get with each area. Maps are generated randomly; you might be under constant assault by traps (which you can lure monsters into), have a maze of trees to navigare through, find a bounty of loot chests, or all sorts of other scenarios. There are over 100 relics right now to find in the game, and each provides either a significant stat boost or a special ability to your character. It's complete luck of the draw what you get, and the developers were gutsy enough to put in some truly unbalanced items, such as relics that give you the ability to fly over open air and water, staying completely out of the range of many enemies. No game played is a waste; if you die, you'll lose all the relics you've collected, but can restart with all the levels your character has amassed (except in the perma-death Hardcore mode.)Miniboss and legendary versions of regular enemies show up on a regular basis and every sixth wave, you'll fight a boss creature; success takes you to a new area (and often rewards you with a relic.) There are four ""Acts"" to the game, with apparently more to come, and 5 classes to try out and level up, also apparently with more to come. The game supports some sort of local multiplayer right now, but I have only done single-player mode. I can imagine that getting 2-4 people going on the same game would be a hilarious blast.The bottom line is that there's a lot of variety in this little title. The repetitve wipe-em-out nature of the game might not be for everyone, but I've already put in 12+ hours on a single class type, and that's more ""fun"" time than I've gotten out of many AAA titles at three times the price or more.

												Hero Siege is a decent game for its price, I went into it expecting a semi roguelike game and got what I was looking for.  It does have some issues such as being very repetative, but that I can forgive.  My biggest issue if I had one is the fact that in the explosion of enemy corpses... actual damaging abilitys being shot at you get muttled in with it all.  I still think its a decent fun time sync, but others may want to wait for a sale. Especially since mp is only available as a DLC right now... yeah I don't get that... I would still say the base game itself is pretty decentA video review I made on it.

												This is a wave survival rouge-like game. When i first saw this game on Steam i was hoping that it was going to be a free roam game though i was wrong it is still a fantastic bit of fun. A big negative from me is the references to other games can be alittle cringey at times for example when you make an Archer character he makes an ""Arrow to the knee"" reference which nearly made me uninstall the game because i didn't feel like developing cancer.

												What could have been a very fun game is ruined by cheap (or simply bad) design. Hero siege is littered with cheap shots. Traps and turrets dealing 2/3 to 100% of your health in damage. Certain mobs spawning impossible to dodge traps. Some dungeons spawning with diagonal corridords yet you can only shoot in 4 directions. Other times you will find an item early that lets you one-shot almost everything and you will get very far until you get one-shot by something you didn't see coming. Altogether the game is more frustrating than fun. It would be fun for a free game, but I wouldn't say its worth the asking price.			"

												Not quite sure why it was labeled as a ""Diablo-like"" game, because it isn't. It's very much like Nimble Quest (Cutesy graphics and powerups) mixed with Binding of Isaac (Control Scheme). Cute little game, very easy to pick up and play for short periods. In my opinion, worth $5 easily. Not quite sure $10 is what I would pay for a time-waster that is little more than a mobile port.			"

												Hero Siege is a decent game for its price, I went into it expecting a semi roguelike game and got what I was looking for.  It does have some issues such as being very repetative, but that I can forgive.  My biggest issue if I had one is the fact that in the explosion of enemy corpses... actual damaging abilitys being shot at you get muttled in with it all.  I still think its a decent fun time sync, but others may want to wait for a sale. Especially since mp is only available as a DLC right now... yeah I don't get that... I would still say the base game itself is pretty decentA video review I made on it.  It is of an older version, but playing it recently I still feel the same way about the game even with a few changes that have happened since.

												Hero Siege suprised me. It was better than expected. Some of the negative reviews put me off, but I'm glad I tried it anyway.When starting playing Hero Siege I died a lot. Most of the times it was an instant death with not even a clue what just happened. After a while however you leveled enough to with stand those blows. It's a pity that you need to go through this initial builiding of your character but otherwise it's fantastic. The game involves some basic 4 directional combat. Depending on the character you choose it will be shooting or slashing. If you look at the achievements you will see the archer is the most popular. This is also the character I used to complete the game i.e. play through the 4 acts (without DLC).For a game that looks like it's from the 90's, it is actually great fun. Not a lot of games in this segment make me want to play them longer then an hour or two. This game is a positive exception.7/10			"

												Fantastic game!  Funnest game I have played in a loooonnng time.  It's like Diablo/Fate/dungeon crawlers meets binding of issac.  This game however does have kinks beware!  BEWARE - you cannot gift this game to people from a select list of other countries.  Also the multiplayer is very bugged.  Can't join a party that has the port forwarded :( Also cannot join parties that have people in them already (ie parties with 2/4 or 3/4 players in the group already).  A bit of a bummer considering that this game would be perfect with friends.  Other than that fantastic game.  Wouldn't reccoment to people who want to play only for multiplayer tho, but if you like this kind of game GET IT! You won't be disapointed with the gameplay.Edit: we finally made it work and it was ultra fun but the crypts were ultra buggy so it felt a little rough - regardless was ultra fun in multiplayer too!

												Hero Siege has some of the worst try-hard voice actors in a video game i have ever heard. It's super cringy, the characters say stupid cringy stuff and i wish they could have skipped the voice acting in general. The sound is awful, i know this game is trying to be old school and it kind of get what it is doing on some points. But the sound is way more awful then i would have imagined. The music is mediocre.However, the pixel art is superb and i kinda get this ""Habbo"" feeling when i look at this game. Not that the game is like Habbo, it's far from, but the pixel art is just as cool and accurate like Habbos art style. The game is repetetive but fun. You kill enemies, gain perk points, level up, get new gear and abbilities and the hub area really makes this game feel like some online game from the early 2000. However, the levels are boring since it is pretty much just wave based gameplay with small dungeons you can find where you can earn some sweet lot for completing puzzle and stuff like that. Even the many areas of levels there is to explore, it is still pretty much the same, over and over again. The ""Free"" characters are pretty boring. However you can buy dlc packs with other characters, yeeyyyyyyyyyy.....And the game is mostly just the same throughout the time you spend on it.However, there are now seasons with new stuff coming to the game, like more boring quests(like finding 20 snowballs for a snowman) and some sweet stuff.The game is mediocre, online is fun. Buy this game for a lower price if you have the chance.			"

												Hero Siege is an interesting game. On the surface it sounds great and makes a lot of sense but the further into it you delve the more mish-mash the whole experience becomes.Graphically the game is great. Characters are designed well and fit the atmosphere niceley, the enemies are well drawn and so are the background elements. Problem is.... the background elements are totally placed randomly throughout the maps (which are poorly designed in and of themselves) which make the levels feel really.... dead. Which is the most serious problem plaguing this game. Nothing about it feels immersive or engaging.The leveling system is a fun twist to the roguelike formula but pretty much means you'll get hammered by the hordes of enemies until you're strong enough to progress. And regardless of how many levels you gain you'll find traps and certain moves constant headaches since they can potentially one-shot you ruining a hundred+ wave game. Furthermore the skills and stats, although novel, feel tacked on and pointless. Your stat points strengthen your character really really slowly, and the skills don't really offer much customization. Sure you can invest in one skill over another but you really don't feel very unique doing so. Maybe if the characters progressed through branching classes or something you'd feel more invested in how you build your character but the current system leaves you wanting more.There are also LOADS of things on the screen that clutter up the experience. Enemies come at you in big clumps and frequently have abilities that leave so many particle effects on the screen that you feel like you're stuck in some sort of horrible particle effect nightmare.Progression in the game is extremely boring, as well. Wave after wave after wave without any change. Sure you can do the occasional dungeon but I feel like the dungeons are way more fun/interesting than the core gameplay.Hero Siege is like a tower defense game with no home base to protect. It is like an RPG without equipment, classes, and storyline. It is a roguelike without unlockable content, mish-mashed graphics, clunky+boring progression and replay value only for the truly dedicated.Not to mention the bugs. Thinking of playing co-op? forget it, for now. The co-op is completely clunky and broken. Online multiplayer has never worked for me so I can't tell if it is more fun than offline (I'm sure it is, if it would work).Having said all that... it is a fun game.I recommend playing this ONLY if you can get it on sale. The 5.99 price point doesn't seem like much but in its current state there are loads of issues with the game. The developers seem interested in fixing things but the list is so long, and the core gameplay so mind-numbingly boring, it may be a long time before we see this product turn into something truly awesome (though the potential is there).

This game is frequently updated by the developers based on community feedback (that's a good thing), so this review is based on version 1.0.7.1 of the game.Hero Siege is an excellent time-killer. Twin-stick, randomly-generated, Roguelike gameplay with 5+ classes, customization, dozens of special items to find in dungeons for extra power... It scatches so many game itches for those of us who enjoy some action RPG (light RPG, mind you) fun. The basis of the game is fighting off wave after wave of enemies, leveling up as you do so and obtaining items of power (relics) on a periodic basis. This game screams for a gamepad; you move in eight directions and shoot in four independent directions, while also activating items, allocating stats at level and buying from shops. I don't want to imagine doing that on a keyboard.Like a true Roguelike, there's no telling what you'll get with each area. Maps are generated randomly; you might be under constant assault by traps (which you can lure monsters into), have a maze of trees to navigare through, find a bounty of loot chests, or all sorts of other scenarios. There are over 100 relics right now to find in the game, and each provides either a significant stat boost or a special ability to your character. It's complete luck of the draw what you get, and the developers were gutsy enough to put in some truly unbalanced items, such as relics that give you the ability to fly over open air and water, staying completely out of the range of many enemies. No game played is a waste; if you die, you'll lose all the relics you've collected, but can restart with all the levels your character has amassed (except in the perma-death Hardcore mode.)Miniboss and legendary versions of regular enemies show up on a regular basis and every sixth wave, you'll fight a boss creature; success takes you to a new area (and often rewards you with a relic.) There are four ""Acts"" to the game, with apparently more to come, and 5 classes to try out and level up, also apparently with more to come. The game supports some sort of local multiplayer right now, but I have only done single-player mode. I can imagine that getting 2-4 people going on the same game would be a hilarious blast.The bottom line is that there's a lot of variety in this little title. The repetitve wipe-em-out nature of the game might not be for everyone, but I've already put in 12+ hours on a single class type, and that's more ""fun"" time than I've gotten out of many AAA titles at three times the price or more.

												The game is very fun, but the absurd amount of bugs doesn't compensate for it. Even if you get this game for free, it isn't worth playing it due to insane life monsters spawning from nowhere, deaths without any apparent reason and things like those. I also need to mention that the screen sometimes freeze and blackout even with no apparent consumption of computer resources. I understand that the Gamemaker platform is a little bit hard to work with but this game shouldn't be considered finished due to these problems, so I already tried a refund request(even with 4 hours of ""gameplay"", or pure stress if you prefer), and even if it doesn't work, I hope someone reads this and pay attention to know that buying this game is a peril to your mental sanity. I'd just like to wish you a nice day, because some time of mine was completely wasted playing this.			"

Enemies can walk around with zero hp, you can use certain skills to get stuck in walls, etc. I really liked this game, but it's just getting worse.			"

												Really fun and simple game, but i found a major problem.My lvl 78 viking's max health downed from 89k to 34k for no apparent reason, nothing to do with relics (I had none) nothing to do with items (they are the same) and yet, i lost 50k heath. That makes impossible to play on higher difficulties, like i was before closing the game.I don't know why this happened, but I saw it did more than once, and this makes the game unbearable because it is so ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating.If this is some kind of rogue-like mechanic, ♥♥♥♥ this game. And I, for real, was having fun.			"

												What to say about this game? At first the game didn't impress me much: clunky controls, ""what-the-f-do-i-do"" moments etc. But I gave it a try. How I went deeper into the game, it got interesting.It's a simple game, hack n' slash stile with a ""grind 'till ya' die"" element. How you get stronger, it gets more intense and interesting. Do I recommend it? ABSOLUTELY, but not for the full price.			"

												This game is incredibly fun. Infuriatingly fun actually. The infuriating part? I'd wager it's the #1 glitchiest, buggiest, poorly designed game on all of steam, with the all-time worst UI I have ever encountered in any software application, game or otherwise, in all of my life. I mean, it's *impressive* how bad the UI is. Whoever the developers are, let me know what drugs you're on so I can try some.Still, would recommend, because the many, many, many bugs do not actually stop you from progressing, and you can play around the utterly horrendous design choices (No confirmation prompt for portal/ladder? Are you serious?!).Dying isn't the most frustrating thing about this game, oh no. Just wait until a Satanic weapon drops directly on top of the exit portal because the boss you're fighting doesn't move. Then you get to stare at it, knowing it's just out of reach. Taunting you. Laughing at you. And then, after several solemn minutes contemplating uninstalling, you step through the portal, and continue to grind. An empty, broken shell of the man you once were.I'm so triggered.			"

												Being a fast-paced run, dodge and hit-game, Hero Siege does almost anything right it has to. I picked it up a while ago and thought I'd really have to look into it. That was an awesome decision! The game is pure fun! You create your character and start killing monsters. Leveling up unlocks various skills to upgrade your character and you can find some pretty nice weapons and trinkets. The game is always fair, you always know what you are up against or why you just died with the controls being very simple. All this together makes for an awesome amound of fun and the ""This time I'm gonan get one level further"" works pretty well.8/10 easily achieved!			"

In my opinion, this game is definitely worth $10 and is a definite pickup!At first the game seems really repetitive and boring but I have seen a noticed subtle changes that make the game different every time.  This game brings an addictive formula that keeps you at your feet constantly.  People complain about the difficulty, which is really an overstatement considering the game is designed for a challange.  All in all, this game is constantly being update to fix any bugs and improving hour by hour.  I would say this game is an 8/10, heading towards 9/10 as it continues to improve.			"

												THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED SINCE MY ORIGINAL RESPONSE, PLEASE LOOK BELOW:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW REVIEW:Alright, so I don't nessecarily do reviews much, but having been bored and looking for stuff to play, I thought I'd give a game like Hero Siege another chance. I didn't see that I actually recieved a reply from one of the two developers as well, so let me go ahead and give another fairer review of it. My original score was a 0/10 on the claim that I wanted multiplayer and when I purchased it, it turns out mutliplayer wasn't even in the game, then over a year later it was in an early release and it turns out you had to pay for it. Please allow me to look at this over again:Hero Siege, as you can tell by my small amount of time playing it, is not nessecarily fun. Its an OKAY time-killer at best, using simplistic mechanics. Its very easy to get into which is nice, but upon purchase of the game you are not given everything thats inside the game; and this isn't the kind of game that warrants DLC. You get thrown into different arenas and fight varying mobs that tend to charge you head on or try to shoot at you - you dodge and fight back, simple stuff. I can't nessecarily speak for multiplayer because even though I have friends who own this game, no one wants to play it. The art is decent, it all stays within its style, and it looks like someone's first shot at making a video game- that being said it is impressive for what it is, but its nothing new or groundbreaking and should just give you access to the entirety of the game at one simple low price rather than having DLC and/or microtransactions.Buy it if you can get it for under a dollar, get a 4-pack, make ONE night of it, then never play it again probably.SCORE: 3/10			"

												Post release, the core game was abandoned.  It's still buggy as hell.  The display is a mess, with items and text constantly pushing outside of the frames.  Power creep was never addressed.  The game becomes an endless grind, and is basically worthless without the ~$25 worth of DLC.  Even then, the devs have never bothered to polish and bug fix beyond what is absolutely necessary to keep the game running.  It sucks, because the gameplay itself is wonderful.  The awful programming and lack of polish will seriously leave you pulling your hair out.Also, my original review for this game has mysteriously disappeared.  No clue why.			"

												TL;DR-Best randomization I have ever seen-4 Classes w/ talent trees-4 acts-Fairly difficult, but rewarding-High replayabilitySo far this game is very fun.  It looks very simple at face value, but I can assure you that it is not!  Hero Siege is not unlike many other rogue/rpg games like Rogue Legacy or Bindings of Isaac, but it does a much better job at making a super fung game.  Hero Siege has much more, and better randomization than the other games in its genre that I have played.  The classes in this game have quite a bit of depth to them when compared to other games as well.  Overall the game has the randomness that you would expect, and the depth that you would desire from the genre this game falls into.  I highly recommend this game if you enjoy arpgs like Diablo or Marvel heroes, or games like Rogue Legacy and Binding of Isaac.			"

												The game is very fun, but the absurd amount of bugs doesn't compensate for it. Even if you get this game for free, it isn't worth playing it due to insane life monsters spawning from nowhere, deaths without any apparent reason and things like those. I also need to mention that the screen sometimes freeze and blackout even with no apparent consumption of computer resources. I understand that the Gamemaker platform is a little bit hard to work with but this game shouldn't be considered finished due to these problems, so I already tried a refund request(even with 4 hours of ""gameplay"", or pure stress if you prefer), and even if it doesn't work, I hope someone reads this and pay attention to know that buying this game is a peril to your mental sanity. I'd just like to wish you a nice day, because some time of mine was completely wasted playing this.			"

												Bought because of multiplayer, had a hard time trying to get into a game, getting my game show on the games list and keeping the game in sync / working whatever. Not a pleasant experience. Or an experience at all. Agony and frustration, forums were of little to no use in finding a solution.Maybe again in a couple of months. If I still remember that this game exists.			"

												While the gameplay is really fun, I can't recommend this until they fix the bug that keeps causing me to get knocked into inanimate objects or off the map by hostile area of effect attacks.

												What could have been a very fun game is ruined by cheap (or simply bad) design. Hero siege is littered with cheap shots. Traps and turrets dealing 2/3 to 100% of your health in damage. Certain mobs spawning impossible to dodge traps. Some dungeons spawning with diagonal corridords yet you can only shoot in 4 directions. Other times you will find an item early that lets you one-shot almost everything and you will get very far until you get one-shot by something you didn't see coming. Altogether the game is more frustrating than fun. It would be fun for a free game, but I wouldn't say its worth the asking price.			"

												Gotta say the fact that something as essential (Essential for this kind of game anyway) as MULTIPLAYER is a payed for DLC is utter nonsense. I repeat! You Have to BUY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER as a seperate DLC. I see now why ""Multiplayer"" isn't included in the tags.Now, on to my (admitttedly limited) experience with the game:It was okay I guess. Nothing really grabbed my attention. The graphics were nice enough, the controls worked, the enemies kind of wandered towards me as I kited them all to death with little trouble at all. I found that my abilities had trouble acitvating however. Many times I'd press the button (even 2 or 3 times) and nothing would happen. The ability icon would be in full colour, but it just wouldn't activate.Eventually I reached the first boss and that's where this games shortcomings really brought themselves out. The boss was this armless zombie who spawned swarms of flies and threw giant spike balls. Sounds interesting in concept, but the execution was rather poorly done. 1) The swarms of flies are constantly moving towards me which results in a constant wall between me and the boss and he always spawns more as soon as I clear a swarm.2) The flies each have a noticable amount of health. They are not as easy to clear as you'd think flies would be.3) Every time he attacked, And I do mean EVERY TIME he attacked, the boss would speak one of his 3-4 sayings. And with his neverending wall of flies you can imagine that those lines would get repetitive.4) Eventually the flies started spawning with elemental enhancements which didn't seem like a problem at first, until one fly touched me and I was frozen and then instagibbed by the swarms.5) I levelled up like, 7-10 times just on those flies alone, in like, a few minutes. To me there's something wrong with a boss fight if the minions He's spawning are strong enough to warrant that much of a reward.TLDR: 1) Visuals and music are nice           2) Controls work for the most part           3) You have to BUY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER           4) Bosses can be frustrating to fight           5) Character sayings get annoying           6) Can't shoot diagonally           7) Get's pretty old really fast			"

												This game never rewards you for doing good at all, requires microtransactions to RENAME CHARACTERS and even PLAY CO-OP. Not to mention this game is hard as balls for anyone, newcomers or Binding of Isaac finactics. Do not buy this game, it is broken and does not even deserve its sometime 1.62$ price tag.			"

												Most of the classes in this game are horrible.  The skills either dont do any damage, have long cooldowns, or both.  The only class I found enjoyable was the Redneck due to his ability to cleave multiple enemies and weird random skills.   Any other class is going to require you to slam your head against the wall as you die multiple times from weak enemies.  Adding points to strength barely does anything to up your damage, instead relics are your damage modifiers which are rare.  I initially thought about buying 3 copies for friends but thank goodness I didnt because there is no multiplayer.  Also not being able to shoot diagonally is a real pain.  Have fun running around in circles just so you can line enemies up to attack them if your ranged.			"

												The game is overall quite entertaining, but let me point out a few flaws:The boss system is a little funky, sometimes you will get a boss that you just smash all of your ability keys and will die before it can use its special ability, but other times they will just completely mess you up. and there is ONE boss that i can not beat, no matter how hard i try, its just COMPLETELY broken, dead within seconds.You can also die SUDDENLY without even knowing. you can be in a crowd of dudes just slashing and allova sudden BAMN you get hit with some sort of attack that is way overpowered.and a HEADS UP: you have to pay 3 dollars for multiplayer. thanks, EA			"

												WARNING: SLIGHTLY TL;DR REVIEW, SHORTER CONCLUSION IN THE BOTTOM.Now-I don't get why people don't like this game,Pros--Replayable-Fun-Many variants of enemies-(At least) 4 Areas to fight through-Multiple dificulties to fight through-AddictingCons--DLC to get half the game (I was okay with buying this)-Addicting-Gets slightly stale after a little while as the game either gets too easy or too hard-Graphics aren't great-Laggy in partsNow, for a few funny reasons to buy this game if it's on sale1. Spikes sound voice acted2. Purple ooze3. Karp DLC4. Horse Head mask5. Buy wool for 5k ""Premium"" (Cosmetic, can still get it for in-game money) Currency6. Necromancer, just NecromancerI would highly recomend this game and I really don't understand why people complain that DLC is half the game, I still got 7 hours of gameplay getting to stage 4 (Out of 7) on one character, and if the DLC is on sale you can get the game for $0.90, and the DLCs for $6-ish. With many funny things to laugh at and many pros versus cons, this game is freakin' amazing. NOW WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS REVIEW? GO UP AND CLICK ADD TO CART ALREADY!EDIT: The reason why people do not like this game will not apply to newer players.			"

												Alright, so this is a special review, and I'm gonna ask you guys to read it to the end before dropping any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on me. A good friend of mine gifted me this game like 2 days ago, and I actually like the game. It has some flaws, like the random nature of Roguelike games for example, but it's not a terrible experience. So, why do I NOT recommend it? Easy.The game is a rip-off. And I'm not saying that like ""it copies the concept and gameplay of other games"". That would been aceptable IF the game is good. What I mean, is that the game quite literally uses assets from other games. I can accept using the Diablo font, for example, since the game IS a parody of Diablo. What I CAN'T accept, is that the game uses an INSANE amount of sprites taken directly from games such as The Binding of Isaac. And unless it's proven otherwise, they did NOT ask for permission, because that would be like asking the Bank manager for the keys of his Safe-lock.I usually ♥♥♥♥♥ about games having ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs, glitches or being lazy, but taking assets from other games and using them in your own TO THEN SELL A GAME WITH THEM, is STEALING the effort of other people, and getting paid for it.And it's sad, really. I was going to give the game a positive review, but then I noticed all the stolen sprites. I'm still gonna play it, don't get me wrong... But why they stole all of that, is a mystery that goes beyond my mind right now.EDIT: I discovered some extra stuff yesterday, and I also forgot some others. I'll keep it short:-Controller support seems to be random. I have a Xbox360 controller, a PS4 controller, and a random other controller that was cheap as hell and works at times. Weird enough, you have to select what kind of controlls you want in the Controls option screen, but the game doesn't recognize ANY of them.-The game has just too many grinding. I can understand that in games such as Disgaea, but here it gets boring quite fast.-Remember that I talked about the randomness of Roguelike games before? Well, screw that. This game goes beyond. What do I mean? I've faced multiple times already some unfair stuff, 2 of the 4 times, I had a LVL3-5 character on the first stage, and for no reason an enemy with arround 60k HP appears, and kills me in one hit. Difficulty should not mean ""Of 9001 tries, you might win a stage once"".-While the controls with a keyboard are okay, it feels weird. You attack with the arrows, while moving with WASD. Why not making your character face somewhere with the mouse, and attacking with it? Would been better, on my oppinion.-The game kind of drops you into it without any explanation at all. You have to select a character from 10 or so, and it doesn't tell you what each one does, you have to look it up on the Internet. The game doesn't then tell you where you have to go. At first I though I had to talk with NPC's for quests, but turns out ALL of the NPC's in town just trade some stuff on crystals, an ingame currency. I don't like tutorials, but the game should at least give some indications of what you're supposed to do.-Tried the multiplayer once, and I will never do it again. Why? Tried it 10 times in a row, NOONE of them ever worked.I'm kind of glad I didn't buy the game, it was a gift... But I feel bad for the friend who bought it to me. He though I would fall in love with it. Kind of sad to see potential go to waste. I hope tough, that they make a sequel at some point, with all of this stuff fixed. And please, don't ""take"" so much inspiration from other sources next time, try to make it more original. Diablo parodies are nice, but I rather play something refreshing, with some innovation.			"

												Can't reasonably recommend the game. The game has amazing potential, but I'm not convinced it will ever get there. The development team is small, and is very focused on releasing DLC for the game. While the DLC adds new content, the game is full of bugs. Some modes like multiplayer are pseudo unplayable. You can play a few levels, maybe you'll get a few hours in, then you'll run into a boss or something that will crash you, and there isnt anything you can do about it. Also at the time of this post, strange errors happen with damage scaling of people who join games in multiplayer. The Devs admit that the game isn't polished yet, and they hope to get it there one day, but they really need to focus less on additional content. But unfortunately there isn't much money in it.  Lastly, I perused the forum quite a bit to get an answer to some of the bugs in the game, or report them myself, and see if devs were working on them. Quite a number of the responses were abrasive from a member of the development team.  "

												THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN EDITED SINCE MY ORIGINAL RESPONSE, PLEASE LOOK BELOW:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW REVIEW:Alright, so I don't nessecarily do reviews much, but having been bored and looking for stuff to play, I thought I'd give a game like Hero Siege another chance. I didn't see that I actually recieved a reply from one of the two developers as well, so let me go ahead and give another fairer review of it. My original score was a 0/10 on the claim that I wanted multiplayer and when I purchased it, it turns out mutliplayer wasn't even in the game, then over a year later it was in an early release and it turns out you had to pay for it. Please allow me to look at this over again:Hero Siege, as you can tell by my small amount of time playing it, is not nessecarily fun. Its an OKAY time-killer at best, using simplistic mechanics. Its very easy to get into which is nice, but upon purchase of the game you are not given everything thats inside the game; and this isn't the kind of game that warrants DLC. You get thrown into different arenas and fight varying mobs that tend to charge you head on or try to shoot at you - you dodge and fight back, simple stuff. I can't nessecarily speak for multiplayer because even though I have friends who own this game, no one wants to play it. The art is decent, it all stays within its style, and it looks like someone's first shot at making a video game- that being said it is impressive for what it is, but its nothing new or groundbreaking and should just give you access to the entirety of the game at one simple low price rather than having DLC and/or microtransactions.Buy it if you can get it for under a dollar, get a 4-pack, make ONE night of it, then never play it again probably.SCORE: 3/10			"

												EDIT Sept 13 2015: recent updates added a NPC shop hub and while it's cool and all, trying to buy anything from the shops is impossible because the same button is used for buy and exit, so it makes me exit and I never can buy anything.This game is what you get when you cross Binding of Isaac with an arcade or Amiga game from the early 90's!You get a ton of upgradable attributes for each character so it makes you want to try out everything and it's worth it!At first I had a hard time figuring out what was going on (a tutorial would be a nice addition), but once I did it was smooth sailing, blasting, sword slashing, etc.Hero Siege was a little ruff and buggy when I started playing it, but now it's gotten A LOT BETTER!I think it is more fair to those just starting to upgrade their characters, before the many updates I died A LOT!Fun little game that only sucks your free time away! Now I'm off to buy the DLC!			"

Some of the classes are very underwhelming comprared to others atthis state in the game, though balancing is supposed to come in december when season2 drops. With all that said, the game is just a joy to play, a real gem. All the nostalgia of Diablo 2, in a rogue-like indie game.			"

You can only move and shoot up/down/left/right while enemies can move and shoot in any direction. The game doesn't seem very well thought out, and how to use in game actions isn't very well explained or demonstrated.Wasn't even fun with my partner. Uninstalled within 30 minutes.			"

												Fantastic game, takes me right back to childhood and gives me and my brother a really fun game to play online.Single player this is great, I haven't seen any bugs and its a thoroughly enjoyable hack and slash game defeating waves of monsters/completing dungeons/finding treasure forts etc - sort of a like a really cartoony diablo but it's easily a game in its own right.Multiplayer I experienced many bugs over the few months I've played online with my brother (not tried couch co-op but this option is available) however the developers are easy to contact and WANT to fix these bugs and have fixed many of them over the last few months. Right now the online multiplayer is in open beta and i'm only having small bugs which come and go and are reset when an area/dungeon is exited so no biggy, I completed normal difficulty multiplayer alongside my brother a couple days ago and experienced no game ending bugs whatsoever that we had experienced in the previous month so the developers are obviously working hard on this.If you're expecting a bug free multiplayer option then wait a bit - it's open beta there are gonna be bugs, otherwise this game is absolutely fantastic and one of my new favourites that i'd recommend to anyone.

												After 3.5 hours of playing it, for some reason the game blocks you from playing the acts 5, 6 & 7. No warning, no window popped up. I searched through wikia of the game... that's when I knew you need DLCs to continue the game through the rest of the acts, and finish it.Technically, the fact that costs $6 and not let you end the base game because of two lacking DLCs (+$6) which you don't get warned before buying it, is a scam.The game costs actually $12 to be a complete base game.And Steam policies say that I can't refund it because I went more than 2 hours.If you're looking for low budget games, SKIP... THIS... GAME.			"

												I got a 4-pack of this game ON SALE (key word there) For $1.79 during the summer sale and let me tell you i am thouroughly impressed.For a relatively cheap game it is very woth your while to purchase. I played it with some buddies for multiple hours now and for the cost i got some amazing enjoyment out of it. This game actually has some longevity to it compared to other cheap games and that is great. It is great fun with friends however it does fall flat playing solo.That being said it does have numerous bugs that will crash your game (like talking to the landlord but i think that has been patched,) The town is shallow, and you cant really purchase things outside of levels with your hard earned goals, also there is nothing purchasable that wont disappear upon death. And the DLC is grossly overpriced for what you get.But despite the negatives the game looks amazing, the short cutscenes after bossfights ACTUALLY INCLUDE YOUR (key word is YOUR) CHARACTER(S) opposed to other games which will use filler characters in the clips (which by the way are really well designed)Quick things to list:-Decent graphics outside of clips-Wont break weaker computers-Every character feels unique in both abilities and design-Game feels too easy on first playthrough (probably intentional) however becomes basically impossible on next difficulty up-Wave trigger is broken and you can spam it and skip to the last wave, also skips to last wave randomlyOverall: Great game to pick up on sale if you have friends to play with, I fell in love with it, However not worth your while solo, DLC not worth it unless on sale7/10 - Dat Boi "

												Most of the classes in this game are horrible.  The skills either dont do any damage, have long cooldowns, or both.  The only class I found enjoyable was the Redneck due to his ability to cleave multiple enemies and weird random skills.   Any other class is going to require you to slam your head against the wall as you die multiple times from weak enemies.  Adding points to strength barely does anything to up your damage, instead relics are your damage modifiers which are rare.  I initially thought about buying 3 copies for friends but thank goodness I didnt because there is no multiplayer.  Also not being able to shoot diagonally is a real pain.  Have fun running around in circles just so you can line enemies up to attack them if your ranged.			"

												The game is overall quite entertaining, but let me point out a few flaws:The boss system is a little funky, sometimes you will get a boss that you just smash all of your ability keys and will die before it can use its special ability, but other times they will just completely mess you up. and there is ONE boss that i can not beat, no matter how hard i try, its just COMPLETELY broken, dead within seconds.You can also die SUDDENLY without even knowing. you can be in a crowd of dudes just slashing and allova sudden BAMN you get hit with some sort of attack that is way overpowered.and a HEADS UP: you have to pay 3 dollars for multiplayer. thanks, EA			"

												Can't reasonably recommend the game. The game has amazing potential, but I'm not convinced it will ever get there. The development team is small, and is very focused on releasing DLC for the game. While the DLC adds new content, the game is full of bugs. Some modes like multiplayer are pseudo unplayable. You can play a few levels, maybe you'll get a few hours in, then you'll run into a boss or something that will crash you, and there isnt anything you can do about it. Also at the time of this post, strange errors happen with damage scaling of people who join games in multiplayer. The Devs admit that the game isn't polished yet, and they hope to get it there one day, but they really need to focus less on additional content. But unfortunately there isn't much money in it.  Lastly, I perused the forum quite a bit to get an answer to some of the bugs in the game, or report them myself, and see if devs were working on them. Quite a number of the responses were abrasive from a member of the development team.  "

												fun game.but glad i got it while it was on sale because i still feel like i overpayed, because you can get Hero Siege for FREE if you have an Andriod device. it is the basicly the same game, it has some minor user interface differences and ingame purchase to unlock some things, but the game play is the same.untill just a few days ago you could get the exact same version as what is now here on Steam for free through the Windows Store, but they just recently pulled it out of the Windows Store.if you have an Andriod device just search Google Play for Hero Siege and get it for free, unless you really want it through Steam, or unless you really want to support the developersalthough the forum mods (Tupu and PaNicci) from thier development team keeps deleting this info from the game's forums, they dont want Steam users knowing you can get it free else where. kind of rude on thier part. so i am posting this here in a review, where hopefully Tupu or PaNicci can not delete it. you all have the right to know you can get this game for free.also the game may be available on Xbox One, but i don't know if it is free for Xbox One.despite all that i would recomend the game, it is fun, but if you can get the FREE version first before deciding to buy the Steam version			"

												I wanted to like this game, but I think my biggest gripe with it was that there was no clear sense of direction and purpose. There's nothing in the game to tell you what to do, and frankly the combat is rather boring and repetetive. I'm new to dungeon crawlers, so I'm not sure if this is what the genre has to offer but in general the game leaves me confused on what to do except slash at baddies. But besides that the levels look really messy, and the voice actor (atleast for the first guy you play as) sounds... perturbing, and not so much in the good way. I really wanted more from this game, I'm glad it was a gift.TL;DR : Boring combat, no direction.			"

												Very wonderful singleplayer game, Even though the game has JUST RELEASED MULTIPLAYER it is getting a bad rep and is being called a scam.But thats because most of these people havent played singleplayer and man. is that a freaking douzey. its an amazing game that these guys put together but its getting such a bad rep because of the overflow of players.I mean sure they should have expected it but hey, atleast its not another RAKE where its half finished and sold for 20 bucks.

												This game is great. Think of it as Diablo if it came out during the NES-SNES era. A dev that is really involved and constant updates.Pros:Fun!Now Has an Alpha Co-OpQuite a Few CharactersCustomization is Neat.Cons:Some Skills Are UselessSometimes Screen is Overwhelmed With Stuff and You Cannot Tell Where You AreCo-Op only for DLC owners.I Own the DLC bought it day 1 to support the dev. I got this game in a bundle so it was least I could do. I place it as a con as some people might have payed full price and the had to get bundle, plus we all have poor friends who cannot buy it for themselves, they cannot play along side us.Cannot wait for the next update(s) as the one today was a nice step. Removed a vanilla store and added a random, better store, and changed the way money was looted and looked.NIce Game, Highly reccomend for retro and diablo fans.			"

												There's potential for a good game here, and the coding is certainly competently executed, but the game is ultimately far too poorly-designed to be a success.For starters, the game is too random (even by roguelike standards - sure, potions in Nethack are random, but the key difference - and one which the developer may not quite grasp - is that Nethack potions CAN be identified through various means before swallowing them) and certain elements are extremely poorly-thought-out (there's no ""momentary invulnerability"" on hit - so if you happen to wander into a patch of poison, you die pretty much instantly) or just clunky (it's too easy to get hung up on scenery, and sometimes traps can be spawned ""behind"" trees and other objects, rendering them completely invisible until you happen to get killed).On top of that, the game is EXTREMELY grindy - I love a good grind as much as the next guy, but only when the game is fun and fair. ""Fun"" is in the eye of the beholder, but ""fair"" is not, and with its plethora of one-hit-kills and suicide potions, this game is anything but.			"

												This is a really nice game.Is it worth full price? I would say yes.Your goal is to beat the waves that come at you by using your attack. There are different classes, and the attack is different for each one. There is only 1 attack per class, but each class has abililities and perks that can modify the class specific attack, which is very nice indeed. For instance, as a pyro, the base attack is a ball of fire, but as you level up you can improve the chance of instead of firing a ball of fire, you fire a meteor, or even fire the base ball of fire in multiple directions. There's all sort of crazy things you can do really.As you beat waves, you go trough different areas. Those areas are different each time you play (they are somewhat randomly generated), and different areas have different traps and enemies. What i mean by ""somewhat randomly generated"" is that for instance the size of the area, the type of the enemies, and the type of traps you can expect in one area it's always the same, but they are placed in different locations each time, and some instances may or may not have some traps. That makes each play-trough unique, and you may have to adopt slightly different strategies each time. Killing enemies gives you experience, which you use to level up. When you level up you are given points that you can spend on improving your stats. There are 4 stats in the game, those being Damage, Attack Speed, Armor and Health. Also, you receive points to improve/unlock abilities or the chances of your base attack do something different. It's also a rogue-like, in the sense that if you die on one wave, you're done and you have to start from the Wave 1 of the act all over again. Though, unless you're playing on Hardcore, you keep you character, its levels, points, abilities etc.. Part of the point of the game is level up so you're stronger the next time you play.The game also features dungeons, that appear on the areas of the game. The dungeons sometimes are harder to beat than the normal waves, but they give you an item if you beat the dungeon, so it's more often than not worth the risk. Those special items, called ""relics"" are also given to you each time you beat an area, and they really improve you experience with the game. Those items do all sort of crazy things. Some give you base attack a chance of freezing/poison enemies, others give you homing missiles that are around you that fire automatically and help you killing the enemies, others ""simply"" improve your base stats etc... I say ""simply"" because even though ""improve you base stats"" may sound something boring, it can REALLY help you out making areas easier. These items are also wiped from you if you die, so you have to collect new items again each time you play. The game seems to have a finite number of these relics, but there's a large number of them and the items you find are also randomly generated.As you kill enemies they drop gold, that you can spend on the store on thing like health potions, damage boost potions etc. Those boosts are also only valid for that specific play-trough, they reset if you die, as well as all the gold you happen to find. The game has also a rare currency, the crystals. These crystals are really hard to find, as far as i know there's only 2 ways to get them: crystal chests (chests that need a crystal key to be opened) or bosses that sometimes drop a few of them, very rare to happen though. With crystals you can buy cosmetic stuff, the possibility of have a skeleton pet the next time you play (that actually helps you fight the enemies), the possibility of starting with a relic on your next playtrough, crystal keys. You might be like ""Hang on a minute..you say you can get crystals from crystal chests, but you have to spend crystals on crystal keys to open them, what?"" Yes, the good news is that those crystals chests often give you more crystals than the ones you spent on the key, along side with tons of gold and possibly a relic. And for those wondering, i'm happy to say that the game has no microtransactions whatsoever.I really recommend this game. Already put 10hrs on it and will definitively put more.The only word of warning advice before buying this game it's that even though it's on sale as a completed game, it is not. As the time i'm writing this, new classes and multiplayer are promised and are still to be added. Some balance improvements are still being made. It's more like a beta, but with a pretty solid gameplay already.			"

												At first I attempted to play it on my laptop which always ended up in a windowed screen which I did not like at all.  I did finally install the game onto my gaming pc and it plays perfectly and full screen now.  It is a very fun game, with many different characters to play. Reminds me of Rogue Legacy, if you die you go back to the beginning but do not lose your levels. I recommend playing it with a controller though, easier to use. Multiplayer is still in beta at this time, but I am being patient and looking forward to it being completed.			"

												Bad game design at at almost every point.  It feels like they took bad part of every ARPG and shoved it all into one game.  The pixel art is kind of cool, but more than half of it is completely uninspired rip offs of other intellectual properties.The sound design is also just kinda...bad.The screen becomes of cluster-♥♥♥♥ of pixels, to the point where you can't even tell what is happening.  Playing co-op and just putting all attributes into damage, most enemies die before you can even see them on screen. There is so much CRAP LOOT just thrown at you...it just adds to the clutter.There are almost no actual gameplay mechanics...first of all you are restricted to shooting up, down, left, and right...but the game does not seem like it was designed to have that restriction at all.Most things die so quickly that nothing gets a chance to happen, or vice versa...you die so quickly that you don't get a chance to do anything.  It becomes a game of who gets one-shot first, therefore no mechanics needed.This feels like something some students would put together as a school project...not a finished game that people should pay money for.I commend the devs for sticking with their game, however they need to hire design director or something, because it's obvious that they don't really know what they're doing when it comes to that field.I got this game shortly after it initially came out, and at that time it was supposed to be a rogue-lite or something; now it seems like it's trying more to be like diablo, with a hub world/portal system like crash bandicoot.I just don't understand what they are trying to accomplish with this game, and I'm not entirely certain the devs do either.If anyone has any questions, or concerns, I can try to answer them. Verdict: Would Not Recommend (No hate intended, this is my opinion)			"

												Random in every aspect of the word, this game embraces inablity of its developers to create a mechanicly satisfying hack'n'slash and instead focuses on throwing as much♥♥♥♥♥♥on the screen as possible. Most of the time you going to wander around trying to distiguish anything amongst the constant explosions of gibblets and blood. A lot of abilities and classes are borrowed from Diablo 2 and Binding of Isaac, but without compelling synergy system that would make building your character at least remotely interesting. Constant spam of enemies and effects and meaningles items, horrible potion and buff systems, sprites overlapping each other and making it harder to see on the battlefield, dungeons resetting the level for no reason - it's just a frustrating mess of a game.

												I saw Hero Siege on a list of local co-op games, added it to my wish list without much thought, and eventually bought it in a Humble Bundle. I expected it to be somewhat similar to Hammerwatch, but instead it's a rather dull wave-based twin-stick shooter which doesn't have much going for it. Its art style and graphics are somewhat mundane and amateurish, and everything on the screen sort of blends together when there's a lot of combat going on. On top of that, the game's sound effects are terrible. There are locked menu items on every menu with references to DLC or future DLC, and the game doesn't seem to bring any new ideas to the table, either. Overall, Hero Siege feels very amateurish--it reminds me of something I might have made at age 12 with RPG maker or similar, or maybe a flash game one might have found on newgrounds.com in 2002.			"

												So yeah there's  a lot of characters, lot of custimization, however though buying the game gets you singleplayer, MP is an additional $4. All you do is survive waves of enemies, there was no cutscenes or anything to even give me a hint of what the hell I was doing. Your supposed to be able to open the store in game by pressing P to spend your gold, but no that doesn't work. You kill stuff and level up and thats it. No grind for gear, no getting better weapons, just straight up single-player killing and character custimazation. I would hands down recommend hammerwatch over this since it's the same concept, but more story and action. Heck for the price of mp for this game just go buy Crypt of the Necrodancer instead....much more fun than this!			"

Everything what this game needs really.But that's not exactly why I recommend this game, I mainly review this game because this game has potentional.Just like some other games I reviewed, I like that they are updating the game guite often to keep up this game.It's like they know what they're doing and keep inspired to make this game even with their updates.Ofcourse I think there needs to be a little of changement, like for example those centain things like the spike balls can kill you instantly even if you got full health.But then again I'm not sure if it is planned but I think it's worth buying the game and checking it out!

There are changed to how you choose levels which lay out each hub in a nice special area. There is a shop to by special hats, now stick with me here, they don't do anything to your stats but they are awesome. You can only buy them with gems you get in-game and they range from horse head to naruto and pyramid head to other pop culture favourites.

												With the overwhelming amount of positive reviews and the game being marketed as ""[...] one of the most loved indie hack n slash games with roguelike elements! Join the fun now!!"" I did indeed expect to have fun.But fun was not had. This is a plain twin stick shooter masked as a hack n slash. Acts are also promised, but is rather a randomized arena where waves of enemies spawn. That was another letdown because I expected a randomized map as in a place where the outer edges shift in shape instead of a simple square. Though to be fair, there's dungeons. However I never had the chance to enter one before I lost interest.Third letdown was the combat. I always play melee whenever I have the choice and the little I did that in this game consisted of pointing the left stick away from the monsters and the right stick towards them, occasionally pressing it whenever a skill had cooled down.All in all this game feels like it would fare better as a newly released early access game. Since it is not I just can't find a reason to recommend this game.			"

Problem is, if I want to play online multiplayer, I need to pay another $3... WTF?! So essentially,  the ""demo"" is $6, full game is $9 and the full game with ""extras"" is $11. Just seems kinda like a scam. I'm really suprised their aren't mirco transactions in it TBH, it just feels like the kind of game that would try that ****. Also, it took me 3 hours to figure out what the coins are for! You collect them almost constantly but you can only spend them at randomly appearing shops. I have still never been able to spend the coins. The shops are rare and to stumble upon one with enough coins to spend on something is even more rare. It just seems like a broken mechanic. The rouge-like elements are just not strong enough for me to boast about them. When you die, almost everything but your level goes back to zero and nothing else carries over.Not very rouge-like if you ask me.			"

												I saw Hero Siege on a list of local co-op games, added it to my wish list without much thought, and eventually bought it in a Humble Bundle. I expected it to be somewhat similar to Hammerwatch, but instead it's a rather dull wave-based twin-stick shooter which doesn't have much going for it. Its art style and graphics are somewhat mundane and amateurish, and everything on the screen sort of blends together when there's a lot of combat going on. On top of that, the game's sound effects are terrible. There are locked menu items on every menu with references to DLC or future DLC, and the game doesn't seem to bring any new ideas to the table, either. Overall, Hero Siege feels very amateurish--it reminds me of something I might have made at age 12 with RPG maker or similar, or maybe a flash game one might have found on newgrounds.com in 2002.			"

												So yeah there's  a lot of characters, lot of custimization, however though buying the game gets you singleplayer, MP is an additional $4. All you do is survive waves of enemies, there was no cutscenes or anything to even give me a hint of what the hell I was doing. Your supposed to be able to open the store in game by pressing P to spend your gold, but no that doesn't work. You kill stuff and level up and thats it. No grind for gear, no getting better weapons, just straight up single-player killing and character custimazation. I would hands down recommend hammerwatch over this since it's the same concept, but more story and action. Heck for the price of mp for this game just go buy Crypt of the Necrodancer instead....much more fun than this!			"

												Just kind of a ""meh"" flash game. It has been updated so many times over the years (seemingly every day) that it is hard to keep up with. I just tried playing for the first time in months only to find out that my necromancer can't summon his golem because it is too high lvl and costs too much mana. There used to be no mana in the game. Why add it? So I had to go back out and reset his stats and talents and the game just isn't fun enough to bother. Not to mention you can be having a perfect run and one of the thousand unavoidable BS surprise ways to die happens and it's game over.Plus when I try to select the shaman it pops up ""4.99"" so I click it and it takes me to the steam page to buy ""The Karp of Doom"" which I already own...If you can get it for a couple bucks go for it, although there are much better choices readily available.

												Game is horrible. No replay value. I waited for new cotent after buying the DLC as they said all new content will be free. Turned out that was a lie and instead refunding my money, they changed the wording so they are not liable for lying anymore.Game is mostly about dodging red-colored bullets, but when enemies die, they explode into lots of red chunks... You will most likely die to something you didn't see.			"

												I really enjoyed this game, as my playtime reflects.I also have to give props to the developers for continued support, but unfortunately the game in its current state is not the game I purchased. Instead of fixing the game in its released state, they keep adding new features, but onto sloppy coding -which inevitably introduces new bugs. If you would like to see for yourself the state of the game, I think their bugtracker paints a very clear picture.https://www.autoseries.net/bugtracker/index.php?page=issues&search=&show=100 As I said, new content is great. But at some point they need to take a breath and fix what they have. Until that happens, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.			"

There are many bugs with enemies where you insta die to nothing (usually in multiplayer) which makes HC mode unplayable. That being said, the game is still ♥♥♥♥ing fun as hell. It is a good time sync, and is unique in the rougue-like diabloesc style. Don't listen to the people here ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the devs calling this a cash cow(unless they start releasing micro transations for ingame currency). Updates are fairly regular, and it seems they have a general integrity for competiution on the leaderboard unlike many many other games (cough cough D3 Season Botters).TL;DR Buy the game during christmas sale for .99 or whatever they knock it down too, and pick up all the dlc cheap, its a very good time sync and will continue to get better overtime.************************************************************************************************************************************* "

												A pretty fun game that unfortuinatly lets itself down with bad practises. In order to get the achievemnts for the main game you HAVE to buy DLC.There are some also annoying little things, like you have to press a button to pick items up when you are close enough. Sometimes these items spawn ontop of the doors or ladders you go close to in order to leave to the next level. This usually results in the loss of those items, as once you leave an area and return it's reset itself meaning all the items you left there are gone.The game can also be quite annoying too if you're trying to build up alot of items (which since it has a small roguelike element) you loose them on death. I find that when I die, I either get one or two shot, even after assigning all talent points into damage reduction and health.So I'd probably recommend just getting Diablo, which when you've bought all the DLC for this game comes out to the same price xP			"

												Take my words - This game is super fun. This is basically a hybrid twin stick shooter, but here no mouse is involved. wasd are used for movement, cursor is for shooting. There are 7 classes, 5 are playable at the moment of writing, rest of the two are locked. Depending on which character you choose, you can turn this into a hack and slash game or just play as top down shooters like Gun Bros. Multiplayer is work in progress as I understand from the game menu. This is a super fun game that you need to play now. The RPG elements are not too heavy and there's only skill progression here. No dialogue or choice to make. Each levels are randomly generated. I am still new to this game so I'll update this review once I discover new contents. Grab it if you still don't have this yet. This game has been bundled at least 5 times if I'm not wrong. So, it should not be expensive if you know where to look(*wink* trade *wink*).			"

												I played this game for only around 5 hours, and I'm already in love with it. I just finished Act I with 4 legendary pieces of armor, and Hero Seige has only gotten more fun over the time. There are a couple down sides to it however, but we'll get into that after I state the pros. So, let's get into the details.The game is quite addicting. While it can get a bit repettitive if you're, quite frankly, bad at it, since you face the same monsters and bosses every time you play, if you're skilled at the game you can pass Acts ""quickly"". Each act has it's own bosses, monsters, traps, etc. The one things that I have found to stay the same is the drops and the layouts of the dungeons and crypts. Even after I beat Act I and got into the snowy act, the crypts and dungeons are still the same textiles as before, dirty. This may be for a reason, since it is underground, but I would have liked to seen some more details, perhaps at least some snow, or maybe some other factor that would indicate the low temperature. One thing I liked about changing acts is that it seems that the previous act's bosses are the new act's normal enemies. For example, a boss called ""Annie"" that appeared on the first act, appeared as a normal enemy with her health in the next act. Another thing I like about Hero Siege is it's replayability. While it may get a little boring once you beaten all the acts with each character, and I highly doubt many people have done it, each time you play a new act, or a new character, the fun factor doesn't decrease. Hero Siege brings a lot of new content to the table for each of it's components. Each acts has different bosses, enemies, traps. Each character has different weapons, abilities, and special buffs. For example, my Demon Slayer has a lot of health and speed, while my friends Samurai seemed to have a lot of attack damage and got a lot omore experience then me. Which brings me to another point, this game can be played single player, and be extremely fun. While this may seem like a wierd point, and it is, since I can't really word it correctly, I have to give an example. Basically, I can sit down at my PC, skype a friend, and we can both play in our own single player worlds, talking to each other about new things we would, and new bosses we're fighting, and our stats, weapons, relics, etc. Almost none of the games I've ever found had that feature where I can just talk to someone about thsi game and have a lot of fun. So, I may have left a lot out of the game in terms of pros, and I have, I need to be starting on the cons. One of the main problems I have about this game is it's terrible multiplayer support. Normally on Steam games, you can just press join game or something of that nature. In Hero Siege, you have to make your own server by port-forwarding, which not a lot of people know how to. But that's not an issue for me, other than that I can't port-forward, as in it just doesn't work on my computer. My problem is the amount of bugs in multiplayer. I have seen some update logs, and I can see that they are fixing a lot of them, so I guess that good. Another con with this game is how the learning isn't exactly steep, but just ""there"". People who are bad at the game can't exactly get better. The good loot is with the hard to defeat enemies, and without that, you can't really get better. You're just... stuck? Another thing that I didn't like was that the bosses difficulty fluctiuated, alot. Sometimes I would face a boss that I could one hit on round 24, and then I would face a boss that would one hit me on round 6. They definitely need to change the boss strength to make each boss equal to each other. Another thing that bothers me is that the bosses never really get harder. I'm not talking about through acts, but through the rounds, one boss is as easy as another. When I played the first time, the first boss was extremely hard, and I found pleasure in that. Over the time, as I got better and better loot, I found that none of the bosses leveled up to match my skill. I could instantly take them down, and sometimes, I wouldn't even notice they were bosses. That's due to some of the bosses and almost all of the mini-bosses being re-colors of other enemies. I would like the bosses and the enemies get higher in stats as I level up, since now it's just kind of boring to go through the earlier rounds. I just skip them all, and then just shoot them down easily. Other than that though, the game has really no more disadvantages that I can think of.So, now the real question, would I recommend this game? Yes, definitely. I am recommending this to all my friends at school, and even some out of school. If you're not really good at games like this, more so, terrible at games like this, don't get it. You won't really advance and it'll just be boring. However, if you can handle a challenge, and be patient with the game to level up and get your equipment, I promise this game will be a good buy, I only noticed this game when it was on sale for $.050, and I got the 4-pack. I would probably have gotten it even for it's $6 price now. "

												I think the game is good. I played it straid 40 min and i was wrong about the game. Before I played it I was thinking that the game is to simple. But I was wrong.Only one think. Do I need to have all of the DLCs to get the Achievement that you need to have all the characters on level 100?			"

												One of the best indie games ive ever played. This is diablo and the binding fo issac. Mltiplayer now almost fully works, totally worth it. DLC is a little overpriced, but it is worth it just because of how much replayability. I recommend to anyone. I also suggest getting on sale...4 pack. Your friends will love it! HAVE FUN!			"

To me its a very good cross between the first Diablo, and Legend of Zelda link to the past.The only issue I have with the game is there is some fog that gets in the way of visibility. I hope an option to disable the fog is added. Besides that the game is an A+ for sure.			"

												It's an ok game. Has a few issues but still kind of fun.One the biggest issues is the difficulty distribution, especially in the randomly spawning crypts and dungeons. You could get an easy small corridor with a chest in or you could get placed with several monsters with thousands of HP and insane defense, in a room that doesn't allow for kiting or dodging, basically meaning an instant loss that you can only avoid by never taking dungeons. Same deal with standard level boss monsters. You could get an easy melee thing that does nothing and has barely any health, or you get a ranged behemoth, with tons of health, spewing AOE that puts Gradius to shame.Another issue is the seemingly random events that happen thoughout the stages. They vary from raining coins, to raining fiery balls of death. Most of them are fine, but one of them is unavoidable and basically an instant kill. It spawns spiked balls (like a mace head) that roam around the stage in a set pattern. However, it seems to always spawn one of these balls on top of you. Which makes you take 3 or 4 hits before you can escape, which is a problem when you can generally only take 3 hits before you die, from anything.If you can put up with these issues and you enjoy playing Hammerwatch or The Binding of Isaac, you will probably enjoy this game. Challenging, addictive and well worth the few quid it costs. "

												With the overwhelming amount of positive reviews and the game being marketed as ""[...] one of the most loved indie hack n slash games with roguelike elements! Join the fun now!!"" I did indeed expect to have fun.But fun was not had. This is a plain twin stick shooter masked as a hack n slash. Acts are also promised, but is rather a randomized arena where waves of enemies spawn. That was another letdown because I expected a randomized map as in a place where the outer edges shift in shape instead of a simple square. Though to be fair, there's dungeons. However I never had the chance to enter one before I lost interest.Third letdown was the combat. I always play melee whenever I have the choice and the little I did that in this game consisted of pointing the left stick away from the monsters and the right stick towards them, occasionally pressing it whenever a skill had cooled down.All in all this game feels like it would fare better as a newly released early access game. Since it is not I just can't find a reason to recommend this game.			"

												A pretty fun game that unfortuinatly lets itself down with bad practises. In order to get the achievemnts for the main game you HAVE to buy DLC.There are some also annoying little things, like you have to press a button to pick items up when you are close enough. Sometimes these items spawn ontop of the doors or ladders you go close to in order to leave to the next level. This usually results in the loss of those items, as once you leave an area and return it's reset itself meaning all the items you left there are gone.The game can also be quite annoying too if you're trying to build up alot of items (which since it has a small roguelike element) you loose them on death. I find that when I die, I either get one or two shot, even after assigning all talent points into damage reduction and health.So I'd probably recommend just getting Diablo, which when you've bought all the DLC for this game comes out to the same price xP			"

												I played this game for only around 5 hours, and I'm already in love with it. I just finished Act I with 4 legendary pieces of armor, and Hero Seige has only gotten more fun over the time. There are a couple down sides to it however, but we'll get into that after I state the pros. So, let's get into the details.The game is quite addicting. While it can get a bit repettitive if you're, quite frankly, bad at it, since you face the same monsters and bosses every time you play, if you're skilled at the game you can pass Acts ""quickly"". Each act has it's own bosses, monsters, traps, etc. The one things that I have found to stay the same is the drops and the layouts of the dungeons and crypts. Even after I beat Act I and got into the snowy act, the crypts and dungeons are still the same textiles as before, dirty. This may be for a reason, since it is underground, but I would have liked to seen some more details, perhaps at least some snow, or maybe some other factor that would indicate the low temperature. One thing I liked about changing acts is that it seems that the previous act's bosses are the new act's normal enemies. For example, a boss called ""Annie"" that appeared on the first act, appeared as a normal enemy with her health in the next act. Another thing I like about Hero Siege is it's replayability. While it may get a little boring once you beaten all the acts with each character, and I highly doubt many people have done it, each time you play a new act, or a new character, the fun factor doesn't decrease. Hero Siege brings a lot of new content to the table for each of it's components. Each acts has different bosses, enemies, traps. Each character has different weapons, abilities, and special buffs. For example, my Demon Slayer has a lot of health and speed, while my friends Samurai seemed to have a lot of attack damage and got a lot omore experience then me. Which brings me to another point, this game can be played single player, and be extremely fun. While this may seem like a wierd point, and it is, since I can't really word it correctly, I have to give an example. Basically, I can sit down at my PC, skype a friend, and we can both play in our own single player worlds, talking to each other about new things we would, and new bosses we're fighting, and our stats, weapons, relics, etc. Almost none of the games I've ever found had that feature where I can just talk to someone about thsi game and have a lot of fun. So, I may have left a lot out of the game in terms of pros, and I have, I need to be starting on the cons. One of the main problems I have about this game is it's terrible multiplayer support. Normally on Steam games, you can just press join game or something of that nature. In Hero Siege, you have to make your own server by port-forwarding, which not a lot of people know how to. But that's not an issue for me, other than that I can't port-forward, as in it just doesn't work on my computer. My problem is the amount of bugs in multiplayer. I have seen some update logs, and I can see that they are fixing a lot of them, so I guess that good. Another con with this game is how the learning isn't exactly steep, but just ""there"". People who are bad at the game can't exactly get better. The good loot is with the hard to defeat enemies, and without that, you can't really get better. You're just... stuck? Another thing that I didn't like was that the bosses difficulty fluctiuated, alot. Sometimes I would face a boss that I could one hit on round 24, and then I would face a boss that would one hit me on round 6. They definitely need to change the boss strength to make each boss equal to each other. Another thing that bothers me is that the bosses never really get harder. I'm not talking about through acts, but through the rounds, one boss is as easy as another. When I played the first time, the first boss was extremely hard, and I found pleasure in that. Over the time, as I got better and better loot, I found that none of the bosses leveled up to match my skill. I could instantly take them down, and sometimes, I wouldn't even notice they were bosses. That's due to some of the bosses and almost all of the mini-bosses being re-colors of other enemies. I would like the bosses and the enemies get higher in stats as I level up, since now it's just kind of boring to go through the earlier rounds. I just skip them all, and then just shoot them down easily. Other than that though, the game has really no more disadvantages that I can think of.So, now the real question, would I recommend this game? Yes, definitely. I am recommending this to all my friends at school, and even some out of school. If you're not really good at games like this, more so, terrible at games like this, don't get it. You won't really advance and it'll just be boring. However, if you can handle a challenge, and be patient with the game to level up and get your equipment, I promise this game will be a good buy, I only noticed this game when it was on sale for $.050, and I got the 4-pack. I would probably have gotten it even for it's $6 price now. "

												This game honestly surprised me, it delivered more than i expected.It's very similar to The Binding of Issac, but with some progression through leveling your character. It's not one of those games which you play for hour upon hour, but for 6€ you can't really go wrong.It's definetly worth the money and if it's on a sale you have to be really cheap to skip out.Multiplayer is still in Alpha.

												I absolutely love this game, pretty much anything ""dungeon crawler"" I love to death and this game perfectly fits in my favorites list.  However that being said, I have very mixed feelings and can recommend buying this game for certain things and avoiding it for others. I am changing my Not-Recommended to Recommended for somethings.-- Singleplayer -- (Recommended)The gameplay for Hero Siege reminds me of Diablo 2 and The Binding of Issac I can say that after awhile of playing I haven't encountered many issues due to recent patches. I can honestly say that if you are looking for an amazing dungeon crawler experience grab this game immediatly. -- Multiplayer -- (Not Recommended)Oh boy this is where the fun begins. Let's just start with the registration process of PanicNet. You need to create an account with PanicNet in order to play online. People have been having trouble with this however I have not, it worked perfectly fine for me. Now onto the actual gameplay, this is where the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. 1. The delay when you are attacking is horrible if you are not the one hosting the actual session, and yes I have played with many different people so it can't be lag. 2. Things tend to break alot especially quests, you will at some point get quests when you are playing and sometimes the objectives for the quest will be outside the map not allowing you to complete the quest. 3. Like singleplayer crashes tend to occur not as much but they do exist. Oh... did I mention how BUGGY AS♥♥♥♥♥♥IT IS? *ahem* it's quite bad.If you are planning to play singleplayer that is fine go ahead and buy the game however if you are planning to buy the game for multiplayer I would hold off until they fix it, they have been working hard on this game so I don't see these issues lasting much longer.

												It's remarkably good at capturing the important elements of Diablo II: loot, navigating skill trees, corralling enemies in order to maximize the number you hit with your stronger skills, that sort of thing. Once I noticed that I could repeatedly tap the next wave button to get all of the level's waves to come at me, the combat became reasonably challenging.It does have some drawbacks though: I've only had a few times where my build was so awful that the bosses lasted longer than the short line they say when they spawn; the game crashed a few times, once it explained itself with an ""Out of Memory Exception"" (I probably had about 4 GB for it to use at the time), other times it just sort of forgot to draw new frames to the screen for a couple seconds, while I listened to monsters trying to kill me. I don't recommend entering a dungeon while a boss is in the process of spawning. And one time I got knocked over the border fence that prevents you from going outside the level, and couldn't get back in.Sadly, this game has not gotten me any closer to figuring out how to do Diablo-style loot without ending up with Diablo-style combat. Oh well. "

I really wish steam had a “neutral option.”Review in a minute: 


YouTube™ Video: Review in a Few: Hero Siege 

			Views: 105		

			Here is my review in a few for Hero Siege. Buy the game here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/269210/ My written review can be found on steam here:...		

To preface this, I own all collector’s edition DLC and will likely continue to purchase expansions.Hero siege is a hack and slash horde based roguelike with RPG elements tagged on. Containing two player local co-op and 4 player online co-op, with many different classes to play for strong replayability.   It has solid character progression, leading you from a frustrating insta-death to a godlike destroyer of worlds for its RPG influence.  It’s heavily reminiscent of Diablo 2, the two creators being huge fans who enjoyed the grind.It has a lot of visual variety, but it’s mostly a façade covering up its bland designs.  Every map has a different look to it, but the randomness leaves them all feeling the same – With just houses and holes to fill the space between traps and events, nothing changes level to level besides the colors.  This isn’t entirely a bad thing, as it adds a certain familiarity to it all.The controls are very responsive in combat with both a controller and a keyboard; however the menu controls are very much designed for a controller.  Navigating the inventory is a huge pain unless you’re working your thumbs, as it has strange keybinds and lacks mouse support.  With a large variety of classes to pick from, you can find a class that fits your playstyle, some more interactive than others.  This however has led to balance issues, causing certain classes to be useless during certain stages of gamestate.  There’s a few classes locked behind a DLC paywall, restricting a few unique playstyles.Relics are drops that can change the way you play, and add a lot of roguelike feel to the game.  You collect one relic per boss/dungeon/crypt you complete, and they disappear if you die.  While a great mechanic, it means that death requires you to replay old levels or be severely gimped.  Some relics were added with the DLC, so if you play without it some relics are unobtainable.  They weren’t added retroactively.There’s an item system as well, which carries over between lives.  It allows you to customize your characters beyond skills, and in some cases gives you them.  However I’ve found it leads more towards getting one über item early on and keeping it until you hit max level rather than gearing up slowly.Overall I’m very neutral on the game.  I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy roguelikes, Diablo 2, or Gauntlet, but I also wouldn’t recommend it if you never plan on picking up the DLC as the basegame is lacking in certain regards that has been fixed by the DLC.

												Hero Siege is a fun game, though the DLC's are WAY too expensive since the game only costs about 3 euro and dlcs like 35+ lol, and you need like 3 dlcs for one to fully work which imo is pretty bad if you only want one hero and not three.Multiplayer still in BETA, get's disconnected and game freezes sometimes but other than that it's fine.Fun game if you are bored or just want to spend some time on leveling and picking stuff up :PRate: 7,5/10 cus it still has bugs on multiplayer. If this game were to be ever bugfree I'd give it a 9/10 :) Thanks/ Moa :)			"

												The Game is fun, but it has many flaws. First of all, the combination of genres is really cool. It's basically a Beat'em Up + RPG + Rogue-Lite, it definitely has many inspirations from The Binding of Isaac (it even borrows ideas like the bible makes you fly"", ""Book of Belilal, gives you DMG"", and others, plus the way you attack.). Now, when it reaches a certain point, with a certain combination of items, i became a lawnmower with my Viking, destroying multiple waves of monsters in high difficulties alone, with ease. Now, i'll let the flaws come in. Trying to play with friends is a nightmare. You can either port-foward or use Hamachl, but the game constantly crashes, bugs you back to the lobby, many funky stuff that annoys. In a server, you can exit in you don't lose any of your items, so the game is kinda broken there.The sound effects are nice, but most of the voice acting is really unprofessional and distracting, like that Stickman active item that is really weird and badly dubbed. Bosses are ridiculous easy at the beginning, at the point of enemies having equal or more HP than them, and later on bosses have a weird difficulty spike. (Hp barely changes between Normal and Nightmare, there was another one that jumped to Hell where Anubis had like, 500k hp, then on Hell he had 2 or more Million hp.)There is a ridiculously frustrating puzzle in a dungeon where you have to place many crates over buttons (including a line of buttons, it probably sparkles the memories of whoeved did it), where if you don't have any flight it will be a nightmare, the crates get stuck in corners, and any slight touch can move them, so you gotta restart it a lot and it bugged me a ton.And one of the biggest problems are the DLCs. Pratically half of the game content is locked behind DLCs, which are more expensive than the game itself. So yeah, if you're not into grinding through the same levels over and over with increasing difficulty, ready your wallet.Now, is the game worth it? Well, yeah! I had fun with it playing solo, it's satisfying to cut my way through enemies, it has cool mechanics and creative concepts, they only need to improve the game a bit to make it golden (looking at you, servers!).

												Used The Holy Bible to gain Levitation, and then used Satan's Tooth to set all the enemies on the screen on fire. On a serious note; this game is amazing. If you like looting, dungeon crawling, hack & slash rogue-type games, then you'll have a ton of fun with this. The game is currently beta testing dedicated servers for Multiplayer, however port forwarding works well enough for local play. So be sure to jump in with a friend! They update content frequently, however there are a few bugs, but it's understandable. Once you've played the game for a few hours, you might consider getting the DLC's as well, as they add a ton of extra content, bosses, loot, maps and classes. As they are, they're worth every dime. Overall, this is a pretty fun, addictive game. Got a few dollars to spare? Be sure to pick this up. :)			"

												Hero Siege; this game is simply amazing. It's a rogue-like, hack 'n' slash, RPG. Has the feeling of Binding of Isaac and the feeling of Diablo. You fight wave after wave of monsters leveling up abilities and picking up items in order to further your progression into the game. Beware that the farther you get into the game the more grinding you're going to need to do in order to progress. Pros	- Tons of Different Classes to Choose From- Smooth Gameplay with Great Controls- Pixelated Game with a Great RPG FeelingCons- The DLC is a little bit on the pricey side (especially if you bought this game when it was on sale)Final Verdict;10/10			"

												You are going to die, you are going to be resurrected, and then you are going to die some more. Keep your stats, get stronger and re-attempt the dungeon. This game will drive you crazy, but it is that fun kind of crazy that will make you go back for a bigger beatting. Controls are simple and smooth, plays a lot like an early Zelda game. Think SNES Zelda. Lots of different character classes, i started with the nomad. The dungeon seems to be randomized, every time you die you begin in a new location with different items. It makes for a sense of suspense especially when you are starting out and don't exactly know what to expect. Boxes and plants can be destroyed for items. Health however is scarce. You can play a few quick runs or a few hours, it is up to you. This game is easy to pick up and put down at any time. No need to remember where you left off. If you want a game with a huge amount of replay value, this is for you.			"

												Well, let me say that this game feels like an addiction.  I was not sure what to expect at first, but 10 minutes in and I was hooked.  It is a rougelike, but does not have permadeath.  You die, then keep your character and keep on.  This game reminds me why I loved Diablo 2 so much and what makes games like Torchlight so fun.  Kill and loot, kill and loot, and this one has great pixel blood and wonderful sound and music.  I have been playing with an Xbox 360 pad and have really enjoyed the vibration that ties in very well with the action.  I am of the opinion that this game deserves your money and your time.  Really a fun and enjoyable game.  Also, I still have not completed the first world, but I have seen tons and tons of random baddies where I died in a few seconds to a few hour long marathon of fun and loot.   Really seems random and depends on what you find.  Funniest thing I have found was some Razor Headphones which caused me to have Music Notes shoot out of my head and attack all the bad guys!  Was hard to see, but was super fun and funny.  Try this game you might just fall in love with it!			"

												If you want something to play that'll pass the time or crave a game with the classic RPG feeling to it, then Hero Siege is the perfect game for you. It's, in my opinion, a fantastic little gem of a game. Gameplay wise it feels as though the developer stuffed Diablo’s more reserved brother into a blender with The Binding of Issac, and added in a pinch of Killing Floor for good measure. In more sensible terms, it’s got a great number of rogue-like and RPG elements to it. There are a number of different levels, ranging from forests to snowy tundras, deserts and many more. At the end of each of these levels you can collect random pieces of loot, or relics as they’re called, which grant you varying stats and abilities. These relics come in four different flavours; weapon enhancing ones, which, as the name suggests, enhances your weapon giving it extra powers. For example an item called the Basilisk's Tooth makes it so that you have a 2% chance to turn enemies to stone. There are also passive relics as well, which improve your character’s skills. One example is the Cactus, which periodically spawns a cactus on the nearest enemy. The third relic type is active, which, after pressing the use key, will activate the effect of the relic. The Candy Crusher, one example of an active relic, launches candy in a ring around the player that explodes on landing. And the last relic type is orbiting, which float around the player and help during fights. One example is the Almighty Fedora which rapidly shoots projectiles.All these and many more can be obtained by progressing through the game, and surviving the large waves of enemies the game throws at you.Talking about enemies, there are a large number of different types. Ranging from axe throwing skeletons to towering yeti-like beasts. Also there are several “elite” type enemies that have particular skills that happen once they die. For example creating a large laser that spins in a circle or an X shaped explosion, which both appear where the “elite” was slain.There are also a number of RPG elements in the game too. For one, there are unique skill trees for each class, providing varying passive and active abilities, depending on which class you choose out of the possible seven, or ten (depending on whether you own the DLC). They also all have their own sort of personalities and quotes as well.Graphically the game looks a lot like your typical indie, rogue-like affair. But it fits nicely. The characters are easily distinguishable from each other and the varying levels all look pixel pretty with their individual themes and settings. Overall the game feels enjoyable to play. The classes and their skills vary enough for the game to be replayed time and time again. Not to mention the seemingly endless number of experience levels you can rack up on a single class. The enemies vary in difficultly, depending on the level, and the boss battles, for the most part, feel fairly satisfying once they eventually kick the bucket.To Conclude, I’d say that Hero Siege is worth a play, whether it’s a rogue-like or an RPG you're after, or just a quick bit of fun. It’s a satisfying game to play and well worth a go.			"

												Im not entirely sure how much this game has or will be improved, but it could sure is it. The difficulty is tough right off the bat, classes are rather vague before you just wing em and try and the use for gold seems... Nonexistent... Nothing is really explained at all.SOIf you do have this or decide to get it, don't expect something new and revolutionary. Paying for early access to multiplayer pretty much is a flop, since the non-intuitive instructions for the needed port forwarding are just that. My roommate and had to so say screw it and end up using splitscreen. That worked I guess, but feeling other players' vibrations was pretty obnoxious.TL;DR: 4/10			"

												Fantastic game, It's a combination of nostalgic graphics and diablo 2 gameplay elements.It's perfect for 2-4 friends over a weekend or longer.Hero Siege's dedicated serversystem is however having some slight bug issues right now, However they're in beta and the developers have been very informative of that. However there's always the Peer-To-Peer option that's basically bug-free. Overall the game runs smoothly and tanks up for alot of fun. The DLC's amps up the difficulty a bit and provides more acts and more items to be found, They also unlock some new and interesting characters.			"

												If you happen to see this game on sale with the DLC pretty cheap, pick it up.First, addressing all the Non-recommended reviews:The community is small but pleasant most of the time, and the developers are working and responding to how the community wants to shape the game.Yes they try new things, and yes they mess it up sometimes. But if the community doesn't like it then it gets revoked and they take a step back. Mana System is not bad at all despite what people make it out to be. There are bugs that people happen to lose their relics and then come write a negative review instead of troubleshoot the problem with developers. You should also note the date of most of the (Helpful Reviews) are from more than two months ago (with exception).The game itself (As of February 5th 2016)PROS -------------------- Latest update has smoothed gameplay a lot- If you are in the U.S. they just added dedicated servers so multiplayer is a lot more playable with other people. (Other dedicated servers are in Germany, sorry Asia dwellers)- Community is small and you'll make friends fast- Gameplay is pretty fun, loot system lets you pick up gear and there is a decent (albiet small and not too variable) skill    system.- Wave System allows you to control what comes at you, enemies are now released in packs that speed up gameplay.- Endless Level Wormhole lets you put your gear to the test with enemies that scale up a lot.CONS ----------------------- Siege Mode doesn't let you skip waves at the moment.- There is a relic that when you pick it up and exit game, causes all your relics to disappear.- Sometimes devs try something out that everybody hates and you have to wait a while for them to revert the changes.- Sometimes crashes unexpectedly, annoying but boots right back up quickly, doesn't have any extremely negative results from the crash (loss of items, gold, etc.) from what I've seen so far.- Active Relics (kind of like skills you have to activate) are way less powerful than Passive ones.I'll update with more as the game progresses, but it is very much playable in it's current state and quite fun despite what others think. If you got more than a full day in game time, I'd say you have gotten your money's worth.			"

												In this game, all you need to do is to survive. Survive waves of monsters / bosses that spawn. Nothing more.In the start, the game is really fun, you do your best and die, but after 2 hours the fun ends. The controls in this game are very simple. My first character was the Viking, wich was melee-only character. Killing bosses with him is impossible, so I tried another characters. The next on the list was the necromancer. When I cleared a level, the necromancer said something like this: ""Why it's so dark here? oh, my hood is down"" and then you can hear the voice actor laughting, wich♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. My next character was the Marksman. His abillity is to shoot arrows from a crossbow and deploy wooden autoturrets. In my second or third try, I reached lvl 30 and around wave 80. The game is same. Same gameplay but diffrent arenas. Also there are items that look exactly (well almost) like in the game The Binding of Isaac.I'd give this game a 3/10 because the cheapness, and the lack of ideas. Also after I defeated a boss, I found a relic that was a NAZI SYMBOL.			"

												They should have left the game as it was when they first released it, and worked on that.Instead they brought out DLC's they didn't need. And revamped systems which weren't broke.Get your core game working before you charge money for extensions to the core game.Then the dev's. Oh man the developers. Always crying about the trolls.Oh boohoo people are being mean to me in a public forum wah wah.Shutup and suck it up. You made a game.

												Hero Siege is a really fun Rogue-like RPG,with some unique elements to it.It differs from from the ''room-after-room'' template and has 100+ different and unique to each other stages,all filled with countless waves of monsters for you to kill.It is very action packed,but has a slight strategic element to it,allowing you to build your character the way you want to,instead of being linear in terms of progression.Unfortunately,no game is perfect.If you do choose to pick this game up(and i recommend you to do),expect a few of your runs to end unexpectedly.At the current state of the game,there are a couple of ways you can almost instantly die,no matter where you are,or at what stage/difficulty you are on.Furthermore,the successfulness of your run heavily depends on the items you get,and not so much on your character and the way you have built him(Your character's and your own skill can't take you to the endgame without some items to back you up).The lack of tutorial is a double-edged sword,since even if you cant understand anything about the game from the start,it is verry fun to learn everything yourself.Overral,i would reccomend buying this game if you want a way to waste your free time.It doesn't contain micro-transactions and has more than a lot of potential,so that's a plus in my books.At it's current state you can't play it ''full-time'' but it's hella fun to play when you have nothing else better to do(it's better that shooting birds at pigs while waiting for the bus at least).8/10 For this one			"

TL;DR Rating:[3/5]  ""Fun but Flawed""-Buy when it goes on saleSo, this game is a Twin-Stick-Shooter that is basically a mash up of Diablo and The Binding of Isaac. It has the persistence of gear you equip that is permanent between deaths, and the rogue-likeness of relics that you collect that add effects or massive stat increases and randomized potions that act on your current run ONLY.Graphics: Solid, vibrant sprites, pretty much what you would expect of it.Sound: OK, the voice-overs are amatuer and the BG music is bland and repetitive, but the sound effects are decent.Controls: Responsive and intuitive, good controller support, but some controler functions overlap in menusDLC Content: Unfortunately, half of the game is locked behind ""DLC"" including later acts and classes. If you are on the fence, buy the base game and try it before you buy the rest.Gameplay: ....Ok here is where things get dicey. I really want to love this game more but....The bugs.... god the bugs... This is a game that has (had?) so much potential but I feel like the enourmous list of unfixed bugs is really holding it back. Many have pointed out that the devs have almost abandoned this game, and it is kinda true. They do still fix things here and there but the backlog of documented bugs is astounding. Some you can exploit to power up, some exploit YOU and ruin your run. This is not an early access game, but if you buy it expect all the things that you would expect of an early access game. Its pretty buggy.Class balance is pretty... unbalanced. It becomes clear very quickly which classes are god-like and which are terrible. That doesnt mean they are un-playable, but dont expect to be on equal footing in the higher difficulties.Multiplayer is one of the main draws of this game, but you will need to port forward to host, and the dedicated servers are restricted to Europe. On top of that, the multiplayer server hub system seems to crash often, and player hosted games can also crash for no appearant reason.Items (relics) are somewhat bland, many are blatent clones of The Binding of Isaac items, some are utterly trash, and some really dont make any sense functionally or thematically.NOW DESPITE ALL THAT... I still like this game. This is a nice little loot-grind shoot-em-up and its fun to play with friends or randoms, you get to feel pretty powerful and awesome when you start getting gear and mowing down dozens of enemies at the same time and there are hella explosions and huge damage numbers. It is definitely fun, but at the normal price it is probably not worth it. It has too many bugs and not enough dev support to warrent a full price purchase. If you like the genre, then buy when and if it goes on sale again.			"

												There might be some kind of awesome endgame experience I'm totally missing out on, but the first few hours in this game are terrible and didn't leave me wanting more. I'm not sure they balance tested the singleplayer; or at least not the early game.Starts off nearly impossible. You do practically no damage and every level up feels like a joke; with each stat point giving maybe a 0.5% increase in your damage or attack speed (You only get 2 points to spend per level). Statues on the map spit shots which kill new players in one or two hits and they're sometimes hidden by enemies, grass, or trees so you're often clueless about how you died.The game is miserly with any loot as well. It wasn't until my 25th run that I even knew the game had items at all. You pick up gold but it can't be spent unless you also figure out that you need to save a key and hope that a ""Treasure Fort"" randomly spawns. Items are only available through locked chests (for which keys are very rare), shops (Also needs a key), or by beating a boss which I wasn't able to manage until at least by 30th run. By this time my character was level 10.Binding of Isaac gives you a gimme floor to start you off and hands you a free item in the first 2 minutes so you know what the game is about; Dispite drawing heavy influence from it, this game seems to miss that critical concept.

												Hey, I've never bothered writing a review before, but I just want to say DO NOT GET HIS GAME. I really enjoyed it when I first got it, and I spent a ton of time playing it. I took a break from it and when I started playing again, it was obviously revamped and patched quite a bit. Unfortunately, the developer(s?) have no idea how to playtest their game, apparently, as I consistently get bugs and unreasonably high RAM usage from it. Issues I never had originally. So they broke the game with updates and I have yet to play a session where I do not get bumped out for ""Fatal Memory Error."" Pretty disappointing, as the game was a lot of fun initially, even for quite a long time.ALSO WORTH NOTING, the developer does not care about the bugs or the feedback from players, as can be seen in many of the reviews on here. Bottom line: Do Not Get This Game			"

												Great game with aspects from both Binding of Isaac and the Diablo series. Easiest way to kill time playing and something to really get into. Yeah there are a ton of bugs, but with the patches being released most of them are being fixed.Very farm heavy if you aren't very good at the game for relics. Solid 4/5 only because trying to find a game with multiplayer is a ♥♥♥♥♥,  but once that's fixed 5/5. 6/5 with rice. For only .89 cents when I purchased it, there is really no reason not to buy it and try it.			"

												There might be some kind of awesome endgame experience I'm totally missing out on, but the first few hours in this game are terrible and didn't leave me wanting more. I'm not sure they balance tested the singleplayer; or at least not the early game.Starts off nearly impossible. You do practically no damage and every level up feels like a joke; with each stat point giving maybe a 0.5% increase in your damage or attack speed (You only get 2 points to spend per level). Statues on the map spit shots which kill new players in one or two hits and they're sometimes hidden by enemies, grass, or trees so you're often clueless about how you died.The game is miserly with any loot as well. It wasn't until my 25th run that I even knew the game had items at all. You pick up gold but it can't be spent unless you also figure out that you need to save a key and hope that a ""Treasure Fort"" randomly spawns. Items are only available through locked chests (for which keys are very rare), shops (Also needs a key), or by beating a boss which I wasn't able to manage until at least by 30th run. By this time my character was level 10.Binding of Isaac gives you a gimme floor to start you off and hands you a free item in the first 2 minutes so you know what the game is about; Dispite drawing heavy influence from it, this game seems to miss that critical concept.

												So far this is a great game to play!Although it's got a lot of issues needed to be sorted- Objects spawning outside of the play area- Minions walking through gates and staying there- Multiplayer netcode (although it's still in beta, really needs improvement for it)- Playing local co-op is a mess (Inventory issues, P2 can't sell stuff ect ect)and more...But it's also got some good stuff- Hours of replayability- Active development- Easy to learn- Great visuals and audio- Pretty decent mechanicsAnd yeah, that's the jist of it really meh meow "

												Do you know, what hack-n-slash is? Well, this game is hack-n-slash RPG as it should  be.Tons of foes, tons of loot, tons of easter eggs, tons of fun, single or coop! The only thing can spoil the impression is a) difficulty of this game - aware everything you see and even more! b) this game a little buggy, but it's ok for indie project. If you like tons of enemies, loot and fun and nevermind of hardcore, play this game, you won't regret it!			"

Short versionThis is a wonderful quick-fix for Diablo 2 fans, and for the money you'll get a solid deal.  Don't expect an incredibly deep game or story, and don't expect something truly amazing - this won't be a game you keep coming back to years later.  But for what it is, it's a fair deal and it's definitely worth the price.Pros:- Local co-op, always a big plus in my book.- Random loot, random levels, and lots of difficulty options after you ""win"", offering a fair bit of replayability.- The first two DLCs added enough fun that I don't consider them a waste of money (this is rare in my book).- There are a lot of interesting classes out of the box even if you don't bother with DLCs.- You can reset skills, but the cost is high enough to make you have to think about it.Cons:- The loot system feels all wrong to me - by level 50 I'm still finding that my level 20 gear is better than anything I've found since.  I expected something more like Diablo 2 or Borderlands where a white level 50 is far beyond any level 20 item.  It seems like loot level has very little to do with loot quality, which makes the item hunt boring fast.- Does gold ever matter?  I thought D2's gold system was broken....- The game becomes a grind very quickly - I'm not sure I'll bother playing anymore, though I do want to know if loot ever catches up with my level.- There are a variety of annoying bugs, like loot dropping in places you can't reach.  If loot mattered more, this could be tragic.- The game is incredibly non-intuitive.  You really have to work to learn how to play.- There's effectively no story to speak of.- Many skill synergies feel forced and/or meaningless.- Many skills feel forced and/or meaningless.			"

												Essentially, this game reminds me a lot of Diablo 2. It has a lot of different classes you can play. Theres loot drops, gold drops, hp/mana drops, and potion drops that do things to your stats. You have a skill tree and attribute points to distribute however you please. The game is played in waves and you use portals to get to the place with the waves, and in/out of town. A nice feature of this game is the online play with server lists. However, I have a lot of issues connecting to other peoples servers even though I have a great internet connection. Its a fun game, and cheap too. I believe this game has been in game bundles before (I think thats how I got it), so its definitely worth it to try it out if its sitting in your library or on sale for cheap.			"

												I'm not usually into these types of games, but Hero Siege plays great for me! I really enjoy the leveling up and upgrading your character system, and the art style is fantastic. I feel this game is severely underrated because people just don't give it a chance once they see a lot of the negative reviews. The game sells currently for $0.89, which is just a must buy, and if you don't want to play alone you can buy the 4-pack for just $2.69. I have yet to try the multiplayer component, but I have nothing but high hopes that it will meet or exceed my expectations.			"

												Well I would give this a 4.5/5 for several reasons. First of all this is very addicting (but in a good way). Everything about this game is being balanced and there is SO much development and new updates happening to the game. I love all of the DLC's and how there are changes and sometimes totally new content at LEAST once a week.The downside at the moment is that there are a lot of bugs. As in I entered a crypt as the timer for ""next wave"" hit zero (this means the crypt would dissapear) so when I got in my whole screen was black and nothing happened....could not quit so I force closed window. I re-opened and ohhhh greeeat all my relics were gone! So its the things like that which can really make the game annoying xD but other than that things are being patched quickly and everything about this dungeon crawler is awesomeCancel everything above out, as the dev's patched a ton of bugs. Way to go!			"

												Fun casual madness. Reminds me of the sidescroller games, or smash tv.Graphics is cute, gameplay is fun, everything has special mechanics that you need to learn to get good at this game.If you like playing laid back games with friends without too much at stake, this is the game for you.Currently the developer(s) are having some server issues with multiplayer. It's quite new, and the game gets a lot of players every time there's a sale, resulting in more traffic than they can handle. Expect some multiplayer issues, but have patience. the base game is incredibly cheap, and has most of the content. If you think you'd enjoy it, i cant imagine anything better  to do with a dollar.

												Anything by panic art studios has been good so far.  I always somehow manage to get their great titles. and my computer never has issues running them. Even at 60FPS.This game is great, taking tower defense to a fun level. It reminds me of early flash games, only way more beefed out. While it may copy off of binding of issacs controls, thats where the similarities to the game really do end. You can upgrade your character, and its not that hard to do it either. I don't really know what else to say other than ""JUST DO IT."" ""NO, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?""EDIT: I saw the negative reviews and played the game more recently. It has issues, but put this into perspective: Most triple A titles are lucky to be WITHOUT issues. so why are you guys complaining some indie game has them? Going as far as calling the developers incompetent fools? Honestly i don't see where the negative reviews are coming from, even after the new update. This isn't panic art studios only good title. Squishy the suicidal pig is another one i have to reccomend, and that one has no issues, so it just seems like people aren't doing their research, and are just jumping ship to say the developers are terrible. Far from it.			"

But still, the repetitiveness, illogical difficulty curve (hardest at the beggining, paradoxically becomes too easy on higher difficulty levels with bosses dying in a blink of an eye), poor graphics and bugs are too much to give it a positive review.

												I just bought the game and have played a decent amount of time and in all fairness it's a wonderful game. The ram required is no joke for how many projectiles and effects can be going at once, which makes the game look amazing. The controls are a little hard to manage with but you'd get used to them quickly, other than the space and enter key switching from time to time. The bosses are really cool and strong if you're not prepared so this makes things challenging. The voices and dialog from the characters are amazing. (The Necromancer just sound amazing and dark) The game has quite simple to grasp gameplay and directions on how to do some things such as unlocking golden chests. A lot of really cool enemies are in the game. And to top it off there are tons of really amazing skills In the end I'd give this game a 9/10 because of the lag that can occur from massive particle amounts but other than that the game is awesome espicially since it's got multiplayer, just think of a top down COD 2 Zombies with fantasy elements. Enjoy the game and thank you to the developers for making this game.			"

												For it's price it is the best game I played in ages.. Literly is a drug when u get the hang of it. Only negative points I could tell is that the balance between classes is diffrent. I played fallen paladin wich dies alot. Though later levels and being equal to samurai who i beated 4 maps on 1 st playtrough with. He managed to seem more bulky and more easy to handle than before.  so now i have a lv 15 paladin and a lv 14 samurai , Samurai seems op , still not sure if paladin might balance back in later levels.

												So far throughout my experience playing this game I've had a blast! The multiplayer is a ton of fun especially when you get to play with your friends and just slay tons and tons of monsters over and over. The game is still pretty early in development so it has its issues. I would tell anyone to give this game a try and don't worry about the bugs, they're basically part of the game right now. All in all, it's a great game. -Pros - Great replay ability- 4 Player Co-op (great for friends)- Ranking system (challenge your friends)- Devs are constantly at work improving the game and adding DLC- DLC and extras are pretty cheap- Helpful community -Cons - A lot of bugs, not as many anymore (devs and community are working hard to fix them)- Server connectivity, the server drops every now and then but almost never happens.- Community complains about everyone wrong with the game.- Servers are self hosted, requires port forwarding.

												Interested in Roguelike games or 2-D low resolution games?So that's it.Wanna suffer lethal traps  and tons of  combat damage in early stages and be invincible in later stages?So that's it.Dying to try  10 different characters ,physical,magical,mixed?So that's it.6/10 Really?Here goes the point.Yes,you may have heard of random traps ,random bosses etc,BUT the general terrain issettled.After finishing normal level,you unlock nightmare,then,try to play the whole 6 stages again with familiar terrain.If you're ok with that.Go ahead,play hell level and more levels to unlock!Geez.So many levels and even hardcore mode.Can anyone bear this?Such a waste of time.It's my first time to play roguelike game,so I'm not sure whether others have same settings.""Sigh""According to my experience,you can reach lvl100 at nightmare Stage 6.Unbeatable.Your stats will be stacked by 1000+ with numerous potions and relics.By the way,relics are not helpful at any time.Example,some of them could increase your strength and decrese your armor  and swiftness.Remember,your stats can be under zero!If you are a melee in early stages,then good luck XDDD. There are several screenshots, you may surf my page(no idea how to post a link).Why I post 10 characters?Cuz in most conditions I just set up a file to check the skills and no further try,which means I don't know exactly the number.LOLAll in all,I suggest firstly choosing a ranger(magician&archer&shooter),reach lvl 100,and one more melee to start again if you like.Don't even think about trying Viking firstly,or you must be ____ed up(no idea how to type heart like others either)Don't even think about full achivements-no way if less than 100hrs were spent. One more to go,I'm an ordinary student who just passed CET6,so sry for any potential mistake. If you have any problems or questions,plz let me know.			"

Yes the multiplayer isn't the greatest although i can see the devs are trying their best to fix it (and it's paying off!) so play with lots of friends and with that trading system their implementing you will no longer have to be that guy who gets money at the end of each round! And you'll really be able to sharpen your classes being able to trade with your friends (i'm assuming you can trade relics).So if you don't like this game for a certain reason don't let your 5 quid go to waste, watch the game you may just like it more in a month or two.Great little game worth the money 8.5/10			"

												Do you enjoy Binding of Isaac's feeling of Random items and the joys of finding that one item that you have no idea what it does? Do you enjoy the Hack n Slash of games like Diablo? Hero Siege puts both of these features in one amazingly fun game. Solo or with friends you will enjoy the game if you are a fan of Hack n Slash games.There are many Characters to choose from Ranging from Tanks to pure Damage Dealers.The Art work I fell in love with back when I found the game on the Google Play Store.The game has that crazy feeling of ""what am I getting this wave"" or ""Oh no Not this enemy again"".The game got many updates that did kind of In my opinion did dumb down the difficulty a lot.Multiplayer is a blast with friends,The game does get harder with more players but that makes the gameplay and the core of what the game was really fun. The DLC's are cheap and add a lot to the game. 5 New Characters, 3 New Chapters. New Items. New Enemies. The final act is actually quite a challange.If I had to rate the game..I'll give it about an 8/10.A few bugs in multiplayer are kind of annoying but are avoidable.All around I love the game and I support the developers with this great game they made and games they are going to make in the future!

												After playing for under 15 minutes, I concluded that this game's performance is too poor to be enjoyable.  Also, the aiming style (basic directions, no diagonal aim) is less than desirable for sure. Also, the user interface does not have tooltips to help you figure out what everything does.  Tooltips seem standard in these kinds of games nowadays. Finally, it looks like an arena-based game with little to no exploration.			"

												Like Binding of Isaac, be prepared to die.  A lot.   Despite knowing that, I have had few (if any) RageQuit experiences.  It's just plain fun.  And addictive.  Yeah, there are bugs in the game but each update I find fewer and fewer of them.  The Dev actually listens to the players (mostly) in regards to recommendations.  If the Dev disagrees with a recommendation, there is plenty of forum communication stating WHY.This is how indie games should be done.I currently have a level 25 Necromancer and despite that, I find new things abou the game each time I play.  If you enjoy roguelikes, retro ARPG's, and have a bit of a masochistic side (as most roguelike players do), the game is totally worth it.			"

												I bought in when this game was in it's early stages, and I thought it was great fun then (I really needed a Diablo fix, but I couldn't get Diablo 3 to work on my computer) It's only gotten better since, with bug fixes, a BIG increase in resolution, tons of additions to classes, items, and enemies (both in type and AI-  yes, they've improved the enemy AI, too!)If you're looking to sink hours into turning foes into gobs, and don't need super-detailed sprites, give it a whirl			"

												I love this game! It's a great throwback to the graphics and simple RPG elements of olde. The added rogue-like element was the perfect thing for this style of game; it really brings it all together. My one complaint is that nearly 5 times now I've made quite some progress, and out of nowhere a ""thing"", I have no idea what, falls on my head and kills me instantly, forcing me to restart act 1 over and over. There's no warning, no shadow or anything; it just comes completely out of nowhere. Otherwise, amazing game, 9 out of 10 :)			"

												A perfect blend of Binding of Isaac and Rogue Legacy, with enough traps to excite Admiral Ackbar. Defeat waves of enemies in five fixed waves leading up to a boss wave on level six. Treasure, and deities are randomly generated each wave to add potions and relics as well as temporary or permanent stat boosts/reductions.  From what I see there are threes stages but I've only made it to wave 26-30 before being killed by a trap I overlooked consecutive times. Challenging and addicting just like the two games mentioned previously. Highly recommended for fans of both.			"

												I don't really understand a lot of these negative reviews.I think the new item systerm is awesome, though the interface for it is pretty clunky at first until you understand what you're loooking at.  Obviously you can't get the best items without buying the dlc....that would be dumb, I don't want a dlc that provides no progression for my characters. Also the infamous mana update isn't as bad as people are making it out to be. Basically they significantly decreased the amount of mana in your pool, but honestly, I like this update. The game would've been way way way to easy with items if you could also infinitely spam all of your skills.My only gripe about this game is i pretty regularly get a very brief, very subtle screen freeze when killing a boss, or if I kill a large amount of monsters at once. It is'nt bad at all and doesn't even bother me unless I just so happen to be standing in the wrong spot and I die because of it.All in all the game is awesome and easily worth ther very cheap price tag. The dlc are only $3 each which are all also very much worth that. 8.5/10			"

												Elements of Binding of Isaac mixed with a very, very watered down Diablo 2?/3 makes Hero Siege.+ Cheap game~ Graphics are clean, somewhat- Controls best with a controller unfortunately (I had a controller anyway, but still)- Getting hit with hard-to-notice-projectiles amongst the busy (sometimes VERY busy) graphics- Cheap deaths ranging from enemy's death shooting a laser to environmental traps- Simplistic and unimaginative skills (all classes have multiple ""% to cast when attacking"" skills)- Terrible netcode for multiplayer (Why have it in a DLC if it's so terrible?)- Levels are all the same with little variation- Stat levels you gain from levelling mean very little- ""Relics"" (which are items that grant different effects you carry with you) are mostly unimaginative stat boosts- Bosses that appear after 6 waves do not scale with # of waves and are completely boring/easy (although how boring fighting these bosses are, this may be a good thing)- The only break from monotony are dungeons/crypts which are deathtraps (see: environmental traps)- Grindy with little rewardIn summary: the game's exceedingly cheap deaths, repetitive gameplay, and banal character skill trees make this game very difficult to recommend to even the most autistic player.

												Traps. Everywhere. They will spawn on top of you or behind things you can't see and kill you. Constantly. In one hit. Even if you're a tank who's invested his skill points soley in not dying.The game would actually be relatively fun otherwise, and I understand from long time players that months ago this was not the case, but you will only be playing in areas where the creeps and bosses pose little to no challenge just so you can possibly survive one hit for a trap or bomb (which detonate randomly when you kill enemies) and scuttle away to hopefully find some life. If you can't find enough before the next trap gets you, too bad. Back to the beginning. Of the act.Also at the moment there is no multiplayer if you don't buy dlc, just as a warning to any potentially mislead perspective buyers. The implication also seems to be that new things will only come to dlc owners now, which may not be the case, but the deliberately vague wording leaves me suspecting otherwise.Despite its seeming simplicity it might have actually been worth full price if not for the things I mentioned. It might have been like a SNES Diablo. Instead it's like a SNES Diablo where any enemy could be an undercover creeper and any wall or tree could be an out of bounds trap waiting to shoot bombs at you. Also your loot is deleted when you die in one hit to those things. Also your SNES is on the internet and they gouge you for dlc if you want basic features.8/10, would do drugs to forget.			"

												Definitely a very fun game! It does get frustrating because if you die you have to start all over, luckily your character lvl remains the same, but all your items and gold disappear. The potions are overpriced and they get more expensive, which makes it even harder as you go along.The local co-op is still in beta, and while very fun, there are still bugs. I lost a lvl 12 character file, but I knew the risks when we started up the local co-op. The local co-op is very fun, but for me it crashes when both characters die and I hit restart. Local co-op is REALLY fun!The developers have announced that the next update will be on 4/24/14 and that many of the bugs have been fixed. Online multiplayer is being worked on.While the game still has bugs to work out, and it can get pretty frustrating sometimes, it's a great, fun game and has a LOT of potential once all the bugs are worked out.I would appreciate it though if there were an 'easy' mode in which you don't lose all your items, or the potions are cheaper, or both.Despite its flaws, I highly recommend this game.

Was worth if you like those kind of pixel-games with RPG elements of levelling up and choosing what skills you'd like with macros that activate skills like League does. You also get various classes and whatnot, the ones you buy are pretty overpowered in a sense, but you can have fun destroying some red-shirt mooks with it. Have at it, guy.			"

												I've been playing this game for a good time now and would like to list the pros and cons of the game to people looking for a new game or to have good time. so let's get right to it.-Pros:-A mix between Diablo and The Binding of Isaac, both very enjoyable games-Classes are all fun to play with a good-ish amount of skills-Relics are rewaring and useful-Armor is the same-DLC Classes and Acts are useful and fun respectively-Cons:-You can get one-shotted on later difficulties-Crashes every hour or so-After losing your relics very hard to build back up -Some enemy champions and mini-bosses are so OP (a.k.a. Electrified and The Necronomicon)-Traps can literally wreck you without a moment's notice-Skills sometimes don' work-Mana costs for abilities don't scale well-Servers sometimes are useless so you are forced to port forwardTL; DR Buy this game if you can deal with bugs and are patient enough to wait for patches. Don't buy this game if you have issues with balance of enemies and items, crashing, high mana costs, and buying DLC.P.S. If you agree with some of my cons please help me get the developers to see this so they can improve the game and make it more enjoyable.			"

												It may not be a Diablo or a Torchlight but what it is shines brightly. This game is a labour of love hand-crafted by a small group of devs with a passion for the genre, their constant, sleep-deprived effort to keep this game running and regularly updated is extremely appreciated. For the price of a large Bigmac meal from Mcdonalds you can't go wrong with the price, and the DLC really does show value for money too. Not only that but it has a ton of classes and a ton of re-playability both on and offline!			"

												When I first got this game it was fun, but after the Devs started changing things I stopped playing because the game became unstable. I waited for months and still nothing good has come from the patches. All the devs have done is unneeded nerfs, added a broken mana system, the game laggs far too much for it to even be playable. Yet they are already planning on adding another Act locked behind DLC.With all that said I just can't recommend this game to anyone anymore because clearly the Devs only cares about money. Just stay away from this game and never spend a dime on it not even if it was on sale. Don't support a dev team that doesn't know how they want the game to work and expects money to flow in. If you want to support a good game go get Grim Dawn at least it's stable and actually balanced.Update: Now the Devs are adding more character DLCs. The problem is that it costs $5 for each one. WHY? The Amazon character dlc is .99 cents so they have no reason to make the other character DLCs overpriced.Another thing is that I saw one of the devs post in the past that they couldn't add new content to the game after release. I call shenanigans because Terraria has been released for years and the devs still added new content to it long after release. Plus the devs keep changing the basic game mechanics so they have no reason to make this game have any DLC. The worst part of all is that you have to buy the DLCs if you don't you won't get any needed updates. As far as I see it I'm still calling this game a cash grab mess that shouldn't even be on Steam.As for the devs if they can't figure out how they want this game to work then they need to stop updating it and walk away. In all honestly I feel that the devs should stop making video games, because the other game they created was also bad. Just look at that games reviews and you will see it's just as much of a steaming pile as this game.I will say this again stay far away from this game and this dev team it's not worth wasting the money on it EVER!

												So after putting in a mere modest 12hs into the game I can now say that I did indeed have a blast of a time playing it thus far, and for anyone interested in binding of isaac or isometric arpgs its a pretty solid buy especialy for the current price point (roughly 10 euros for base game and the current 3 dlcs.).However and this is a big one, the game does come with its fair share of bugs and minor annoyances (having to port forward to even get multiplayer to work isn't something I was expecting of a game in this day and age.) but overall it didnt impact my gameplay all that much and I could still enjoy the game.Graphics : They are pretty much what you can expect from a rougeliteesque game going for a retro feel, Not a showstopper but they're pretty crisp and clear and get the job done for a game of this type. 7/10Audio : The skills have a pretty satisfying weight and sound behind them and the voice lines of champions are pretty stellar (altho they quite quickly start repeating themself and could lead to annoyance for some) the soundtrack itself isnt anything spectacular but not bad by any stretch of the imagination. 6/10Gameplay : This is your typical lootwh*re game, it does have some elements to spice things up in the form of dungeons and crypts that spawn inside the arena you're currently in, the dungeons and crypts come in different types and some might be a fairly straight forward miniboss and some loot while others contain puzzles and traps, in short if you enjoy hoarding loot and watching your character progress then this game will be pretty amazing and if you dont, why are you even here? 7/10Overall, I do recommend this game but only if you can live with the bugs, its a 6/10 alone but quickly becomes a 8/10 if you do have a friend or two (or three) to play it with.

												Elements of Binding of Isaac mixed with a very, very watered down Diablo 2?/3 makes Hero Siege.+ Cheap game~ Graphics are clean, somewhat- Controls best with a controller unfortunately (I had a controller anyway, but still)- Getting hit with hard-to-notice-projectiles amongst the busy (sometimes VERY busy) graphics- Cheap deaths ranging from enemy's death shooting a laser to environmental traps- Simplistic and unimaginative skills (all classes have multiple ""% to cast when attacking"" skills)- Terrible netcode for multiplayer (Why have it in a DLC if it's so terrible?)- Levels are all the same with little variation- Stat levels you gain from levelling mean very little- ""Relics"" (which are items that grant different effects you carry with you) are mostly unimaginative stat boosts- Bosses that appear after 6 waves do not scale with # of waves and are completely boring/easy (although how boring fighting these bosses are, this may be a good thing)- The only break from monotony are dungeons/crypts which are deathtraps (see: environmental traps)- Grindy with little rewardIn summary: the game's exceedingly cheap deaths, repetitive gameplay, and banal character skill trees make this game very difficult to recommend to even the most autistic player.

												Traps. Everywhere. They will spawn on top of you or behind things you can't see and kill you. Constantly. In one hit. Even if you're a tank who's invested his skill points soley in not dying.The game would actually be relatively fun otherwise, and I understand from long time players that months ago this was not the case, but you will only be playing in areas where the creeps and bosses pose little to no challenge just so you can possibly survive one hit for a trap or bomb (which detonate randomly when you kill enemies) and scuttle away to hopefully find some life. If you can't find enough before the next trap gets you, too bad. Back to the beginning. Of the act.Also at the moment there is no multiplayer if you don't buy dlc, just as a warning to any potentially mislead perspective buyers. The implication also seems to be that new things will only come to dlc owners now, which may not be the case, but the deliberately vague wording leaves me suspecting otherwise.Despite its seeming simplicity it might have actually been worth full price if not for the things I mentioned. It might have been like a SNES Diablo. Instead it's like a SNES Diablo where any enemy could be an undercover creeper and any wall or tree could be an out of bounds trap waiting to shoot bombs at you. Also your loot is deleted when you die in one hit to those things. Also your SNES is on the internet and they gouge you for dlc if you want basic features.8/10, would do drugs to forget.			"

												There's difficulty, and then there's just poor design. This game falls in to the later. Projectiles will generally one shot you, or shave off a massive chunk of your health at the very least. Even an AoE DoT from one enemy type generally takes off over a quarter of my HP if it grazes me for half a second. Almost all deaths are nigh-instantaneous, with no chance for reaction or to learn from your mistakes.Additionally, the game seems to love to spawn certain bosses in a way that they will INSTANTLY kill you the moment they spawn in, with some attack where I have not even been able to determine what is HAPPENING, since I only get to see the boss for a fraction of a second.The levelling all seems to completely ignore generally accepted good game design policies, such as diminishing returns. All of the stats you can invest will make absolutely no noticeable difference at first, so early levels only make you feel any stronger from the talent trees. And many of the skills in the talent trees are incredibly poorly designed for early on as well, such as the pyromancer, which has many skills with a 1% chance per rank chance of triggering when you do a basic attack. So when you first grab the skill, it will basically never make any difference, but eventually, once you have levelled it up to be 100x stronger (since nothing seems to have any sort of diminishing returns?) it will also be triggering 100% of the time.I really wanted to enjoy this, because it looked like exactly the kind of game I had been looking for lately, but I have to say, this is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on steam.

												This is a very additive game, and the gameplay, though linear, is some of the most fascinating of its kind. However, it would be even better if the developer could add in diagonal attack, since it is rather annoying no to be able to do so, especially when you are using a controller.			"

Its just a simple game to relax with and can become addictive.Pros: All the fun in itCons: Diagonal shooting, THIS! so much, diagonal shooting is so imperative sometimes and the game doesnt have it.Game lags a bit when theres an insane group of enemies in field and you one shot kill them all			"

												This game got me really excited, after playing for some time. At first it was a little bit difficult to get into the game, but I like it that you don't get everything pushed in your face. So I had a great time figureing out how the game works. After i understood how the death mechanic works and that you will lose all your relics on death, which are the most important items to boost your character, i got really excited. So in this game death gets punished, which is great. I had some exciting moments when i survived near death or some frustrating moments when i died and needed to start over. You keep your character (even though you can play a hardcore character), your level and your gold and will lose your keys (to open certain treasure chests) and your relics.I did find some minor bugs, but the devs are very active and releasing regulary patches. There are some DLC's which will 'complete' the game. With the basic game you can access 4 out of 7 acts and you can not play every character available. For now I find this way of handling the DLC's okay, because you can reach the max. level without the dlc's. Im not sure if the endgame content is limited to dlc users, but I will add this detail once i reached the max level (150). If you like Diablo you will enjoy this game as well. Just the fighting mechanics are kinda like in The binding of Isaac. The only drawbacks I've seen so far is that you can't access the control menu while beeing ingame and you can't access the list with the relics while beeing ingame, which would be useful to read what effect it has (if you couldn't read it while obtaining). So I ended up searching on the internet for the effect of relics and some weapon/armor effects which you can't look up in the game.And for whatever reason I can't get access to the Servers (living in germany). So I ended up playing on multiplayer alone with the peer2peer option, because i was too lazy to open the port. All in all I really enjoy this game so far!			"

												Tbh the dev for this game is great, €6 is a great price to start off with but the sales for the game are insane, I've all the DLC so far for the game and the dev is always brining out free updates making the game better, highly recommend, I've only 10hrs so far but I could easily see someone who wants to explore all the content get 500hrs out of the game! :D			"

												Such a simple game with retro graphics (scale lines and all) but its so damn fun.7 classes without buying any DLC.5 stages. 2 more with DLC Hero siege is a mix of diablo and The binding of isaac, I only mention isaac because theres relics you collect that change stats/damage/active items and you lose them when you die.I play with a few friends so its alot of fun. you can also play with others online.has alot of replay value and I mean ALOT.If you pick it up on sale you can get it for under $1. :)10/10 I reccommend this game.

												This game is a lot of fun when playing singleplayer, even though it can be frustrating from time to time it is still addicting.On the other hand, we have multiplayer. One word that could describe this ""pre-alpha"" multiplayer is cancer. Here's why: - 90% of the particles (not including the projectiles) are not even visible by the 2nd, 3rd or 4th player, including the traps.- random player ability swaps (e.g. the 2nd player is a pirate and the host is a marksman, the ability glitch would make marksman's abilities the same as the pirates, for instance, the 'harpoon/balista trap' would be switched with the pirate's cross-looking trap- only host can open the treasure room doors- it can happen that when someone else other than the host enters the crypt/portal to the next biom? (after defeating the mini boss) the host becomes stuck on the place he spawns - the necromancers minions follow the host, so I wouldn't really count on minions help if you're away from the host- the vikings primary damage ability (the one in which he slams the ground which also stuns the monsters for a bit) is glitched most of the times (atleast that's for the players who aren't hosting), by that I mean that you don't actually deal damage, even if you should deal 1750 dmg, you would actually deal 300 dmg or 0 to monsters- there's probably still something that I have forgotten at this moment but you get the pointTL;DR:- bought the game since it was cheap, it actually is addictive when you play singleplayer, but multiplayer will get you frustrated- if you hate glitches, don't buy this game, period- even though the game has been out for over a year + you actually have to pay in order to play with your friends, the multiplayer could've been IMPROVED A LOT during this period, having people play multiplayer in a 'pre-alpha' stage after a year is quite			"

You can buy it, but not play it (at least I can't).  Multiplayer not working at this time (DLC was supposed to add that feature).			"
