												That kind of game that keeps you from pretty much having a life. ""One more floor and I'll go make dinner""- you think.. 5 hours later: ""Ok, that's IT! This is the last floor and then I'm hitting the bed!"" Spoiler: It will never happen, you will never stop, Runic Games knows how to get ahold of your soul.. Nobody should be keener for fast runs with this one!Still loving the game,despite my lack of sleep. The classes aren't many but the characters adapt as you level up and allocate points.You get your very cute little pet,too. Despite starting with Torchlight II and only now buying Torchlight I, I'd say it's as addictive and awesome.TL,DR -> Go grab this awesome game!9/10			"

												This game is a great action rpg. It's not a refined as TL2, however there is more than enough game here to stand own it's own. The story isn't bad, the graphics hold up well. The end boss is actually an epic battle. A few downsides: drops do not highlight unless you hit 'alt'. I found my thumb perminately locked on the 'alt' key. There is not shopping list for your pets. If you do the Bard's quests you will have to town port after almost every level. Pets pathing and selecting drops is sometimes stressful. The goods: Lots of levels. It took me about 22 hours of play time to get to the final boss that was on dungeon level 32. There are 100 more dungeon levels past that. Character development is very open. Just because your a warrior doesn't mean you can't wear a robe and wield a wand. Potions drop from about 60% of the mob kills: This seems like a con in the beginning, but once you hit the lower levels you'll be thankful. If you have this and haven't played it, why not? If you can pick this up on a sale then I would definately recommend it.			"

TL;DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Torchlight II ReviewINTRODUCTION:Torchlight is a Top-Down Action RPG Dungeon Crawler developed by Runic Games in 2009. The game invokes a Diablo-esque / Fate-esque gameplay mechanic mostly because the developers were former members of the teams that made said Diablo and Fate games.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game is set on the town of Torchlight, a small mining community who stumbled across a strange new mineral called 'Ember' which produces an unfortunate side effect to anyone who comes into contact with a corrupt piece. The player takes on the roles of the Alchemist, the Vanquisher or the Destroyer who makes their way through the deep mines and caves of Torchlight to stop a great evil from rising and destroying the world.PROS:+ Classical Formula: -(Also a CON, see below) Although the game is dangerously familiar to Diablo, Torchlight executes this formula almost to perfection. The loot system, monsters, player classes and gameplay mechanic were applied and utilized very well in a way that gives a renewed interest on the genre.+ Artistic: -Graphically, its not the most pleasing game, but its true artistic quality is with the style. It deviates from the regular dark, gothic themes of most games in the genre and instead, replaces it with a cartoon look in a steam punk setting.+ Map Variety: -Story wise, you're only headed down, but each map you enter has completely different themes. You can be exploring a dark dank cave one moment, and the next, find yourself in a long forgotten stone crypt or an ancient temple.+ Sound and Music: -The composer is Matt Uelman, Composer for works such as Diablo, World of Warcraft and Star Craft, and with a track like that, you can only expect greatness in the music quality.CONS:- No Multiplayer: - The game is a single player experience. No multiplayer mode whatsoever which disappointed many fans.- Story: - Rather weak and forgettable story with too few side missions.- Classical Formula: -(Also a PRO, see above), Strip it down to its bare minimum and you have a generic Diablo Clone right down to the Story. PERSONALLY, I think its GOOD since the newer generation of gamers who never got to experience the glory of the original Diablo can now experience it through Torchlight.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME FOR GREAT VALUE. Although some may argue that Torchlight (1) is obsolete because of the release of Torchlight II, the first title still provides a lot of entertaining hours with its Diablo (1) type of gamestyle.WORTH IT?:Sale or full price, this game deserves your attention however, you may also want to check out Torchlight 2 since it expands the world and introduces multiple new classes.FINAL NOTES:You would think that its just your average Dungeon Crawler RPG and you would be right since all the elements of Torchlight are the basic elements to an Action RPG, HOWEVER, it's how Torchlight merges those elements that make it stand out from the rest. From start to finish, this game uses and applies the tried and tested classical formula to create a wonderful and memorable experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												I don't really play games like Torchlight. The style of action RPG proliferated by titles like Diablo never really interested me. It's mostly just a repetitive slog of killing and looting identical enemies who changed only statistically, becoming incrementally more difficult so as to retain the same amount of effort required for their deaths. While Torchlight is all that and more, it managed to keep me entertained for quite some time through diverse enemy types, artistic direction and engaging skill trees.The gameplay hardly needs explaining - it's like Diablo. You control most everything in the game using the mouse and some hotkeys. I chose to play as the 'vanquisher' class, focusing on ranged weaponry and magic related to it. The abilities of this class mostly serve to complement her ranged weapons, and I managed to completely finish the game without even equipping a melee weapon. I did find that the class benefited significantly from having summoning spells, allowing players to fire powerful ranged spells at enemies while minions keep them at bay. A lot of the more powerful weapons felt great to use, and I was impressed by the game's lenience toward players interested in multiple gameplay styles--nothing stopped me from summoning an army of skeletons, even though I didn't choose the class focused on that at the start of the game.Torchlight's balancing feels fine, though later levels do feature some enemies with huge damage output that were a pain to get past. I really liked the way the game's entire story takes place in a single dungeon, with the player's gradual descent into the earth beneath the titular town slowly revealing different fortresses and ancient ruins all lying beneath the ground. The game begins with entry into the mine upon which Torchlight's economy is reliant upon, but before the game's end you'll see a sprawling necropolis, colourful, flooded ruins and a fiery dwarven fortress. The graphical diversity keeps things interesting, and everything's quite pretty too. I liked the cartoony art style, but I found it quite curious how many enemies were simply recoloured, buffed up a bit and reused.On release, some criticised Torchlight for it's lack of any form of multiplayer component. I personally found this to be a good decision, as a single-player game tends to be more focused. Torchlight, despite the admirable streamlining of UI and gameplay still contains a large amount of engaging content, even after the final boss. I just don't know if Torchlight will be one of those games that the average player can get a huge amount of mileage out of--while I found the content to be sufficient, it certainly does get old after a certain point.

												Fun and solid dungeon romp reminiscent of the Diablo series. (Yep, it's going to get compared/referred to Diablo whether we like it or not)Randomly generated dungeons with tons of randomly generated loot. Cliche story with a tiny twist (didn't see that coming a mile away. Nope, nadda, nah).

												Thinking back on my time with the Torchlight campaign, the phrase “Baby’s First Diablo” keeps coming to mind. I think it provides a more accessible aRPG experience coupled with unusually light hearted and colorful world design. It’s by no means a game for children but for someone who is not a hardcore aRPG diablo master, Torchlight is a fantastic, more relaxed Diablo style adventure. It’s successor (Torchlight 2) is much improved in most of the gameplay aspects, but for the right price the original is a must buy and will not disappoint.			"

												A very, very enjoyable game.  If Diablo is the older, serious, stylish sister, then Torchlight is the younger, jovial, fun-loving twin.  At its heart beats a quick-based action RPG where performing story based kill or fetch quests, see you fighting through numerous levels of varying monsters and enemy bosses.  In addition optional sidequests though similar steal your focus from time to time allowing you to power-up your characters abilities if you so desire.  Now while you can expect alot of repetitive gameplay you can choose from three archetypal characters with which to complete the challenges ahead: Go hand-to-hand combat with the fighter, shoot from range with the archer or blast your foes with magic as the wizard.  Each character can assign skill points to four seperate skills: Melee, Ranged, Magic and Defense and each has a set of three skill trees from which to customize their style of gameplay further.  Through the clever use of item pre-requisites you can actually choose to use all three types of weaponary available to you.  So mix and match to your hearts content.  Players can choose to equip many aspects of their character with a truly huge assortment of equipment from armor types, jewelry and weapons - all of which are designed to provide you with a selection headache.  If that is not enough some items can be upgraded further by slotting them with magic igots called ember that boost certain abilities.  These igots can be transmuted to form bigger more powerful items, that provide bigger bonues if enough are found.Further to the base game you will be able to use numerous magic spells to augment your offensive and defensive capabilities from casting fireballs to calling on temporary npc allies.  You also possess an animal companion which can be used to send items to the town above when you can trade and upgrade items.  This animal companion can also be temporarily be turned into other creatures with other powers in your fight to reach the end of the game.Overall despite its functional story its graphics, music, voice-overs and design provide some nice touches filling with with atmosphere, providing a fun flilled blast-a-thon with plenty of action and reward for those of you who'd love a change from a deep meaningful game.Probably the only down sides is restrictive nature of the inventory which can be a pain when handling alot of items, its purely singleplayer aspect and also the expected reptitive nature of gameplay.  (If you want mp/coop try TL2)However I would recommend this to anyone who likes to try something different from shooters, strategy or deep RPGs.			"

												The dungeon-crawling genre has never had a complicated formula: you kill stuff, you get equipment, you kill bigger stuff, you delve deeper. Repeat as necessary. Torchlight is, well, no different. But it does it well. It refines many aspects of the genre, adds some more options to the top, and tops it all off with an attractive style that is pleasant to look at as you cut down swaths of enemies.You begin the game as one of three classes: the Destroyer, the Vanquisher, and the Alchemist. Despite the names, they're really just fancy ways to say Warrior, Ranger and Mage. Each of the classes gets a number of skills unique to who they are, such as the Destroyer having a lot of close-combat abilities to take down enemies, the Vanquisher having a number of traps and long-range attacks for their guns and bow, and the Alchemist has a number of spells that do different types of elemental damage to enemies. Each skill has only a character level as a prerequisite. No previous skills need to be taken, no amount of skill points need to be spent. This is a system that I'm not fond of. It encourages hoarding skill points, and can be a little dull to distribute skill points in.In addition to these class-specific skills, there are about ten skills that are shared across all classes, passive skills that do things like increase damage with martial weapons, increase armor defense, or increase the effectiveness of some spells. Based on what class you have, these shared skills are only available at certain levels. For example, as the Alchemist, you can get Magical Weapons Expertise immediately, while as the Destroyer this skill has a much higher level as a prerequisite. But these aren't all the skills available. There are also a number of spells in the game, scribed onto scrolls, that every character can learn. These spells range from healing yourself to attacking enemies, raising your damage, and so forth. These act differently from skills: they are learned just by using scrolls, not skill points; any character can learn them; each character can only have a certain number memorized at any time (they can be forgotten whenever you want); and to get a higher level of the spell, you need to find the higher level version of that spell on a scroll. The variation of class-specific skills, general passive abilities, and spells means that every character can be different.Each character also starts with a pet as well. With this pet comes not only a fighting partner in the dungeon - one that can equip rings and an amulet, in addition to two spells - but also something of a pack mule. You can throw a bunch of equipment onto your cat or dog, then send them off to town to sell all the equipment. It makes the action a lot more seamless, since frequent trips to the town are no longer required, breaking up the action all the time. Throughout the various dungeons you can also fish, the results of which can be fed to your pet in order to turn it into different creatures with different stats, abilities, and weaknesses.Attributes are handled a little oddly in this game. There's the typical Strength, Dexterity, Magic, and Defense, but they don't do what you might expect. Though defense is pretty much self-explanatory, all the other attributes do is increase other amounts of damage. Strength raises physical damage, dexterity raises ranged damage, and magic raises elemental damage. Like I said, it's weird (magic doesn't even increase your mana reserves), but it makes for some interesting builds. In other games, you'll always see mages, for example, have very high magic levels and a disregard for every other attribute. In Torchlight, while this is viable, spreading out your attribute points also works. You can put points into magic and dexterity to increase the damage of wands that shoot long-range magical attacks, or some points into strength to beat the enemies that get close to you with staves. It offers a lot more options than a typical dungeon crawler, though it may take some time to get used to.The dungeon levels are randomly constructed, but impressively so. I seldom encountered any lay-out that I considered strange or out-of-place. There are several different tilesets used, depending on the level of the dungeon, so the atmosphere never grows dull. Levels are littered with secret passages, multiple story construction, and the occasional trap to keep everyone on their toes. Each section of the dungeon has its own style, from the typical dank stone passageways to an underground greenhouse to the fiery depths of volcanic doom.And it’s not only the levels themselves that look great. All the graphics in Torchlight are top-notch. Torchlight sports a cartoonish look, keeping things from becoming too dark and dreary. The various spell and ability effects are solid, and everything runs along very smoothly. In fact, the system requirements for Torchlight are incredibly low even for a game that was released in 2009. The audio fares equally well, with solid voice work and a simply great musical score. The main plot demands about 15-20 hours of adventuring per character, and can be done at varying difficulty levels. Once the main story is complete, players can embark on a much deeper dungeon to further advance their character. Should players decide to be done with a character, they can “retire” that character from play and bequeath some bonuses on the next.I had an absolute blast with Torchlight, and I’ll be returning at least a few more times to try out some additional character concepts. There’s just a ton of well-done ARPG goodness here. And while I usually don’t comment on the price of the games I review, Torchlight brings all this goodness to players for just 14,99€. That’s an incredible amount of fun for a bargain-priced title. For action RPG fans, Torchlight is a title not to be missed.			"

												Diablo-inspired isometric hack-n-slash dungeon crawler (or ""action-RPG""), with many, so many levels filled with treasures and monsters, under seemingly common and peaceful village.Those of us who have played Diablo before, will recognize everything immidiately, and will be wandering only with cartoon-animated visual style and with the pet - which is quite nice and useful companion, generally, both in fight and in dealing with the loot (which was quite a problem back in time).Those of us who saw Fate, however, will not be asking any questions, as the Fate is just the base for the Torchlight, with the same visual style, mild music, and the pet. You may think of Torchlight as of much upgraded towards the more comfortable gameplay version of the Fate... And as of next of kin to Diablo Hellfire. And made by the same people, creators of Diablo and Fate.Torchlight is not a ""Diablo-killer"", as it goes with so many projects like Titan Quest, Sacred and so many others. On the contrary, Torchlight is actually made all this race to beat the fame of Diablo 1&2 looking even more out-of-order. As you don't need to be better than somebody else. You just need to be fun and complete all by yourself. And Torchlight is just that kind of game - with satysfying content, challenges, variety of features, and general fun-out-of-the-game.That I personally liked about Torchlight is the atmosphere, which is both quite reminiscent to the original Diablo, with the nearly same background and music... but much more mild and joyful altogether.That has frightened me there - is the same thing as with the Fate game - the amount of levels below the surface. Even after you'll beat the main scebario nemesis - you still have a long way down before you, with more and more powerful foes and more of the rarest loot.And it was namely the loot - along with other possibilities to enhance and empower a character - that frightened me the most. Really, while some people are starting to hate Skyrim for the hundreds of hours of adventures, in Torchlight the biggest blackhole, that has eaten the majority of my playtime - was levelling and redistributing items, perks and other enhancements. Yeah, just the same thing for which so many people love RPG systems in the first place - clear numerical system of your hero's progress - made me sick. For it seems so bottomless, that I've dropped the playing at one moment, realising that for every hour of dugeoning I'm spending 2+ hours just orginizing the stuff and making preparations... I'm not saying the game is like this. Actually, you can play it on the flow, and pauses for changing equipment and distributing stats can be as small as you want them to... It's just the way I'm playing the games and living life in general - if I can tune something to go with that in the field, I usually do that, ad perfectum.Summarizing. Torchlight is the one very nice and enjoyable hack'n'slash dungeon crawler, which can leave uncomfortable only those who can't play action-RPGs, sicked with cartoon-style animation, or completionsts like myself. One last thing to add is that I suggest to start playing right from the hard difficulty, for ""easy"" and ""normal"" settings are somewhat less inspiring. Overall mark is 7.8/10.			"

But if you look for a very decent Diablo clone with pleasant graphics, nice sounds and music and a very fluent gameplay, you found what you're looking for.

												I was looking for ARPG similar to Diablo and saw many recommendations for Torchlight and Torchlight 2. Coming from Diablo 3, the art style put me off at first but when both games went on sale, I decided to take the plunge. And I'm really glad I did.I've finished the main quest with my vanquisher and have enjoyed the game immensely. My favourite bit has got to be the pet. It's awesome being able to continue my mob killing badassery through the dungeons while my pet returns to town to sell my loot, especially on maps that don't allow porting back to town.A+++ will play again.

												Wow, all I can say is this game is an absolute gem. I cannot remember the last time I played a game that I had this much fun while playing. This is an extremely well done hack and slash action/rpg, plays very similar to Diablo and Fate (which I finished a week or two ago as well), but there is something about this game that is head and shoulders better. Whether it is the cute cartoony art style, or the simplicity of the game play mechanics, probably a combination of them all. By the end of my first play through, my character was so overpowered that I was one hitting enemies and taking bosses health down by half each swing. I was a slow mace duel wielding warrior and it was hella fun. Another thing I like about Torchlight is there is endless replay-ability, once you finish the game, you open up a new dungeon with infinite amount of levels, each floor is randomly generated with enemies which scale to your level. This is a game to keep installed once you finish as there is plenty of reasons to keep coming back			"

												Very good game and well worth time spent playing it. Great Graphics. Characters easily customizable. Choose your class and customize it to your style of gaming. Multiple mods to choose from if that's what you like. I added one new character and a Loot Crate mod and that's all I use. No multiplayer that I know of? I've had no issues with the game and works well with M & KB. No need for any controller at all nor, needs to be changed to support them. If you can't play it with M & KB then, play something else. Price may seem a bit high but, it's money well spent for hours of endless fun. Sales are common so, if you don't want to spend $20 on the game, be sure to pick it up any time it goes on sale. 10/10			"

												This game starts off real nice. You get into it by recognizing the marks of the Diablo franchise. It is no surprise, because Runic Games was founded by ex-Blizzard veterans, and they intended to make a ""better clone"". So, the game is great fun for a couple of hours... but then the problems start to emerge. First of all, the levels are more of the same. The only difference is the texturing. Seriously, all levels play out the same - even the enemies act very alike, despite them being completely different looking creatures. Furthermore, you aren't really forced to evolve your character further and further. You can keep the same skills and just invest more points into them. Torchlight gets very boring and very repititive too early. I disagree with both scores on Metacritic (press + user). This is a mediocre game. Could have been a great game with a ~5 hour length, but no, they had to stretch it to be dull & tiresome. Runic failed with this first attempt. Maybe Torchlight II will be better.			"

												A fun game that slowly starts to show you it has more to offer than just going around a mine. While the game is almost extremely easy, it does have it's difficult moments - however, the pacing and introduction of these difficult moments is odd. It's almost like the developers knew the game was too easy, so decided to throw a whole bunch of killer mobs and mob groupings together in the last few levels of the story mission. All of which leads up to the insanely difficult last boss - you will die several times fighting this large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Overall not a terrible game, and if Torchlight II hadn't been released I'd recommend this highly, especially given the cheap price point it seems to have these days. Interestingly, it appears as though the Story Mode is only the tip of iceberg, as the game seemed to open after killing the 'end boss'. New dungeons opened, options to retire hero appeared, all of which I now want to explore and play around with (at a later date).Torchlight's nods to Diablo are nice, and it's refreshing to see a game not denying the influence of Diablo to the Dungeon Crawler genre. The character models are nice and 'Blizzard' like too.			"

												Look, this game is great if you like a simplified Diablo type game. It has a more vibrant color palette than Diablo games, making it more cartoony and more accessible to young children, but the gameplay is solid and fast enough for anyone to enjoy. I'd rather play the sequel Torchlight 2 because it is twice the game this one is, and it has multiplayer which this one does not. The story is pretty bare and simple here. Basically this is a good game and I would say worth a playthrough, but if you want your money's worth then get Torchlight 2 over this one. However if this game's style is not to your liking then I would recommend checking out Grim Dawn which is graphically superior and mechanically similar to this and the Diablo series. If steampunk is more your style then give The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut or Victor Vran. If you want something more anient gods style then check out Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition.			"

												Torchlight one still holds up to this day. It is a dungeon based arpg without any surface missions. It has much in common with Diablo 2 but can't quite be as good as it's big brother. Still, all elements of a good addicting arpg are there. But that's also the only point which I can criticize, the game just doesn't try to push for more. The story isn't good but the combat and gameplay feels fluent. The fishing mechanic is a cool gimmick but I never really used it since it wasn't needed. Overall a good buy when on sale.			"

												This game has more similarities to Diablo than I can explain.At the core, the game offers the same experience. You have a dungeon underneath the town that leads to a boss that is ultimately corrupting the town. The townspeople will offer quests which you can complete and will give you rewards. (often non-consequential.) Where the game shines is in the huge amount of polish attached to that. Not only is it polished, it offers difficulties which tie to a level 1, something Diablo tied to tiers of levels.Something else I can rant and rave about is the fact that the game is essentially endless. The dungeon goes for 100 levels, and on top of that, there's maps which take you to a randomly generated map that you can trek through for even more content. Now enemies are pretty set to each map, unless you do the maps that are randomized per level.This game does only offer three classes, but those three each have three trees that are different in and of themselves. You have you brutish fighter with his defense, attack, and dual wield options. You have your archer that can either be a melee rogue, set traps, or go full on archery. And you have the alchemist that will boast summoning, and two types of spellcasting. (I played the Alchemist the least.)As for anything else, check the game out. It's definitely worth it if you enjoy Diablo style hack and slash games. I would honestly even recommended it to newcomers to the genre, since it boasts a casual difficulty, and even goes all the way to a Very Hard, which is definitely hard. It also comes with Hardcore modes for the masochistic, like myself.I cannot rant further about how amazing this series is, except I can, because there's a second installment that adds on top of every good thing here.

TL;DRA classic action RPG with a lighthearted attitude.+ Solid gameplay+ Classes (the classic trinity)+ Graphics+ Setting+ Loot+ Tons of mods (no Steam Workshop though)- Linearity- No multiplayer- No customisation (there are mods for that)REVIEWTorchlight is a classic action RPG developed by Runic Games. It features Diablo-esque gameplay with a cartoonish art style.There is not much to say about the story: Torchlight is a mining town where a magic mineral called Ember is stored. Alric, once an adventurer like you*, has been corrupted by the One Ring tainted Ember and fell to the Dark Side went rogue. You are to enter the depths of the underworld and track him down. The gameplay is solid and focuses on going deeper down while completing quests and eviscerating thousands of nasty creatures. The setting is an interesting mix of medieval fantasy and steampunk: magic and swords meet robots and firearms. One should not be surprised to see a robot bard who gives monster contracts.There is a classic trinity: a warrior (Destroyer, male), a rogue (Vanquisher, female), and a sorcerer (Alchemist, male). Each of the classes have 3 skill trees which provide a player with a variety of playstyles. Unlike in Diablo, some skills are shared among the classes (e.g. passive skills which provide an xp boost, dual wielding damage bonus, etc.). What is also unique is that every character can learn to use various spells (up to four at a time). Wanna be a dual axe wielding Destroyer who can also cast fireballs on demand? No problem!The art style is pretty much timeless: the graphics are decent even now (there are texture mods should anyone be interested). Even though there is not much freedom to explore, randomly generated dungeons are diverse enough to keep one entertained for hours. Moreover, the game is paced just about right – the ""just one more level"" phenomenon is real. Speaking of art, the soundtrack is just astounding which is hardly a surprise. It was composed by Matt Uelmen, the author of Diablo's soundtrack.It is a shame that there is no multiplayer, as gathering a group and venturing forth is a staple for action RPGs. The only companion a player will go with is a pet: either a cat or a dog. Pets can support you in a fight, cast spells (up to two at a time), and go to town to sell your items. The player can also feed them fish which make them change into different creatures. Speaking of downsides, there is no character customisation.In conclusion, Torchlight is a marvellous action RPG which can provide hours and hours of highly enjoyable gameplay. One should do themselves a favour and play this gem.*Wait, wrong game.P.S.

												I love fantasy and RPGs so that's the first reason I picked it. The other reason is that my PC is kinda old and Torchlight has low system requirements. The design is cartoony/real and colorful. I love the level design and it looks like modding will be doable...something to try in Torchlight 2 I think. I love the customization options. Its great that you can go on autopilot and grind for hours or solve puzzles and work your way around enemies. Plus the game has hours or replayability (is that a word?) by working your way thru extra maps acquired thru questing/purchase or playing as a different character class.			"

												I started playing Torchlight, because one of my friends played it, and it looked like fun.Before that, I never played any Diablo game (beside Dungeon Siege) and wasnt familiar with ARPG games.Having a simple story, you will forget, in the second it ends, Torchlight is mostly a game about monster hords, explosions and loot. Village gets attacked by evil wizard, heros help, heros save the day (and genocide countless minions).You have 3 playable Characters, without being able to edit their stats and looks: A melee, ranged and mage.Beside having classes with roles, every characters has 3 skill trees, that mostly provide main damage, support abilitys (buffs or debuffs) and summoning allies. Also each of these trees provide you with the abilitys to fight with the weapon, that was made for the class (sword for melee, guns for ranged and staff for mage) or buffing the damage with fighting with another class weapon, so the melee fires with staffs (why would he do that?).The loot is mostly randomized like in every ARPG. Exeption are uniques and set items, that also can have different stats, but have them always in a certain pattern.Also, the village provides you with different NPCs who offer you:- 3 traders- A quest NPC, that gives you tasks into special dungeons, giving you bonus dungeons as reward- a gambler that sells you items, that have random stats- two goblins, that can ether save sockets from items or clear items from sockets- an item enchanter, that can upgrade your items. There is always a chance to break the item, which chance increases with every use. Features like that were stupid like ever, because they can be bypassed by save and load (in this case, because the game saves automatically, you can crash your game to leave without saving).Having a campaign that is going through a dungeon with 34 levels, the bonus levels from the quest NPC and a endless dungeon, after you completed the campaign, you have enough time to enjoy the game.Contra:- The classes are really imbalanced:Having trouble fighting with the mage? You maxed your skills and still the enemy doesnt feel your hit? Play the ranged: I made a ranged fighter playthrough with every skill on level 1. How? The skills of the ranged character make damage based in % of your weapon damage. Most of the attacks of the mage do not. Who designs crap like that? Having a skill that gives you better mana regeneration and having the first ability on max, you can use it instead of your standard attack, blasting 300% weapon damage with every shot, with an attack, that pierces through enemys in a line. Why even playing the other classes.- The enemy damage is imbalanced:A big rock troll is hitting you? No problem, didnt even feel it. A little kobold mage casting a lightning on you? Dead!While physical damage gets blocked by your armor, elemental does not! So, you will be ignoring all enemys, only focusing on their mages. This can be so extreme that in the dark fortress levels you always look out or demon caster, because you will onehit them, and they will onehit you. It is who is spotting the other first. All that doesnt feel like it is right.- After lvl 50 the game starts feeling dull and unfinished:After playing through the campaign, you will notice that the drops of uniques will decrease more and more. Thats because instead having your level, most uniques have a certain item level they drop. Around lvl 50-70 the normal items will also start going rubbish, giving you sometimes lvl 40 item on lvl 70. After a time, normal playing is no longer possible, because the enemys get stronger, but you dontYou can have a lot of fun with Torchlight, but dont take it as serious as a Diablo.			"

												This is an excellent action RPG game. Maybe a bit more accessible for those who never played Diablo and don't want to really manage stats/builds and want a somewhat easier experience. Nice cartoony graphics, tons of loot and bad guys, good old-fashioned clicking and killing lots of things. The best part is having a pet that follows you around casting spells.			"

												The single player predecessor of Torchlight II, offers solid dungeon crawling gameplay reminiscent of the good old Diablo II days. With 3 main classes to select with a range a different skills and abilities, the game offers a multitude of gameplay experiences, with a permenant-death hardcore mode for the dedicated gamers. Fan created Mods offer various new styles of gameplay with additional pets, classes, skills, NPCs and more. Torchlight created a great fan base for its popular bigger brother, which I no doubt look forward to playing. Pros:+ Nice variety of player skills+ Fan created mods add plenty of replayability+ Added difficulty settings and a Hardcore mode for an extra challenge+ A wide variety of achievments to complete+ Good to zone out for mindless monster killing after a tiring day at the officeCons:- Many achievements are very tedious and grindy- Fishing is awful- The dungeons and enemies themselves can get repetitive after a whileMy Score: 7/10			"

												What if Blizzard and Runic had a debate on which game is better? It would go something like this:Blizzard: We have Diablo 1 and 2 that are the best classics ever! For only $20 each!(Might be more even considering Diablo 1 is hard to come by at stores that sell used games).Runic: We have Torchlight that has a level editor AND doesn't screw gamers over their money for expansions/dlc. Only $15!Blizzard: Yeah? We have Diablo 3 with stunning graphics! And that's for $40 new and $30 used!(Depending on where you buy it, and it's $60 at the blizzard store if you buy the digital deluxe edition, or $40 if you buy the standard for Reapers of Souls).Runic: We have Torchlight 2 with the steam shop. Only $20!Conclusion: Get Torchlight. While you're at it, get Torchlight 2. You could get Diablo 3 for the price of Torchlight 1 and 2. Just get Torchlight 1 and 2. They're a lot better and funner (I know funner is not a word, but it's the right word to describe this game). Torchlight may not have the best graphics, but it does promise you the best quality for playing through the game and not being bored one bit. If you play the game for the graphics, I do feel sorry for you. But, still tryout Torchlight.			"

												Every time I play an action RPG I'm reminded of Torchlight. It's not even the first in the genre but I always remember it as one I never got bored with. I played floors the way I take my medicine, one a day. It's interface, challenge and loot always keep me coming back. Even after I finished the main story I still delved deeper into the extra dungeon that opened up if only to test my mettle.Let's take a look at the story though since I brought it up. You're helping this mild mannered swamp town inhabitants by venturing into a bottomless cave in hopes of uncovering the cause of the blight that has cursed this small mining community. More focused you're helping another adventurer find out what's happened to her friends. While you journey down the mines you read journal entries on what happened to the alchemist you're chasing. It all leads to an epic battle in which you see who's got the bigger magic stick. Really though, this is one of those games where the journey matters more than the destination.  I like the idea of the three classes as there's lots of ways to take down enemy hoards. You can even take your trusty pet with you. I prefer playing with the alchemist. I find that the best approach to taking on large groups of evil spawn is to summon my own to fight with me. The game is probably easiest with this class and I generally really liked the versatility with weapons and skills to choose from. The vanquisher and destroyer classes both have their strengths and weaknesses but I think the alchemist is more middle ground with the best of both worlds. There is loot a plenty. Weapons of all shapes and sizes. Many different things you can use to kill. There's also no shortage of quests. The one thing I think I would have liked was to have more towns or diverse number of people you could interact with. You are pretty much stuck with the same citizens of Torchlight throughout your journey but there's all the maps, quests and challenge that makes up for it. Also note that all the shortcomings of this game was made better in Torchlight 2. Though as the original I think it definitely stands the test of time.			"

												The best Hack 'n' Slash between Diablo 2 and this year's boom return of the genre. Torchlight and Titan Quest were pretty much the only Hack 'n Slash during this period, at least that I can think of, and Titan Quest weren't that similar to Diablo. Torchlight have a similar atmosphere to the Diablo classics, even though the art style and graphics are more colorful and high-res that those of Diablo 2 - They still have very similar atmospheres.A few guys in the Runic Games studio did work on Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction, and therefore have a professional insight of what made the original game so great. I wish to prevent using the term Diablo-clone, because it casts a negative shadow over a great game, but Torchlight is a obvious success of cloning. In some regards, Torchlight is even better than Diablo 2 because of it's added genuinity.As every Hack 'n' Slash and RPG, you get to choose your class. In Torchlight there are only 3 classes; Vanquisher, Destroyer, and Alchemist. All three with different perks and advantages. Vanquisher is Range, Destroyer is Melee and the Alchemist is a Mage. Clear focus point for the three classes is speed, strength and magic in that order. You get to modify each class heavily though throughout the gameplay so each class can look very different in the end. There are a lot of different types of Weapons and Armors in the game, as expected from the genre! Loot is the most wonderful of things, see.One unique addition is the pet system, where you always have pet with you. This has a few advantages; for example can the pet go back and sell your loot, for non-stop hacking and slashing. The pet also helps out in the fights, and can never die only flee and run around like an idiot. You can boost your pet with armors and jewelry, as well as bind scrolls to the pet that it will cast by itself. I never upgraded my pet too serious though, I always forgot to give it new items - so it's not a game breaker. Just a neat feature.Sadly Torchlight lacked in a few areas as well, Multiplayer mostly so. Hack 'n' Slash is most enjoyable in co-op, where mowing through hordes of monsters become more of a sport. Luckily this year's sequel, Torchlight II, has improved the series greatly while maintaining the renowned Diablo aura. Torchlight offers rogue-like gameplay with the Hardcore difficulty settings, if you get tired of playing like a wuss. Worth picking up if you like Hack 'n' Slash and mindless killing, just be prepared to do it alone. Very good atmosphere and art-styleNote: It might be worth checking out Torchlight II (Review) as it only improves the original in all ways. As well as Free to Play game Path of Exile. "

Definitely recommended if colorful is something you´re looking for in a game.			"

												If your a fan of hack and slash RPGs like Diablo 2, you need this game in your life. While Torchlight doesn't really bring anything new to the genre, what it does bring is various vibrant and lush environments that can't help but draw you in and make you want to explore every inch of the landscape, leaving no stone unturned.An interesting point to make, regards your pet. The easiest way to put it is, you catch a fish, you feed the fish to your pet, your pet transforms into something you've probably killed. This adds a large element of versatility to how you approach each of the dungeons and may allow you a slight advantage in combat based on the abilities your pet gains as per the transformation.Long story short, get this game, you won't regret it at all.

												I am not sure I have much words to say about this game. While I did play the heck out of it, that was more for completion than for loving it the entire time.The game is definitely a Diablo clone, running through a dungeon over and over, getting down to the bottom of it, grabbing items and fulfilling quests along the way. Story is not a focus to the game. In fact, fighting, fighting, and some more fighting is pretty much the entire game.Honestly, the game was not exactly my favorite by any means. It pulled me in for a good while, as I thought it was nicely setup. But I don't think that this game has any amazing longevity because you just fight the same types of monsters forever. The game has mods that you can use to make things more interesting, so that is definitely a benefit.Overall though, games like this are a big hit in the community, so I can still recommend it for people if they enjoy Diablo-style games, even if I probably won't come back to it myself.

												Torchlight, like its sequel, is a quite enjoyable ARPG dungeon-crawler with a lot of loot, fun, and exploration to be had! I've enjoyed this game since 2013, and although I haven't played it in a while, it, along with Torchlight II, are probably my favorite ARPG games!The game is set in the small mining town of Torchlight, and the town needs help, as its mine is being attacked by monsters. As you continue further and further down the mine, you'll see a vast array of different enemies and environments, and quite a bit of loot to be had! There are three classes in Torchlight, and each one has different spells and weapon specializations. The Alchemist is a mage, specializing in staffs and wands, and has elemental spells and attacks. He has the highest MP of the classes.The Destroyer is a melee-oriented class that is best at using swords, axes, maces, and polearms. He has the largest health pool of the classes.The Vanquisher is a range-oriented class which has abilities that strengthen her ranged combat. She is best suited for long-range combat.Torchlight is an enjoyable game to play, and and its visuals nice. Its soundtrack is excellent, as well, and compliments the game quite nicely, giving it its cool style, just like the sequel has a nice style. The environments in the game are pretty fascinating as well, and sometimes quite varied, and there's many places to explore, and some side quests to do too.I also appreciate how lightweight it is, graphically. I think it still looks pretty good, while at the same time, being able to run even on old machines in my home, including old laptops!Throughout the game, just like with its sequel, there is a huge variation of armor, weapons, and enchantments that you will find, and you can also transmute items and enchant things at an enchanter. You can also find ""ember"" to socket items, which gives you various bonuses.Overall, I have no complaints about Torchlight. Its gameplay is very satisfying and quite fun, and I would certainly recommend this game, as well as its sequel, which introduces multiplayer co-op! Definitely pick both of them up, if you are someone who enjoys ARPGS, Co-op games, and loot games. ^.^			"

It really does play better than Diablo and has some enjoyable trais of its own (fishing and maps).  There is an editor for the moding community to play with.

												It's like a cartoony Path of Exile mixed with some Diablo. I like everything about it but some things hereActual things wrong with the game- Tabbing out on fucllscreen causes the screen to bug out, getting rid of the hud or smearing characters across the screen. Minor Annoyances- Quests don't have a guide which can be a pain during the beginning where you don't know where anything is but some people would like this.- There really isn't a ""tutorial"" like in a lot of games that teaches you all the binds and what to do when you level up and such. It isn't too hard to get past this but it's a pain in the beginning.- Instead of phasing out a wall when you go behind it, you get outlined awell as everything else behind the wall.			"

												My travels take me into this small town called Torchlight which I get mixed up in someone else's problems. Always the life of the hero I guess. My mission was to go below the town into many floors of caves and ancient ruins to find a once good but now bad, like always, guy who was hell bent on awakening some all mighty evil. What he wasn't expecting was me, the all powerful bad guy killing machine and my trustworthy wolf.Torchlight was a pretty fun game to play. It's a massive dungeon crawler with loads of loot to grab, sell, upgrade, and use. The main storyline runs you down 35 floors which may take you some time to accomplish.  I clocked in a little over 27 hours to finish it but that is with some side missions too. You can put in tons of more hours into this if you want, specially if you like to collect achievements.Story is the basic good guy went bad and try's to bring some powerful evil out from below to take over the world. I didn't pay to much attention to the story since it didn't really grip me. This game also isn't really focused on the story since it is mainly a dungeon crawling loot grabber. After a while I did get a little burnt out playing and felt like the same thing over and over. Torchlight does look pretty good and play pretty good. There was a good variety of enemies to fight which would range in all sizes. Controls just had you clicking on enemies to attack which sometimes became an issue for me cause I would lose track of the mouse icon on my 46"" TV. You also had a pet to help you fight and carry loot. Both of you level up from XP to make you stronger throughout the game.Equipping your character and pet was pretty fun and a lot of work. You can equip every body part with armor and also have rings and a necklace. Your pet can also be equipped with a necklace, two rings, and two spells. All weapons and gear can be enchanted to add more stats to help you out. They can also lose all enchantments when trying to enchant them.Overall the game was fun and worth playing if you like dungeon crawlers. You also may want to just skip this one and go right on to part two as it has much more to it and it's co-op. This game can keep you busy for hundreds of hours just trying to accomplish all the achievements. You can definitely get your moneys worth out of it. Bear Rating: 8/10			"

												Torchlight was a one-and-done game for me - I beat it once, and had zero desire to play it again after that. It was okay, though it surprised me just how closely it hewed to the Diablo 2 formula. The addition of pets doesn't really change the inventory management game, it just means you're doing it in the dungeon instead of in town.I give Torchlight a tentative recommendation, but only if you are looking for a Diablo 2-alike that specifically isn't Diablo 2, Diablo 3, or Path of Exile.

												Repetitive, but wow, this is a beautiful game. It's fun, yes. For about 15 levels. Then the repetition kicks in as you grind your way to the conclusion.The initial feel of this game is much greater than it ultimately delivers. It's got all the bells and whistles you'd expect in a full-price Adventure RPG, but the main storyline is short, and when it's done, there's no compelling reason to keep playing. Even though there's an infinite (?) dungeon waiting to be plundered, I felt no compulsion to continue when there was no quest to fulfill.I am very much looking forward to Torchlight 2 to see if it's a bigger game. It may be a compelling alternative to Diablo 3.As this game is on sale often for $5, it's a great intro for first-time ARPGers. If you would prefer an ARPG a bit more satisfying, I reccommend Titan Quest: Immortal Throne.			"

												I made the mistake of buying this AFTER I played Torchlight II. It is a solid clone of Diablo I like Torchlight II is similar to Diablo II. Perhaps I would have liked it more had I played it first, but quite frankly Torchlight II is a better game AND Torchlight II is MODDABLE unlike Torchlight I. My advice: if you only play 1 Torchlight game play Torchlight II instead of this one. UPDATE: Ok, due to some smartass comments on my review, Torchlight I IS Moddable, but you have to go outside Steam to do so, which in my opinion defeats the purpose and does not count.			"

												A fun enough Diablo-like ARPG.The graphics are fairly lo-fi (even for the time) but the art direction is nice so it works.Audio design is fine and the soundtrack is pretty amazing in places, but god I can't stand the old man voice telling me when I've finished a quest, levelled up etc, his pretentious fake british accent makes my flesh scream.The story is as basic as they make them (""something evil is threatening our village, work your way through the dungeon and kill it""), but honestly what would you expect from a hack'n'slash?As for the most important part, that is, the gameplay:- The industry standard three classes: tanky melee guy, archer woman and mage. I went with the archer because that's what I always do in this sort of game.- The four character stats (strength, dexterity, mana and defence) are really straightforward - strength buffs melee, dexterity buffs ranged weapons, mana buffs elemental damage and defence makes you tankier. Items have stat requirements that (unlike in Torchlight II) you HAVE to meet in order to use them.- Passive and active skills are simply locked by level as opposed to being arranged in a tree you progressively unlock. Active skills usually depend on weapon DPS and they're going to be your primary means of dealing substantial damage. Passives buff your combat abilities, pet, buy/sell prices, money drop rate and various other things.- Maybe I was doing something wrong but even on Normal difficulty (2nd of the 4 available) enemies were very tanky so I had to spam a lot of attacks, especially on bosses. I'd rather have enemies who are easy to kill but more lethal when you let them attack you.- The loot system is a little weird, for example I kept using a bow 20 levels lower than my character simply because I hadn't found a better one since. Sockets and enchantments allow you to improve gear but there's the annoying chance of an enchantment attempt disenchanting the item.- You have a pet who helps in combat (but its role mostly just boils down to aggro tanking) and can run back to town to sell items so you don't have to warp back as often.- Once you finish the main storyline you unlock a randomly generated dungeon with randomly generated kill/fetch quests, much like the entirety of Fate (the sort-of prequel to Torchlight). It gets repetitive after a while.So yeah, this is a good ARPG that you should definitely play if you're into the genre at least a little bit. It's not as good as its sequel though, imho.			"

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Torchlight skip to Results and read from there.Runic Games pushes the boundaries of RPG genre by providing a unique dungeon generation experience. Torchlight uses standard mechanisms for character development, but combines them in a unique experience that provides a fun and dynamic game. Story:In the relatively small town of Torchlight a mysterious element has caused a bundle of trouble. A special mineral known as Ember, popular for its unique traits, has been corrupted by a dastardly foe. A giant monstrosity has released his evil across the land and has corrupted the Alchemist known as Alric. It is up to you to fight through the layers of the mine and free the town of Torchlight from the evil daemon Ordrak who is forged from the ember the mine withholds. Campaign:Torchlight provides a relatively linear campaign filled with irrelevant quests that essentially provide a long-winded grind. The main story consists of 35-floors of a mine where each floor generally resembles the next with minor changes to the environment and foes held within. As you battle through the floors the enemies’ levels do not scale with the player; although, they do maintain a good consistency with the player’s level. To help separate the campaign each group of floors are bundled into segments that have portals connecting them: Orden Mines, Necropolis, Estherian Ruins, Tu’Tara Caverns, Molten Prison, Lost Fortress, Black Palace, and Lair.Each segment of the campaign contains a main boss which provides a unique battle experience that tests the player’s fortitude and skill.Gameplay:Torchlight offers a unique mixture of gaming by providing a generated dungeon element similar to Spelunky with a combat system such as Diablo the game provides a unique experience with each champion play through. In my personal opinion the campaign has little to no replay value when playing the same champion twice as the generated dungeons, although different are relatively the same.Similar to a standard RPG Torchlight provides classes that offer different combat styles: Alchemist, Destroyer, and Vanquisher. The Alchemist is your standard mage class and plays off magic attribute. The Destroyer is your standard fighting class and plays off strength. The Vanquisher is your standard hunter class and plays off dexterity. The gameplay elements are rather cumbersome and can be infuriating at times. There will be more times you will perish because of poor game mechanics than difficult curve. The player is required to move and fight by left-clicking with the mouse. This causes a lot of times where the players champion will run into battle when you actually just want to shoot from distance, this can also be annoying especially with fast moving and smaller enemies. Hints:>Do not waste your gems, using the Duran the Transmuter you can combine smaller gems into powerful gems that will have massive impacts on your champion. >Purchase Gems from Triya whenever you get back in town. She will sell them relatively cheap and if you keep using the Duran the Transmuter who doesn’t charge you can make powerful items.>Make sure to give your pet two spells, two rings, and a necklace. This will make them more powerful – I recommend Heal All and Frost.>If you’re ever stuck on a level just go back to an earlier part of the Campaign where the enemies are weaker and level up.>Make sure to send your pet back to town to sell items and heal up.>Defense is an important attribute – there is no tanking class so all classes need defense. Results:I played Torchlight after beating Torchlight II – this game is fun, but some elements are missing which cause the campaign to drain rather than provide enjoyment. The campaign is formatted in a way that seems like a grind rather than progression. The levels offer very little dynamics, meaning one portion of the campaigns play through is relatively similar to the next. Overall this game is relatively fun, and provides a good bit of enjoyment. It is a single player game and I’d really recommend getting Torchlight II over Torchlight, but if you are interested I’d say try to get this game when it’s on sale.Pros:+Lots of gameplay – estimated 40+ hours.+Unique character class with dungeon generation which causes acceptable multi-play through.+Pet which provides decent dynamics and intelligent character building.+Once the main campaign is completed the game goes on.+Two types of leveling: Fame and Experience. Fame gives you points to level your special abilities, while experience gives you points to level both special abilities and character states.+Amazing item diversity and item building. Enchanting items allows them to become stronger which makes key items very powerful and effective for building a highly custom character.Cons:-Poor controls moving and attacking utilize the same button.-No multiplayer-Pets stats are relatively low making them not entirely tank or damage.-Limited tutorial, this isn’t really that bad unless you are not averse to gaming.

												This is a great ARPG, but I'd reccomend it's successor, Torchlight 2, over this one. Torchlight, like Diablo before it, is a completely single player game. The music is by the same composer as Diablo and the game is created by former Diablo creators making it an excellent addition to anyone's collection. My biggest gripe with this game, however, is how ridiculously spongy the final boss is. If you're playing on Normal, you will breeze through the game, but you will still be nowhere near where you'll need to be to fight the final boss. I teleported back to Floor 1 and fought my way back to the end and tackled several Scroll Dungeons before I was able to defeat Ordrak and even then, it took me 15 minutes to drain his health. Great game, just be wary of this one major flaw.			"

												Initially I was extremely underwhelmed with this game. Poor class selection, rather simple combat mechanics, not huge variation in weapons, even the pet system could use some work. But what puzzled me the most is why this game had such good reviews for being as simple as it is. I mean, it isn't even unique, it simply takes parts from other games, dumbs them down, then integrates them. Then it hit me...That's why the game is so popular. You see, few people actually enjoy complex rpg's, which is this game's key to success. It makes playing extremely simple, with easy to understand mechanics and little variation. Considering that, this game really isn't all that bad. Would I reccomend it? Depends.If you are new to RPG's then yes, buy it.If you enjoy simpe games, then yes, buy it.Otherwise, buy Dungeon Siege 2 or get Neverwinter Nights or something.			"

												This is a really good Diablo 1 clone, with some neat features (like a pet that fights alongside you when he isn't running back to town to sell loot for you). There's one ""main"" dungeon with a couple dozen levels and then a number of side dungeons (including an endless one that open up once you've finished the ""main"" one). There are also 3 character classes to choose from (fighter, rogue, mage basically), and you can share items between characters in various ways. The story is minimal, and the quests are repetitive (usually involving killing a named enemy). The equipment and player stats are obtuse and unhelpful, especially for dual-wielding characters, but otherwise the equipment/stats system rivals that of Diablo 2. The game is also modder friendly, which is a nice bonus.			"

												Torchlight is an action RPG, made by ex-Blizzard employees.  You can tell as the feel is similar, though Torchlight does more and does it very well.  The graphics are crisp beautiful and somewhat cartoony.  The levels are randomly generated and they can go on and on and on too.  I think I reached level 100+.  The action is intense, but never too difficult to be frustrating.  The loot is remarkable, I've never seen so much loot.  It's nice that you have a pet as a companion to not only help with the fighting but to also go back to town with your loot to sell so that you don't have to constantly go back through a town portal to empty your bag.  The story is nothing new, we'll seen the evil take over a town, and the hero fights it back storyline.  It's the action, the gameplay and the fun that can be had in Torchlight that makes it shine.  One of the best action RPGs to date.			"

												Yes, I'm aware that Torchlight is a ""Very Positive"" game, but that does not make it immune to criticism. I didn't write this review simply to be a contrarian jerk. Videogames age, some more than others. At times, all it takes is for a game to receive a sequel, in order for its age to become readily apparent. Torchlight II improves on the original in every conceivable way. I'll even go as far as to say that Torchlight has been rendered obsolete. There's literally no reason to play Torchlight 1 over its sequel, or over the great many other loot-heavy action RPGs that have been released over the years.The absolute biggest problem with this game is the difficulty curve. I played through this game on normal, and for 9/10ths of the game, there wasn't any challenge. However, once I got to the final portion of the game, I started running into Dark Zealots. Dark Zealots have auto-targeting instant lightning. All it takes is a couple crits and I die. I admit that my lightning resistance wasn't up to snuff, but the fact that this attack is completely unavoidable is ridiculous. Once Dark Zealots start appearing, they're bound to show up fairly often throughout the post-game. I was on the 5th floor of the Shadow Vault and a Dark Zealot's lightning brought me from full health to death. I played through Torchlight II on hard difficulty. A veteran is likely to pop in here and say ""That's still way too easy."" but hear me out. Torchlight II on hard was more consistent than Torchlight 1 on normal. The game remained fairly challenging (for me) throughout the entirety of the main campaign. I didn't sleepwalk through the game, nor did I suddenly get a heaping helping of horse manure towards the end of it and beyond.By the way, why does Ordrak have 3 billion HP? Why can he summon countless dragons and skeletons? I'm positively boggled that anyone signed off on this nonsense of a finale. The ludicrousness of the final boss really stands out, when every other boss dies in a minute or two. Torchlight 2 was more consistent when it came to bosses.Loot. Now I know it's difficult to expect good loot. There is the almighty RNG, and I've never been very lucky. Nevertheless, there is a rhyme and reason to how this system should work, and players should feel like their time is rewarded, especially when they defeat bosses or discover secret rooms. Instead, you're just as likely to get a weapon that's usable for half the game as you are to not find any decent armor upgrades for 3/4s of the game. AGAIN, Torchlight II is more consistent. Torchlight II also has better quest-design, exploration, map-design, classes, skills, monster-variety, and so on and so forth. It's practically a revelation by comparison. Now I could download a couple mods to fix the Dark Zealot's insane lightning, or drop Ordrak's HP to something manageable, or improve the myriad of other things that need improving, but that's not my idea of a fun time. Mods are at their best when they add to a game, not just fix its problems. Besides, I already own the sequel. At this point, there really isn't an excuse not to. Torchlight II enjoys sizable discounts during all of the major Steam sales.On the bright side, when I review Torchlight II (eventually); I won't have to spend the entirety of it discussing why it's a better game than the prequel.

												One of my favorite Single-Player games of all time, an excellent example of an Dungeon-Crawling Action RPG!Controls as simple as they get, graphics that stand the test of time and audio to match. If you've ever played Diablo or Fate this is almost the same but slightly more refined. The story isn't something you'll remember once your done playing but isn't half bad. Its pretty straight forward: buy it, try it then lose yourself in it for about 8 hours. The sequel is even better with multiplayer, its almost Diablo 3 but not quite there.I think ive been through it about 7 times, currently on my 8th Character and probably gonna run it until my computer dies.8.9/10 - Just buy it, its excellent.

												I don't typically like the diablo style games that are only playable with a mouse, seems like all you do is click on things over and over again.  I prefer more console based ARPGs like Ys, however Torchlight is very well done, very vivid, world feels alive.  But its still just point and click, click, click.			"

The game is okay to kill some time, but I wouldn't bother.  I'd recommend Torchlight 2 over Torchlight, but Path of Exile over Torchlight 2. Path of Exile is FREE!			"

												Don't know what to say really. Its a fantastic game, both Torchlight games are, Torchlight II giving you that multiplayer too really hit the spot. Although both Torchlight games have a fantastic singleplayer, keeping you hooked into the game constantly wanting to go deeper into the dungeon or more side or random quests, never getting enough sleep at night :D Warning from now, if you are one of the people that think that im going to get this game to play a bit every day............say adios to your life, this isnt a ""play at bit"" game.............it is if you can manage to un-hook yourself. xD The games graphics are splendid, the story is great and the enormous amount of options you have is fantastic. Yes the only 3 characters u have to choose form and no sex changes is a bit limited, but thats how they invisioned it then. Really its all about the pets, i dont really look at my character and go awwwwwwwww (just go omg i look epic) im all about that pet :D ^^			"

I got addicted to this game for a while with my Vanquisher character and would power through most dungeons without even one scratch. Some say this is a Diablo Clone, but i wouldn't go that far to say its a clone. The Dog pet however sounds like an Asian pornstar when damaged making a high pitched Moan, and can sometimes confuse you thinking its a enemy. Other than that this game is awesome I'm glad i bought this :D			"

												This was truly a fresh experience when it came out 5 years ago. At the time Diablo 3 was far away from being released so fans of the prequel could really enjoy Torchlight as it had the same mechanics as Diablo 2 had in 2000.But what about now? In 2014? Is it worth playing?Well, it depends: The first game focuses on single-player only. Runic Games made the sequel an MMO so multiplayer and coop can be found in it and it offers a long-lasting experience.If you do not mind playing alone an RPG for dozens (if not hundreds) of hours then Torchlight is for you. If you prefer friends then you should purchase the sequel and you'll immediately see that even for one class there are many builds you can create so Torchlight can truly be a long game.  "

												Torchlight is a good game.  That being said, Torchlight exists in a world where it is overshadowed and outperformed by its sequel.  The original Torchlight game has a a very small world, and the game/ progress is incredibly linear.  Basically there's a single town and a solitary dungeon with numerous levels leading down that you work through.  That's it.  In addition, the story is pretty much an afterthought.  What the game does get right though, is the actual gameplay.  Combat is a joy, and honestly you rarely mind grinding through the same early stages as you try to progress deeper down into the dungeon.  My typical play session stretched to several hours and I think I burned through this game in two weeks, so that gives you an idea of how addicting the combat is.  Multiple classes, a great concept of a helper pet, and bright visuals make for a fun time.  If you can only pick up one game though, I would recommend the vastly superior sequel.  In addition, if you've already played the sequel then this game feels like a step down after that.  A solid game, but others (including the sequel) do it better.  7/10 for this one.			"

												If I were to summarize this game in one sentence it'd be ""Child's first Hack n' Slash lootfest for those who weren't around for Diablo 2"". And that's perfectly okay. Namely because that's me.Torchlight is an isometric action RPG where you bind active skills to the mouse and number keys and make your way down 30 floors to kill the big bad, only for you to turn into the big bad yourself in the sequel (Sound familiar?[en.wikipedia.org]). Along the way you will level up and find incrimental upgrades in the form of magically enchanted gear to buff a list of stats and attributes to make your time much easier. After that, you're pretty much done, you can then enter an endless dungeon full of ever-increasing baddies onwards to level your character to level 100 and then retire, but you will usually be absolutely done into your early 60s and will want to move on.If none of that sounds fun, Hack N' Slash games are not your thing. Sorry.If it does sound fun, congrats; buy this game and get started immediately so you can catch up on all the Hack N' Slashes you missed over the years.________________________While many might think that the level to 60 and quit is a dumb thing. I honestly think that might be the entire point. At least for me, this is a game you blaze through during a nostalgia trip and then move on. Your accumulated knowledge from various other loot fests will be put to use here to absolutely destroy the balancing in the game compared to your downward trudge the first time because you thought you could handle Hard (More on that later). I very much look forward to my next playthrough in 2-3 years.However, that doesn't mean the game is without a large share of flaws due to its age. I will go over the Pros and Cons________________________ProsThis game was $20 during its release back in 2009. It has since been given out in bundles, as well as a free gift to people at one point. It's currently $15 as of this review and usually gets 75% off during sale times.The art style used here is timeless. Even after 7 years, it looks as good as it did day 1VERY easy to run on a modern-day windows system (At least compared to Diablo 1/2)It is an excelent gateway to other Lootfests4 basic character atrributes are simple to understand. Life, Melee damage, Ranged Damage, and Elemental Damage.You have access to a pet that can sell your garbage for extra coin without you needing to leaveA lot of numbers do not have a soft cap to them. So if you exploit the start of the game, you can get enough gems to get something dumb like 16 +4% crit chance gems which totals to roughly an 80% crit chance after maxing the skill on the treeSimple and robust modding system, drag mod files into mod directory and you're set.You can somehow remember every single line in the game despite only playing it about 5 times through totalConsThe Pet is 95% useless in any combat situation, the best thing they can do is maybe draw some mobs away from you before he dies again..And again....And again......As this game is over 7 years old, you can believe you can have a difficult time trying to find mods, let alone developers who still support them.Movement speed is one of the worst things. If you pick the melee or mage, you move like a snail. Picking the ranger will have you move like a turtle. Get movement speed enchants and Haste ASAPDifficulty scaling is by far one of the worst I have ever seen in a game. More on that laterThis game was released during an awkward point where you combined basic attacks as well as active skills; meaning you run out of mana constantlyStore weapons and armor are at least twice as good as loot you find in the dungeon; so you will be mostly buying new gear instead of finding a really nice equip.No easy way to identify multiple items at once without binding the scrolls to a hotkeyAn overwhealming majority of your early-game skills are outclassed by the ones around level 25. Resulting in quit a handful of wasted skill points.No non-cheat/mod way to respec your character. Once you pick a skill and confirm, it's there forever.Unique/legendary gear is largly just a rare item with a unique model, hardly an guarenteed stat rolls, and the ones that are guarenteed are largly useless in my experiance.As with all Diablo-typed ARPGs, it is almost impossible to list a name for this genre.________________________Now then, on to my biggest complaint throught the review; the higher difficulties are 100% trash. Do not even bother picking them unless you want to hate yourself. I have did a little research on Floor 1 and concluded that the HP and damage scaling is like this: Easy = 50%. Normal = 100%. Hard is 200% and Very Hard is about 300%. Besides that, nothing else changes; no extra loot drops, no mob changes, just extremely high numbers for your level. As such, the only way you can get through most of the floors is to overlevel like crap before then, which is just padding to make the game longer.Tacked onto this, the final boss is one of the worst designed bosses in history, in my opinion. At level 28, with a 79% crit chance after 15 +4% crit chance gems it took me 25 minutes of nonstop running and potion chugging to defeat him on Hard, As Seen Here. (Sorry about the waternark, issues with shadowplay) I will admit, I was 2 levels behind him, but this is with 0 going back to grind in a 5 hour speedrun.________________________HOWEVER. Despite all my gripes with my most recent playthrough, I will still wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone on the fence about playing a Hack N Slash Loot Fest ARPG Diablo Clones, and a fun little romp for veteran players to break the game the way they want it to, especially for only $15.Just, you know, not on Hard or Very Hard			"

												DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at www.stanislavcostiuc.com. I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.If Torchlight has solidified anything in my design preferences, then it’s my distaste for huge amounts of loot. I like Torchlight, I really do. It’s a fun isometric Action/RPG experience, with very precise, responsive and polished controls, good enemy variety, a nice skill system, and pets. When I first opened up the game and saw that you can have a dog or a cat I instantly went ‘OH MY GOD THIS IS SO COOL’, I didn’t even know what their purpose was at that point.But by Odin’s beard does the loot system just annoy me. It’s actually the very reason why I become bored with Torchlight after playing it for a while. Though the next day I want to come back to it, because the core gameplay is fun and addicting in a way (and although I guess this is contrary to the general opinion, but in my case loot doesn’t contribute to the addiction). But there’s just too many items with too little differences, that the joy of finding something is not there at all. For example, on one dungeon run I have found five rare chest pieces of the same type with little differences in bonuses they give. I couldn’t choose, it was really hard to make an informed decision based on minuscule distinction, so I decided just to sell them all, and try to enchant my current armor instead. And put a gem into the socket to give it additional stats I needed.And, you know what… This should have been the focus of the loot mechanic, of the whole equipment system. Enchantments and gems. In the game, whenever you visit an enchanter, you have a chance to add a random bonus stat to an item, or a socket for a gem (on another hand, there’s a chance that all your bonuses are going to be removed completely, and it increases with every enchantment of the item). You use different kind of ember gems to put into sockets, which give the items more stat bonuses. You can also combine (transmute) different tiers of ember gems to create more powerful gems.I haven’t played Diablo-like games in a while, so I don’t think the idea is new to Torchlight. However, it’s a very cool concept that increases the longevity of the item that you use. In fact, you kinda become attached to it, especially after a number of successful enchantments. But the loot system – the amount of all the stuff you find and how similar they are, it hinders the enchantment/gem system, because you are not quite sure which part of your equipment to focus on when there’s such a huge turn-over rate of the items in your inventory.Decrease the randomness of the items (and the loot frequency), increase the amount of ember gems that you find, and tweak it so every new piece of equipment you find would be (or become) a meaningful addition (and would make the choice between staying with current upgraded equipment or refocusing on new one more prominent). I would’ve had so much more fun with that. You can say, “Well, why don’t you go make your own Torchlight then (with blackjack and hookers)?” And hey, Runic Games allows us to do just that – they have released an editor for Torchlight which allows to edit… well, pretty much everything. So I might as well try to change how the loot system works. Modding scene is definitely one of Torchlight‘s strongest points, and they embrace it fully – there are even Steam achievements for using mods.Overall, Torchlight is a very good game. I really don’t agree with the loot mechanics, and the random dungeon generator sometimes creates exact same huge chunks of levels in supposedly different locations (so it’s somewhat jarring), but it has got fun hacky-slashy core mechanics, and everybody can tweak it to his or her liking thanks to the modding capabilities.

												A classic. A dirt cheap, balls to the wall, throwback of the century.The debut game for the latest label that a collective of Ex-Diablo devs operate under, since they left Blizzard that is, Torchlight is the definitive herald for a new era of ARPG's. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what level of influence THIS, not Diablo, had on newer releases like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, and obviously its sequel, Torchlight II, which I recommend starting at unless you really care about that previous point.So yea, grab it, it's on sale for nothing all the time. It's also on GOG, often for less than here, and those copies are DRM free (can save the installer and give to friends freely, like a music CD.) "

												Not a bad game.  It's clearly a Diablo clone, but, after finding out who the developers were (mostly Diablo developers!) I can understand why that is!  They took a formula that worked, and tweaked it slightly.  If you enjoy ARPGs you'll probably enjoy this one.  Nothing terribly new to speak of, though the pet is a nice additional mechanic.If you're looking for a dungeon crawling ARPG with nice atmosphere that you can do a level or two when you've got some time, this will be a good pickup for you.

												Single-player Diablo-like game (action role-playing dungeon crawler, isometric clicky clicky with randomized loot drops) that came out in 2009. The world was still waiting for Blizzard to deliver the next Diablo, and so, this was well-timed.  (Runic went on to release Torchlight2 at around the same time that Diablo3 came out.) It also has a pretty deep mod community, though I'll admit that I played the game vanilla on my playthrough.The game is polished: graphics aged fine, clean audio helps the game feel immersive and responsive, and the game runs smoothly on my high-end gaming rig. Did not try it on anything else, but I suspect it'll run just fine. The story is nothing new, but then again -- you're not really playing this game for the story. It's a game where you diablo diablo diablo til you diablo diablo diablo, while you diablo diablo diablo... diablo. In that aspect, the game entertained me 'til the end. According to the in-game panel, that was about 12 hours.One point of emphasis: the game difficulty runs easy. If you want a challenging game in which you engage all the mechanics, I'd highly suggest you nudge the difficulty up. In my playthrough, I didn't touch any of the optional map-fragment dungeons; simply the main dungeon and the ones that Hatch opens for you, in his Quest For Many Things. My character's levels almost always matched the number of the main dungeon floor I was on. Though I do have a habit of clearing each floor completely, I shouldn't have been overleveled for any part of the game. And yet, I never had to use a mana potion or any of the various mana shrines. Didn't touch a health potion until L25, and even then rarely. Never had to fiddle with my pet's form -- simply used him as a carryall back to town to sell my items. (So, that took the need to fish right out of the picture.) I had no real use for my currency. (Game only has one -- gold.) I was one-shotting enemies with the gear I found on the ground. I cannot imagine the devs intended for you to three-shot their bosses. At some point toward the end, I just decided to put 100k gold into enchanting a single item, you know, for funsies. I suspect the devs had intended for the enchantment system to work as a gold sink, but I simply didn't need the stat boosts to make the game less challenging. I'm afraid it would have become boring.I never once used any spells. I also didn't bother learning any non-passive class skills outside of the first available frost shot. Once I learned that, that's what I left my secondary attack on.Perhaps it was simply because I'd built up a ranged, spike character and the dungeons are designed with bottlenecks galore (hallways and corners everywhere, weeee), but giving the ranged player a NPC tank, a single-target spike, AND a piercing crowd-control projectile so very early in the game may have been overkill.Even if you haven't played a Diablo before, turn the difficulty up a bit.Other small notes:Pet pathing. I realize this is sticky for many devs to get right, but boy -- my pet did not know how to go up stairs when the stairs were perhaps seven feet away from him. It's a small irritant, of course, since I could simply spend the 5 seconds moving around to manipulate his pathing algorithm.Replayability. Once you beat the game with any class, a new ""Shadow Dungeon"" opens up. I fully admit that I will not be playing the game again (I have far too many other things to get to!) but that along with being able to ""retire"" a character to pass along a heirloom makes it seem as though the replayability is solid. And again, there's a pretty decent mod community.			"

A dirt cheap, balls to the wall, throwback of the century.The debut game for the latest label that a collective of Ex-Diablo devs operate under, since they left Blizzard that is, Torchlight is the definitive herald for a new era of ARPG's. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what level of influence THIS, not Diablo, had on newer releases like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, and obviously its sequel, Torchlight II, which I recommend starting at unless you really care about that previous point.So yea, grab it, it's on sale for nothing all the time.

												Torchlight is a game where you control one of three totally different character archtypes which act similarly. You are forced to guide them through random mazes in order to finish the game. In your way will encounter 'random treasure drops' which you can choose to pick up, or not pick up. This constitutes about 50% of the gameplay. The rest of the game is filled with battles with 'mobs' who will attempt to 'hide' this treasure from you in their soft underbellies. the characters have abilities which you can 'pick' from, although choices are often easy if you want the game to be easier. Combat is comedic in that you don't feel anything but puny and weak fighting your adversaries. Pets are an interesting addition to the genre, allowing you to waste time fiddling with their inventory and their loadout.Play wow if you like mindless grinds, at least it has good multiplayer an balanced gameplay.

You only need the micromanaging skills of a McDonalds shift manager to perfectly optimize this wonderful time-saving repetition-avoiding mechanic.

												Its a pretty sweet Diablo clone. And just like Diablo, it can cause you to crack out on it till 3am if you arent careful. The temptation to go ""just one more level"" is quite high. It has socketable items, a whole crapload of different items, 3 classes (mage, fighter, ranged) and the choice to choose between a pet bobcat like tthing or a wolf that follows you around and attacks enemies. You can also turn your pet into other creatures if you feed it fish, a quest system and a whole lot more. Personally I like it better than either Diablo 1 or 2. Haven't played 3 so I can't make that call. Pick this up if it's on sale!			"

												An action RPG that resembles Blizzard's Diablo series in more ways than one and doesn't quite reach the same level. It's not far behind though and it's still a very great game. One of my favorite games at the moment.I'm more than a little annoyed that Runic Games have not made it available for Linux on Steam when they clearly have a flawlessly working Linux port. It may however be bought for Linux through the Ubuntu Software Center.			"

												It's like they took Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 and slammed them together for a *damned fun* adventure in the same style; when I mean they slammed them together, I mean the same people who created them made this. Rares, Uniques, Set Pieces, Town Portal Scrolls, IT'S ALL HERE. The game features the town of Torchlight, not too different from Tristram that has a massive dungeon underneath it; instead of the church, we have mines, but the end result is the same: evil corruption.You can play as a Destroyer, Vanquisher, or Alchemist. Each class has 3 skill trees they can go into, and each tree changes how the game is played. The Destroyer can be a Melee Warrior, Ranged, or Spell Caster, likewise the Vanquisher and Alchemist can choose as well: If you've ever played a Summoning Necro from Diablo 2, the  Alchemist can assume that role as well, imps instead of skeletons and a Beam Golem that shoots enemies.After you beat the game and kill it's final boss, a new, infinite dunegon will open.

												Torchlight is in my opinion a one hit wonder. The game is fun to play for a short period of time but if you continue to play it for more then 4 - 5 sittings it picks up a boring momentum of repetition, going over and over through same enemies and same levels. After completing the game for a few times the story still remains a complete mystery to me. Bugs make things even worse, destroying the fun concept of the GamePlay  (especially on hardcore mode). To top it all off, it doesn't have a MP which is a must in nowdays dungeon crawler games. Torchlight seems like a game made in a hurry which had potential to be a great game but ended up as a decent 5/10.			"

												A classic. A dirt cheap, balls to the wall, throwback of the century.The debut game for the latest label that a collective of Ex-Diablo devs operate under, since they left Blizzard that is, Torchlight is the definitive herald for a new era of ARPG's. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what level of influence THIS, not Diablo, had on newer releases like Path of Exile, Van Helsing, and obviously its sequel, Torchlight II, which I recommend starting at unless you really care about that previous point.So yea, grab it, it's on sale for nothing all the time. It's also on GOG, often for less than here, and those copies are DRM free (can save the installer and give to friends freely, like a music CD.) "

The story is different due to copyright stuff, but many of the developers who made Diablo made Torchlight.Torchlight does have some differences, like you get a pet who can fight with and sell items for you. But in the end it is kinda a mix between Diablo 1 and 2 gameplay wise. You can buy your own spells, but your character has his/her own set of spells/skills. In the end it is a unique game that is not Quite Diablo, but it is a great game!			"

												Summary: Steampunk Diablo 1.5Multiplayer: NoCompletion: 15 hrs first time, 5 hours subsequentCards: NoCloud: YesTorchlight is a 3D overhead action RPG set in a steampunky cartoony universe. If you've played Diablo II, Torchlight will feel very familiar, especially considering a large makeup of the team consists of the Diablo crew. Thus comparisons between the two are inevitable.Your character comes to the town of Torchlight, a mining town that excavates a hot commodity known as Ember. As with all mysterious forms of power, Ember appears to come at a cost, and it is up to you to investigate. Pretty standard story, it's just there to provide an excuse for you to go hunting for monsters and loot.You are offered three basic classes - a melee fighter, an archer, and a mage. Each class comes with three skill trees. Though some skills, generally passive ones, are universal to all classes, so it's more like every class has two trees. Skill allocations are permament. There are no synergy bonuses in this game, so once a skill becomes obsolete, it becomes wasted points. On the other hand, if you are gunning for speedy playthroughs, then it's a good idea to spend points early on.Enchanting items provides a nifty way to add small bonuses to the items you find for a small fee. However, each additional enchantment increases the odds that EVERYTHING will be stripped from it. I am totally against this design. I wish it instead stripped the item down to its base form. You could spend hundreds of hours making one awesome heirloom, only to have it accidentally disenchanted because of one button press. It doesn't help that I'd swear the quoted disenchant chance is bogus. If my math is right, you should theoretically have a 73% chance to succeed on 5 attempts with the regular enchanter, not counting attempts that result no change. It feels like I failed more than that. Torchlight has a rather fascinating retirement system. After you've beaten the game, you are given the option to retire the character at any time, and choose one item to gain enhanced stats. It's a neat method to encourage replaying, and I would have loved to take advantage of it, but each playthrough of the game just feels so long and samey, that I couldn't bring myself to do it.One thing that bothered me about the game is how short buffs are. A haste buff for example lasts for 8 seconds, and then you have to recast it. Considering you have to briefly stand still to cast it, it's rarely worth the effort. Class buffs are more potent, but they require frequent recasting as well.Torchlight is a pretty game. They did a good job on modeling, and it's got some nice cartoony aesthetics. The music is very Diabloesque, considering it was written by the same person. I did encounter some annoyances with the game engine. Shooting up and down stairs is oddly problematic, as your shots will often stray off or hit the stairs instead of the target. Summons also have a tendency to gather into a wall to try to attack something. Some npcs have curiously large interaction ranges, thus when you exit their screen, you end up talking to them because you clicked too close. Other than that the game runs pretty well.I give Torchlight a 7.5/10. While I don't deny the game is well-done, the sheer repetitiveness of killing dozens of enemies the same way often made me zone out and go into autopilot. It doesn't help that the later floors stretch for so long, and there's few methods to speed things up. Diablo 2 suffers from this as well, to some extent. Torchlight is a good game if you need to scratch that Diablo itch, but some part of me would also just rather play Diablo 2.			"

												Really enjoy this game. Fun dungeons, tons of items to acquire and enchant. It's a bit of mindless hack and slash, but that's what I like about it. Variety of difficulty settings. Quest-driven, though there's not many. Enchantment system is quite a gamble and will empty your wallet extremely fast often for failed results or worse (complete removal of existing enchantments). I've seen a number of disenchants happen when the chance was only 2-6%. Seems a lot higher. Overall, though, a very fun game with easy controls and not much of a learning curve. Pick up and go.

												Not an alternative to Diablo or Path of Exile, if that is indeed what you are looking for. It is a much smaller game in scope and size, with a unique approach towards the genre. The combat is highly satisfying, the progression is intuitive, and the art style is pleasing to look at. You can easily switch your playstyle or try a different class if it becomes repetitive. The level design is somewhat random and not particularly great, but it never feels broken or out of place. The rest of the game is solid with not much to complain about. I never felt bored playing it, but I also never felt too engaged. I often found myself playing other games over Torchlight, or just forgetting about the game entirely. So in that sense it's not particularly memorable, but whenever I rediscover the game I end up enjoying it just as much as the last time I played it.			"

												Good game if cost is factored into it. Overall the game is straightforward and relatively  easy in terms of difficulty and plays similar to a Diablo style of game, minus the great story depth and exploration. The game consists of one main town essentially and a single mission which is to investigate the mines and stop the evil within it, however there are various NPC quests in the town as well (all taking place in same realm). The boss fights were interesting but easier than the levels preceding them. The story although somewhat interesting was somewhat lacking, although it was straightforward it lacked depth. This pretty much sums up the game, it is enjoyable if you like a good dungeon runner Diablo style game, but it is little more than a single mission fight dragged over the course of numerous depths in the dungeon with a half hearted backstory. It is fun for casual play however so I can recommend it conditionally if this is what you are looking for.			"

The character customization is a bit lacking (there is none), but they have promised to change that in Torchlight 2 (sometime this year... please?).  The main story is kind of typical (good guy researches evil stuff for good, becomes corrupted), but the great thing is that the game doesn't end once you finish the main story.  I definitely recommend for anyone to give it a try, especially considering it is always cheap whether it's on sale or not.			"

												Torchlight is a solid homage to the original Diablo.  As long as you don't expect too much more than that, you will be pleasantly surprised.  While the game has greater interactivity than its inspiration, much of the interactivity is irrelevant to the actual gameplay and serves only a peripheral role.  Skill trees offer greater flexibility at the cost of logic and simplicity -- if you're the sort of player who likes a little direction with their character development, you may find it frustrating.  8 out of 10.

												Torchlight is like League of Legends meets World of Warcraft, on a lesser scale. Hardcore League and WoW players may not be very impressed when starting off; however, once the player gets past the first few floors of the dungeon, it easily becomes addictive. Being a good old classic dungeon crawler, it sucks the player in the deeper they go; the floors and their scenery become progressively more interesting as you descend. Definitely a must-play.

For me it's more fun than diablo 1/2.You won't get much in terms of story, exploration, NPC's and the like. This game is pure single player dungeon crawling extravaganza. And it does that better than any other game yet.The 3 characters are all fun as hell and can be played in a variety of ways and you don't have to worry about messing up or anything since the game tailors well to the way you want to play.All in all it's one of the most fun games i've ever played.

												Torchlight - a hack n' slash RPG comparable to Diablo II. I suggest this game on Hard if you want challenge (Normal is pretty easy). You have a choise of a warrior, rogue, or mage class and while there is no visual customization beyond gear, you can mix and match skills or specialize skill trees without fear of having a skill requirement for any skill TL gets somethings right: pets can carry the same amount of items you can, and can be sent to town to sell them, a shift-click will transfer your items to and from inventories and merchants. pets can retreive loot. Though you can't change the keybindings (except mapping skills to 1-0 and F Keys), some parts ore either too easy or too hard, and quest loot if often junk. If you're into this kind of game, you'll get plenty of replay value for $14.99. 7/10 Score			"

												Torchlight is a well done action RPG dungeon crawler. Not original by any means, but its simplified interface makes it very user friendly and easy to pick up. Three different character choices plus you get a pet. There's plenty of random loot which is ultimately why we put so many hours into these type of games. At the end of the day though, it does end up feeling a little empty having to play alone.			"

The gameplay is fantastic, with diverse skill trees begging for multiple playthroughs as the same character.

												I never cared for Diablo, so it's a bit puzzling that I put so much time into Torchlight, a derivative made in part by makers of Diablo & D2. Most tout D2 over Torchlight due to its multiplayer/larger class variety, but Torchlight's interface addresses my problems with the genre.The main problem with ARPGs (esp. Blizzard's) is ""tedium"" & ""excessive mouse clicking."" Torchlight takes real measures to reduce both. You can hotkey commands to ALL keyboard numerals. You get an invincible pet that not only doubles your inventory, auto-attacks enemies, and can pick up items for you, but can be told ""go back to town and sell your items to free up space."" THIS IS HUGE. You're also CONSTANTLY getting new gear, which makes Normal mode a breeze. Alas, you still left-click to both move AND attack.As far as aesthetics, I prefer that in this game, you can dual-wield GUNS and effectively set up machinegun sentry turrets. Hits have impact. Enemies can be pretty massive. One's even a chaingun mecha!			"

												Torchlight is pretty much your standard hack'n'slash. It really doesn't bring much new to the table.Is that bad? Not necessarily. Because even if it may not reinvent the wheel, it does what it does very good.You're hacking and slashing your way through various areas, kill various enemies, collect various loot...stuff you do in hack'n'slashers, right? Right! And if you like the genre, it's quite likely that you'll like Torchlight, although some may not to be to keen on the graphical style, but apart from that it's a really god hack'n'slash.I also love the animal companion. Not much of a game changer in terms of combat, but being able to pack your worthless crap on it and send it to town to sell the stuff without having to leave the dungeon is absolutely great.			"

												*cough* Diablo *cough *TItan Quest *cough* Now that I have your attention, I don't really think I have to say anything else. The two games mentioned at the beginning of this mini review tell you exactly what you want to know. Yes, it's an action RPG (all the mouse clicking is probably going to hurt your fingers). And yes, there's random loot. I hear you think; does this game show us anything new then ? Well... yes. You now have a pet that's with you 24/7. Your pet can kill, keep items and even sell your items. The dungeons are randomly created, meaning a level won't ever be the same and their are enough vendors in town (enchanters, weapons, random maps, you name it) to keep you busy for a long, long time. And the graphics are superb, love the style ! Also, they could've set the difficulty a bit higher, because most of the times there isn't much of a challenge. But I'm sure they'll fix that in Torchlight II. Now... what are you still doing here ? Go play it ![Rating: 78/100]			"

												Bwee. So this is one of those dungeon-crawler games where you click an insane amount of times. Indeed, you move and attack with the same button. Now it's been a while since I played this, so I might be wrong about that, but I am pretty sure I am not. I've got a pretty good memory for things that annoy me. Another such thing was having -all- of my save data for this game lost on a crash shortly after beating the final boss, ensuring that I wouldn't touch it again.So why review this? Because reasons. I guess it's a good diablo-esque dungeon game. I wouldn't know. Ask people who actually like those sorts of games, because I'm not one of them. I'll give this a ""yes"" anyway because it's good at what it's supposed to do, even if it is stuff that I have little taste for.			"

												Having not played the successor (yet), I can' t compare both titles... what I can say, however, is that Torchlight 1 is a good game by it's own right.The story is lovely but short (there are achievements for defeating the final boss in under 8 or even 5 hours), it has some very nice features regarding gameplay (most importantly the pet which fights alongside you and which you can send back to town to sell your loot) and the fighting system is fun too, although some people might complain that it's to easy - I only died once on normal during the main story, and that's because I was extremely unaware.A point of critique is that after you have beaten the main story, the only reason to go to the ""endless dungeon"" is to get the achievements related to it and to have some harder fights, so, in my opinion, the replay-ability is fairly limited. I will play two additional classes to try and get some hardcore- and speedrun- achievements, but not further.A point worth mentioning is that there exist a lot of mods out there to enhance almost everything - additional quests, monsters, dungeons, a new GUI, only to mention a few things. Even better: They do not disable the achievements (only a very few mods do) but rather there are 3! achievements for having mods active while playing.Overall, I would give this game a 7 out of 10 and can recommend it when its in sale, although you MIGHT wanna play the second game instead.

												A simple and fun game. There is no built in keymapper, nor any way to see what comes bound to what, so just play around a bit. Hold shift to fire without moving. On ""normal"" difficulty the game is easy enough that you can basically just screw around with your skills and items and not worry about it. Just have fun slaughtering hordes of mobs. And that about sums this game up: fun while slaughtering hordes of mobs. The end.			"

												I cannot in good faith recommend this to any fantasy or dungeon-crawler junkies.Yes, I know, it was made by former Blizzard (Diablo, WoW) Employees, and they set out to make a better game.They failed.-You cannot reliably fight on stairs, you always miss with spells.-Dungeons and Loot are randomized, making tracking down armor sets a complete chore.-Killing wave after wave of enemies gets VERY boring after about 10 floors of monotony.-The set-up ideas and setting are interesting, but so watered down you don't care in the end.-Main male npc dies in battle at the start.-Main female npc does NOTHING for the entire game, despite being a ""seasoned veteran hero"".-""Evil Wizard that wants immortality being whispered to by a dark deity/spirit/monster"" cliche.-On the 30th floor SUDDENLY enemies show up that can challenge you, blast away 2/3 to 4/5 of your HP in one hit, shifting the difficulty of the game drastically, regardless of what difficulty you're on.This game brings nothing new to the table, and the makers literally admitted they were making a Diablo 2 clone, but ""better"". You guys better shut your sacreligious mouths.((P.S. You can't leave Torchlight (the town) because some jackass parked a supply cart ON the bridge out of town. wth...))			"

While the story is nothing spectacular (like many game in this ARPG genre) and the voice-acting is decent enough, you are really here for the addictive nature of the awesome combat, constant upgrading of your character & the crazy amount of loot. TL is very similar to Diablo 1 in style, as you'll keep going down & down deeper into the dungeons to battle forces trying to corrupt & ruin the town. TL sports a steampunk setting & is much more colorful than Diablo. One cool thing about TL is you can have a pet join you in combat...and have it run back to town & sell items back to town so you can stay in the action! This game is Single Player only, BTW.

												While the story is different, the gameplay and game mechanics seem, to me at least, to be almost IDENTICAL to the old Diablo II game that Blizzard released over a decade ago.  I mean, everything from how you move and attack (left mouse to attack, shift+left  mouse to stationary attack), to the hack-n-slash style of the game's quests, to the scrolls of Town Portal, to socketed weapons and armor, to a three-pronged, Mana-powered skill tree, to the...well, you get the idea: it plays a lot like the old Diablo II game.  So, I guess one could argue that it's a Diablo II rip-off (and they may be right), but it's an extremely well made, easy to learn, fun to play game so it's hard to judge Torchlight too harshly.  I loved Diablo II and despite (or maybe because of?) the similarities, I'm having a ball with this game so far.  It's totally worth buying (especially on sale).  Yes, the story is pretty simplistic, but if you want a fun, doesn't-take-itself-too-seriously, hack-n-slash adventure game, then this is your ticket!  :)  Plus, the cartoony graphics sort of add to the charm of the game.

												A suitable ARPG to pass the time until Diablo III shows up, but there are a ton of glaring issues with Torchlight that prevent me from recommending it fully. For starters, the overall difficulty level is arbitrary, veering from too easy to extremely difficult in a matter of moments. Some monsters are impossible to kill without spamming unique abilities or spells, and oftentimes combat reverts to simply holding down a spell hotkey until spawning monsters are completely wiped out. The end boss is a supremely horrible example of game design, and the targeting system is far too finnicky to be of any accuracy - you have to click on the same tiny spot in order to target any opponent or else you'll miss completely. In addition, there are several game-breaking issues that can bring play to a halt and ruin a finely-tuned character forever.Not a bad game by any means, just poorly designed and executed by the developers. Hopefully Torchlight 2 makes up for all of this.			"

												*click*click*click*That's what you're going to be doing ALOT of in Torchlight.The game is an old school hack-and-slash RPG in the same vein as the Diablo series and all the clones that have spawned from that. Players who enjoy those kinds of games and/or are loot and stat junkies will absolutely adore Torchlight however everyone else will probably run out of steam once the main ""story"" is completed. There's tons of loot ranging from common stuff to rare items and sets of items to track down, you have three character types to choose from (the basic three: warrior, rogue, and wizard who each have three skill trees), you've got a pet that will carry loot and even transform into different things when you feed it fish, the different sections of the dungeon are artistically well done, and the range of enemies is definitely substantial.  Other than being a solid dungeon crawler though there's not much else to attract those who aren't quite fans of that genre. The story is paper thin, theres absolutely no characterization in regards to your own avatar or the very few NPCs, the sidequests are uninspired (get this, kill that, go to a different dungeon and get this) and the whole thing just feels like a time sink - one that will definitely appeal to some but will leave others bored and ready to move on to something else after a couple of hours.The best way to really describe Torchlight: you're going to love it or hate it. Unfortunately I tend to put a good deal of emphasis on narrative, the game world, etc and this game just straight up doesn't have that.			"

												To put it simple the game is a traditional Diablo clone, but a real fun one, not to mention it has an official editor which allows to create awesome mods - starting with some new unique weapon additions ending with total conversions. The gameplay... well, you pretty much just smash and inicerate all the foes on your way, collect new equipment (Most of which you sell - most of stuff you find is not worth equiping) and level your character, unlocking new abilities. These are real fun and different for all three classes. You also get a dog (Or cat, or something weirder if you get a specific mod)  which can be sent to town to sell all the junk you don't need - works great for a speedrun. All the levels are randomly generated (That's what makes any Hack'n'Slash game so unrepeatable and fun) and all the locations look great. Only issue is that weapons and abilities are bit unbalanced - dual wield is best, 2-hands suck. Graphics are simple but neat and remind me of Warcraft 3.			"

												Probably one of the best RPG games I've played. Much like Diablo, Torchlight brings forth a similar dungeon crawler play style with a third-person point and click system. However,unlike Diablo, the in-game system is much different. Take the fighting system for example, Diablo has a very straight forward story line. This requires the player to follow everything that is expected of them. In Torchlight, there are quests that can alter the path of the rest of the game. Character customization is huge in these types of games. Diablo forces you to choose from a few lousy skills, whereas in Torchlight, there is an abundance of spells and skills to choose from. I can probably rant for another few hundred words comparing the two games, but I don't want to denounce Diablo too much because I also play the Diablo series (or used to anyways). Although it says that I have 0 hours played on this account, I did play an insane amount of this game... Trust me, I'm a professional.			"

The gameplay... well, you pretty much just smash and inicerate all the foes on your way, collect new equipment (Most of which you sell - most of stuff you find is not worth equiping) and level your character, unlocking new abilities. These are real fun and different for all three classes. You also get a dog (Or cat, or something weirder if you get a specific mod)  which can be sent to town to sell all the junk you don't need - works great for a speedrun. All the levels are randomly generated (That's what makes any Hack'n'Slash game so unrepeatable and fun) and all the locations look great. Only issue is that weapons and abilities are bit unbalanced - dual wield is best, 2-hands suck. Graphics are simple but neat and remind me of Warcraft 3.			"

												Tight, clean and well made, it's a good game at first, with lots of action and nice details, but soon gets more repetitive than ""A-Team"" episodes. Nice for a pair of runs if you can get it cheap -or free.

												TORCHLIGHT on my scale gets a 7.5/10 this game is very nice the map systeam the low graphics allow lesser player to experience a game like diablo. for this review will have some comparisons with diablo but no game should be just like diablo.The storage system in this game amazes me the fact it doesnt have expansion but, it teaches you how to manage to give to another character.The stash and shared stash is something that also raised this game to my liking. So say you beat the game hurah! and u want to play on hard mode and not lose all your weapons there u go the shared stash will allow you to redo the game but keep ur kick butt weapons.Hud- well the hud i do not completely understand everytime i try to put an abillity inside it doesnt all i hv is a health potion an a pre-set abillity i dont even want! that plays a factor in the losing .5%.the fighting in this game is a little off perfect there is a bug that will make your character stand still and not move and you wont be able to drink a health potion either truly something the ruins the immersfulness of the game. lastly the pet, the pet u get is something that seperates the game from other you start off with this pet and hes with you all the time when ur in a sticking sitiuation your dog/cat/etc.. will come and save your butt. if you equip your pet right with the right spells it will help A-LOT.this game is something i play on the side but i will complete it i very much reccomend buying this game and once i get torchlight 2 i will review that thanks id you read this all.

												Probably the best Diablo 3 clone. Great gameplay, awesome soundtrack and evocative visuals make this game one of those you shouldn't miss if you're fan of the RPG genre. Really pays of for the money. Only downside is the fact game doesn't have multiplayer but sequel will have it for sure and it's comming out soon.			"

												It's a solid game. I really only have two gripes with it:1) Shooting up and down stairs is broken. (They fixed their math in TL2.)2) It's too long, given its repetitive nature! Seriously, it just goes on and on. Maybe some people like that, but at this point I'm grudgingly forcing myself to do just one more floor, just one more floor...But, like I said: overall, pretty solid.

I just don't find this type of game to be that much fun anymore. i will say that Torchlight is one of the best and both it and its sequel offer far more entertainment than Diablo 3. Visually, this game looks great. It has a charming world and great music. The entry price for this and Torchlight 2 makes these games a great value for fans of this genre.			"

												To be honest, I originally wanted this game to fill the void of Diablo, and it did that, somewhat, but I just can't process some of the absurdly streamlined mechanics, or the way that a single drop can leave you overpowered for the majority of the game.... So much so that fighting enemies is a lot less satisfying than it should be and making huge swaths of the game really boring click fests. Not super great imo.			"

												So I've played Diablo 3 a ton and wanted to check out Torchlight since all the D3 haters say this is the real Diablo. Wait, hold on... why is game even more colorful than D3, I thought it would be all dark and scary like Diablo. Also where's my god damned guided arrow, I'm an Amazon for christ's sake. Er, I mean... a Vanquisher. Oh well I guess this ricochet shot will do, and let's not forget to max the passive critical buff, criticals are awesome. Let's continue deeper down.Sigh. The bottom rows of my inventory is literally filled with potions, Identify and Town Portal scrolls and managing all of it is making me crazy. Like stacks of 20? Seriously? I know Diablo had it as well but that was not why I loved that game. Anyway, I ain't picking up more of that ♥♥♥♥. I'll just buy it from the vendor. If only my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat could teleport me back to town... I did teach him a friggin Town Portal spell after all. I mean what else is he supposed to do, he'll start fleeing immediately when engaged in combat.Um... why am I finding guns? This is not Dungeon Siege. Diablo had no guns. Oh great, now that I'm not picking up useless items anymore, I can't even see when I get rare or unique items because they're all hidden behind white trash and you need to be a surgical tech to pick them up. Honestly I can't even pick up what I want without picking up trash in the process so I'm just going to spam the click button.Yay, final boss time. I kinda rushed through the later game and I'm fighting him at level 25. Luckily I just got my raining arrow skill so I can kite him for 20 minutes while dying now and then, not that it matters cause I can be revived on spot. Okay dead. What the... the floor is getting flooded with hundreds of dragon corpses. This is weird. I guess it makes up for every annoying experience I've had with this game. Until next time.			"

Torchlight adds nothing new to an already stale genre.Pros: Graphics, Sound, ControlsCons: Story, GameplayTorchlight hits all the basics very well.  The graphics are varied and colorful, the sound and music are fitting and sharp, and the controls are simple and effective.Torchlight's story and gameplay, however, fall short.  Our hero will massacre thousands of creatures in order to save a couple of humans the trouble of moving.  The gameplay only matches the story's blandness.  Combat consists of clicking things, although this is par for the genre.  The leveling system offers too few new abilities or mechanics but instead too many stat dump options.  The loot system is largely irrelevant: equip anything with more stats, sell the rest.  The enemy variety means little after facing hundreds of the same things.Unfortunately, Torchlight never manages to shine with its nearly nonexistent story and boring gameplay.6/10			"

												Torchlight torchlight torchlight. I remember when this game first came out. Remember too? The graphics were just plain ugly even back then.Torchlight's history in short is that most of the Dev team worked on Diablo 1, 2 and every expansion in between. And that is exactly what makes Torchlight a complete failure.From the very first second I played it, I didn't like anything. The style, the visuals, the setting.... It feels rushed and unfinished. Normally I do a Pro v Con list but there are no Pros here, so here are just the worst things about Torchlight.- Linear Gameplay: I can't stress this enough, It may very well be the only thing that's absolutely wrong with this game but it's a big one. Ever played a 2D platformer, like Mario? Well that's just about as linear as you can get. Just go from start to finish, no deviation in between. To have something like that in a 3D game is... is...what? Why? But that's what Torchlight is, constantly. You go down and then you follow the path, follow it, kill every enemy you see and keep following the path.- Music: Well the town music is very similar if not the same as in Diablo 1 and 2. Because they hired the same guy to make the soundtrack. It shows, it isn't good. They probably thought that it'd be nice to have music that sounds the same as a far superior game. But by doing so, they hit the same note when an awful movie refers to a better movie during the movie.- Classes: Three character classes...? This is an RPG right? What kind of RPG only has 3 classes? Maybe Torchlight isn't the only one, but it should be. There really isn't an excuse for that, most RPGs already have the same classes over and over. But Torchlight takes the most generic 3 classes too, Melee Ranged and Wizard/SummonerNone of which are any fun while running towards the next level down.- Graphics: I'm not a graphic freak, I honestly don't care about them, choppy framerate? I'm probably the last person to notice, but these GFX?! No! Just no, why is everything squareish? Was the Dev team all like ""We need something round but a dodecahedron is easier to draw."" I don't think so, don't like itFinal verdict, Torchlight is nothing more than a Diablo clone. But I've played several clones in my day, this is by far the worst one. Torchlight feels like an empty vessel, like a game without a soul. It has no identity other than the one it tries to be. I heard that the sequel is far better.			"

												My opinion; better than Diablo 3. I liked Torchlight 1 a *little* more than this one, mainly due to a bit more freedom in customization. This game is a good grinding game, if you just want to zone out and use 4-5 buttons the whole time, this is it. Customization could definitely use some liberating, though.			"

												I believe the best description of Torchlight would be Diablo II for kids. I say this because many of the features, from the automap and music to the item sounds and classifications, are all evidence of the developers' previous works, which indeed includes Diablo II. I see this game as a kind of introduction to the type of game it is, whereas Diablo II is its apex. Despite my ""for kids"" label, this game is nevertheless fun and definitely worth playing. Coming from someone who has played Diablo II for years, this game constantly reminds me of its predecessor. If you like to play a Diablo II-like game, but without the dark, horror backdrop, this is a great game with which to begin your adventure.			"

												I enjoyed this to a point. It is basically a very poor shadow of Torchlight II, which to an extent is to be expected, but the gap in quality between the two games beggars belief. Characters don't amass enough potions or skills to make the game about anything except plugging away and resurrecting constantly because you can't stay alive with the tools you've got. What's worse, if you're fighting a boss and you die, choose to resurrect in town (because you inevitably have no health potions left), then try to take a Waygate back, getting back is a matter of complete luck. I fought my way through ten levels of the dungeon and then got to the very last level, just to die and have to go back to town, and then found I had to traverse all three dungeons again. This would have been annoying in any normal game, but in this game it was unbelievably, gut-wrenchingly painful, since all the dungeons were filled with monsters anew. Needless to say I used all my health potions just re-traversing them, and after half an hour of repeating what I had already done, gave up and never made it back to the final boss. I am counting this as clocked because it doesn't deserve any more of my time. I was so close to finishing and that would normally not be good enough for me, but under these circumstances, that's all I'm willing to concede.			"

												This game is pure hack 'n' slash, the gameplay mechanic is very simple, the story is also very insignificant and not engaging. The game is also short compared to other games like Diablo, but even so it gets a bit repetitive. The scenario changes after every 3-4 levels is what engages you back into the game, with new monsters, new art and new items. Overall I would say that this game is skippable.			"

It's pretty easy, basic hack and slash, but you only go in one dungeon the whole game.  I tend to like the exploration part of these types of games, so the fact that I just went further in the same dungeon was a little tedious.  There is no replay-ability for me here.			"

												It's a Diablo clone, or Action RPG grindathon is the technical term. Not exactly a Diablo II kind of experience though. Hell, it's made by the same designers and ♥♥♥♥, the soundtrack and effects will give you regular flashbacks to the Rogue Encampment.Nice little RPG experience if you're looking for one. Not the best though. Lacks multiplayer, look to the sequel for that. Story isn't worth a single comic book even.Play it if you're OCD, otherwise not missing a whole lot.7 / 12			"

												I am in no way a professional critic. But I had a very bad experience with this game and I do not think I am the only one with these problems:At first, the game would not load, I had to fiddle around with the options and such to get it to work. This took me two days to do.After that, I thought I was golden, there were not lag (big ones at least, my computer is not the fastest) no crashes, it worked well! Than, as I was going down some stairs, a sign poped up and read: ""Thank you for playing the demo of Torchlight! If you wish to continue, download/buy the full game online..."" I did not pay 16.99$ for a demo. I tried it again, and again and again. Same message, and after I clicked out of the message I was sent back to the start screen.This was discouraging and so I deleted the game. For some people, it might work, some it might not. I am more dissapointed than angry, as I can't be the only one who had this problem, and ended up with a demo instead of the actual game when I bought it. If you want to take the risk, go ahead, there are a lot of people who it worked just fine for, so I may just be unluckey, but as much as I enjoyed what I was able to play, I am not going to redownload it.

												I originally picked up Torchlight after being disappointed with Diablo 3. I must say, it's refreshing to have a game that rewards you for playing it. But only to a point, it seems. There's a lot to like here, but obviously it is a few years old now - it is still a fun dungeon romp to introduce you to the Torchlight universe.That said, the game gets fairly repetitive, fairly quickly. If you've played 20 levels of the game, you've played 100. That can be fine if the game kept mixing things up somehow - but theres not enough here to hold your interest.That combined with that it's a single player only experience? Don't bother. Torchlight stands as good game, but a game that is showing it's age. Pick up Torchlight 2 instead. I can't recommend Torchlight.			"

												Buy Torchlight 2, it gets rid of every single stupid thing the first one has and improves the gameplay to be a lot of fun!There is only one reason I do not advise you to purchase this game, and it is that when you seek to upgrade an item you like, you have a very high chance of clearing that item of all stats. It will say a 4 or 6% chance, but that is complete crap. When it says 4 or 6% its really like a 25 or 50% chance that your best item will become worthless. This may seem like a silly thing to give a bad review about, but getting new equipment and experimenting with the gameplay is half of the fun in a game that is not very hard.  In addition, if you want to fix your favorite item to be like it was by using a cheat, the game locks you from all of your other characters and literally lables you a cheat.Other than that the game is okay.

												Torchlight: a dull glowI played Torchlight way back when it first came out, circa 2009. I enjoyed it, but there were some things that just nagged at me while I played it. Unfortunately, the more I played it, the less I liked it. Going further and further into the game did not increase my enjoyment. And I ultimately stopped playing.Sadly that perfectly describes my most recent experience with Torchlight.I’ve tried to figure out just what it is that I don’t like, but every time I formulate my thoughts I come up with the same conclusion:The game feels hollow and generic.It doesn’t seem to have it’s own identity or stand out as unique from other games in the ARPG genre. Hell, Torchlight is essentially an “HD remake” of Diablo from 1996… without the “Hell.” The game follows the same basic progression and is, in many ways the same game, but with less of an edge.I feel that really hurts Torchlight.Plenty of games can be fun without a cool in-game world or a “gritty” story hook to pull you in. It’s gameplay that matters in the end, right? Sadly I think that Torchlight also falls flat here as well.Torchlight is pretty a pretty shallow game, to its detriment. Killing monsters is fun in its own right, but only for so long. Other ARPGs alleviate this by giving you things to work for: new more powerful items, more powerful skills, harder challenges, etc. Torchlight does have all of these things… they’re just not interesting. So although the game does have the “carrot on a stick” incentive to continue playing… I’m, sadly, not interested in the carrot.I found the gameplay to be rather lackluster and boring. Torchlight’s art style does not appeal to me. The environments lacked feeling, and ultimately felt sterile. The items in the game were shallow, and only the “unique” items had any flavor. The various character skills weren’t very impressive, and didn’t feel very powerful.But let’s break down the individual pieces of Torchlight and critique it against the five points I mentioned previously.Atmosphere and StoryAtmospherethe pervading tone or mood of a place, situation, or work of art.Torchlight has little to no atmosphere. Certain areas in the game look pretty darn cool, but carry absolutely no feeling.My favorite areas are a necropolis found underneath the mines beneath Torchlight (Yes, that’s the name of the town) and the underground jungle-temple ruins beneath the necropolis. Why I like these two areas over all the others? Probably because they have the most ‘flavor’. But even then it’s spread pretty thin.There isn’t much to be said about the game’s various locales other than that they don’t make much sense and require a bit too much suspension of disbelief for my taste.Storyan account of imaginary or real people and events told for entertainment.I consider story to be tied very closely with atmosphere, and like Torchlight’s atmosphere, there isn’t really much to be said about the story. It’s pretty generic and could be summarized in two sentences: “Torchlight was built over a corrupted source of magic caused by an ancient evil deep within the Earth. Go kill it.”More accurately: The town of Torchlight is mining a substance called Ember, which allows for the various forms of magic in the world, but it turns out the Ember under Torchlight is corrupt and will turn anyone who comes into contact with it evil! This is because the Ember Vein runs over an ancient evil, later revealed to be a dragon. You are called to Torchlight to help the mining operation, which is being attacked by monsters, but are promptly betrayed by the man who summoned you. As it turns out he wants to revive the dragon sleeping beneath Torchlight. And you, the hero, have to stop him by traveling deeper and deeper into the Earth uncovering older and older civilizations that fell to the corrupting allure of the Ember.Pretty good ideas! Not going to lie, there’s definitely a cool story in there. But it’s really only used as an occasional spur to remind you to continue murdering monsters as you travel what seems like miles into the earth. A shame, really.There is very little involvement in the story, and to be honest the voice acting is pretty hammy. If you like that sort of thing, then good on ya! I had to skip most of it.But hey, atleast you can skip it! Actually all of it! Which is nice.Enemiesthe persons who are actively opposed or hostile to someone or something.Unfortunately, the enemies in torchlight are boring. There isn’t any way around it. I don’t like their designs, and none of them really seem to have any interesting mechanics to differentiate them. They’re all just bigger and bigger punching bags. Some will revive their comrades, and some will leave noxious fumes after death. But by and large, the majority of them are meat sacks that fling their bodies against your weapons.It doesn’t help that the enemies have massive spikes in difficulty towards the end of the game. There is a LARGE increase in enemy health and damage in the last area. And every time I’ve played, it has come as a shock.I’ll be doing just fine, then I’ll walk into the last section of the game and be murdered. Only to find that I’m unable to deal significant damage to the enemies. Their scaling seems to be off, and it’s just not fun.Your Characterthe representation or expression of something in a tangible or visible form.Torchlight utilizes the typical stat system. Your RPG standards are all present: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Life, and Defense. Every time you level, the game gives you five points to allocate to each of these different parameters. Unfortunately it seems like the various stat points are really just a way of directing your progression. It didn’t seem as though loading a bunch of points into Magic made my Alchemist’s magic any more powerful, despite it being his main damage stat. It seemed as though it was just a holdover from previous games. “Diablo had them, so Torchlight will too.”Really the stats just felt like numbers I had to inflate in order to put on different armor. My character’s power seemed to be located in the weapons and armor he was wearing rather than the character himself.Skillsskill or expertise in a particular activity or fieldTorchlight also follows a rather traditional skill tree format, present in almost every ARPG. Ever.That’s perfectly fine. Skill trees are used so commonly because they work. Sadly, the skills in Torchlight are boring. Plain and simple. The coolest spells I got for my Alchemist were Chain Lightning and a laser. Everything else rather boring.I think that is was a major contributing factor to why Torchlight felt boring to me. The three different classes all had pretty boring skills. Nothing really stands out, and everything felt pretty lame.Itemizationthe balance and distribution of items, their types, and the various effects, powers, and statistics attached to themLast but not least, the items. Again, there isn’t a lot to say. Torchlight’s items were rather lacking. Most items are of the, “+10 fire damage,” “+20 lightning damage,” “+5% attack speed” variety. Nothing to write home about.This is probably the one aspect of the game where Torchlight tried its hardest to please me.I received about 7 unique items before reaching level 15. Unique items are Torchlight’s highest rarity item, apparently. They were all decent, and some of the unique wands I found had cool effects that altered combat, like shots bouncing and releasing arcs of electricity on the ground. But they were little more than more powerful versions of the base items. Not particularly exciting.Boring skills, boring monsters, boring items, boring combat.Very sad indeed.			"

												This game is about 10 hours too long. It was fairly entertaining at first, but constantly having to clear out my inventory soon became a tedious chore. The story and setting didn't do a good job of drawing me in - it felt like they weren't even trying. I was never really challenged to change up my play style - I basically got through the game spamming the same couple of attacks over and over, and had no major problems. The last boss took forever, and you'd think they'd at least throw in a decent ending after that, but no, just a quick ""thank you"" and you're unceremoniously dumped back into the world.I suppose overall it's fairly well made for what it is, so maybe I just don't like the genre, but for all the time it took, I never found it particularly rewarding, so I can't really recommend it.

												I'm giving this a thumbs down just because torchlight 2 is a far superior game. Don't waste your time with the first one.It's standard dungeon crawler fare but it's too simple, the class talent choices aren't meaningful enough, the loot is too generic and in general it's insanely easy. It's not bad but it's kind of bland. Torchlight 2 has way better classes, levels and loot. I admit I liked it when I played it at first but got bored and tried the sequel and now I realize how poor it is. It's kind of like eating at mcdonald's all your life thinking it's fine until someone introduces you to five guys.			"

												The Torchlight series is a kid-friendly version of Blizzard's Diablo series. However, I would not recommend this for Diablo fans. If you've already played the Diablo games, the Torchlight games present nothing new except make it more cartoony and accessible for younger players. If you want to play Torchlight, I would recommend skipping this game and just get Torchlight 2. Torchlight 2 has way more content and multiplayer. I found this game quite boring as a Diablo player.

												In Torchlight, you are drawn to a town, also called Torchlight, where a magical ore called Ember is mined. As you move down through the dungeon, you learn that Ember has a corrupting effect on any who use it, and has led to the downfall of a number of civilizations before yours. It's not the deepest story in the history of RPGs, but it is clear that the developers put real effort into it. The writing is miles better than that of many other hack & slash games I've played as well. The same can't really be said of the sidequests, which follow the exact pattern from Fate: your task is always to kill a specific boss and/or retrieve a specific piece of loot, with little real reason given. I don't think of this as a significant problem, though. Instead, I think it's pretty standard for action games.Torchlight may only be above average in the story department, but its gameplay is outstanding. It takes good ideas from the developers' previous games and improves on them in just about every way possible. There are three character classes (essentially, a barbarian, a ranged character, and a magician), each of which plays very differently from the others, and each of which can be viably developed in several ways as you level up. For example, my first character was a magician who focused almost entirely on summoning, similar to Diablo II's Necromancer. I could have put my points into casting spells, though, and been more similar to the Sorceress.Each class has three skill trees, although certain skills like ""ranged weapons mastery"" show up in the trees of all classes. I appreciated that, since I wanted my summoner to dual-wield pistols – something he's not necessarily good at by default. In addition, there are magic scrolls, found as loot or purchased, that allow you to teach certain skills to any character. I loved having that ability, because it allowed my barbarian to cast town portal spells and identify magical items; skills that many RPGs restrict to the magician class.In Torchlight, your character is constantly accompanied by a pet dog or cat. You can catch fish and feed them to your pet to change them (temporarily or permanently) into another animal/monster, and I was overjoyed to see that Torchlight doesn't make you waste inventory space on a fishing pole to do so. Your pet levels up along with you, and it can wear two rings and a necklace, which is nice. The pet also has an inventory, can be directed to pick things up, and can be sent back to town at any point to sell loot. Doing so really helps keep the game flowing because like any good hack & slash game, you'll pick up a lot of loot, and going back to town to sell it is annoying.Your pet doesn't just serve as a pack mule, though, or even as simply a meat shield. You can also teach it any of the spells learned from scrolls. It can only learn two spells, but the pet AI makes good use of whatever you give it. I liked my cat to be able to summon zombies and leech health from attacks, but a dog who can throw fireballs and heal the whole party sounds pretty awesome too.The main story takes you down through one long dungeon to a final boss battle, but once you've beaten it, a second, never-ending, randomly generated dungeon is unlocked where the monsters scale to your current level, so you can keep playing with the same character as long as you want. In addition, maps can be purchased from vendors that take you to shorter randomly generated dungeons. These serve as a nice break from the main storyline or even a place to grind for levels and loot if you ever find yourself in need of doing so. Interestingly, there are also random monsters called ""phase beasts"" that open a portal to a one-level dungeon when killed. Again, the only reason to go to these dungeons is to get loot and experience, but they seem to give good loot, so they are worth the time.There are a hundred other things I could talk about in terms of gameplay, but I won't. Instead, I'll limit myself to four brief things I can't leave out of my review. One: you can install gems in your equipable items, and when you're ready to upgrade something, you can destroy the gems and keep the item or vice versa. I would have loved this in Diablo II, where I agonized over actually using all of those runes I collected. Two: each character has their own inventory, their pet's inventory, a private stash in town, and a stash that they share with all of your other characters. If you love to hoard items, this is a dream come true, because it makes passing items between characters and creating ""mule"" characters a breeze. Three: Torchlight is designed to make modding easy. It's reportedly a piece of cake to create mods, and I can confirm that it takes almost zero effort to install them. There are a lot of mods out there, and they range from the classic ""I'm lazy, so I'll break the game's balance"" to simple, but really nice, things like changing the opacity of the mini-map. I even installed a mod that unlocks a ferret as a third pet option. Four: when you look at weapons in your inventory, you're shown their attack speed and the damage they do, but you're also shown their DPS (damage per second), which is a huge help when deciding whether to trade up to a new weapon.There is one thing missing in Torchlight's gameplay, though: multiplayer. I rarely play games online, so I didn't miss it, but I know that this may be a deal-breaker for some gamers. It stands up very well as a single-player experience, though, so if you're interested in this kind of game, I'd urge you to give it a shot despite that lack.Graphically, Torchlight made me very happy as well. It's not that this is the prettiest game you'll ever see, because it's no Crysis. It's that it looks great on even a lousy setup like mine. There's even a ""netbook"" mode to allow machines even weaker than mine to play.The game really does look good. Spell effects are plentiful, and weapons that do elemental damage throw the appropriate sparks, flames, or snow. The environments are rendered in full 3D, and use the classic overhead isometric camera. Like any game with that camera, it has to deal with the issue of environmental elements getting in the way, and Torchlight's solution is to render a sort of x-ray version of the character. Friends are blue, enemies are red, which really helps. Stylistically, it falls halfway between Fate and Diablo II.This game sounds great, both in terms of music and sound effects. Certain sounds are almost identical to their Diablo II counterparts, but that is so common in this type of game that I find it hard to criticize. My only true complaint is that when your pet gets injured, they whine, which can be annoying if they're surrounded by a huge pack of enemies.Torchlight controls very simply, but in a good way. You click on the ground to move or on enemies to attack them, and I like the fact that it's fairly forgiving. If you are pretty close to an enemy when you click, you'll attack, which really helps when dealing with fast-moving enemies. Skills, scrolls, and potions can be assigned to slots for the 1-0 buttons on your keyboard. You can equip two sets of weapons and switch between them at any time by pressing W, which came in handy for me on many occasions. Buttons are assigned to your inventory, your skill tree, etc., but they're easily accessible through on-screen icons as well. It isn't groundbreaking, it's just a good implementation of tried-and-true controls.In the broadest terms, there are two ways to make a great game: do something cool that hasn't been done before, or do a great job of improving on things that have been done before. Torchlight falls pretty firmly in the second category, but that doesn't make it any less great.Highly Recommended "

												From under an hour of playing Torchlight I got tired of it. I played FATE a long time ago, and playing this felt simply like FATE with better graphics and a different inventory setup. Literally every other aspect of the game felt the same, from the level setup, to the town, to the pet companion and its behavior to the color and naming scheme on items.No doubt if you've never played a game like this, Torchlight could be fun, but it just feels like the same game to me.It's too bad; I wanted to like it.

												Torchlight is a 3d hack-and-slash modeled after games in the Diablo series. If you’re not familiar with that, it’s basically a lot of left clicking, dungeon roaming, and loads of looting. It’s hard to talk about this game without referencing Diablo, as even the music seems like it was pulled straight from that game and the visuals are reminiscent of the third game with their vibrant colors and auras.Torchlight adds to the familiar mechanic by giving you a pet that acts as both a defender and pack mule, able to be sent back to town to sell all your loot at a moment’s notice leaving you to continue looting and pillaging. There’s also a fame system that acts as a second “experience” meter and gives you a skill point for every level you gain in addition to skill points given by actual experience levels. Unfortunately, this game lacks a sense of excitement regarding gear. Frequently on my play-through I would see unique and set items drop, giving me a momentary rush that was quickly extinguished upon identification. It’s sad to say that I ended up simply buying and enchanting the majority of my gear in town, meaning the dungeon crawl was more of a means of gathering gold and experience to fuel my character development topside. It was about 20 or so hours before I finally got my first decent weapon drop…from the game’s final boss. The only use for it then was to do the infinite dungeons the game offers afterwards. Since Torchlight has no multiplayer, there was nobody to show the cool weapon to either. Some other grievances: the storyline isn’t particularly engaging and the bosses are barely memorable save for the one that caused tremors and the big bad at the end. The game also has an issue with the Z-axis and projectiles in many levels, making your attacks hit stairways and ramps inconsistently, even when you directly target an enemy (this is incredibly annoying). Lack of multiplayer was a serious oversight IMO as the thing I remember the most with the very first Diablo game was hundreds of hours spent playing alongside friends and randoms online. Torchlight isn’t a terrible game, but it’s not really good enough for me to recommend when there are so many other games around that do the same thing way better. "

												Don't get the appeal of this game at all. It's a dungeon crawler with random loot generation ala Borderlands. Very little story or character development, which is fine if the combat mechanics are there. Unfortunately, they're not. This is a left-click-fest of the worst kind.			"

												Without a story, an RPG is just lots of clicking. And in this case, picking up inventory that you can't use.

												The ONLY reason I do not recommend Torchlight is because TL2 is out. TL2 has improved on everything I saw in my limited time with this game.

												Really monotonous from start to finish, the story was incredibly boring and so was the combat. The game is literally just running through a 30 floor dungeon while killing everything with one (mouse) button. Has none of the charm that the games in the genre usually have, upgrading gear isn't at all satisfying and doesn't change the game at all from start to finish. There are more spells, but there's really no point when you can just click fireball through the whole game and kill everything and drink a potion once in a while. Mainly played through to find out why everyone praises the game and it was nothing to write home about. Only way I got through it was by watching Family Guy on secondary screen while playing.			"

												Torchlight is bizarre in that it introduces a lot to the genre that is very convenient (larger inventories and smaller items, shared character stashes, minimizing town runs to the bare minimum), but the entire game is anemic to the point of boredom. At least, until the last five floors, when the game suddenly shifts to impossibly cheap. The lack of online play is only the beginning of this game's baffling flaws. It lays the groundwork for the genre's future, but is not a good game at all.			"

												Okay so I bought and played this game. After that process I cannot recommend this game. I know that TL2 is out, but I always like to experience the first in the series before playing the others. TL is a game that would suit youngsters that don't have access to the internet and do not have the ability to play WOW. To all others unfortunately in the current tiem i would advise to get TL2 and avoid this complete diablo clone with WOW visuals....even the music in TL has been completely copied to this game. My guess is this is a diablo mod with new WOW skin and package as an entirely different game. NO! It sounds, plays and acts just like diablo even down tot he narration. had this game came out in 2004 it would of been great as an alternative to WOW, but sadly this is lil too late and retro won't even save it.My biggest gripe is not the game, but the recent critics that reviewed this as decent.....yeah maybe 8-10 years ago!!! Seriously!!! Even @ $15 I can only recommend this game to toddlers that wanna play WOW but arent allowed. TL2 now that's a different story, OH well you live and you learn. ""I will say one thing about TL1; it's not horrible and there is alot worse out there, it's just why did the devs have to xerox diablo?

												A good first attempt at a Action RPG but just does not excell at anythingGenre: Diablo clone/action RPGYea! -Cartoonish art direction is nice.-Pet companion is useful.-Decent story- Nice varitiy of enviromentsMeh!-Combat feels extemely slow and simple comapred to Diablo 3.Not much in the terms of equipment stats variation means you could use same piece of gear for quite a long time. -Not much depth, basically you spam most powerful attack and potion when needed from start to end, there is no need to change tactics at allBleh!: -The last boss is nothing but a test of patience then skill, has too much health and takes quite a long time to windle down as you run circles around him popping potions.-Even though you have quite a few skills to learn, expect to only use 1 or 2 and ignore the restLowdown:Torchlight at release before D3 would of been the goto game but after the release it just seems average. Combat seems like it takes forever and needs no real type of skill. You expect a dungeon crawler where the main premise is to keep upgrading gear to get better but Torchlight seems to fail at this as new gear for my character came far and few between. I ended up ending the game with a level 10 piece of gear at level 36 because it had better stats then anything i could find. At least your pet can hike this stuff back to town to vendor for you, giving him more then the benefit of a lowly ai companion And last the final boss was a letdown due to the fact that he is easy to deal with but the devs just gave him absurd amounts of health that took a long time to windle down. The game does offer great art style that is pleasing to the eyes and never gets dull as the enviroment changes often. 2.5/5**From what I heard TL2 improves on a lot that made this game average so it is best to go for that instead of this one if you want a Diablo 3 alternative**			"

												Reviewing Torchlight is a tough one for me. It’s not a buggy game, everything works very efficiently, and the graphics and sounds have a clear unity to them. But I will never ever touch to this game again if possible. It doesn’t have any charm, the setting is dull beyond all belief, the identity it tries to build falls flat, the combat is exhaustingly boring, and the item hoarding reached its new pointless peak. Like I said there’s a unity to the graphics but they possess no appeal whatsoever. They’re just there. They don’t add anything to the game — certainly not atmosphere. Everything looks like a kiddy cartoon and strips the experience from any emotion there was left. You never find anything useful in the dungeons. I bought everything I used and only gathered stuff to sell it. The spells are useless. I wanted a mage but ended up using the special skill that by the way don’t get bonuses from your skills that you can level up. The levels are so repetitive that I barely noticed when their themes changed. The general jist of it was: switch the doodads around a bit and put up different color wallpapers. Then there are the end bosses which bring the word “boring” to a new level. It’s just running and grinding. For minutes. Or in the case of the final boss possibly HOURS (I can’t know for sure because I had to use cheat codes to get through it before I fell asleep). This game does so many things wrong that it doesn’t deserve any sort of recognition. It is just horrible.			"

												Torchlight is a fairly mediocre diablo-like. I haven't played much of the diablo games so I would take this review with a grain of salt. I may just not like the genre. The levels feel bland, similar, and uninspiried. The characters felt different, but it seemed that all of them mostly ended up just pressing on of a few buttons until an enemy died. To be honest, it reminded me of the worst parts of playing WoW: Boring grinding and sorting through loot.If you could get this for very cheap, I could see you getting your money's worth, but with Torchlight 2 already out, I think I would have to recommend picking that up instead.

												If ever there was a game that was overrated it would probably be the first Torchlight.People would say things like ""If you liked Diablo then there is nothing to dislike about Torchlight"" while completely ignoring that even the first Diablo had multiplayer and Torchlight does not.Torchlight has another problem where moreso then most games I've played with RNG loot like this, I seem to always be using gear that is at least 10 levels below my level because everything that drops is worse then what I already have. At about the halfway point in the story I had to rely on purchasing items from the Weaponsmith whenever something decent would show up, because all the loot seems to suck.At the end of the day, if you want to play a game like this you're probably better off getting the sequel or looking elsewhere entirely.

												This is a truly brilliant game for grinding. It has so much grinding in it, the publishers had better sell a physical version packaged with grindstones.On the other hand, if you prefer grinding, this game also has something for you. For instance, I tried placing a handful of black peppercorns on my desk while playing, and guess what - 3 hours later I found them ground to dust, perfect for cooking! Amazing!For the extreme gamers among us: you like listening to grindcore while grinding? With this game, you no longer need to! You immediately reach equivalent amounts of adrenaline and dopamine just by firing up the game. And when you start playi--sorry, grinding--oh boy, oh boy, the joy, the brain ground into nirvana!Last but not least, Torchlight II is a great continuation of the grind included herein, so your grinding in the first Torchlight will have its well-deserved sequelae of repetitive grind in the second.Can only recommend this to any and all grinders.

												I was allover this game on the 360, and jumped ship to Torchlight 2 on here. When you return to Torchlight from Torchlight 2, you'll see how good a game Torchlight actually is compared to it's successor.If you ever if have a few bucks laying around, get this game. The cheaper it gets, the more awesome the deal with this title. It already is a good buy at the going rate though.Great game. Cynics might call it a poor man's Diablo 3.

												Playing through as an Arcane Alchemist on Normal, I was enjoying myself for the first 8 hours. The next 8 hours after that, it became clear that if I wanted to progress at a reasonable rate, I would have to do some grinding. In a game that I actually like, grinding would be acceptable even though I think it's a stupid way for someone to progress in a game. Torchlight's endgame was complete garbage and I would not recommend this game to anyone. There are numerous problems with the spellcasting in this game like: not being able to cast up/down stairs properly, not being able to cast depending on what hand your casting from when there's a very small and almost non-existent object next to you, having to wait between casts (meaning if you want to drink a potion, do a buff, then cast, you have to wait until each animation is completely finished before you can do the next. This makes intense combat scenarios extremely annoying to get through when you have to shuffle between these things) and so much more. I could complain about this all day but I'll just end it here.Torchlight is not fun, it's annoying (as said before.) I beat the game and I'm obviously salty as all hell, but I had to get this out. Stay away from this trash heap of an RPG.			"

												Very basic Diablo clone with childish graphics and no atmosphere whatsoever that can be fun—for the first few hours anyway.The first few hours are quite fun due to its basic structure, which is very like the first Diablo (single town with a dungeon under it).  It can be addictive building up your character, and the game provides a decent amount of ways to power up outside of simply gaining levels.  You can attach gems to equipment, try to have equipment enchanted (and risk having all enchantments removed), and buy random equipment that could turn out to be enchanted.Unfortunately, there are way too many things holding this game back.First, the graphics and atmosphere.  It was designed to run on netbooks so the graphics are very simple.  That doesn't bother me so much... but the cartoony exaggerated look that couldn't be more generic means you'll be playing this for the mechanics only (more on that later).  The music, composed by the guy who did the music for Diablo 1 & 2, is just alright.  It sounds a lot like Diablo, but not nearly as good as Diablo.Second, the itemization is poor.  I found my best equipment not even halfway through the game on Hard.  Outside of finding rings that would give me +8 Dex vs +6 Dex, I had basically the same equipment loadout for the last 6 hours or so.  Nothing that dropped even came close to what I already had.Third, the dungeons are dull and feel way too long.  You have a mine, spooky castle, lava place, spookier castle.  That's about it.  The layouts are randomly assembled from larger pieces, but there is nothing whatsoever interesting.  Other than randomly coming upon merchants and bosses, there is nothing to look forward to or be surprised by as you explore.  Some unique hand-crafted rooms or levels or something would have gone a long way.  You have to go through 35 of these to beat the last boss, and once the item drops got boring so did the rest of the game.Fourth, the enemy variety is awful.  You typically have 2-3 enemy types per level.  Usually a small fast monster that just charges at you, an archer or wizard hanging back shooting spells, and a big tough monster that slowly comes after you.  That is basically it.  Each type of enemy will have some unique abilities (such as ""shoots fire"" or ""stun resistant"") but most of it is window dressing.  The bosses are just HP-inflated monsters that summon minions over and over.Fifth, the game is way too easy.  Diablo clones need to strike a good balance between being difficult and unfair, and need to give you access to skills and tactics that let you push the odds in your favor.  The only time I had any difficulty here (note: I played on Hard, which I know is code for ""Normal"" in this game) was in the last couple levels where they would routinely spawn demons that could basically instantly drop a two-hit kill spell on me.  If you die you can resurrect in town with no penalty, resurrect at the start of the level with some gold missing, or resurrect in place with a gold and exp penalty.  So in other words, there is really no penalty for dying, and once I learned that I totally lost interest in the game.All in all, a skeleton of a decent Diablo clone is here (as Torchlight II would go on to prove), but considering the competition (including the original Diablo which has actually aged remarkably well), Torchlight is a hard game to recommend to nearly anyone.

												Everything about this game is repetitive:  the music, the sounds, and the combat.

												From the developers of Diablo 1 and 2 comes this amazing game! It's basically Diablo 2.5 with many improvements. One of which is that your pet has its own inventory space and on command-can run to town, sell those items, and return to you with the gold! There is also a specialized chest in town which you can share items with all your profile characters - a mechanic all RPG fans have been waiting for!This game also supports many good mods that are Runic-approved with the mod editor ""Torchleech"".The main downside to this game is the lack of multiplayer. Runic made this game only single player so they could cut back on developement time and release a game early, Runic states that the next Torchlight game will have co-op, and a future vision of an MMORPG. Also the fishing mechanic is lacking, there is a mod to add a fish vendor in town.I highly recommend this game, especially to all Diablo fans.			"

												A pure-blooded rouge-like from the original developers of the Diablo franchise. Torchlight blends a light-hearted, painterly visual style with hack-and-slash dungeon crawling. From a gameplay perspective it's almost too similar to it's spiritual predecessor Diablo, but it introduces a healthy collection of additions to make dungeon crawling smoother and easier for new players while still providing players seeking hardcore challenges a lot of meat to chew on. On top of that the game also has built-in support for a wealth of free community made mods that can add in new characters, classes, spells, items, pets, monsters, dungeon elements, and more at any time. You can even make your own mods if you're feeling industrious, the game comes with the same full featured mod making utility that the developers used to make the entire game.			"

Each of the 3 classes has its own refreshing playstyle and talents, but they can be as similar as you want depending on your build. The archer class /can/ use wands, though not as good as  the wizard. If you really want to stab things as a wizard, its an option though the warrior is better at it.

												A modern take on the original Diablo that manages to improve the action-rpg formula in several ways: rapid leveling, free gem removal with no chance of failure, a transforming minion who can help carry loot and even return to town and sell it for you, fishing; the list goes on.Highly recommended to anyone who doesn't demand that their action-rpgs include  a multiplayer component.

												A nice and simple Diablo I and II clone, more parts from Diablo I than II in my eyes but also ten times as good  as Diablo I in my eyes.Viceral combat and some nice additions to the Diablo style of games such as pets, fame and a retirement system that replaces the re-run Normal, Nightmare, Hell style from Diablo II, and you can also pick your own difficulty setting! No need to start on ""easy"" and work your way to a challange, just start with it from the get go.			"

												I put plenty of hours into Diablo 2, this game fills that little void left over for me from Diablo 3. I feel like this game gives to you, where Diablo 3 gives a bit of a harder challenge and punishes you. I feel they are two different beast so I'd recommend both! I would suggest buying Torchlight one and two for supporting runic games and there hard work to please the fans missing Diablo 2. Oh and mods and extra classes give you that extra content for free without buying a expansion that is the cost of a whole new game -.-			"

												This is as close to a single-player Diablo-clone as you can get. Even the music in TL echoes the somber tone of Tristram from the first Diablo.Torchlight gives you constant incentive and reward for playing [ie. levelling up every ~10 minutes, finding new loot, etc.]. It's truly addicting.And when you're finished the main game, there are tons of mods to explore that provide new classes to play, pets to raise, and loot to plunder.			"

												It's a cute little Diablo / Fate clone with WoW-like graphics.  The battles are visceral enough to keep you hungry for blood, and the levels are fun to explore.  Socketing and customizing weapons is the center focus, while your character only changes looks based on what armor they're currently wearing.  I'm a big customization guy and not being able to customize your toon bummed me out.  The story is minimal, and the starting town full of NPCs is boring, making you disregard them to the point of not caring about their lives or stories.  Overall, For the price it's pretty fun, but not playing it won't have you missing out on anything.  It's a casual game for casual players.			"

Loot, monsters, quests, gems, you name it Torchlight has it. Torchlight 2 is coming out soon and it'll expand on the Torchlight game and add multiplayer. This will surely give Diablo 3 a run for it's money at a cost of only $20!I'd definitely look for a copy of this game and give it a go. You won't be disappointed.			"

Everyones problem with this game is that its only single player.  Part 2 will be and looks way better.

												It's been years since Diablo II left a dungeon-crawling hole in most of our lives. Torchlight fills that void nicely. While there are only a few classes to choose, the dungeon themes repeat, and you'll see the same monsters over and over, the game manages to have more than enough variety to keep you entertained and digging for hours, days... you'll be surprised how much time you've sunk into discovering the secrets of the ember-filled caverns below the town of Torchlight.The only major drawback is a lack of multiplayer, which is outright criminal. Supposedly there's mods out there in the internet aether that allow friends to cavern-dive together, but it's not immediately obvious how to get that running.Pros: Great dungeon crawler, keeps pulling you back in for ""just one more level""Cons: No multiplayer (without modding), things will get a bit repetitive during long sessionsVerdict: Well worth the money, even at full price.

While this type of game has been done so many times before, Torchlight manages to get it pretty smoothly done. While it's no Diablo it's enough of a dungeon smasher to keep interest for a bit. Customization is there, combat is fun enough, and the dungeons are randomly generated - that being said, I feel like story line is almost nonexistant. I know I don't pay attention to it anymore, anyway. There's also a shared chest between your characters which makes it easy to twink up different characters quickly (a plus or a minus). Overall probably one of the best options until Diablo III comes out.			"

												Really fun, fast paced ARPG. Would recommend it, although if you've been playing PoE you'll want to set the difficulty to Hard or Very Hard so that it won't be a total breeze for you. I beat the game my first time on Hard.			"

												Amazing game. It is much like Titan Quest or Diablo I/II/III. Highly recommend if you like RPGs. The only downside is there are only 3 classes, and there is not as much class customization like Titan Quest. On the plus side, there is a great and interesting story and neat side-quests.

												Torchlight is pretty much a clone of Diablo 2 and similiar games but with a more cartoonish style. You start in a town and work your way deeper and deeper into the ruins underneath the city, finding treasure, beating monsters in randomly generated levels. Every now and then you head back to the surface to buy new stuff, get skills and spells or do sidequests to gain experience points.It's overall a decent game if you like dungeon crawler. As for me, i quickly lose interest, the repetetive nature of these games isnt my cup of tea.			"

												EDIT: Now that Torchlight 2 has released, I figured I should put a little update to this. This game still shines just as much as I wrote previously.. and if you like it, you should definately pick up the second game! So much more was added and it still retains all the things I loved from the first.OLD REVIEW: This is one of the best dungeon-crawlers I have played to date.  I like this game more than I like Diablo and Champions.  It is fresh, and since it is made by most of the original Diablo 2 team, they know what they are doing and they give players a game worth investing in.  Unlike most other dungeon-crawlers, this games only drawback is there is no multiplayer for it (but Torchlight 2 will be).  The story is good, graphics are pretty, and there are tons of levels to explore and monsters to vanquish.  The game supports fan-made mods, and so there is a ton of extra content you can get, varying from different classes, pets, items, levels, etc. I love it more than a fat kid loves pie.			"

												I got into this game not too long after Diablo 3 came out. I was originally playing that, but the servers were such a nightmare that I gave up. I went looking around and came across this game. This game is a good substitute to Diablo 3. I would even go so far as to say that it is better than Diablo 3. Sure the fact that it isn't always on DRM is pretty awesome, but the game is just generally more fun to play. It isn't as complicated as older Diablos, and I never really found this game to be difficult, but I have a real soft spot for it.One of the best things about this game is the pet system. It is so satisfying to be able to go into a dungeon, pick up every bit of loot, and when my bag is full I can just send my cat back to town to sell it off. I love that I barely spent time in town while playing this game, and when I was in town it was because I purposefully chose to go back on my own.Probably the thing that holds this game back the most is that choices are pretty limited. There are only three playable characters, and the skill trees aren't all that robust. The magic system is cool, but it's a bit annoying to have to switch out scrolls all the time. If you're looking to replace Diablo 3 this is a good choice. It might not have the shine of the other one, but it has more heart and it is more fun to play. Plus the sequel is even better than this one.			"

												Torchlight is an action-RPG that is very similar to Diablo, which is to be expected as much of Runic's team is comprised of people from Diablo II's development team.  Choose from one of three classes and delve into the increasingly perilous depths beneath the little mining town of Torchlight.  As action-RPGs go, Torchlight isn't overwhelmingly complex, but is fun to play and has a large variety of enemies, items and abilities.  It also introduces a pet system akin to that found in Fate, giving the player a furry companion who will fight alongside you, carry items for you and even return to town with them to sell them.  As a purely single-player experience, it's a very solitudinous game, but if you are a fan of action-RPGs and want to sink a few hours loot-collecting and level-grinding, Torchlight is the perfect game for you.

												Torchlight is a nice change of pace from the Diablo series. As a clone, as everyone else will state, it holds up as a great clone to Diablo. It's a milder environment to Diablo which is actually a refreshing change of pace. Instead of always being gloomy it has lots of color and different environments. It has some annoying characters like Diablo but nothing overbearing (like the Dungeon Hunter series).What I love. The ability to send a pet back to town with your loot to sell and not have to worry about town porting over and over. Also, pets, love the pets. I wasn't big on the fishing aspect of the game but loved having a pet around me. I also love the thriving community of modders and the ease of applying mods to the game.What I don't like. I wish I had more control over the character customization and appearance. Thankfully we do have some mods that allow visual skin changes. I have my alchemist set with a black goatee. But it would be nice to choose the sexe of your role. This was a limitation in Diablo too until Diablo III but still something that bugs me.I've tried out all 3 roles and enjoyed each. My favorite is the alchemist but there is something for everyone. Highly recommended.			"

A gorgeously presented solo-diablo clone extraordinaire, this (along with it's sequel which will have multiplayer and is still in the works) should tide you over until diablo 3 is finally released....sometime around DOOMSDAY :(			"

												This is a Diablo clone, made by some of the original developers of that series. It retains the former's loot hunting addictiveness while introducing new and innovative features that gives it its own unique feel.The simple cartoony graphics might be abit of a turn off, but the true gem lies in its excellent gameplay. Controls feel tight and smooth, and the pet system lets player focus more on dungeoning and reduces mundane resupply town trips.Music is very good and is very musically similar to familiar Diablo tunes. Playtime was about 20 hours. It even allows modding for you to fully customize it to your personal tastes.Downsides, the major glaring flaw is the lack of a co-op mode. There are no ingame method of reassigning key bindings and the actual story isn't anything special. None of these flaws however take away from the good points of this game.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Definitely worth it if you are a fan of the Diablo series or Action RPGs. Don't miss it.			"

												I can't recommend Torchlight enough.  It's a action rpg, similar to Diablo. There are 3 different classes and each has several customization options within branching skill trees. There is also a ton of equipment to find and specialize. You even get a pet to accompany you that can help fight, cast spells, and carry loot back to the surface to sell so you don't have to keep going back and forth.Torchlight 2 will be coming out in 2011 and will have multiplayer capabilities. So get your training in and look for Torchlight on Steam; it goes on sale every so often for $5-10.			"

												This is a charming, modernized spin off the Diablo 2 style of gameplay. If you were a fan of Diablo 2, chances are you will have no trouble deriving enjoyment from this game. It's all third person perspective with random loot and other roleplaying elements to give this game enhanced replayability. The storyline may come to an end, but the game itself is infinite. The dungeon generates an unlimited number of levels which make it possible to play this game continuing the adventure indefinitely. This isn't a game that competes well with other modern titles which offer more originality and hardware intensive graphics, but it was well worth the cost and won't soon be forgotten.			"

Hundreds of enemies that die in a torrent of clicks. Scrolls. Health and magic potions. Quests. Leveling. Loot. More loot.Diablo is the obvious comparison you could draw with this combat-heavy RPG, but Torchlight is more than a clone. This is like a super-clone with psychic powers. Choose a character. Choose a companion cat or a dog. Enjoy a quaint cutscene, and then wonder where your evening went.With Torchlight 2 on the horizon, and Diablo 3 even further down the line- enjoy this game as your go-to clicky-looty-action-rpg.

												Torchlight is a cool simple RPG that has a slight feel of Diablo (every level deeper just gets harder and harder, and there's a central town to do your inventory/customization stuff) but with graphics and characters/enemies that resemble Warcraft.  The classes are good and there's a decent amount of tinkering you can do with items and spells.  The first play through may seem easy but after that you can start fighting harder enemies and challenges.It's a good alternative RPG to try out!  You've got a typical fantasy RPG story with it.			"

												If for some reason you've never played Blizzard's renowned Diablo franchise and have wondered about the fuss surrounding Diablo 3, look no further than Torchlight to answer your questions.Runic Games consists of former Blizzard employees who worked on Diablo 2. As such, it should come as no surprise that the two games are extremely similar. Unfortunately, Torchlight has a few flaws that limit its potential:Repetition. Maybe I've outgrown the dungeon crawler genre, but I couldn't shake the tediousness half way into Torchlight's 12 hour campaign. Gameplay is primarily mouse clicking and neither the enemies nor environments were varied enough to keep my interest.The lack of multiplayer severely diminishes replay value. It's generous of the developers to add an infinite dungeon, but why should the average player care when he can't flaunt his spoils or successes?I do applaud Runic's inclusion of an editor, allowing fans to prolong the life of Torchlight. Kudos to that!Grade: B-			"

I like the idea of having a pet that can take extra inventory back to town to sell, but I have noticed, that if I don't turn in a quest as soon as completing it, I might not be able to complete the next quest item if I already completed that dungeon floor.  This might mean that will have to restart my game, which is ok as I'm just beginning.Overall, an enjoyable game!			"

												If you love action / hack'n'slash RPGs (and are old enough to remember) and prefer Diablo I to Diablo II and want some new thrill - don't skip Torchlight. Many games have tried and all have failed to extract the essence but Torchlight could successfully become the spiritual breed of Diablo. Among an ample of cool things in game mechanics, balance and combat system that is newly oldish, having just the perfect balance, you will find one of the key elements that Diablo I and II had but III did not: master composer Matt Uelmen who single handedly created the atmosphere here with his amazing tracks. Not as if GFX were on the weak side, they are just a little easy, cartoony and cheery for Matt's heavy and dark sonic texture - but that's just me, you can't go wrong with the game itself, it feels, plays and looks cool. It is like a little ninja among the 10+GB sized games: nimble, tiny (600MB or so installed) and very stabile. I played it on XP32, XP64 W7 and W8 and it worked perfectly on all the systems, not a single freeze, glitch or hiccup whatsoever. I guess, developers put an extra emphasis on bugfree coding. It plays extremely solid.Alsolutely recommended.			"

												Lots and lots of clicking. Lots and lots of random dungeons. This game is really good, as you essentially hack and slash through multitudes of dungeons, all with different scenarios and art styles. You get quests where you then venture into the dungeons and grab what you need, or even just kill X amount of things. Many things drop a variety of items, from scrolls, maps and spells to weapons and armor which you can then sell. Good game.			"

												Yes, it is a Diablo clone, but a good one at that. The graphic style is redolent of Warcraft 3/World of Warcraft, in fact some weapons seem to be a 1:1 copy. Yet Torchlight succeeds in having its own idenity. Combat is fast paced and fun, and the higher difficulties are giving me a good challenge. There are 3 distinctive classes (Rogue, Wizard and Barbarian) who in turn each have 3 different talent trees - so replayability should be ensured.I got the game for free by pre-purchasing Torchlight 2 for 20 bucks, a no brainer.

												Torchlight does not f**k around. It’s a simple hack n’ slash loot fest of a game, not trying to do too much but what it does do it executes perfectly and with precision. Designed by a team of veteran action RPG developers, it’s the kind of game you sit down to play for ten minutes in the evening and then all of a sudden you’re late for work in the morning. It’s a hyperactive, quick rewarding, tight production, that will get you blasting goblins like a Skinners pigeon in order to get that next unique item.			"

												PROS:- Three solid classes- You can equip anything on anyone- You got a familiar with you- Your familiar has travelling pouches strapped on, which means you can send him to the store to sell excess items!- You can equip a few pieces of equipment on your pet, and magic as well- Passive skills can be obtained (so if you're like me, you'll prefer those to manual skills)- You have multiple difficulty levels to choose from- You can also select Hardcore mode, meaning you pick any difficulty plus hardcore (this means death is permanent)- Auto save (saves to Steam and locally)- Enemy deaths are permanent (for the most part)- Mods are available, yay!- Mod editor available (I haven't tried it though. Library --> Tools ---> Torchlight Editor)CONS:- Only three classes to choose from- Character customization in the beginning is very restrictive- Skills and so on are very limited- Magics are very restrictively used. You can only equip a limited amount- Part of the storyline is confusing- Story could have been better plotted- Only around 25 hours of gameplay- Only 3 main characters + 3 secondary characters + the townspeople/miners and salesmen- Music is not horrendous, but uninspired and makes gamplay somewhat boring			"

												Opinion: worth every cent of the $15 I paid originally, but on sale for less than $4? Buy this game! For that price I bought one as a gift and one for myself even tho I already have the game on disk with >L50 hero. The convenience of having it on Steam where I can play from any of the 3 computers I have access to is solid gold!Rating: 9/10.If you liked Diablo 1/2/3, you'll really enjoy TL! Looks like, plays like, and feels just like Diablo but with a pet (which gives you more inventory space, a way of getting rid of excess inventory without leaving the dungeon, as well as having another body to fight along with you)!Standard choices of hero: barbarian (melee), rogue (ranged), and magician (alchemist) altho you can customize all of these by using skill points to increase strength, dexterity, magic, and defense. Upgrade system for your armor or weapons by enchanting and socketing gems (""embers"") just like Diablo. These gems can be refined to higher grades of purity, giving better bonuses to your armor or weapons. Also a way of recovering either the gem or the socketed item without harm, but you have to sacrifice one or the other.Tons of loot generated with no (white), one (green), or more buffs (blue), along with unique (orange) and set (purple) items that when matched to other items of that same set, give additional buffs to your hero.Randomly generated levels so each playthru is different, giving unlimited replayability. Excellent game with the best of Diablo mechanics, wrapped in smooth visuals and seamless gameplay. 5 stars! Buy this game!			"

												Torchlight is a delightful singleplayer game than will have you playing just-one-more-level till 3am.Mixing the artwork from World of Warcraft and the gameplay from Diablo, this game brings the best out of both games.Your choice of class is boiled down to a simple three choices - Brawler, Archer and Mage, and there is plenty of gameply to be had as each class.If you're a hoarder of gear and equipment (like me), then this game is going to be both a blessing and a curse. There is just so much to pick up, so many matching sets of armour to collect, so many jewels to craft, that your inventory gets a fair workout just in the first few levels.Happily, you get a pet companion to act as a loot mule, but you'll still wish for more storage.Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone, and given the cheap, cheap price on Steam, it's almost a crime not to have it in your collection.Noticeable omission of co-op play, but that is being addressed in Torchlight 2 - soon to be released in 2012.

												As dungeon crawler RPGs go, Torchlight is a considerably decent entry in that particular category. Created by former staff members and developers of Blizzard, the game serves as an excellent spiritual sequel to the popular Diablo franchise, albeit one that was created prior to the release of ""Diablo III"".The game improves upon certain mechanics originally featured in the Diablo series, and brings its own new tricks to the table as well. Examples include the ability to create magical gems using lesser gem fragments picked up in the various dungeons of the game, as well as the ability to send your character's ""pet"" back to a safe haven to sell any excess loot you pick up, both to earn your character a bit of extra coin, and to help alleviate your character's overburdened inventory.The further into the depths you go, a new challenge waits to be conquered, a new monster waits for a worthy opponent, and new treasures are eager to be discovered. Equip your gear, grab your pet, and prepare to hack, slash, shoot, and blast your way through level after horrifying level in one of the best top-down RPGs since the release of ""Diablo II"".			"

												Remember how Diablo was really fun, but there wasn't that much to do and how Diablo II had more to do, but most of the classes were unnecessary and the gameplay felt a litle awkward? And remember how both didn't have glittery, Adderall-meets-World-of-Warcraft graphics? Or fishing? Runic Games has solved these problems. You're welcome.So here's the plot. You're an adventurer with a dog or cat that can carry a freakish ammount of weight (I refuse to believe such a small spine can take that much weight). You show up to a town that has bad stuff happening for reasons that don't matter. You go into the mine and bash in the skulls of anything that happens to look mildly guilty. It's fun and satisfying and everything drops sparkly loot that you sell to buy more sparkly loot. The end.If you're familiar with the Diablo games (it's essentially the best of both fused together and filled with delicious custard), you'll feel right at home for the 100+ hours you'll spend with this one.

												Simple and straightforward at it's core, but with a lot of replay value thanks to randomly generated dungeons and ever-changing item placement. The graphics aren't top of the line, but they're far from ugly, and the music is wonderful. The mods that are out there offer up some nice changes to your character and/or pet, as well as the textures in the game. Overall, this game is perfect for long-term time killing that doesn't require you to sit and play for hours on end to make a little progress.The only real downside is the lack of co-op and online play.

The added bonus of a pet is great, limiting your downtime with multiple Town trips to sell all that ""Phat Lewt"", but the Skill trees could have used more thought. A fun time waster but really not as good as expected.With Torchlight 2 due out soon, it's worth the US$20 to preorder T2 and get the original to muck around with.6/10 Dragons			"

After the main storyline is cleared, a new dungeon opens up with no limit to the floors, and enemies get much stronger as you advance in it.  There is no end to this part of the game however, the dungeon just gets deeper and deeper.Highly recommend this game if action-rpg is your taste.			"

												Torchlight is like the more colourful, funnier brother of Diablo. Like the first Diablo game there are no grand maps to explore, just a dungeon you climb deeper and deepler into to reach the ancient evil at the bottom. Each of the three character classes plays differently so it is fun to play all of them through. The dungeon levels are different, there is a bit of story tying the whole thing together. Combat is fast paced and uncomplicated. Perfect when you just need to bash a hoard of monsters without using your brain much.Good value for money.			"

												I got this game on the Summer sale for $3. Even though I paid $3 for it I would pay the full price for it ($15), something I can't say about most games on Steam. I have never played dungeon crawler games like this for the most part, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it so far. It sort of looks like World of Warcraft but plays like Gauntlet/Diablo. Lots of character customization and the combat is very fun and the perfect level of challenging. Overall I would reccoment this game as I think it is a great introduction to the dungeon crawl genre.			"

												They call me ""Psi, Lord of the Nether Imps, and allow me, to tell you the tale of my legend, and of my finger that now hurts.""Torchlight is a clicky-clicky imp summony-summon game in the same vein of that of Diablo, where you click on things and loot comes out. Best described by like, PC-gamer, as ""Diablo but with actual loot"", Torchlight is the kind of game where the wizard (alchemist, here) can just use maces, pistols, and bows in addition to his wands and staves. I've always been wowed by what magic can do in games, personally, so that's who I went with. Goes without saying how impressed I was.The Story to this game is pretty meh, and is mostly what you'd expect, Ember is a thing that makes you more powerful, but eventually corrupts you. Steriods. Its steroids. And similarly to diablo, you got classes. The 'knight' (tank, uses swords and shields the best, low att high def) the uh 'ranger'? (long range, uses bows, pistols and 'traps', very low def, high att at long range) and the alchemist, (low def high att with neat effects and elemental abilities). They got their bases covered and therefore everyone can find someone to enjoy.Oh and you get a pet too. Dog or Cat. Husky/German Shepard (Its hard to tell) Or, a Lynx. They can sell stuff for you in the dungons.So, I never feel unsafe within the mines of Torchlight. I handle everything with the cocky swagger of an alchemist that totally doesn't have a cloud of imps with him at all times. Might be a problem who knows.AI pathing is quite good to my suprise, you run into packs of foes and they all fall to the ground as fire or electric bolts pulse through them.""....and you know what I did it for? An identify scoll! And did you know the pistol I discovered was absolute trash? It was! Harharharhar and then I killed a pack of bats or something in about three clicks...""I love this game, Easily my favorite dungon crawler to date. 10/10There were times where I had to stop playing because my finger could not click anymore. That should speak for itself, quite frankly.Don't bother trying to face the final boss. He'll keep summoning dragons and eventually they'll mob you and you'll be set in a cycle of death and life becayse they'll never despawn if you can't live long enough for them to despawn. Such a shame.			"

												This game is the best thing since Diablo2 and may end up being better than Diablo3. Another holiday purchase, I got it for $2.50 last Christmas to New Year sale. Though there are only 3 characters to choose from, the loot drops, ability to empower weapons, armer and such with gems which are also upgradeable to make their effects even more powerful, you'll find yourself lost in this for hours. It is not turn based, so you don't have that ""Just one more turn""  sense, but it is unbelieveable how easily you can lose track of all time with this action/RPG beauty.			"

I just wish there was more bosses and quests. The game is medium length and doesn't cost much. A must buy!			"

												Mindless entertainment, but pretty good at it and definately better than television. In general I would give it 'up' but unfortunately there is a problem that I have encountered. I have aggravated a lot of creatures' which now camp on the respawn spot and I am being killed in 2 seconds after clicking Continue button. Cannot reset the level because for some ♥♥♥♥ knows reason the console is deactivated on Steam. Shame because I am on 30th lvl. Instead of giving thumb up, it is 'up' your's 'Steam'. Damn			"

												Torchlight is, in every way, the successor to Diablo 1. It's a stylish Action RPG where you control either a warrior, rogue or wizard and venture into a randomly-generated dungeon. Torchlight improves on Diablo in that, in addition to your hero, you control a pet that has its own inventory and can be sent back to town while you are adventuring to sell all the goods that it is carrying. Torchlight will provide you with many hours of entertainment, although, much like Diablo, it can get somewhat repetitive.			"

												Its good. Lot of originality and the game world is nicely rendered. But the amount of weapon drops and items kinda kill the gameplay. You constantly are having to check bags and decide on whether to keep or drop items. Its like an MMO cept a bit more annoying on the loot. The lack of a variety of classes means each class has multple routes which change how it plays, but overall it also can complicate things if you want to change up play style. Lack of multiplayer is also a hinderance but not game ending. Buy it whenever it goes on another Steam sale. Its worth it then for sure.			"

												While the formula for the point-and-click rpg isnt changed much here, that doesn't stop Torchlight from being addictive and fun. Playing more like Diablo 1, there is one town, one dungeon, 3 classes, and a million enemies and items to click on over and over. Add in mod support(including more classes, items, dungeons, monsters, etc) and this is a must play for any fan of Diablo or Titan Quest.			"

												Awesome game that is very reminiscent of Diablo / Diablo 2. Everything from the music to the gameplay lives and breathes the world of Diablo, as former developers of the game worked on this software release. If you are a fan of Diablo, this is a must-have. 'Nuff said. Graphics do look/feel a bit dated, but the game itself is amazing.Would definitely recommend, even though it is single player. Would have loved multiplayer.4 out of 5 stars.			"

												This is a very fun and very playable Diablo clone; the inventory and character build system is much more simpified, there is a shared stash to facilitate moving items between multiple characters, and the overall game has far less blood and gore in it.  It's an excellent game for those who like dungeon crawl games but don't want the excessive inventory and character building found in more advance (read complicated) games.			"

												I was given the sequel as a gift, having never played the first, so I decided to buy this and try it out.I am actually happy with this game. It's pretty much like Diablo 1 (as far as it being central to one very specific area and just going further and further down) with art very similar to WarCraft 3 (meaning somewhat cartoony).So far I have only tried the melee character, but if you want a game that plays just as good as Diablo (and sequels), I could definitely recommend this. HOWEVER, the main menu mentions nothing about multiplayer, so I think it may be a single-player ONLY game (which I am fine with, but others may not be). Curious if Torchlight 2 brings in multiplayer or not.			"
