												Ragnarok Online 2: The Extremely Generic MMO Experience.I remember the good old days of Ragnarok Online, with its cartoony top-down anime art style, cool spell/skill animations, and overall fun appeal. So naturally, when I heard there was to be a sequel, a 3D sequel at that, I was ecstatic.-Insert several years of waiting here-Then came the day when I heard Ragnarok Online 2 was available for play. I was stoked. What followed was roughly 45 hours of the most generic game I've ever played and refused to finish. Where do I even start? I can safely say that I've played my fair share of MMO games, reaching into experiencing roughly 30+ different games. In the ones where I could make a character specific (Such as Mage, Warrior, etc), I would choose to make the healer. The most sought after, rarely played, and hardest to solo of them all. I also had a few other friends who were playing RO2 alongside myself. Well, over the internet of course. The whole time we were playing, it just felt like a tedious run here, do this, run back kind of game. At first, I wanted to give RO2 the benefit of the doubt, but after hitting the 2 hour mark, I could see, and sadly admit to myself, that this game was just not that fun, even with other people! During solo play, I found myself just mashing the 1 key to do my basic ""Holy Light"" attack, or whatever the skill was called. I barely gained another useful attacking skill for practically the entire time I played. Playing with the group however was a more enjoyable experience. At least then, I was able to use my Heal, Revive, and Buff skill.One of the cool things this game did have was the Card System. Almost every monster in the game would drop a card. These cards could be equipped; up to five. Certain sets would give you bonuses, and it gave the game a somewhat Pokemon-esque feel.While the quests were generic, there was always a plentiful amount. Story, Side, Dungeon, Monster Hunters, and more. You never needed to worry about needing something to do.Something Ragnarok Online 2 does that I absolutely LOATHE is having items, equipment, and mounts that had time-limits. Yep, you read correctly. Time-limits. The worst possible feature a game can have. Oh, and the class change in this game is nowhere near as awesome as the first game. You finish the quest and the person just says: Congrats, you're now a X, whereas in the first one, you had a light beam down on you and your clothes would change.Eventually I just got to a point where I said ""I'm done."" RO2 eventually becomes more of a chore than a game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Quests: As basic as they can get; Split into the trio of: Go Kill X, Talk To X, Gather X.Character Customization: Limited. Pretty much just Hair, Face, and Eyes.Graphics: While it's a nice touch to have Ragnarok venture into the 3D world, it lacks the detail of the original. From character models to environments to monsters, everything is very, VERY, bland and lackluster. One thing I will give RO2 is that it is quite colorful.Gameplay: Auto-Attack or Mash 1st Skill in HotBar.Monsters: RO2 definitely took the easy way out with its creatures, having many of the same monster models with varying color schemes.Sound: Nothing really stands out as bad, yet nothing stands out as great.Fun Factor: 4/10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bright and Colorful settings, A unique card system, and some interesting boss fights just aren't enough to save this overly generic, bland MMO.~3 out of 10~			"

												I have been playing this game for since it was released on Steam.Seen everything this game has to offer with a max level character, level 85 (ML35.)[ATM] With the new content being released soon, there will be more adventure's and areas to explore. I am addicted to this game with nearly 30 characters scattered throughout various accounts and have experienced every single class available in the game. Seen the ups and downs of the game. I've decided to stick by this game for better or worse.Everyone that has reviewed this game in the past has experienced some unfortunate bugs that have been long since patched. If you haven't given this game a try and are going by the reviews, judge this game for yourself. This review might get a ton of thumbs down but whatever.________________________________________________________________Due to numerous people asking for me to go more in depth with this review, here we go.---HISTORY---2 years ago this game was released as Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second, a wonderful & more challenging time. Everything was kind of difficult to do and most of the time people rejected you because of not having a specific amount of health for raid dungeons. September 12, 2013, they released the Noel class. December 2013, (can't remember the specific date like the previous one) this game was renamed to Ragnarok Online 2: Advent of Valkyrie introducing Master Level. ***[Side Note, master level is pretty much rebirth on RO1 but ONLY your display level is reset back to 1 (51).]*** With master level, the older content became easy to do. Until the ramped up the difficultly on the raid dungeons, still soloable if you have the right gears and junk. That same year, the korean server closed.October 2014, the SEA server merged with us making the game iRO2 (International Ragnarok Online 2) and a sperate server called ""Freyja.""July 28, 2015, the TW server merging with Freyja.---UPDATE---The last major update was the remake of Forgotten Payon and boosting the level cap to 85 (ML35). In August they will be releasing Jawaii, the honeymoon place from RO1. Awhile back they said that a marriage system would not be added with Jawaii but according to the ""Will you marry me?"" event on the forums, it might be added. (Ovvvvvver jooooooyed)---GAMEPLAY---***People have complained that it just a clone of WoW. I have not played nor will ever play WoW so I do not know about that. There are folks on the forums here on steam saying that the camera and movement is terrible. Everyone will exerience different things according to their machines and their connection to the server.***The basic levels, 1-50 are so easy to fly through combat level and professional levels alike. There are EXP events every weekend and sometimes during the weekdays to help players with grinding. Level 51-85 aka ML1-ML35, is just grinding of course you can do the Morroc and Dayr Desert quests to boost for MP this could be the main questline or all of the Daily Quests. This is where the EXP events mentioned before comes into play making grinding so much less painful. The current end game gears is Eddga, the ""powerful"" gear which was specifically designed for PvP. Most of my friends and myself, have stuck with the previous end game gears Cazar & Himmelmez. Now for the what you can do after reaching the max level, anything that you want to do. PvP in WoE (Guild vs Guild, located in Prontera & Morroc), helping low leveled players, collecting items, taking part in Trivia for prizes, farming for items, gears or pets and so on.If this is not in depth enough for you, just say so. With so much experience in this game I just picked key points and just touched on specific topics. I apologize if this is unorganized, this is my thought process.			"

												I've never experienced another MMO with this many bugs. First, in order to log in with  Steam there is a separate launcher from the game. This only works half the time and there is no way to manually log in. After every update it stops working or sometimes it just stops working for no apparent reason. Second, quests are bugged. I've had a main storyline quest just break with no way to recover it and no other quests available, effectively making the entire character useless. Google revealed that there are several quests in particular that have been broken for years without anyone working on them. Third, the prices for items are different depending if you are on the Warp Portal website or if you're on Steam. The best deals are on their site. Also, some items expire after a couple of days (which is bad if you can't log in half of the time.)The game has been doctored so that Warp Portal can make more money. In the original Korean servers, there are quite a few Tiger mounts that you could purchase for in game money. All of these have been removed and put in a cash shop were you have a CHANCE at getting them permamently in a box. (There is only one mount available that does not require real money.) Costumes are not permament either. Most costumes expire after 30 days and you need to buy extenders to keep it. Both these items cost real money. If you want a permament costume the only way to get it is by more chance items, or by getting a lot of rare stones to play a pyramid game (which has an extrememly low chance of getting an item.) Inventory / Bank space is severely limited. Only 'medium' bags are dropped / purchasable which hardly have any slots. You will get these at level 10. If you want actual space, you need to buy bags from the cash shop. RO2 may not be a 'pay to win' but it sure is a 'pay to do anything fun' sort of game. Server population is pretty low. No one seems to be socializing. In fact, all the social interaction I had was a creepy guy hitting on me. So, if you play MMOs in hopes of finding some new buddies to talk too, you won't find them here. If you insist on plaything this game, do not do it through Steam. Go to the site itself, or better yet find another company / private server. Warp portal is not doing a good job integrating RO2 with Steam. If the game actually worked as intended I might suggest it for someone looking for a casual game to play with friends (if you don't mind old school rpg grinding) but since Warp portal provides such a terrible service, I suggest trying one of Aeria Games' anime MMOs instead. They have a cash shop too, but they are more fair about what they give you. Overall RO2 is a HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT and I am not saying this because it is different from the first game. I am saying this because of the bugs, Warp portal's poor choice of business model and all the issues I've been having. I've played a ton of f2p mmos and none have quite been this bad. You have been warned!			"

												Stay away from this game.  It had a lot of potential when it first arrived here on Steam despite early showings of a pay2win model.  Unfortunately, despite all of our hopes, the game did indeed decide to milk us for all we're worth.  The classes were extrememly unablanced the last time I played and other than my own guild, the community was possibly one of the worst I had ever had the misfortune to play with.I wouldn't touch this game again if they paid me.

												This game brings shame to the original Ragnarok, which gave many of us MMORPGers our very first taste of what it is to play an MMORPG. Comparisons aside, Ragnarok Online 2 is still one bad game. Stay away from it.RO2 is ridden with a horrible pay2win system; bugs that never or take hell of a long time to get fixed; unbalanced classes; a ridiculous amount of grinding to earn enough money to catch up with those who can buy from the cash shop; and endgame content that is almost impossible to get through unless you use glitches. The staff regularly release new content and events but leave a lot of the game's problems to the side. If you check their Facebook page, people still complain about bugs and other problems with the game all the time.The community is also pretty toxic since there are a lot of immature players who are super competitive about the silliest things, including sitting space in town. The only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because I had an awesome guild and really good friends who still played, so I was able to do endgame dungeons with a decent party. But when a majority of them moved to other MMOs, there was nothing left to do but leave as well.Just... stay away.			"

												I can't, in all honesty, recommend this game. Although the early game aspect is fun and exciting, that facade quickly slips. Despite easy and quick leveling in early game, late game content is still severely lacking, and heavily unbalanced. Constant gamebreaking bugs, pay-to-win events, poor server optimization, lag and latency issues, incredible graphical defects and compatibility issues with regional settings on your computer make the game nigh unplayable at times, especially after big patches. The Pay-to-win model breaks balance between free to play players and paying players, and the gap between them is offputting to say the least. The biggest problem I have with the game is the ridiculous amount of RNG uses in places where there shouldn't have to be random attribution. Random chances to get an item that once opened up, gives a random chance for an item, and combines with other items with a random chance to get a good item. So many recursive random chances that player advancement is purely luck based, rather than progression based on player activity is unbearable to say the least.There are many good things about the game, but honestly, it's hard to talk about them, when the first thing you think of after a long session of raiding dungeons or grinding was: that was pointless.

If you want something quick to play, this is a good MMO that should last about 2-4 weeks, but definitely not something for long-term.			"

												I was hoping that its gameplay would be like the first Ragnarok Online but just in a full 3D environment. But the game is almost unregonizable from the original Ragnarok anymore except for some familliar places. The game became more restrictive and doesnt have the openess of the old one. The visuals are subpar from its contemporaries and its gameplay is seems to be very common with other Korean Online games. The early game bosses doesnt offer that much challenge as the bosses from old RO. Although the inclusion of raids is good, that is also the only place where you can get an actual challenge because this game is too easy. All in all, I do not suggest this game to old RO players and I discourage players new to RO to try this one because you will be dissapointed.			"

Very grindy starting at lvl 47+, and since you're going to grind anyways b/c of the khara quests, might as well activate em than to forget and re-grind again. 11/10 would let my storage get wiped without me getting notified that it was going to happen.If I could get those items back, and more players, I would get back in the game. Also, maybe a game engine update is needed since it feels very inefficient (massive lag with good internet and mid-high end computer).			"

												RO2 is the very definition of a generic, cash grab MMO. There is a cash shop involved in which the game will shove in your face any chance it can get. Despite what my profile says about my play time, I leveled up a character to Master Level 1 outside of Steam, because I couldn't launch it otherwise. The graphics are decent and very cutesy if that is your style. Some environments are colorful and quite eyecatching. Players who enjoyed the original Ragnarok Online will recognize a few NPCs, and then become disappointed at how bland they are. The dialogue is very simplistic in order to match a certain personality type assigned to a character. The translation is rough and you can spot quite a few typos. Quests give plenty of experience, so it is easy to level up a character to 50. However, it is hard to find players to run through dungeons at later levels. It's not uncommon to wait up to an hour to find a tank or a healer. PVP is pretty much P2W and laughably unbalanced. After you hit level 50, you can complete a quest to become a ""Master Class."" This is where I lost interest in the game completely. The game becomes a pointless grindfest. Every time you die as a Master Class, you lose experience (called master points)... unless you purchase an item from the cash shop to avoid the penalty. Players have been leaving and many servers have been shut down since RO2's inception. The developers have put less effort into keeping players interested and more effort into milking as much money as they can from a F2P game. With the community dying, I don't see much of a future for Ragnarok Online 2.			"

												Many people hate this game. Many people say that other MMORPGs are waaay better. I am NOT one of those.They say that your first MMORPG is shaping your online playing. My first was WoW and I absolutely hated it. The free world was too much for me and I needed something I could explore properly. Several years later I bumped into Ragnarok Online 2 on Steam. I was a fresh Steam user and the game had been out for 2-3 weeks when I saw it. Since I have seen the anime Ragnarok: The Animation, I eagerly downloaded it and set forth.As an inexperienced player, the game lead me along perfectly. Some things came along the way, but that made me feel like I learned something and that I grew a little more into the universe. The starter area is gorgeous and I LOVE the atmosphere there. The maps are limited, but leads somewhere. You can't get lost and there's a lot of people around to help and boost you. I have never met nicer people in an online game before.Do you like to play solo in an online game? It's cool, you can solo your way up to the Master Levels (you might need some random help with some dungeon here and there, but no need). Do you like to play with others? Join your friends or make new ones as you play. How you play is your choice.People also say that this is too much grinding. I say it's the same way in every game like this. You just need to find the one that suits you the best.As you can see, I have played this game. A lot. Over 1000 hours and still counting. I vote recommend on this game, since I have a special connection with it. If you find the same, is up to you. I just hope you try it out before trashing it. But know this: I have still to find a better online community than this.Join the family!			"

												This is probably one of the greatest disappointments ever when it comes to MMOs. The original Ragnarock was a massive success in the day, where the world felt alive, and the gameplay was pretty fun at the same time. The sequel was in the works for a VERY long time, and now that its been released... Its a pathetic game, to say the least. There was a unique feel of how the original Ragnarok played, and the second game is NOT unique in any way. Its a pathetic attempt to cash in on the Ragnarok IP, while not taking any risks, nor keeping any of the charm that the original game had.If this game came out 8 years ago, it might have been somewhat ok, but its just sad how low quality the game is by today's standards. Its using an ancient engine with low polygon-count, low-res textures, and is filled with extremely generic gameplay, just click on the enemy and mash ability hotkeys until its dead. It is nearly identical to the hundreds of Korean made free-to-play MMORPGs, with the only thing that sets it apart, is that it uses Ragnarok art assets.If I had to sum up the game with one word, it would be ""Generic"", if I had to use one sentence, it would be, ""stereotypical outdated Korean F2P MMORPG that uses Ragnarok art assets""The makers of this game should feel ashamed for being so damned lazy. Thanks to them, the Ragnarok name will likely slide into obscurity.			"

												First of all, this is a whole new game. Treat it as such. Get RO1 out of your system.If you're still too stubborn to get RO1 out of your shnoozle, then don't play this game. Period!For those open minded players, keep on reading!Here's my opinion for those who are looking to play this game.PROS:-Decent character design-Diversified Classes and Subclasses(you'll see once you've played it)-Interesting Storyline-Interesting In-game features/events( Dungeons, Raids, Rankings, Honing, Pet summons etc.)-Costume availability (you can look different and be different)CONS:-Stale and repetitive quests (too much kill a number of these, gather a number of that, talk to this blah blah)-Boring (when played alone)-Not much diversity in builds( stats are based on your equips in master level/ same equips = same stats)-Some skills in some professions are not worth getting causing a generic build in skills I recommend playing this game with friends. It's really boring to play alone after you've reached master level(based on my experience). Don't get me wrong, I had fun playing this alone, up to a certain point.  The storyline is good IMO, the characters are quite lovable, and the graphics are not that bad either. I suggest you give this game a try. Altogether I'll give this game 7/10.			"

												I was really excited when I knew that they were making Ragnarok Online 2 since I really enjoyed all the lost hours playing the first game. So I've this nostalgic and fondness on Ragnarok online, but when I played this game, well I wasn't able to enjoy it like his ancestor, instead of renewed version of Ragnarok Online with new traits and graphics I got nothing but a generic 3D mmorpg game like any other that I can find on the internet to play.I really tried to enjoy the time that I passed on the game but I wasn't able to it, I didn't felt like playing the old game that I loved, but just another online rpg game like so many other that I played and dropped immediately after find killing 30 monsters of a certain type something boring and tiresome instead of exciting and challenging like Ragnarok was able to make me feel. The quests are very bleh and I think that the 3D graphics made the game lost most of his originality and magic. If you like me played Ragnarok online for hours and hours and really loved that game I don't recommend this one for you, but If you just wanna try out to see if are going to like well go for it.			"

												TL,DR version : (Sorry Gravity for this review, but I am still a fan of the original and believe you can still make a comeback)Very generic. I want to say ""not as good as it should be"" but instead I find myself saying ""Not good or fun at all."" I give a lot of chances especially to something I want to be good, this took 3 mind numbing chances after waiting a while for the bugs to be worked out first. Give it a try of course, but don't expect much at all.Long Version : Running back and forth between 2 characters over 6 times before killing or collecting an item is downright boring as hell. I have played Ragnarok Online the original and it was/is much better than playing Ragnarok Online 2. The game went 3D and lost all value in community and leveling gain. After multiple times of scrapping and redoing the game it should have been much better than this.Time should have gone to giving Ragnarok Online 1 a huge update or cloning the game with a different storyline. This was awful and I cant play anymore than the 8 hours I have pushing myself to like it. Sorry Gravity but you value your profits too much for this game to be any good.Anime cut-scenes were interesting. New card system is not as inspiring. Music loops so much it may have made me nauseous, Running up and down a hill shows obvious bugs that should have been fixed in Korean Beta, none of my costumes fit me (hat was floating 4 feet aboive my ehad at all times) All of the items are timed. Peco usage for 3 days. VIP access was generous but pointless, the people are NOT fun to play/talk with (original has that locked down better than any game) "

Product received for free
												WARNING: PERSONAL OPINIONpositives- character customization- easy to play controls- decent graphics- interesting lore if you actually read what the NPC's say to you- fun with friends- easy to advance until around level 35negativies- excessive grinding (unless you like that sort of thing)- you can't drop certain quests like events and stuff, they just sit their and clog up space- difficult to play solo- while the story changes and I find it interesting, the quests still end up being almost the same thing a lot of the timeI see a lot of people complaining that it's P2W, but I've never run into this problem. I don't participate in PVP so I don't know if that's where the problem lies, but I'm master level and I have yet to spend a single cent on this game. I would not pay for this game, it's not worth it. But since it's free, I think it's fun. I wish there was a ""meh"" option instead of a thumbs up or down. It's fun for awhile, but once you hit around level 35 as I mentioned earlier it becomes much more of a challange and less of a game.			"

												Did you enjoy Ragnarok Online?Yes? Well, prepare to succumb to the sad realization that this game is a poorly made korean WoW clone that threw in some RO references here and there.Play this game for five minutes and you realize they butchered every single element from RO that made it great. Generic trinity classes with none remotely interesting (remember Stalkers, Creators, or Professors?), terrible stat and skill trees, slow tab-targeting gameplay, and repetitive quest grind. This game is literally any other low-budget korean MMO with poring mobs thrown in there, then had the balls to call themselves RO2.			"

   My Playthrough     The Review This game has been through a lot. First this game was called Ragnarok Online 2: The Gate of the World which was a game which entered beta testing in 2006 but was discontinued in 2010 due to poor reception. Then it returned in 2013 as Ragnarok Online 2: Legend of the Second. Being called Ragnarok Online 2 you would think that this is a direct sequel  to the original Ragnarok Online? Well it is not as it has little to nothing to do with Ragnarok Online storywise so it is basically a reboot. The problem is that it has all the same issues that I had with Ragnarok Online but now it has whole new issues. This game was trying to be more narrative centered than the original but the story is awful. It's full of bugs. And the gameplay really didn't improve that much above the original. Not worth the 7 year wait.  "

												Avoid this like the plague. Its pretty much World Of Warcraft with a reskin to look somewhat like something that vaguely resembles Ragnarok Online. Its excessively grindy and goads you at every turn to plunk money on its cash shop. Its also no fun at all. Worst of all, Hats, something Ragnarok is known for, are timed unless you buy them for real money. By the way, while it shows that I only have an hour logged, I played this prior to it being available on Steam.			"

												I havent played the game long, however I can already see why I personally will not be playing long just looking at the 'temp' items in the cash shop. 1. Card System I actually like this part, I'm a person who loves completing collection and like it even more if those collections have a point to them. Each card has a set of stats on them that boost your character, and you can have up to 5 cards at a time (You unlock up to 5 slots as you level). You can also upgrade the cards to be more powerful, though this is more luck than anything eles. It takes 5 diffrent cards to give it a go, however if you fail you lose ALL those cards, so if you have been farming a monster for hours to get that one card you wanted and you fail upgrading it, well...sorry. Storing of the cards is also probomatic at best, unless you pay for the card album, your patheticly small bags will overflow with these and other junk you need for quests and crafting. Now paying for the card album itself wouldent be bad except you only get that storage for 30 days at a time, after which you have to pay more real world money to keep it open.2. Storage: this brings us to one of my pet peeves for any f2p mmo, having to constantly buy storage. You will never have enough space, and they know it. want a 30 slot bag just so you can haul that crap around? better bust open the wallet. Expand your bank a little? Swipe the card sir! In a perfect world, this stuff would be managed with in game currancy, not real world money.3. Comunity: I know that gold spammers are the bane of any mmo, however they are not even present here, which should be a good thing until you see the chat. Some of the most annoying chatter i have seen. The chat channels are not even regulated. The filter also does more harm than good, bleeping out half of every 4 or so words it 'thinks' are swear words. So while I do not see gold sellers spaming in the game, I know its not moderation, its just they think the game will tank apperently.There are a few things that are good in this game, and from time to time i run into people who are willing to help a newbie out instead of just spouting off some insults just because i asked a question. So while I did press 'not recomended' let me just add this....Its worth playing if you have nothing to do, just do not spend any money on it because later on down the road you  will regret it.			"

To be fair, i did only go as far as level 20, but i figure: if the game is universally boring in the first 20 out of 50 levels, why should i think that the other 30 will be any different?			"

												I was a huge fan of RO. So much in fact I did some trickery to get into GOTW beta in Korea. I never bothered with RO II for a while when they scrapped it back then, so I never got into the beta LOTS, and to me, no offense Gravity, but you failed. The system was much better in GOTW. You took a great system and threw it away, and the graphics were better. They could have been improved, but definitely much better than this. The skill system, combat, everything was superior in GOTW and they replaced it with this sad excuse for a sequel. I was disappointed and couldn't spend more than an hour on this game and uninstalled. The size of GOTW's world was much larger, too, from what I remember. This is just cheesy, and lots of crap. In RO's day, using the technology they had at the time, you got a real feel for how big Midgard was, in this game, it reduced it to walking a short distance to get to the next objective/area, basically compressed it so the 14 year old brain of todays generation could handle it. In GOTW, that sense of ""This is our world we created, see how big it is"" was prominent, in LOTS(this game), it's completely gone. The graphics and environment reminds me of like it was like 5-8 years ago when Flyff came out.But, even if a Gravity rep or dev were to see this they might not be able to understand what I mean.So I'll make it easy:라그나로크 온라인 2 Legend of the Second = 서사시 실패 (Epic Fail) 라그나로크 온라인 2: The Gate of the World = 최고 (Awesome)			"

												The good things:-actually ingame looks pretty nice, the game is well done in maps, the landscape has no compare-has a decent plot, actually enjoyable at the beggining-really good game if you come here with your gf or a close friend, there is a lot things to do for 2 or more people outside ingame comunity-nice looking costumes, characters, bossesAnd the rest of the game-has bugs, a lot. Since day 1 and still some remain-admins, gm doesn't give a single f**k about the game, they are just interested in 2 things; 1 money 2 keep the game running with low cost and more income-no chances or pvp, if you're not assassin or crecentia with a lot of money (real one $) is just a waste of time-most people it's gone, they leave this forsaken game, nobody cares if people leaves or not, make research, is like 2000 people playing... in a month x.x-be prepared, if you pass all mentions things upthere here are ''what is this game?'' things: since lvl 1 to 50 is made for a generic random MORPG, nothing different from others and bugged. Thing is this is all useless, because item levels from 1 to 50 are soo useless, in fact you use them in just 1 moment and is when you get ''master level'' Masterlevel: this is where nightmare starts, no matter how you get to masterlevel, this is the ''game'' ML means grinding... for the rest of the game. hours and hours of grinding, just nothing else, to wait for one of the 5 main guilds of the game accept you in to defeat one generic augmented ''boss'' npc to get loot. Repeat last process to get the next weapon for next grinding-if you're here because someone send you, wish a car crash to him, with no dead involved, just material stuff gone with no repairs or insurance.-nobody gives a s**t about you in this game, and if they do is because you can heal or tank the bosses for the grinding, that's what guilds care-everything important in the game is buyed with real money, don't waste time getting money from quest or grindind and don't even think about loot. Sellcrap cost like a piece of dirt or 2-forums are full with randomized stuff, people ingame don't even care anymore about telling problems or glitches or w/e happens to the game, GM'S only care for money income at low cost, means if the server (the only one) works, and some random bug doesn't get involved in people's grinding it's everything ok from them.-I waste my time just because wanna make a friend happy to play together... the only thing I found here was the love of my life. That's why I am writting this, if someone from high on game really cares and read this... make sure RO2 at least die with some honor. Because the game it's almost dead.			"

												This game has it's pros and cons, but all around, it's not an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥game and it's good enough to get people willing to try MMOs, into that kinda scene, it's a pretty good starter game instead of committing to something hardcore or that needs money to play. I see SO many people ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game becaue it's not as good as the original ragnarok game, which honestly, you should never expect a 'sequel' to an MMO to be just like the originalAside from that, all I really have to say is that, despite what people say, it's a pretty decent game for it only being such a low GB game. I've played Tera, and as fun as that can be, this game, honestly has kept me more interested in it, whether it was the story given at the beginning between both races, and then merging into one big one, or the diversity of the classes, decently fast loading screens. actual gameplay in itself (although it IS tab targeting), and the difference between places til you hit ML. Yes, this game has it's flaws, but that's mainly within the community of players; A lot of them are arrogant, mainly holding this ""im better than you"" mentality over people, especially in certain guilds. Yes, there are glitches, and the game gets boring with the unending grindfest when you hit ML, (which i have a ML24 priest, ML 12 crec, and 5 other MLs between 1 - 5 so don't assume I have no idea what I'm talking about with this).BUT, once you get past the arrogance of other players, and find decent people to group up with every so often to take on dungeons and go gear hunting, the game can be really fun. Sure, they could use some content updates accessible for lower level players that don't have the time to grind to ML40, as well as the content for those that are ML40. But developing a game takes time.And for people complaining about P2W, you can accomplish SO much without needing to pay a single penny. I've gotten over 40k gold, full OSI gear and pretty damn far in the game without spending any money on it, since I don't believe in dropping money on a free game, it's just not how I do, props to those that do though, good on them. But paying money doesn't automatically make you a better player than those that don't. And to get far in the game and get the things you need without putting money in, DOES take patience and time and you can do so much without needing money. But a lot of people are hot-heads that just want to jump all these levels so they can say they're better than others, without putting in the time, it ain't gonna happen on an empty wallet, buddy. So yes, if you do want to get to high levels without putting much work in, then you do gotta pay to do so, but if you want to get there without doing so then stop whining about how it's 'unfair' and put the work in. lmaoAs much as I love this game, the playerbase can get aggravating, which is why it's best to turn off all chat features and just ignore literally everyone in game if possible. It has it's pros and cons, it's buggy sometimes, but for a free game, it's not absolutely horrible and unplayable. There's plenty of games out there that are worse. (like Echo Of Soul, that game is♥♥♥♥♥♥)I can certainly say it was better before they merged the two servers into one, allowing less lag from people hanging out in the big cities, Prontera being the laggiest since that's where a vast amount of players are on any given channel. And yes, but over the past couple of years, it has improved on itself and added more content than from when I very first started playing it, which is more than what a lot other free MMOs can say. There's things that can be improved on, such as leveling out the classes, but all around, it's not a bad game and it gets more fun once you get past Izulde Hill (imho). But to each their own.			"

												An awful sequel to one of the best MMOs I've ever played. This game brings shame to the original Ragnarök, which gave many of us MMORPGers our very first taste of what it is to play a MMORPG. Comparisons aside, Ragnarok Online 2 is still a very bad game. When the game was released in 2013, I've played a few hours and thought that the game itself was kinda generic and a bland MMO but I wanted to give RO2 the benefit of the doubt and I kept playing for something like three months or so (I've probably had around 300 hours of gameplay outside Steam). As soon as I found that this game was in Steam, I felt like I should came here and make a short review of what RO2 includes. Let's resume it in a few words:- A horrible pay2win system and a ridiculous amount of grinding to earn enough money to catch up with those who can buy from the cash shop;- Generic anime graphics;- A lot of bugs that are never or take a hell of a long amount of time to get fixed;- Unbalanced classes and a repetitive combat system;- Generic Quests. A lot of them. Bring X, Kill X monsters, etc.Just stay away from it. This game is a failure and doesn't worth your time.			"

Not really anything different in this from other mediocore mmorpg games, the fact you can set up your own ""shop"" and sell the stuff you make to people was pretty cool experience for me in this game. I played this for a bit longer even though I was bored just to see if there'd be anything cool to keep me playing. Being in a guild gave me something to actually do other than do those tedious ""Kill X amount of..."" and ""Deliver to.../Talk to..."" quesys which never develop in to anything great.Maybe if you're a newbie when it comes to mmorpg games then you could play this to learn the basics like preforming party roles, how to use stats & skill points for the highest benefit and such.

												The game's good up until you get to 50. It's quite hard to do the Mastery Quest at 50 if you don't know other players to go farm the gears needed or the Rank up. Back then, the quest was hard, but it wasn't that hard. (During the Beta days). It'll take you at least 3 days to get to 50 then possibly quite a lot of time == if you're just starting out -- to get prepared just for the quest. Once you rank up, the gears that you've farmed from the end game dungeons will be obsolete because the base Master equips are incredibly strong.If you really love playing Ragnarok, there's a sense of nostalgia there from the first one. However, if you're expecting the same gaming experience as the first one, you're in for a big disappointment. They took it to the generation of generic mmo's. Still a good time to play, but it's best to play with friends -- or get a guild ASAP.Just a fair warning, once you get to Master Ranks (50+) the game'll change into a HUGE grind fest so be ready for that.TL;DR : I'mma give this game a 6/10. A good time up until Master Rank. A great game to play with friends, but it's still a bit generic in terms of gameplay. (I know some of you out there enjoy playing these types of games)			"

It's a walmart brand world of warcraft but instead of a vast sprawling world to explore you can either go forward or backwards. I think there may have been a fork in the road at one point but thats the only one I ever saw. Quests are repetitive to the point where a quest giver actually asked me to hunt the same number of the same monster I had just killed for his previous quest.			"

												Compared to all the other anime based MMO titles this is one of the best. Now mind you, there is nothing really outstanding about this sequel. The original Ragnarok was unique in it's own right, this one however does nothing to stand out. There is a Player merchant system where you can set up a stall to sell items you found, but this requires that you stop playing and become...basically a ♥♥♥♥ing NPC...This feature would have been better if you could do this while offline. The rest of this game is standard fare, Combat is your normal Tab targeting with skills and classes that are the norm for all MMOs. Despite that this is the only Anime styled MMOs I've found with little to no: poor Programing, bad translations or,  currenccy spammers. Mind, they're still there, just less noticable. RATE: +7/10. This sequel isn't as economic based as it's previous, but, it's still an entertaining world to play in.			"

												The game is pretty much cool unless you have a friend to help you in the beginning, cuz questing alone is hard in this game, and the low population of this game makes kinda hard to find a party. when u reach master levels. its even harder..  i kinda enjoyed it 1st, (well i had a group of friends ingame, started in the beginning till master tho,) but still so hard. play it as you like. hope u dont end up as me tho. but i can guarantee the game fun enuf in the start. if u like MMORPG genre tho..(im a guy that plays the game 1st b4 saying it sucks)i give this 2.65/5			"

												Rating: 4 out of 10.I was hoping this MMO would capture on the franchose that was started years ago. Sadly, for me, it did not. It is quite literally a grind-fest and boring to the nth degree. The graphics are great and the gameplay is similar to other MMOs, but nothing really stands out and defines it as a worthy MMO to play. I give it a 4 due to the graphics quality. The 6 points missing is subsequentially everything else about the game.			"

												[De-Recommendation] Setting my ""This is not the true sequel to Ragnarok Online"" bias aside. This game plays and FEELS exactly like a generic Korean MMORPG: Fetch quests, do them, mash down your hotkeys, right click, loot all, run back to town. Doing this RIGHT off the bat is a huge turn-off. Would you like to do this for 15-20 hours before you get to your first job advancement at level 25? By then, you'll be able to do dungeon runs and raids. TANK? KEEP AGGRO. DPS? KEEP DAMAGING. HEALER? WATCH THE HP BARS AND SET UP YOUR BINDINGS!There is literally nothing else that keeps the user interested. If you're comfortable with the 'Point-and-Clicker' WoW style based game without subscribing, then this is right up your alley. And it's free naturally. Unfortunately, the cash shop is still questionable. I have not even seen what COSMETICS you can get out of it, it only works with a raffle based system and you don't even know what you're getting. 100 of these points equals a dollar. These raffles costs 6 dollars each. I don't even know if it's permanent or if it runs on a 30 day expiration. If it's the latter, that is sad.The log-in screen music kicks♥♥♥♥♥... But every other BGM is generic. Animation is a bit cheesy. A bit downgraded from most MMOs I see in 2010+.There are people that already 30s and 40s. This game's cap is 50.There's not enough information for all the classes on the RO2 wiki nor in-game, so you can't really plan your build. You're really left with people who made guides on their blogspots from the Philppines. HEUEHUHEUHEUHEUHEUHEUHE! Because it's really important that a Acolyte's Job Advancement are Priest and Monk. And those TWO are very DIFFERENT classes. One turns to a more robust healer while the other one turns to a DPS and Off-Tank Fighting Machine with his fists. Because of course, skill resets costs MONEYMONEYMONEY.I'll pass. Maplestory is sadly better than this. Heck, Dungeons and Dragons: Neverwinter is better than this.3/10			"

												Inspite of brutal reviews I went ahead and downloaded this game. Now that I've binge played for a few days I'll take the time to review in a more positive light.Pros: Character Costume Customization,  nice-looking cartoonish avatars, towns/cities well realized, extensive pet-trainer with many pets, card collection, easy to pick up and make money right off the batCons: environments outside of towns and cities seem half empty, poor quest translations (which effects story immesrsion), RNG weapon/armor upgrades (does NOT = pay to win)If the idea ok a kooky cartoonish and casual mmo sounds fun I definitely give this a thumbs up. The community seems a little low, but the AH is active enough that I made quite a bit selling items already and there are noticable peak times in the cities. The lowest score I could give this would be 3.5/5 stars. Considering that the store doesn't = PTW alone makes me want to give it a bonus half star for a total of 4/5.			"

												Based on alot of the reviews I didn't expect this game to be very good but I downloaded it anyway. I'm so very glad I did. This turned out to be in my opinion a very fun game.  I thought I'd play a couple hours just to see what it was all about. I ended up playing the entire day!  The following are my personal opinions and from the viewpoint of a new player. It must be noted that I've never played the original Ragnarok.PROS:You can have multiple characters. ( 4 by default ) Crafting is useful and fun to advance and collect ItemsGameplay is fairly easy. Did my 1st dungeon solo on day 1. Not alot of aggro for my Magician at least not in the lower level areas. Higher levels may be different.Graphics are very good and cuteGreat community!  A random player gave me for free 4 Medium Bags to increase my inventory space. Thank you!Chat is active with Trades and people looking for a Party to join.You earn special gifts for logging in and also for staying online. YAY!CONS:Music can get a little boring but it does change in different areas. Takes a long time to regen Health and Spell Points.Potions seem to have a long cool down too.			"

												If you already have a Warp Portal ID, it's highly not recommended to play it through Steam.  The game will require you to create a new account which really sucks if you have made progress in another account with Warp Portal already.  It also seems that Warp Portal doesn't really care because they've ignored this problem since launch (7 months and counting as of this review).  Otherwise, an okay game for nostalgia if you played RO1 but otherwise nothing overly special and certainly not worth all the errors and crashes that occurs.			"

												Great game that lives in the shadows of its older brother RO1. When I first started the game a year ago it was full of bugs, errors quitting the game without my permission, and graphic glitches... I left the game a few months due to work but most importantly, my friends walked away from the game as well...The real reason I play Ragnarok is because the friends I am able to make there, slightly different group of people...Anyway... as of October of 2014, the game finally fixed the errors it had, the game is more balanced, believe it takes more space in your harddrive, and the prices (real money) of items are getting more stable and realistic. Obviously my friends came back as well!I usually play and will continue playing in Channel 10, come visit....			"

Ragnarok Online 2, the fifth installment in Nintendo's Online 2 series, is a story-based third person action adventure game. Dropping the player into the midst of an epic battle for control of Middle-earth right from the start, Ragnarok focuses on delivering an individualised single-player experience comparable to that of the Dragon Age series. The player meets his/her love interest, the knight Hans Rapad, early on before he is taken prisoner by an evil sorceror and trapped in an ancient castle ruin. Without spoiling anything, the second act of the game focuses on Hans' rescue, and as an avid Hammerwatch player I know that other fans of that franchise will feel very at home here. As with previous Online 2 games, abilities and combat strength is determined by a vast, inclusive skill tree--think Path of Exile, but without an initial choice of class at the beginning of play. Instead, the main character and all unlockable party members (each available for purchase in-game for $3.99) each start with a simple choice of Focus (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Speed,  Charisma, Presence, Corruption, Agility, Fertility) and build outward on the skill tree from there. This makes play highly customizable, and gives huge replay value to the game. Combat is similar to that found in the かたわ 少女 series, with fast-paced and innovative combos being the bread-and-butter. The unique combo system allows players to create their own combos, offering even more customization and crazy action possibilities. Overall, I would rate this game a 7.76 out of 10; while it offers a lot of options, great gameplay, an amazing story, and awesome replayablity, purchasing additional party members forces the monsters to scale their difficulty, which means one cannot simply pay real money to succeed at the game more easily. I'm looking forward to Nintendo adding that feature in the next Online 2 installment. Here's hoping!			"

Like most F2P MMOs it has a cash shop, which as a business model isn't sustainable enough to make regular content patches or even bug fixes. If you're looking for a game to mindlessly waste some time without needing to dish out any amount of cash, it's a reasonable way to waste a Saturday afternoon.

But even on some of the most basic settings i could hardly play the game without lag. I have a moderatly built computer, not best for gaming but not worst for gaming and am capable of running most mmo's. But this one seems to bog down my computer for no real reason with no real reward for straining it. I'd not recommend this game for the sole purpose that it seems to take up far more data then shold be necissary, and the fact that the game feels overly complex where it should feel more simplistic, at least to start.

												If you want the fast and skinny (TL;DR): This game is a greedy pay to get ahead WoW clone that will ban you for no reason. Don't play it, especially if you want to remember Ragnarok Online as being good.The Analogy: Divorce. She gets half your money, breaks your heart, and did it for no reason other than she heard a rumor through a distant relative's distant acquaintance's 2nd cousin's roomate that you could possibly be cheating (even though you weren't).The long Answer:Wouldn't work through steam for me, but I still managed to play it. Clocked in several hours (despite my hours on record, which consists of me trying to get it to work through steam) made it to level 35 and tried to look past the problems:1. Clone of every other MMO out there (I know this has been said a million times, but it can't be emphasized enough).  Way to think inside Schrödinger's box after a radioactive element found in said box has decayed leading to a series of events in which the game can accurately be described as the condition of, lets say a cat in that box, after an outside observer has say opened the box.. They took out original classes, so now you have standard sword guy, magic guy, bow guy, healer (and slightly a religious stereotype) guy, and sneaky guy. Also thanks for the crafting system which took less imagination to create than any reality show ending in ""wars"" (seriously, occupation + wars = new TV series). They scrapped the interesting card system to turn it into a trinket system (Oh cool, +3 strength. Where's my ""Immune to magic"" or ""Can see invisible dudes"" or ""You can do more damage to this type, but this other type will pwn you""). Type advantages also seems pretty arbitrary, as I've taken out water type enemies with fire moves fairly readily, sure electric does more, but not super substantially so like in the previous game, and some enemies/dungeons are so difficult you HAVE to over level even accounting for all boss mechanics.2. Buying way too heavily into the whole fee to play thing. CONSTANTLY reminding you that you can buy these things for crafting or reviving yourself or to look pretty. Also 14 day limits on things? That's Microsoft levels of greed. Take down the time limitations, people will still spend lots of money at your shop. Also, the clothing (at the time) was random, so you could potentially spend hundreds of REAL DOLLARS and get absolutely nothing you want. It is absolutely the greediest game I've ever played including cell phone games that ACTUALLY HAVE POPUP ADS EVERY FEW SECONDS PANDERING TO YOU ABOUT GIVING THEM MONEY. Oh and did I mention that the clothing is worth more on the auction house than pretty much anything else? So, they complain about buying gold (which I am not for in the slightest, I hate unbalanced games where you can pay to win, and bots drive me up a wall, you're playing the game to PLAY IT, not let someone else play it for you, then pay them for the work), but then they just indirectly sell you gold, with the potential to ban you anyway (see below). Oh and if you want to talk balance, thanks for having a VIP card that you PAY FOR AGAIN, which gives you a large stat boost, and is basically just a monthly fee. JUST CHARGE THE MONTHLY FEE AND RAISE EVERYONE'S STATS.3. The graphics are just terrible. With all the other ""free to play"" MMO's out there being substantially ahead. I would rather pay 10 bucks a month and get a decent graphical upgrade. So many clipping issues, and camera angle issues... ugh. That's all you could come up with? Even after tons of people paid you 12 dollars a month for YEARS (I think RO1 was 12 bucks). I really don't care about graphical quality all that much, but when RO1 looks better to me, and it looks like you changed the skins on some PS1 game, come on.But then, even after ignoring all these glaring signs they decided that wasn't enough. They permanently banned me for absolutely no reason. I contacted them and said that if a person who bought gold bought something of mine from the auction house the anti-botting security might have picked that up and banned me. Nope. You banned me, and that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I hope you choke on the money you're extorting out of people for a 14 day mount, which in any other game would be permanent.			"

												Ok, so I've played this game off and on prior to downloading it here on steam and got to about mid-level. So here's what I think about the game! It's not nearly as bad as some people might make it out to be, and I think people would be less upset if this game had nothing to do with the Ragnarok universe and just had its own. But obviously that's not the case here. So onto the main problems with the game, the first one being that it's generic. Painfully generic. HELLA generic. In fact, one of the only features about this game that even remotely help it stand out is the fact that it's a Ragnarok game--and in my opinion, in name only. RO2 has none of what made the original so great...The charming pixelated sprites being replaced with generic animu models, bland (and again, generic) combat mechanics you'll find in just about every tab-targetting game, a lacking soundtrack, and shady behavior from the GMs are all reasons why this game and the original Ragnarok Online just can't compare.In conclusion...If you're looking for a new MMO to try and hold you over for a little bit and aren't too picky, go ahead and give it a try. I still find myself briefly coming back to it when I'm bored and up for a simple game to keep me entertained for a while myself.However, if you're coming into this game expecting anything even remotely close to the original Ragnarok, then you'll be very disappointed. Final Verdict: Play Tree Of Savior instead.			"

												I'm afraid I can't endorse this game. I just can't. I've spent my fair share of hours playing it and I can tell you: It's as dull as it gets. The idea in itself was not bad, but the execution is plain terrible. It's fun for a while, but after putting some time into it, it gets old pretty fast (and you realize it's not going to get better).Most of the classes are pretty boring after some levels, with only a few skills to use. All of them feel very generic and uninteresting, unlike RO classes.You will also get bored of the quests real quick. It's not just the nonsense they put you through sometimes, they are also BLAND and MONOTONOUS. The kind of BLAND and MONOTONOUS that makes you wonder why are you still playing the game.As of summer 2013 it also struck me as a pay2win game, as you could enhance your HP, SP and movement speed by spending money.It pains me to say this, but you're better off playing the original Ragnarok Online. I so wanted this game to be at least half as good as Ragnarok Online was.All in all, the login screen music is great. That, and the Led Zeppelin reference in one of the towns are the only good points about this game. That, and the characters don't look half bad either.			"

												Disappointed in the P2W and I don't mind the Store but the items maybe a little ""weak"" for new characters, but the items are percentage based so at high levels its quite unfair.Things that NEED to change to make this a better game.-Change the VIP (THIS SHOULD BE THE ONLY ITEM THAT STOPS AFTER X DAYS), change HP and SP to a number not a percentage.-Stop the card album being a time use item, but limit space by number of cards, and not types ( 5 diffrent cards use up the same space as 5 same cards) and pay to increase space along all characters.(characters should not share album, krafka service/mail box is needed)-Increase size of krafka storage, but merge it along all characters. On buying storage increase shouldnt be per character.-Limit size of 2 character slots. People will hate this but it makes sense.-Bring back old diffrent weapon/armor types to class, rember the days when a swordman could use a mace.			"

												To most Ragnarok 1 players of course they won't initially like it because it did not stick with the original, I was a former player of Ragnarok 1. But I adapted and fell in love with this game, not bad for me, no overcrowding of merchants on prontera, no deadbranch abuse on low level places, the graphics still give the Rune-Midgard feel, I like the questing system. This is a game worth trying honestly, even though it is bashed I think it is on it's early stages, there is still room for more cool updates.  Plus, weapons and armor are cool. More power to Ragnarok 2. I hope more people and former Ragnarok players adapt on this game : )			"

												I'm probably - no, definitely - biased when it comes to my feelings on this game. I had been waiting for it's release for years since I was an avid fan of the original. RO II isn't terrible but it isn't RO and does not really give me the happy feelings of nostalgia I was hoping for. The original release of this game back on the original engine they had, looked and felt much more like RO than this version. So, basically, if you want a cute (and free) MMORPG to play give it a shot but don't bother if you're coming for the RO nostalgia feels. Also, I couldn't play it via Steam because I had done the early registration via the website.			"

												Unfortunately, this is a prime example of why Korean games and Western games differ, in all the wrong things. Economy based, grind fest with repeatative music from the very get go. While it has a certain charm style-wise (as all Korean mmo's do) it's a pretty distraction at best. It's a cookie cutter mmo....same tired concept of unoriginal questing and there's absolutely nothing inspiring about it. If you enjoy cute things, then go ahead and play....if it was cute and had substance that would be one thing but it's just cute, that's it. Find me a slightly chibi style mmo that doesn't have the same exact play style and quest system and you will have found the unicorn. I don't see how these same style mmo's keep getting made and never managing to be original as they continue on. I've been fooled before by good looking Korean mmo's, Lineage 2, Aion, Rf Online, Terra online, and been disappointed. I guess there's a big enough population of gamers that like these uninspired things.  "

												I had high hopes for this game.I'm not much for any MMO but the original Ragnarok was a lite hearted and fun game with a great comunity of people and lots of creative astetic and functional customisations.While technically those mechanics are in this incarnation, this game does not use them propperly to get a cohesive feel to them.the voiceovers at (least for the english) are HORIBLE, probably the worst use of voice and animation I have seen in a long time.with the choice of font color your eyes are drawn to the summery for a quest and not the plot dialogue that would motivate the character in world. For me it was so distracting that I on more than one occasion was scratching my head and had to go back and read the dialogue again.some of the quests are simply find a character, then that starts another quest where you have to talk to that same person again.Early on there is a time where you meet the person then have to talk to them four times, this could have been swayed by just haveing an actual dialogue with the person.When you meet the king you are given the offer to become an apprentice knight.then it actually says that your character says yes. removing your choice.In a medium founded on naritive (JRPG) and a style founded on choice and player empowerment (3D quest based games) this fails at both.I love the look and feel of the Ragnarok world. (Poorings are just to cute to ignore) but without a solid story to add richness to the world and more consideration given to the NPCs and the PC choices this one is going to likely be forgotten fast.However I am considering reinstalling the original Ragnarok to get my pooring fix in a fun and lite hearted world. Just because it's 3D and looks nice does nto mean it is better.			"

												Has some nice ideas, the card and DNA systems are nice tweaks, but very grindy.However it's not only a boring MMORPG, no it's also the one with the most annoying, nerf-grinding quests i ever had to endure.Sometimes you just run from one NPC to another in circles, with no sidequests to lighten the mood, just to talk to them. I had a hilarious amount of quests where i had to talk to the same NPC that gave me the quest, again.All quests with exception of one where ""Kill * of * enemies"" or ""Collect * of * objects"", really... ALL of them.Not to mention the bugs and typos...There are far better MMOs.'nuff said.			"

												Not a terrible game, even if it fails as a proper sequel to RO.The mouse-to-camera sensitivity is absurdly high, and there is a serious problem with the mouse getting stuck, making interacting with NPCs or targetting/changing targets very difficult (As using TAB is inconsistent at best)I haven't gotten terribly far into the game (Currently Lv20), and they're still adding in new features (Or rather, features that were originally in RO), but the gameplay is solid enough. Animations aren't strong, but the visuals aren't bad. The sound is effective and meaningful, but I don't know about the soundtrack because I always turn that♥♥♥♥♥♥off.Not the first MMO I'd recommend, but worth a try if you have a couple friends.

												It's impossible to register through Steam. The WarpPortal account creation pops up but no matter what names you try, it says they've all been taken. So I went to sign up through the official webpage, and all the names I had tried were actually available. Awesome job there. And strike one. Then when downloading through the official site, it failed about ten times before I finally got it to work. Strike two. When I finally got it up and running, I got an error about how it couldn't run alongside another program [@1], and it crashed. These crashes happened about five times in a row and I never got past character creation. Googling found a very unhelpful thread with no answers or solutions, so strike three, it's out. I had really looked forward to trying out this game. I think the graphics look really cute and nice, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Uninstalled.			"

												HIGHLY UNDERRATED Game. I see negative reviews everywhere mostly from RO1 fans.Why can't everyone see this game as an INDIVIDUAL game? Everyone is comparing it to RO1 simply because it holds the ""Ragnarok Online"" title... It's a strong MMO on its own!The reason why it's called RO2 is that it's still based on Norse Mythology and follows the same characters, monsters, and possibly the story from RO1 on a different engine and on a 3D interface!The developers are doing everything they can to make this game better and more approachable! Just a few days ago from when this review was written, WarpPortal has taken over RO2 Development! This is a sign that they will never give up on this game! So don't lose hope, come join us and play with the AMAZING community it holds! (The people here are amazing, seriously)Give it a chance as an INDEPENDENT MMORPG and STOP posting your hate comments!If people started talking ""♥♥♥♥♥♥and hate"" about you and started ignoring and hating you simply because you're not perfect and made mistakes, how would that make you feel?

												Is a very good game, but bruh, you really need friend to play after master lvl or at least, one active guild (what is very hard to find thse days) You can lvl up from 1 to 50 in 15 hours, even more if you use the V.I.P coupon they give you in your first quest. (8 days duration) it helps a lot if you do all the quest, once you reach lvl 50, you can changue to Master Level what is kind hard because the  lvl 50+ mobs, they change a lot because they get like 3 time more stats than lvl 49 mobs.But once you get all the way to 50, people will help you as long as you ask for it in public channel and i don't know if this is spoil or something, my english is kind terrible but i try as best i can to tell you all this game is kind awesome, just a little hard for beginers.

												Compared to the old Ragnarok Games, RO2 felt very choppy. Movement, using the UI and how it interacted with the overall gameplay felt very rigid, and just really unpleasant because it felt like it took forever to do things, felt like you were lagging and it would not allow you to multitask very well. The graphics arent bad and it is better than what I expected.Some of the questlines were also not really newbie friendly, it forced you to look externally for answers at such an early stage which was kinda disappointing. This game would be overall okay if the controls felt more fluid and the quests were relatively easier to understand.			"

												So i loved playing RO1 and had many toon of decent level, so like everybody else when i heard that Gravity Inc. was doing a sequel to RO1 i was be on happy, once finally relesesed my happiness along with my brother and my father (who also played RO1 regurly) was in complete dissapointment. we all have good comps that should have no problem running a game with this kind of graphic, but alas we got nothing but lag spikes and errors loading the game. the graphics we very shotty parts of the screen wouldnt load properly, aslo when my toons would run up hills my toon would shrink as if the areas wasn't built big enough.Now onto the gameplay itself. Firstly the idea of a novice class (which made RO1 original) was missing from the game, and was replaced (like everybody said) and very poor imitation of WOW which started you off already one of five classes taking away an already enjoyable start of the game, and as if to and salt to the wound the classes weren't even built enjoyable every class started of with generic MMORPG skill set, plus like im sure everyone will agree warriors (swordsmen) should able to carry every weapon except for wizardy items (wands, staff etc...) the last thing im gonna mention is the NPC voicing... the historian at the beginning of the game sounds like a 60-70 year old woman despit being more closer to 18-30ish in looks and a man who is more of the same age, and also not big in size sound like a big man..... over all this game reeks with poor quality work, and a lack of understanding on how a MMORPg should be			"

												TL;DR: Mediocre MMO, but the nostalgia's still nice for those who played RÖ1. Better with friends, boring alone.As a MMO, RÖ2 is below average, quality-wise. Some might chalk it up by saying it's Free2Play, but I've played better F2P MMOs before; RÖ2 gives an aftertaste of unfinished game, a Forever Beta whose developpers bit more than they could chew. The character design isn't particularly original, and the voices are standard. The graphics are okay at first, but get rather dull after the tenth hour. However sometimes you will stumble upon a beautiful scenery (and sometimes, stumble through), but it's not often enough to make it acceptable. The gameplay is entirely standard; the good thing is that you won't be lost with the controls, but if you were looking for something original/different: look somewhere else. As for the story, it isn't grandiose, but if you played the first game, you might like some elements of it.One big issue in the game, that I hinted at earlier, is how buggy it is, and how little the GM support is. In all the time I played, I managed to contact a GM only once, and managed to get stuck in [trees, houses, mountains, invisible rocks, broken stairs, dunes, out of bound, water, wall, boat, ...] more times than I can count. In one occurence, I got stuck in a mountain; when trying to use a move skill to get out, I warped through the map, fell under it and stayed stuck. When I logged out and back in, I was 3 zones ahead, monsters were 10+ levels above me. Another time, I simply swum my way out of the map, then fell again; same scenario. Although it was hilarious when it was discovered, this kind of bug quickly grew annoying.That being said, if you've played RÖ1 before, and have some friends who did too, you might want to give it a try; despite everything, it's still fun to play it with friends, even if only halfway through.

												I have mixed feelings for this game.Keep in mind that I have played and given this game a chance twice, with several years gap between. I first played when it was newly-released, for around 2 days, then quit because of the disappointment of the game being completely different from RO1 and boring. I played it a second time recently in Spring of 2016... and this time I did not care if it was nothing like RO1. Sadly it had me leaving in just 1 full day from how unplayable it was.On the up-side, I do recommend TRYING it at least once, because it's free (to start), decent character creation options, low-lag, the armor is beautifully-designed, and overall the game has beautiful art, especially if you are into the anime or hand-painted aesthetic and wanted to see more stylish, late-teenage, anime-style characters in games. It has a few features which are fairly unique(the card system, job costume, etc), but aside from that it's a very standard point-click-hotkeyspam combat MMORPG. There will be many familiar monsters from the first Ragnarok Online game, which can be nostalgic, and they look beautifully-made with nice animations.I liked the beautiful male NPC ""Eremes Guile"" as well, who is also from RO1. Nostalgia again (and eye candy which is fairly rare in gaming to be made for female taste).However, even with all of these things that I liked, the cons simply outweighed the pros for me.Also, if you get addicted to all MMORPGs easily, and are poor, I recommend that you don't even try. You will save more money by buying and playing a non-DLC console game than this.The biggest con of all, would have to be the inventory. All throughout the game, before I could even reach the first town (Prontera), I was struggling like crazy to manage my inventory. No matter how much I tossed out useless items or stored stuff in the storage, the inventory kept getting jammed with things I wanted to keep like good armor I could use soon and good/rare cards. At this point, you really can tell that the game is using a fairly aggressive psychological manipulation to get you into buying inventory bags/slots/whatever. It's not ""BUY THIS OR WE BAN YOU"" type of coercion, it's ""BUY THIS OR TOSS YOUR FAVORITE ITEM"", and to me, this is really still a similar concept to blackmail, and even for an F2P game it felt like an incredibly heavy pressure. I probably have played every F2P anime-style MMORPG out there, and this may be one of the worst offenders.At this point, I simply just quit the game even though I had been enjoying the actual game fine a few minutes before.This is really a game-breaker for me, and even if the game is an F2P model, I expect F2P games to be free-playable without so much stress and pressured near-coercion. Otherwise I would stayed and have bought tons of costumes since I am a fashion addict in MMORPGs. Then again, if the costumes were gachapon-only (I cannot remember if RO2 was), I would also not buy them.So, if you want to play a game without spending money, and not tossing every precious in-game item you have earned, this is not for you in the long-term.Honestly, the scrapped old version of RO2 (Gate of the World) was way funner even when it was still in-development with many bugs. Mainly because it had no cash shop to restrict your gameplay, and it was actually unique in many ways (weapon leveling, movement physics, etc), but sadly it doesn't exist anymore, because why make a fun unique game, when you can make a cash-grab instead?I really tried to love this game, I want to love this game, I really do... but I just can't stay playing longer than a day.

												The game is alright if you considered the fact that it did not follow how Ragnarok 1 is and its just your typical MMORPG. However, the fact that its already out(not in Beta stage or Alpha stage) will get you questioned, because of the extreme amount of bugs you will encounter throughout the game. Not to mention, just recently, the update from the game had a malicious program in it according to all 3 of my antivirus. Definitely need to check that out, it may be a false positive, but you can't be too sure unless they have proof that the program is needed by the game and is proven harmless.			"

												Ragnarok online is a free to play anime MMO. It's a very time consuming game with LOTS to do. Though it can be very unfair and challenging at times (I'm looking at you master level test) but that doesn't change how fun it is. I think I spent like 100 hours on this game and enjoyed it all. Though there are microtransactions, they don't even seem like they're there. This game has so much to offer and I don't even think I scratched the surface of it. So anyway yeah get this game. Even if you don't like anime, it's very addicting and the multiplayer system works very well and it can be very fun to play with other people and it also makes the game 100% easier. It was one of the very first games I ever played on steam and it's always gets fixes and updates regulary. SO download this and have fun! :D			"

Characters and classes was alright. but it need to be work on. storyline was ok, it's like the normal RPGs would have, ""no kick"" or a hook to keep playing the story. i got board and start to hunt and travel all over the place. mainly helping other players with missions that they want to do. so there no side.. well i don't want to say it like it didn't have any side missions. but there wasn't anything i enjoy playing. beside doing the main quest and side- quest. i do not recommend play this game. you will be board in the first week.

												There is no other game that emphasises the MMORPG like Ragnarok series. Have classes to choose and chain of classes which enables you to increase your arsenal of skills. Quests are straightfoward. Dungeons available. Auction is always there if your storage is full. Huge map. Great storyline in quests. Thats pretty basic but no other game that have originality like Ragnarok.The thing is the costumes,armor,mounts... basically every other equipment//accessories are limited and this makes the exitement goes down once playing after a while. Events should give unique equipment//accessories which are not bound by high levels. To wrap it up the equipments//accessories should have a vast variety so players' characters seem more unique than others which drives them to play for long hours because they want to stand out with their unique characters.People are saying trash about the game just because they can't get a good view//graphics of the game or lagging, blame on your Rig for being low spec. Judge the game by the mechanics or base story.I would recommend this game to most of my friends and hope game Devs could change it up a little to make it more 'UNIQUE"".

												Look I'm going to be honest. Look at my time spent in-game and others giving bad reviews. One guys says its generic, another says its buggy and boring, ect. But I'm going to give you the truth here. I played it for a little bit yes and it gives you missions to start you off so you know what to do and your not thrown into a world although I do wish some MMO's would do that then throw some cool little ""did you know"" hotkeys or shortcuts to do certian actions during loadscreens but I digress. RO2 is honostly an empty game. It feels empty because not even the trailer can give you a story to what your fighting for. They love using P2W tactics and take a backseat to players trying to grind the hell out of levels. If your reading this and you want an MMORPG worth it then think like a Miner looking for a job. Does it give good rewards and worth the grind? Am I stuck in one job or can I also haul coal or metal refine it ect.? Does mining give me holidays off, medical and dental? This game in those aspects is equal to a parent giving a 5 year old a plastic shovel and telling em to dig for dino bones.			"

The launcher recognized my user ID, but didn't recognize the password. Made new account on the warpportal window from Steam! (Keep in mind that I used THE SAME mail every time,because the only conflict on the account was on the userID). Finally it works, linked account with Steam. The launcher starts with an update. Few seconds, need restart of the game. Restart game. Launcher needs language update,please restart! Restart game. Launcher updates again. Please restart. ♥♥♥♥in' restarted again and again!

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.I quit the game running ym hands through my hair and slapping mself to help make me feel like I was alive again.  @_xWow. Didn't think the game would be bad as I heard the first game was spectacular. Wrong. I got a headache from this game due to monotonous crap, horrible camera controls (spent a good 30 minutes fixing it), and the lack of character individuality. My god, there were five characters that looked the same only that the colors were different. On the topic of colors, they were washed out and muted, more like pastels. The color black does not exist nor does any definition in design and contrast. The little Pouring icon at the top of this store page is much better art than in the actualy game. At least cuter in my opinion.Of the ""massive World of Ragnarok"" there are only four jobs that the six classes can do. Speaking of gameplay, your inventory gets filled up quickly with no NPCs around to sell to, and you have to buy another pack to make it bigger, but that takes a while. An estimated three hours of playing the game and I never left the local area you start the game in. The chat controls are the worst, spending a good 15 minutes trying to join a public chat from the ""normal"" or general one I was in and back, especially they don't list the channels you can join and go searchingfor the proper channel name. So what's good about this game? For newbs like me who never played the original Ragnarok, this game was horrible. For elites who played the original, this game was horrible and a big letdown. From many I heard from it's severely lacking much from the original. yeah, it's a new game, yeah it's different, but not a good diiferent.The name brought me here after much praise and this game made me walk away with a big headache and three hours wasted, as well as probably most of my brain cells, most likely after being given a mission to ""find the mailbox"" (which was right behind me) and given a reward, and then ""talk to the mailbox"" (again given a reward)  when you click to talk to it. I think this sums up your first three hours of this game: When not hurting cute bouncing things was ""accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward, accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward, accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward. Kill Pourings. Accept mission, run to mission, complete mission, accept reward. Kill Pourings.""    After three hours....  ""Yay level 2"" -_- .......  so yeah, I've lost my mind. Game over.P.S.: You can't complete your mission unless you accept the reward so if your pack is full the mission will not be completed. -_-			"

												How should I begin? First, i already played this game on Steam, some time ago. When i launch the game, a Warpportal window appears,that says that I need to register. The only other option - ""Cancel"", which closes the game. I go to warpportal homepage and try to retrieve my password. Didin't work. Made a new account. The launcher recognized my user ID, but didn't recognize the password. Made new account on the warpportal window from Steam! (Keep in mind that I used THE SAME mail every time,because the only conflict on the account was on the userID). Finally it works, linked account with Steam. The launcher starts with an update. Few seconds, need restart of the game. Restart game. Launcher needs language update,please restart! Restart game. Launcher updates again. Please restart. ♥♥♥♥in' restarted again and again! This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a launcher game.			"

												There is no other game that emphasises the MMORPG like Ragnarok series. Have classes to choose and chain of classes which enables you to increase your arsenal of skills. Quests are straightfoward. Dungeons available. Auction is always there if your storage is full. Huge map. Great storyline in quests. Thats pretty basic but no other game that have originality like Ragnarok.The thing is the costumes,armor,mounts... basically every other equipment//accessories are limited and this makes the exitement goes down once playing after a while. Events should give unique equipment//accessories which are not bound by high levels. To wrap it up the equipments//accessories should have a vast variety so players' characters seem more unique than others which drives them to play for long hours because they want to stand out with their unique characters.People are saying trash about the game just because they can't get a good view//graphics of the game or lagging, blame on your Rig for being low spec. Judge the game by the mechanics or base story.I would recommend this game to most of my friends and hope game Devs could change it up a little to make it more 'UNIQUE"". But so far my first time playing the game for few hours was great.			"

												Look I'm going to be honest. Look at my time spent in-game and others giving bad reviews. One guys says its generic, another says its buggy and boring, ect. But I'm going to give you the truth here. I played it for a little bit yes and it gives you missions to start you off so you know what to do and your not thrown into a world although I do wish some MMO's would do that then throw some cool little ""did you know"" hotkeys or shortcuts to do certian actions during loadscreens but I digress. RO2 is honostly an empty game. It feels empty because not even the trailer can give you a story to what your fighting for. They love using P2W tactics and take a backseat to players trying to grind the hell out of levels. If your reading this and you want an MMORPG worth it then think like a Miner looking for a job. Does it give good rewards and worth the grind? Am I stuck in one job or can I also haul coal or metal refine it ect.? Does mining give me holidays off, medical and dental? This game in those aspects is equal to a parent giving a 5 year old a plastic shovel and telling em to dig for dino bones.			"

												During the early stages of your life and level up, you can play the game independent of a party or a team, which is my play style, but as you go further, the population decreases, and people lose interest. You eventually get stuck at a point where you need to have a party to succeed, but because no one else is online anymore and stop playing, you cant really progress anymore.			"

												Eh....tried it out after RO1....bitterly dissapointed with the back and forthing of gather/slayer quests. Just doesn't feel right, RO1 will always be a thousand times better.My initial thoughts: ""Wow, RO1 was brilliant so a 3D make will obviously be just as good if not better!"" (I tend to enjoy my 3D games more)Boy was I mistaken. Everything just seems so...undercooked if you know what I mean. Like they've tried to make it really epic and just gave up halfway and just chucked it out. Feels like there is WAY more room for improvement.3/10: Could be helluva lot better but if you're just looking for an 'MMO' with a lot of killing and back and forthing this could be your lucky day. Personally RO1, a 2.5D game is better, more crafted and even though it's theoretically a grind game...just so betterly executed.			"

												Too big of a paywall. I understand f2p games charging money. I'm the first person to defend a company when people complain they can't do everything for free. The company has to make money. That benefits not only the company, but the consumer. The more money they have to invest into their product means the more money they can spend to develop new classes, dungeons, zones, quests, etc. With that said, I think the paywall for this game comes too soon, and it is too restrictive. Lots of companies no the free to play model excellently. Albion Online is b2p but f2pafter.I don't mind cosmetics, but I do mind items that gives n advantage that a non player can't combat, plain and simple. Otherwise it is a good game. If you're well off with money and don't mind spending money on the game you love, then I say give Ragnarok 2 on line a try. But honestly, if you don't mind, and even enjoy older graphics, gives Rangarok Online a try instead.			"

												Ragnarok Online 2 is a free to play MMORPG from the same Korean developer that made Ragnarok Online.  It worked, looked good, played easy, sounded ok, was understandable. They took the lore of Ragnarok and made a western style MMORPG with it.  RO2 is Better than Ragnarok online, IMHO.  Try it, if you like MMORRPGs.For more info:

												Based on my experiences of playing this game for about 20hrs (the Steam timestamps are somewhat screwed up here) I'd like to warn fellow sympathisers of Ragnarok Online who are rushing into its successor with high expectations:I expected Ragnarok 2 to have something to do with the original Ragnarok Online. I installed the game full of anticipation it would be a Ragnarok Online in 3D ! With a beautiful and diversive world to explore ! With new skills and a better fighting system ! I'll be able to make a completely individual char, a wholly black knight and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that ! This will be awesome !After starting the game I figured that I would be disappointed in even my lowest expectations.- The gameplay is a simple WoW copy and utmost boring. Why would you limit the fights to auto-attack rounds in a game like this? Let me fight myself.- The ""open world"" is more of a path you follow - from village to village - doing your repetitive 'kill 20 of these', 'get 10 of those' quests. Always the same type of quests with no emotionally involving content behind. Couldn't they think of anything to evoke the player's passion about playing this game?- Using the exact same job class system as in its predecessor I was very surprised to see that Monks now can't use the Acolyte skills they acquired before. I am sure there are similar rip-offs with other job classes. I am not against inventions, improvements and new stuff but there is nothing positive about this.- Everything is very colourful and cute but the game fails to surround me with spectacular, astonishing or inspiring environments - Ragnarok Online does that even in 2D.- I don't know why but I had difficulties crafting items, using items, buying items, trading items, ... maybe it's just me but it felt very complicated and not as conveniently accessible as it should be.- Almost all usable items are timed, which makes you lose interest in getting or using those in the first place.- Do you remember the feeling that you got in Payon Dungeon? Orc Dungeon? When entering Prontera? The Geffen fields? The Comodo Beach? You won't get even close here...- ""Ragnarök"" is an event in the old Germanic and Viking mythology. The meaning behind all terrains, quests, names and monsters in Ragnarok Online is a combination of different culture's mythologies (i.e. Munak and Bongun referring to Chinese Jiangshi, you also find Korean, Taiwanese and other references).Now in Ragnarok 2 I am told to obtain the crown of the Sunflower King. wtf?I wished it was a Ragnarok Online turned into 3D graphics, with an active fighting system, some cool character individualizing stuff and maybe even some open world building elements (I'd love to build my own in-game house with my own obedient Kafra servant) but what we got is all annoying stuff about WoW put together in pretentious Anime style, claiming to be the successor of Ragnarok Online. I am sorry but I couldn't think of anything positive to say about this game. I guess the in-game music is not as disturbing as it possibly could've been. A few musical references to its predecessor would have been nice, though.			"

												Not as much depth as the original as far as the class system goes, but that doesn't necessarily leave much to be desired. To the contrary this simplifies (maybe oversimplifies) things in a managable way. I'm currently playing each of the the classes except Archer and each one is enjoyable. They're fun to play and each feels unique without feeling too much like the same classes from other MMOs. In short, it stands out and not just because of its heritage. However, its still mostly dependent on the cliches and tried and true formula of the genre, so if you're simply too jaded to try another MMO then stay away from this one, but I will tell you that its entertaining in its own right.Disclaimer: I didn't play the original, so I can't speak of the story-telling, quest-system, or over-arching game systems/structure. This is just my general opinion of a generally great MMO.			"

												Never played the first Ragnarok but I've played the phone version of the first one. And i can honestly say that I really like the graphics/game play of the first one (if the phone one is anything close to the actual first Ragnarok). Ragnarok Online 2 is a game that I personally enjoyed and from the first night of playing it me and my friend got to lvl 10. Now being the huge MMORPG fan that I am and like any MMO, Ragnarok 2 has some faults that any MMO will have. One of the biggest faults of RO2 is the grind between levels and the amount of exp that some quests will give you. In the early levels of RO2 you don't really realize the grind since it's not hard to level up a new character from.. lets say 1-10, then 10-15 and then 15-20. The leveling system is all good until you get to lvl 20 and then try and get to lvl 25 so that u can learn your claases new job (mine being thief going to rogue). With knowing that you can learn a new job soon and get some new moves, you get all pumped and go the hardest you can to lvl quickly. This is where you quickly notice the change in the exp rate and how much exp you need to actually lvl.....This is where the grinding starts to really get annoying. If Gravity fixed the leveling system past level 20, it would make the game a whole lot more fun and make it feel less than a chore. Over all I would recommend this game since it has bought me and countless friends that I have already recommended this game to hours of fun! My advice for this game is to make sure that you have a friend with you when you get to lvl 20, so you don't have to get bored out of your mind when trying to lvl!			"

												I like the long play aspect of the game and the variety of character types, weapons and armor choices, job system,  and the frequent server events. The storyline is okay it has its bumps and annoyances but its better than most. I like to explore and enjoy a game environment and you can do that if that is your thing up until Master Level and then it gets a bit difficult and monotonus unless you can find a really good guild. If you are a hard core gamer and love to kill things over and over you may tire of this game after achieveing all there is to do at master level. You can cash in this game but I have had fun without doing that.			"

												This is one of the best games ever. I have been playing MMO since Everquest. I never played the first Ragnarok so I am not comparing it. RO2 is so fun, you can have purple hair and do quests. The crafting is really legit and you get a mount. It is free to play so you pretty much are like oh ♥♥♥♥. The flying on brooms is awesome. I play with a group of friends and we all have the same color hair and we just grind forever, it's great if you like to play games with friends. if you dont like it you probably don't have friends. We played the version from playpark before it was out on steam.			"

												This game made me very angry with the registration process which took me an entire day and an alternate e-mail to make it work... Then I finally managed to play it.I've played to level 10 and it's not as bad as those critics tend to depict it, the Kara is an original and enjoyable system, the quests for now are balanced between story-wise and short-farming, there is an engaging story, nice graphics and good mechanics.I've played the first RO for two years and I've got to say, RO is unbeatable, but give this game a chance, you might enjoy it as I do, it's free after all.

												Before playing this game throw all your notions of the original out the window, this game is nothing like that. RO2 is more of a 'WoW Clone' instead of being a 'true' sequel in terms of gameplay and structure. That being said, it is not a bad game especially for being completely free. Fans of the original should keep an openmind should they wish to check it out. If you're a fan of standard MMOs then this is not a bad option. Visuals are decent but some spell effects look somewhat lazy, character models are good and the musi is alright but there are some odd quips. Overall 3.5/5, its free so you got nothing to lose in trying it out.			"

												I loved the original Ragnarok Online, so I was really excited to try this sequel~ Unfortunately, RO2 is absolutely NOTHING like the original RO at all. It's a very generic budget 3D MMO, full of bugs, poorly translated and exceedingly laggy -_- It does make a few vague references to the original RO though, like there were Porings in the starter area... so... that was nice, I guess.Stay away from this abomination of a game.

												Overall: It's a great game if you have a connection to RO1 & want some time away from the serious games. Not so great if you want to feel you accomplished something. RO1 was the epitome of grind/reward.I played RO1 from closed beta to at Niflheim, and was in some of the very serious guilds. It's fun to see how the old was integrated, but it's VERY different. The world & monsters are AMAZING, but I get a bit annoyed with all the ""run there, talk to XXX"" quests. The quests are rarely confusing but most are too easy (laughable vs RO1 quests). Another annoyance is the incredibly low inventory space they give you.I experienced zero bugs and video performance was outstanding. I was blown away how big they made some of the maps & some of the intricate details. The character/NPC models & movements always make me smile. I'm not exactly sold on the music (still better than Lutie s***), but the SFX are good.			"

												No, really don't. Poorly optimized, really Pay2Win. The devs won't fix bugs since beta and lastly, GMs won't punish misbehaviour. If you're into hacking, this game isn't worth either because you'll get a lot of FPS drops from ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere, no matter what rig you have. The only thing this game aimed correctly, was the good ol' grinding of Ragnarok Online, but limited the options exponentially.			"

												Ragnarok Online 2 is pretty controversial among Ragnarok fans, I find most dont like it. That being said I myself dont dislike the game, even if it does have a good deal of pay to win features. I feel like it might have actually been better off if it had not used the Ragnarok IP, it probably would not have gotten so much hate if it just did its own thing. I find most of the hate really is just because the Ragnarok name got ""dragged through the mud"" so to speak. Now, that being said I feel like if you are not familiar with old Ragnarok, you might find Ragnarok Online 2 much more enjoyable, especially if you dont mind grind or pay to win in your anime styled MMO. I have really mixed feelings about RO2 but I know some people do enjoy it. its definitely not the worst MMO on Steam.			"

												Ragnarok Online was awesome, this... not so much. It's been in development way too much and it still feels like the game isn't even close to being finish, which it probably really isn't. It's buggy and has lost the charme Ragnarok Online had. When I first heard about it I was looking forward to it but after I've played it I have to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, specially not if they've played the old Ragnarok Online before and love it.

												Dont mind the negative reviews, It's not really a pay to win game. You can achieve the level cap without spending money. But there are certain quests that needed a party in order to finish it( Because of the difficulty of the monster) The good news is, the community is good and some are willing to help(based on my experience).

												SEE THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME HERE?!! DO YOU SEE IT??!!! NOW SMELL THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF IT. NOW ♥♥♥♥ OFF. NOW COME BACK. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS THE FIRST MMO GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED, RIGHT?! WELL SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP MISTER I-PLAYED-TOO-MUCH-MMO-TO-KNOW-THAT-THIS-ONE-SUCKS♥♥♥♥♥Yeah, The game is bugged. Yeah, It's infected. But it's a really lovely game to me. And even though it's ""just like any mmorpg game"" I still find the appearance very cool and bright. It brings me joy. The community are pretty cool aswell! They're very friendly and i met the coolest people ever, There! They were fun and lovely!Now, I wouldn't say that you're required to play the game. You're not even forced to play it. In fact, Don't even dare to touch it! It's mine. I play it. Stop playing this!....I'd recommend this game if the infection danger got lost and never came back.			"

												So I got this game near when it came out, created a charecter and forgot about it. Didn't play it till a year and a half later decide to give it a try with a friend, start the game up remember I have a charecter log in, and find out that I am max level, with never playing it once. I still have level 1 gear just max level. Am I just that good? I am going to say not recommend just for the fact that it was a game I just couldn't help but laugh at.			"

												This game (even with the reboot) was quite a disappointment to the expectations on what a Ragnarok Online sequel should be like. They tremendously simplified the game, removed many monsters, classes and characteristic features from the original. They also over-modernised the stat system and character progression. When I tried the game (2013), the graphics were unpolished - shadows were very pixellated and the tree foliage often obstructed the camera.Can't really think of any good sides, they removed all that made the original Ragnarok Online and replaced it with a generic modern MMORPG. Pity.(Actually there were some concepts that I liked more in the pre-rebooted version - it was very different from the original RO, but at least it had its own distinct flavour. This new one is just bland :/ )			"

Farming is not hard but not easy. All jobs such as cooking provide you with different benefits, feel free to go what you want. The game has wonderful graphics, amazing for a free to play game.People may give this 0/10 for not living up as a sequel, but that is not it's job, I am reviewing this game, not how well it did compared to it's predecessor.Overall, this game has amazing music, basic to moderate story, great graphics, wonderfully polished classes and professions, bosses, player interactions.

												Awsome game if your into Ragnarok Universe and likes a generally standard mmo. Not so great if you hate anime graphics style and mmos like TERA or RaiderZ. But personally I love it. Cant recommend you to give it a whirl. I mean hey its free to play no restrictions.			"

												In all honesty, I very much recommend this game because it is a great sequel to the first Ragnarok and has tons of things to do. The players are very helpful, Joyus, and amazing all together. This is just a emersive and amazing game with lots of amazing things about it.			"

												If you ever played Ragnarok Online in more then just a hey its a free game lets check it out. I think you owe it to yourself to check this game out. Seeing all the 2D sprites in 3D is very Nostalgic and can make you enjoy the game for what it is just another mmo but it reminds you of old times as well!			"

												I'm a big RO fan <3 played the very first one and I am glad to say that I've also enjoyed playing RO2. Since is still a pretty new game it still has a lot of patches and areas that need polishing, but as a whole, RO2 is a great MMO game :) I especially LOVE the community in here. I've made serveral good friends and really enjoy fighting at their sides! Try it out! :D			"

												I was an enormous fan of the original Ragnarok Online. I find II to be fun, but perhaps too much like its obvious successor, WoW, to be worth playing for long periods of time. The graphics and its eternal cuteness is a nice, refreshing change, though. And as a 'Free For Play', you can't go wrong with the price. For my own personal taste, I give it a definite pass. However, for someone who wants a taste of WoW, with a charmingly cheerful atmosphere and no cost to goof off, Ragnarok Online II is not your worst choice!			"

												I've never been one for MMORPG's. I've tried a couple but none of them seem to pull me in very far and I get bored and leave in the first couple hours. But this game is one amazing exception. The artstyle and look of the game is beautiful, so colourful and detailed. The voice acting is really good as each character and NPC has a voice rather than just a silent protagonist. Gameplay is as you would imagine it to be with an MMORPG with you levelling up and buying new skills with your points. This game has some nice additions, my favourite being the 'Card' system. When you kill and enemy there is a chance he will drop a card, this card then can be equipped and add special bonus stats to you character. That one thing alone makes me want to go out and fight as many monsters as I can and believe me there are many, all of which looks beautiful and unique. The story is well crafted and I've managed to stay with it with no confusion at all. For a free to play, you should definately get it and play with friends. It get's a lot better when you create a party and devise your strategies together which become incredibly effective.10/10			"

												All fans of original Ragnarok Online will find many nostalgic moments in this game: familiar monsters who still look awesome even in 3D, characters with very well known names (like Eremes Guile) or nice gags like Green Zeppelin band of Rockers who will ask you to bring their lost instruments and who sing about some girl buying a stairway to Valhalla. Unfortunately, it's a bad MMO in everything else. It's nice to dive deep in the world of Rune Midgard again, but it's really disappointing that RO2 does not deliver what you would expect from ressurrection of legendary MMO. I would recommend this game only to hardcore fans of original Ragnarok. At least to see what it's like now.			"

												First things first guys. If you want a game with no bugs, or P2W, then pay a monthly fee. As you can see I like this game for many reasons, but I will be unbias in my review. Let's prove it by talking about the downfalls:The three worse parts about RO2 are the leveling and the [lack of] PvP, and the release of new content. In my thousands of hours of WoW, it is fair to say, that a much better Quest line system from lvl 1 to max level is available in other games. The leveling is very, very grind-till-you-drop style. There are three kinds of Quests: 1. Kill this monster twenty times (some times for an item it drops to give to the quest giving npc) 2. Talk to this npc  3. Gather this item. Poor planning of Patch release dates that bring new content to the game. There have been three, no wait, four new dungeons in six months added to the game. I have the best gear in the game (^^) but to be honest, a lot of people are either skipping new raid dungeons to go to the newest one, or moving to the most recent raid dungeons half geared from the one before it (my point is a ""new"" dungeon shouldn't become redundant after a month an a half). They would be better off releasing 4-8 dungeons a year all at once, or six months at a time, and letting players work through them tier by tier.Pvp is entirely under developed, but they did add a new PvP map, which is actually pretty awesome, if you have a DPS cahracter. Healers are not really needed unless they are a hybrid (DPS mixed with Support). There are three maps: 1. Colo (it is a big open circle so not really a map) on this map you free for all with 30 other players for 5 rounds and people are eliminated each round 2. WOE (don't even get me started) this is a poorly designed map with too many choke points and you can only enter with your guild (fyi: I am in a very large, strong guild) and the big, strong guilds always win (my guild is PVE based) 3. Jehoon Training Site (nice map and game play) uses a lane and tower mechanic like DOTA or LoL with merchants to buy buff scrolls and monsters in the ""jungle"" which you kill for a quest to obtain items and points to win the match or buff your team (also debuffs other team).PVE: The Good Stuff  : DThe best PVE content in my opinion is end-game. Like anything there are good and bad sides. Let's get one thing straight, I have done every raid a bunch of times on my own and in a guild, and they are all doable with Pugs (random people) aside from AoD (unless you are over-geared, but for review sake, let's assume you have gear from the tier below the raid you are doing). The bosses in the ten-man raids are all fun. They aren't too hard that you rage out and quit the game, but aren't too easy that you get bored and quit the game. There are two bosses though, that are extremely difficult to most people (Rat Master and Zoda). I did Rat Master with only pugged raids and killed it almost every time, but never the first try (Rat Master: two tries, four tries, nine tries.) in order to enter the Chaos Dungeon (newest raid dungeon). People say it is impossible and cry, and cry, and cry. Put simply, it takes chatting software, strategy, practice, and skill. Not every one is meant to make it to the furthest endgame content in any MMO, and those people, usually have trouble accepting it. For me, PVE is the best part of the game, and reason I have played so much.Interesting Content: There are a lot of unique aspects of the game that I hadn't seen in others. 1. Costumes: these are either ""grind your face off"" or P2W items, but overall it is an interesting and ""fun"" aspect of the game. The amount of power you get from costumes depends on how many Runes you put in it to give you bonus stats. You can also combine costumes with a chance to get ""rare"" costumes. I have only gotten one ""rare"" from thirty combines total over a span of months of game play, but lucky people in my guild have gotten ""rare"" costumes with only one fusion.  2. Cards: cards are only dropped from monsters and bosses. They give you bonus stats, and you can combine them to get rare cards, with great stat bonuses. 3. Phantom Pyramid: this is a P2W mini-game that you play in order to win content. It is based on RNG and can provide great rewards, or waste money (in-game or real life money) and time. Overall this is a great F2P *once you hit max level*. There are bugs, and the only real issue I have is the lack of attention put towards fixing those bugs faster. If you are a talented PVE player in any MMO game, be prepared to be surrounded by the most idiotic players you have ever seen (mainly Tier 1 raids and early game five man dungeons). You have to find people that are awesome players to raid with from the pugs you do, or join a great guild. There is a decent job system, and class system (with a nicely set up talent tree for each class). And even though I say to myself, ""why would the developers do that?"" more than I would like to, I ffind myself logging back in to play (way too often). PS: Thanks for reading my book.			"

												I like this game. Its fun and it was free. So remeber its free its for me. Cons: Had some issues patching and such. Wishe you can have it in Japanese or Korean with Eng Subtitles.Pros: Its free.I like free things.Its beautiful arty style.Awesome music. and it was free damn it.  ( Don't ALWAYS expect free to be super awesome. Yes Ragnarok isn't living up to its predocessor ( I can't spell)  Who cares? I had fun and I enjoy it with my family and friends.  8/10 for sure			"

												This game isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be and this coming from someone who played RO1 for years. If you don't expect the game to be something it's not (a AAA major mmo with an extensive raiding end game, RO1 in 3D etc) and just enjoy it a fun, casual game it's very enjoyable. The art style is pleasing, smooth with a beautiful color pallette and a very animated feel to it. The classes/stats have a build system that reminds me quite a lot of the original game and the story is even pretty decent, if the translation is very hit or miss. The highlights of RO2 are it's non-combat sytems like card collecting and pet building as well as crafting. I'm sure that someone who plays the game for 1000+ hours will find many things wrong but if you're looking for a light hearted escape with some old school mechanics it's well worth a few hours a week.

												I managed toplay the original RO for a bit, and after my experience with RO2 I can say that there is very little resemblance. But I say that in a positive way, not because I disliked RO, but due to RO2 being a much more WoWish grindy game, which fits in well with all the other big mmos out there. RO2 is a highly enjoyable game, and the content allows for alot of replayability. I'd highly recomend that you atleast play the first hour or so, and if your a fan of the anime aesthetic like myself: then you will love this game.			"

												As a note, this is my first time reviewing a game, so if it sucks.... Bite me ^^Ragnarok online 2 I picked up by accident, clicking it while trying to get rid of an ad, and then downloading it out of curiosity. I am quite pleased I did.The game itself is (from my limited experience), reminiscent of the playstyle of early WoW. Focused on the usual core classes and the first person MMO style I very much enjoy. The core classes are pretty varied, with option to diversify into two subsets when you get to a higher level. Atop the core classes there is a Job system which is while second to your class, has its own leveling system and, through proper use of the job system will allow you to level much quicker. Simply put, you can make your own armor and weapons, make your own potions, or buff yourself even as a fighter before a match, depending on the job you pick.The game is Free to play, so I would say it is at least worth a brief look at if nothing else. (As a note, the graphics start of fairly high end, nearly crippling my laptop on my first go. I would advise reducing the render distance to 2-3 to make sure it wont interfere with gameplay).I would say that the game greatly benefits from having friends to play with, but it can be a fairly enjoyable solo adventure, with a surprisingly interesting story. I expected a simplistic, insulting reason to just go and murder several areas of color swapped creatures. Instead I got a large variety of creatures, many different NPC's and points of view. While not perfect there has been honest effort to make an interesting and involved story in which you participate, including an earlier section whereupon you end up fighting your own repressed memories.I certainly would rate this worth a try, and possibly to keep.7.5/10 "

												Play it and decide whit your head don't trust all these negative reviews most of them admitted they didn't even play it more than 10 mins. It's a really nice game not too hard if you are alone but sure a lot better if you are in a party. Unfortunately it's still in the middle of development and every patch bring a bug and fix the previous one. On the other hand every patch bring a lot of new contents so the game has always something new to do also if you reached the cap lv. If you have patience to all the bugs that this game still has is a nice game (you can see how many hours i played until now). As EVERY free to play has buyable content that give you shortcuts to gain items and cute costumes to wear or mount to travel a bit more fast trought the world. The so hated vip pachage that increase your stats and your drop rate by 5 points it'a a nice thing but don't trust who say that makes this game a Pay to Win. It's a free game download it and try it you will see the items in the shop are not so powerfull, most of them are just costumes, or paints for your costumes. I repeat it's a free to play game but developers need to eat too so it's normal that there is a shop in game where you need to use real cash and where you will find helpfull things. You don't want bugs? You don't want and in game shop? go and play world of warcraft and pay 14 euros every month and don't try to jump a payment.PS yes there is a lag after the last patch but they recently improved the graphics and they still need to optimize it, they recently introduced a beta tester server and developers will be more focused on EU and USA servers soon AND even more these days is going on an event for new caracters created these weeks.

												I can't even create a character to get into the game to begin with. You know how you click things with you mouse & things are supossed to happen? Not in this game, I would try to click a button with my mouse & the game would select something an inch & 1/2 above my mouse. nothing I could do would correct this. I couldn't even get to the options menu to make the game full screen to see if that would work, know why? cause the button for the options menu is at the bottom of the game screen & I can't get my mouse low enough to select it without clicking outside the window. & for that matter, what mmo defaults to windowed mode?! This is the only mmorpg that I've ever seen do that. Every other one I've played make windowed mode a secondary option in the options menu with fullscreen as the default.In summary, this thing is so broken I can't even create a character. That should speak volumes for this steaming pile.			"

												A fantastic MMORPG. The graphics are stunning making you feel immersed in the game. Unqiue NPC's and carefully designed zones are everyone. This game hosts a wonderful community with a bit of the downside also though. Since this was originally a Korean MMO, the text has been translated yet it is very poor one at that which can lead to confusion for the player. Majority of the quests are the same as well us the usual of MMO's, re-using rigs. Ragnarok Online 2 is a point and click game which while seems annoying, it is also very useful too as the 3D graphics provides multiple mobs. One of my personal peeves of RO2 is the abundance of glitches, bugs, and others alike. I am able to experiance more then fifteen different ones a day (playing for maybe 10 hours or so). All in all, this is a wonderful game and absolutely my favorite.			"

Currently a level 40 Full support priest 2 things I do love about this game is that it's free to play. and most of the cash shop items are tradeable. So when people argue ""OH IT'S PAY TO WIN!"" well.. Yeah you can spend real money to get a SLIGHT EDGE but you can also buy THE EXACT SAME STUFF with in game cash. So yeah. The fun doesn't really start to happen until levels 15-20ish though.			"

												This game is P2W only if you care about PVP. Since I don't, I've enjoyed my time greatly just messing around in the world with the quests.Yes it does suck that costumes are random, but you can alleviate it a bit.People will pay good in-game coin for VIP passes, which can be purchased on the store for real money. Simply find people to sell those VIP passes, then go to the auction house (Yes there's an action house. It took me forever to realize that) and pick and choose which costumes you want. It may be a bit more expensive than trying your luck, but in the long run you can get exactly what you want for much cheaper than through the gambling system.			"

												I recemmend Ragonarok Online 2 for those that are looking to not be stuck in how the 'Predecessor' was.  Let's get a few things out the way, YES it can be grindy. ALL MMO's are, if you're playing one that doesn't make you work for it then you're just playing Trick or Treat. As a few review stated, It is a good starting MMO. But it isn't bad for veteran MMO players who wish to research and test different systems and even more so for those that don't mind hunting for to make themselves better in the end. The card system is still around with a better revamp in my opinion. And instead of the need to drop it in equipment you just attune it to yourself.			"

I was a long-time fan and player of Ragnarok Online back when I was in high school, but once WoW came along...well, we all lost a little of ourselves to that behemoth in its good days. Anyway, seeing this old gem get a repolish is nice, and there's lots of references to old RO still in this version. I enjoyed playing it up to a point, and if you can tolerate some of the Freemium stuff floating around (It doesn't effect the gameplay NEARLY as much as some of the other free to play MMO's out there like RotMG) it can be an enjoyable experience.

												Having played this game now for a good length after American launch, I can say that things are SLOWLY improving.  Is it a worthy successor of the original RO?  Some ways: yes, others: no.  The graphic style translated very nicely over to 3D and the game definitely has the Original's feel.What is missing, however, is the level of accesorizing, number of jobs and even number of skills available to classes.  Accesorizing is still there, but limited and difficult to find good accesories that are not limited time items.  They over came some problems the original had and dropped new ones in your lap.My #1 gripe remains the 'support' given to the game.  Warp Portal, the service used as launcher and forums/tech support system is unfriendly to use and hard to locate what you need.  If you make an error filling out a form, they don't tell you what is wrong.  When you ask for password recovery, you're still waiting on the promised email hours later.  GMs are still aloof with no way to contact one.To thier credit, they did manage to fix the chat issues.Overall, I say play the game. If you like it, you'll love it.  But pray you never get technical difficulties!			"

												this version of ragnarok online has smoother gameplay , less congestion and better graphics and sound then the original. the game makes it less difficult and confusing to learn to play and navigate the world setting. the controls are simple and fast to learn but the questing and grinding can seem tedious and redundant at times. its not with out its fault but over all its a improvement over the original.

												I gotta say I'm impressed with the level of detail that's gone into RO2. I was a long-time fan and player of Ragnarok Online back when I was in high school, but once WoW came along...well, we all lost a little of ourselves to that behemoth in its good days. Anyway, seeing this old gem get a repolish is nice, and there's lots of references to old RO still in this version. I enjoyed playing it up to a point, and if you can tolerate some of the Freemium stuff floating around (It doesn't effect the gameplay NEARLY as much as some of the other free to play MMO's out there like RotMG) it can be an enjoyable experience. Also PORINGS!			"

												I recemmend Ragonarok Online 2 for those that are looking to not be stuck in how the 'Predecessor' was.  Let's get a few things out the way, YES it can be grindy. ALL MMO's are, if you're playing one that doesn't make you work for it then you're just playing Trick or Treat. As a few review stated, It is a good starting MMO. But it isn't bad for veteran MMO players who wish to research and test different systems and even more so for those that don't mind hunting for to make themselves better in the end. The card system is still around with a better revamp in my opinion. And instead of the need to drop it in equipment you just attune it to yourself.			"

												It's a fun easy going MMO. You can't really expect it to be as impactful as RO. RO was out during a different time, when MMO's were less prevalant. The graphics are fun and pleasent. Overall it is a good game. The one major downfall for me is the mouse control. The selecting size for things is too small and causes you to select the wrong thing if you arn't careful. I hope that this is fixed.			"

												This game is great, before I thought it would be boring because it wasn't really like the original (the one I wanted to play) and when I tried it I was scared of lagging, but the last time I tried it and made my account for the last time I wasn't much of an MMoer and didn't know how to reduce lag, now I did, and I can play well. I like how you can be a vendor without sacrificing your ability to choose a class for fighting.It's also cool how you can get slots in your bag for free.This is a real F2P.PLAY IT. NOW!New Edit: I quit due to the fact I was tired of daily questing, since my important quests wouldn't show up after leveling soo much, New Edit #2: But now its fixing up. :O since I need an mmo to play I'm getting back to this and all other mmos ive been trying are utterless crap. This game is really smooth to play which is why I miss it, so if you haven't played World of Warcraft which lures you back in all the time, I reccomend this game.New Edit: its pretty fun and dungeons are good. Its balanced IMO and there arent so much skills but not so little. Im playing it again and probably not quitting for a while. My friend finally got to play it again on her new Windows 8. Now that was off-topic, its a pretty great game.

												For this game, i would say it has a butt ton of tech problems and i have had nothing but problems with my bottons and more..But for a game that is free, all i can say is that this is, no it is one of  the best free mmo i have ever played!I have played a ton of online game coming all the way down the free, cheap, to tottaly out of the mind expensive. Yes, the voices in the game lack quality, the card books have a time limmit... butThis is the first game i have played, that i haven't been rudely harrased for being a new player. I have played Final Fantasy 14 ARR since it first came out, i was a betta tester. My fiance began playing it latter to find the both of us being called rude, and tasteless names anyways we had taken our time to help others, craft, perk and dp with others. We still have to say it has, and is one of the most horrible expeinces iv ever had playing a game.. Nothing worse then eliete players with their swords suved so far up their... you know whats.. in a game that you had been playing the game since it was first launched...and be called a ""noob:. or even worce... I was called a d i c k s u c k e r in a dp for i told someone to wait for our tank.... Even in Guildwars 2, Eve online, Star craft 2, Star Trek i had the same issues... no one to help me figgure crafting, perks, or armour... nothing but stuck up and dishounorable people.This game has problems, but not in a way that makes you want to stop playing, but are hard to play around.For example, i have, and i mean HAVE to reset my bottons for crafting and armour everytime i click on them to use them.Another, in areas of the first lower level zones i get attacked by non existing enimies..That is a problem....Cards can be a problem, you have a time limmit when it comes up to your card album in whitch i find really anoiying.Infact, most of the stuff you do get has aa time limmit, it is at times a pay too win but it is free if you don't let it bother you too much.I have a good computer... iv had one one issue with a lag spike but that is erelevent... Their are progreming flaws, but i am sure they are working on it as we speak.. The main problems with some enviroments is the suroundings sometimes randomly building as you get closer to them, and i dont mean slightly i mean.. right infront of you sometimes it will sprout a christmas tree 0_0 or a building...The voices for the npc's are horrible... and some fit, that is due to budget.. and lazyness... can't complain too muchI would just take them out if it was my game and just make people read more, but its not my game .. XDThe music is.... AMAZING!  Some areas have music that is a tad anoiying but it fits the enviroments... Im not sure who made the music but i bow down to your greatness! The selects for your new creations if you want to start a new game are limmited, but aren't bad..Eyes, Eye color, hairstyles and faces, colors, voices.. are pretty good!The side jobs  are very limmited, Chef, Cook, Alch, and Light arm, Heavyarm. Pretty good. And the main jobs are also incredibly limmited, Swordsman, Arch, Healer, Mage, and Theif... They do have Another pick besides Humans, but only one other... can't complain too much.Generic is the name for it...The animations are okay, the idol animations make you look like for in a fastion show.. pretty stuid But, all and all.Not bad at all for a game that is FREE!

The animations are fun and the style is quite funny and good, one of the best anime styles that I have ever seen.

												A fun MMORPG to spend some time on, but fans of the first one be warned it is very different. You can still play the game solo, but early on, like many MMO's, you will need a party to run any dungeons and gain quality loot.			"

												Not a bad RPG. An Online RPG is a unique experience.Pros: Pretty okay backstory, Attention to art detail, RPG feelgreat controls.Cons: NoneImprovements: Needs more Emotion to missions and backstory. Feels lifeless. The text does hold its own in unique situations but it feels like a table top dungeon experience without the table.			"

												The game itself is nothing special. If you can overlook the English and the poorly voiced characters (best example being the beefy sounding general in the intro town who has very teenage anime boy features), its a cute game to play with others, grind over meaningless quests, kill some time and share some laughs.If asian MMOs aren't your cup of tea, you most certainly will not enjoy the game.

												I liked the game, but since it's not Ragnarock one, people aren't going to like it, just like they won't like Maplestory 2 and Mabinogi 2 even though both will probably be good games in their own right, not to say that this is a good game, there are definitely issues with it, but I had fun with it until everyone I played with quit.

												It's a fun easy going MMO. You can't really expect it to be as impactful as RO. RO was out during a different time, when MMO's were less prevalant. The graphics are fun and pleasent. Overall it is a good game. The one major downfall for me is the mouse control. The selecting size for things is too small and causes you to select the wrong thing if you arn't careful. I hope that this is fixed.			"

												Ok let me tell you what I think about the new Ragnarok 2. I am also a original Ragnarok series fan and let me tell you Ragnarok 2 is no where near the originial Ragnarok But there are the good things and the bad things. So heres my break down.So far ive reached lv 25/25 combat and job proffession so im pretty much halfway the game.1. Crafting System - 9/10The crafting system is simply great. At the beginning of the game you choose your specific proffesion. for example blacksmiths gather materials from minable rocks around the whole map while artisans carve out leathers from your hunted enemies. this system is really engaging and makes grinding more fun!2. Gameplay/Mechanics - 7/10Rather than the old skill point and click Ragnarok 2 lean more towards on modern MMORPG 3rd person view press ""tab"" to change target. I def. prefer the original series game mechanics. But im not gonna lie there is something interesting with the new system. The new skill mechanic has a combo counter and you use this counter to use stronger skills. A good combo strategic style of gameplay3. Raiding - 8.5/10Extremely difficult almost impossible to solo unless you are 20 levels over the dungeon. nonethless its how you play the game. with parties and cooperative. Raiding in ragnarok 2 is as fun as the original series. no difference from other mmorpg usually played in roles. tank etc etcoverall verdict, ill give it 2 thumbs up and would let everyone to try! its fun and its new forget the old era its suppose to be innovated.

												Had a tough time with the confusing ""sign up for an account"" through Steam, but I had previously signed up for an account through WarpPortal. Each time you launch RO2 from Steam's library, you're forced to ""sign up for an account"" instead of leading you to a ""sign in"" page for the game or any kind of UI. This problem has been the same since day of release on Steam.It would be nice to see this problem fixed instead of manually nagivating to my Steam folder > Steamapps > Common > Ragnarok Online 2 folder to delete WPLauncher.exe or rename to WPLauncher2 then rename RagnarokOnline2.exe to WPLauncher.exeScore: 6/10			"

												Yes and no.  If you like anime and mmo's then this, by far, has the best anime based graphics available in an mmo.  Personally, I think the content needs to be darker.  It is all well and good to have your happy forest full of goofy creatures, but you need to have your dark forest (or cave, that'd be cool for a zone...) full of zombies and necromancers too.  If it is in the game, then they need to introduce it earlier in the game. (of course it is too late now...). This game is good about the whole 'buy power' thing.  Only thing I've noticed is the VIP pass that provides a stat bonus and earns more currency in dungeons (which i assume is used to purchase stronger end-game gear).  All-in-all, it is a balanced game with a classic mmo playstyle and a unique crafting system.			"

Best played with a group of people, which is pretty normal, but solo-ing at least up until the first dungeon is viable. You can party with random players at anytime, and as long as you have a good healer, dungeons are possible. Just the right difficulty level to keep you interested with a minimal amount of roaming. First mount comes earlier than you'd expect, and is really nice for traversing the map so you dont get bored early on when you're just farming anyway.			"

												While the game has its flaws in terms of playability sometimes after updates, it's still a very good game, and it has held up to its intentions of being ""cute"" in a sense. This game despite being an MMORPG is actually very good for both hardcore veterans, and casuals. The jobs are very good, and easy to level, and very useful once you join a guild, ect.			"

												I guess you can call it ""Standard-MMO"".It has a bit of the old RO flair through design elements, classes and mobs but all in all hasnt much to do with its predecessor.It got tweaked a bit for european and american standards so that you do not have to grind your♥♥♥♥♥off like the ""classic"" RO. I have to agree to the most people that it can get very boring very fast if you do not have a knack for the RO-Universe and its cuddly graphics.The most negative parts about the game are the fact that it is Pay 2 Win the moment you gain max. level, no way around it, I have to name it. I myself wasted around 100€ (yeah I am that stupid) with useless lottery systems and the try to get more money to use.Second thing is that there are still a ton of bugs, it seems like it was programmed with no love at all, the most serious bugs got fixed (Dungeonfinder and some graphic-elements) but there is still a long way to go.All in all I recommend this game for every fan of Ragnarok Online to try it out at least.Leveling is relatively quick and you do not really have to spend any money until you reach higher levels.

												Return to the beautiful and dangerous world of Midgard! Inspired by Norse mythology, the much-anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking Ragnarok Online has arrived! Immerse yourself in the new, but recognizable world of Ragnarok 2. Visit the large, capitol city of Prontera, form a party and explore the underwater Sea Temple dungeon, or set up a shop and earn a living for your character by accepting a job as an Alchemist, Artisan, Blacksmith, or Chef. Adventurers who have explored the world of RO1 will instantly recognize many of the famous monsters and landmarks as their journeys continue. The fun social experiences of character customization, guild creation and PVP play have also returned! Ragnarok 2 is a free-to-play, fantasy MMORPG that takes elements from the original Ragnarok Online and re-imagines them as a three-dimensional, modern MMO experience.			"

Now i launched the Game and it tells me to create an account before i could start the patcher, anyway i own 2 accounts now xD Patched, started, Character Selection.... TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE, the Creation runs with 5 fps or something, and i dont know why, because the game itself runs very smooth (most times) and i can run much more resourcehungry games. The Game features a autorouting for quest, so you can play it brainafk... i played till level 10 and noticed at lv 5 already that it is just a generic MMO and now go play Ro1 !			"

												 I had some fun with this game 2 years ago, even though I'm not sure what's it like now but judging by the reviews, not so good.    I had several maxed level characters and I hated that the best gears in the game can be obtained by just participating in PvP. The worst part is that there's only certain time of the day you can do pvp.... something like 1am, 1pm, 6pm each last one hour long.    But what's the point of crafting, and other dungeons, if everyone can just do pvp instead? What about the people that has a job or a normal life? How can they participate pvp at these time? (I actually did get those pvp set gears for all my characters, but I felt like I was forced to do something to get something else in return. )    Unless you have all day to sit there and go to pvp at certain times  it will take you forever to get Colo gears and proceed to harder dungeons....

												When I was transitioning between games until FFXIV came out, I played a lot of this. Even now when I play FFXIV, there's times I actually missed playing this game. I played it on the release day up until shortly before Noel came out, and there were a ton of bugs after release. But the bugs were mostly funny to me, and as someone who has played a lot of both Free to Play and subscription MMOs, it's extremely understandable for a game to have a slew of bugs after release or post-patch. What matters is how they were handled.The bosses were fun, the Emnity list for tanking was actually EXTREMELY useful (something I've always missed is the ability to see the parties' exact emnity values as I'm tanking), the game is colourful and pretty, mobs range from adorable to awesome in appearance, and above all, the game is maintained on micro transactions that -are not required pay to wins-. Although you can buy items that'll enhnce your abilities for a certain time and progress quicker through the game, you dont -have- to in order to keep going.People seem to forget how great this is when you play something Free to Play. Tons of micro transaction games will have you ""Pay-to-Win"" in order to become anything of value beyond the beginning levels and some players would literally pour thousands of dollars per week into specials just to gain and if you didn't have that kind of money, you'd have to spend days grinding or competing with bots in order to earn enough of the in-game currency to trade with someone for it in order to just do the real content. Despite the exorbitant amounts of money some communities would dump into these games, they would -still- be rife with game breaking bugs. So what is everyone's complaint with RO2 when compared to the majority of F2P MMOs?This game is fun, is enhanced by but not dominated by it's cash shop, and is a good casual thing to play without requiring a huge time sink. Yes, it has bots, bugs, and elitists, but what MMO doesn't?			"

												Hi everyone,after playing Ragnarok Online, i decided that I would try out the successor, warts and all. Well it certainly has some quirks to it. I dont mean that in a negative way. Dungeons are pretty much ""please party me"" and a Master Level comes and does the dungeon for you. As far as game mechanics go, if you've played mmos this is a pretty easy one to learn. the only criticism is that I dont see many parties, or indeed difficult dungeons that need roles in them. The only experience of partying i had was in sograt desert, where tanks would round up all mobs and everyone else would dps them to death.I can't say that It grabbed me, mostly because all players I have touched base with have also finished playing. I started maybe december last year, and quit after a few months, and started again, only to find none of my friends were still playing. As far as challenge goes, i have yet to face anything challenging in this game (due to multitude of ML players) who are willing to go through dungeons. The real game starts once you have mastered your class. This poses an interesting dilemma though. As most people do not play this regularly (maybe once a week) you are left to yourself largely to do the gameThis is my experience playing RO2.There are a large amount of guilds to play for WOE which gets its name from the battlefield challenge for guilds in the original game. Also public chat has a bunch of players that you can talk to. "

												Although it strives very much to live up to expectations, it seems like it cannot be done. At least not in full blown frontal 3D.*If* you want to play something that will remind you of the original Ragnarok Online, then you will be probably heavily disappointed. The only thing that binds them together are a parts of the lore (still, very fuzzy).*If* you are looking for yet another 3D MMO, then this is probably the right spot.- Graphics are meh. Not in terms of the quality, but in terms of the visual style. I would expect something more from Gravity. Something that would fit into the sprite style of the original, but in a refreshed enviroment. Pastel Colors & outline more? Hard to tell, but for sure this one looks just bleak and boring.- Controls. Could have been way worse. They mostly kept the RO style so quick bars, and shift-ctrl bindings, which are just perfect.  The camera seems a little sluggish though.- Mechanics. Ruined it all. Boatloads of stuff, which at the first glance, have no coherent meaning and connection to the way the game play. Given for example the *new and confusing* card system. Took me a while to figure out. Also, the forging system looks a lil bit grindish' (but hey, that's ragnarok after all).- Micro-payement. Reason for which i dropped the game. Don't get me wrong. I would like to pay, it it's done in a sensible manner. Here it is NOT. You have very slight idea of what you're paying for, what you will get, and what YOU ACTUALLY NEED. There are tons of stuff, most of them undescribed. Sure, you can buy *something*, but you need to do some digging to get the info on what it is, can you actually use, or how long will it last.The whole game, minus the messed up micro payments is bearable.Sooo... with the payments, it's not. That a NO from me.			"

												I've played through about half of this MMO, but I'll keep this short an sweet. They give you a few sweet little items now and then to encourage you to play, force you through group dungeons for the main story (horrible for a solo player like myself), and then after a certain point you realize those items you'd gotten earlier are cash market stuff and the in-game and quest rewards are crap so it becomes Pay-To-Win very swiftly. When the original RO was subscription based, I'd played a trial of that and wanted to continue playing it but couldn't pay the subscription fee. I gave RO2 a chance, but then it just became a steaming pile.Game play isn't bad, the story is pretty lame, class system could be a lot better, controls are basic, graphics are. . . fine for what it is. Fans of the original RO, don't play this, I was sorely disappointed after a few hours of play, but pushed forward until I just gave up on it.			"

												I loved Ragnarok from the beginning. I game I didn't need to save! WOW! (It was my first online mmorpg) So I've used to play every day from the beta for maybe three years almost every day.When I knew this game was about to be released I was really happy, because it was a new version of a game so important to me that led me to love playing online games in general.Watched videos and waited a long time so I could finally get it in my steam and remember all the things I loved about Ragnarok.This game has everything I liked about the older one like classes, monsters, cards and cliches, and many new things that I consider improvements that made me spend a few hours on it.So why am I giving it a bad review? It's a P2W game. If you don't pay, you can't enjoy the game at all. It's free only for tryouts. If you do not intend to spend money here, you won't have a good time at all. Don't get me wrong, I liked the game, but lying to me saying it's free to play is not good. I pay for other games monthly and wouldn't mind maybe spending here from time to time, but compete with others who got more money, that's just something I won't do. If you don't have a big problem with this such as I, go ahead and give it a shot.			"

												Don't download this at all. I can't even get past the registration. To simply quote someone who has gotten through.""This kind of game has its own sub category besides WoW clone. I call it, sweat shop Korean MMO. It's when a Korean company pushes out a low budget, graphically outdated, copy pasta game that wouldn't have impressed anyone after 2002. The controls are just terrible. The choppy camera movement alone makes it seem like the game is running at half the speed that it actually does. The quests are cheesy and overly done. There's no depth in the combat either. Like most bad MMOs, it's just pressing buttons to activate skills in a certain order. There's literally nothing about this game that makes it worth playing.""

												Ragnarok Online 2 is a very generalized and normalized MMO. There is nothing that is groundbreaking that you will see in the game. However, it doesn't suffer from the normal overseas issues that most F2P MMOs have. You are not forced to put money in the game to make sure you can level quickly and effectively. The quests don't run out as you level. And, it keeps it's pace very well. If you want a free MMO that helps you get a feel of a solid online story, try Ragnarok Online 2. If you want something hardcore, keep waiting for Wildstar.			"

												Ragnarok Online 2, the supposed to be Ragnarok Online successor which was different from the Gates of the World.I really tried to love the game but it really fell short. I came back to the game after being inactive and sadly, I still can't love the game.If you are looking for a nostalgic RO experience, give it a try.The Good:- Like I've said, it gives a soft RO nostalgia.- It's fun to play with friends especially dungeons.The bad:- Gameplay: It is so slow paced in battle. During raids and boss hunts, as a support I would usually just spam a skill then that's just it. I just watched the healthbars slowly diminished then that's it. - Graphics: Graphics isn't top notched. I placed this second since I prioritize gameplay over graphics. - The Aftergame: You have two options after you maxed out, boss hunts and world boss hunts (i.e Goblin Leader) for Equipment drops or maybe PVP? Either of the two, you would be easily get bored especially if you can secure good equips earlier than expected. There's nothing much to do when you reach the level cap.-- There's too much game related factor that pulls the game down, but who knows it's still updating despite RO2 being discontinued in Korea. But IMO, I would likely play Dragon Nest or Tera than RO2.			"

												I've been playing Ragnarok for only 3 days so far, but I can already tell this is a pretty well made game. The combat system is really good (And that's a huge part of it for me), the variety in each class's strengths is great, and it's a great game to play online with your friends and follow the story quests together. I definitely recommend getting Ragnarok if you're looking for a good in-depth anime MMORPG to play with your friends.			"

												Hi everyone,after playing Ragnarok Online, i decided that I would try out the successor, warts and all. Well it certainly has some quirks to it. I dont mean that in a negative way. Dungeons are pretty much ""please party me"" and a Master Level comes and does the dungeon for you. As far as game mechanics go, if you've played mmos this is a pretty easy one to learn. the only criticism is that I dont see many parties, or indeed difficult dungeons that need roles in them. The only experience of partying i had was in sograt desert, where tanks would round up all mobs and everyone else would dps them to death.I can't say that It grabbed me, mostly because all players I have touched base with have also finished playing. I started maybe december last year, and quit after a few months, and started again, only to find none of my friends were still playing. As far as challenge goes, i have yet to face anything challenging in this game (due to multitude of ML players) who are willing to go through dungeons. The real game starts once you have mastered your class. This poses an interesting dilemma though. As most people do not play this regularly (maybe once a week) you are left to yourself largely to do the gameThis is my experience playing RO2.There are a large amount of guilds to play for WOE which gets its name from the battlefield challenge for guilds in the original game. Also public chat has a bunch of players that you can talk to. "

												Ragnarok II is an entertaining game that can be enjoyed on your own or with a group of friends. Of course, in most games online having a group of friends almost always makes a game more enjoyable. In this one though you will most likely be able to fully like it on it's own merits if you wanted to solo through most of the game yourself. The game has quite a few features and is at least as great as any other MMORPG that is out there. No matter what you want out of this game, you will get at least a few quality hours of gameplay from it for sure.			"

												I loved Ragnarok from the beginning. I game I didn't need to save! WOW! (It was my first online mmorpg) So I've used to play every day from the beta for maybe three years almost every day.When I knew this game was about to be released I was really happy, because it was a new version of a game so important to me that led me to love playing online games in general.Watched videos and waited a long time so I could finally get it in my steam and remember all the things I loved about Ragnarok.This game has everything I liked about the older one like classes, monsters, cards and cliches, and many new things that I consider improvements that made me spend a few hours on it.So why am I giving it a bad review? It's a P2W game. If you don't pay, you can't enjoy the game at all. It's free only for tryouts. If you do not intend to spend money here, you won't have a good time at all. Don't get me wrong, I liked the game, but lying to me saying it's free to play is not good. I pay for other games monthly and wouldn't mind maybe spending here from time to time, but compete with others who got more money, that's just something I won't do. If you don't have a big problem with this such as I, go ahead and give it a shot.			"

												The game itself is fine (partly) if you don't mind launcher problems.Seriously, it's often hard to launch the game because of Warp Accounting system. Go around the internet finding solutions and patches to walk through errors popping out of nowhere while updating game or simply launching it via Steam and here you are - playing what shouldn't be Ragnarok Online 2 after its predecessor.

												One of the most exciting things in RO1 was cards and RO2 is huge disapointment in cards system. Most cards just give +x to str/dex/etc, and its not fun at all, when you have 300+ str and find a card that gives +8 str, yay.... no... There are some interesting cards but they are rare from high level bosses.Also stats on lvl up doesn't seem very impactfull because later on you start getting gears with a lot more stats than you get in all 50 lvls.I don't have much play time but other than cards system i really enjoy this game. Leveling is easy and reaching lvl50 solo is fast and only then the real game starts. When you quest for master level 1 and equip new master gears you feel so OP compared to what you were at lvl50. But once you enter master lvl zones.. ouch :DQuesting always gives nice EXP and is faster lvling that way than just grinding. Something about questing that just keeps me doing quest then the next one and the next one. Overall it is fun game and as big Ro1 fan i can say that they did good job remaking Ro2.Oh, if you loved monk in Ro1, you will hate it in Ro2. Monks here are tanks as a heard.			"

												After 3h into the game I still feel like in the tutorial zone, with the same quests over and over again (kill x monsters of type y; get x items from monster type y etc.). Everybody looks the same (because the best gear right now is the one from the quests). It does a rather poor job of explaining itself. Especially in an MMORPG you want players to understand all the features, not just some information about every feature. If you like RO 1 or WoW, I guess you're gonna like this as well. If you don't (like me), keep your hands off this time sink. After 3h I still feel like I have achieved a whole bunch of nothing.Aside from stuttering in the crowded areas and lags everywhere, there is nothing to complain regarding the technical standpoint of the game. I don't get why such low poly models and low res textures cause it to stutter so much.The graphic style is lovely, and the jump to 2D really helps the experience. But while being lovely, it's nothing extraordinary.I appreciate what they did with RO, but unfortunately it's still not for me.			"

												I've played Ragnarok Online 2 for over two hundred hours.That probably says something about my lack of a social life more than the game, but whatever.It's not a terrible game. I won't say it's the worst one out there. I enjoyed it - to a point. Overall, I'd give it a passing grade of 6/10, but if there was a 50/50 recommend option I'd definitely select it.The pros:Free. That's the biggy. You can easily play it and wipe it off your hardrive without regrets if necessary.Had a great time as an assassin. DPS is the way to go; tank and healer classes have much less fun in RO2.Lots of class diversity, something inherited from RO1.Lots of dungeons if you actually have friends or manage to join a guild.The cons:Hah! Like you can join a guild! Hardly anyone plays, so you end up waiting for randoms half the time or, if you're not masochistic, skipping the dungeons altogether. Without dungeons there are massive holes in both the plot and your equipment list.Class diversity is cool to a point. RO2 isn't forgiving when it comes to min/maxing mistakes; you often have to buy reset scrolls. This leads to cookie cutter characters and people afraid to go off the path.The grind is real! Good god I had a terrible time of it, and I was DPS! For example, a quest in Izlude. This was to kill 25 mermen soldiers, then 25 mermen warriors. Immediately afterwards, you get a quest to kill 25 slightly different mermen soldiers and 25 slightly different mermen warriors. After that, you get an optional quest to kill fifty more mermen, except these are merwoman! My loathing for this scenario led me to come back with a fire magician. I nuked the whole fishy place. If you don't do it with friends, you're stuck slowly killing entire hordes alone. Hopefully you brought potions, or every three enemies you'll be stopping to eat.Premium items. Premium mounts. Ugh. I see people walk by with their five dollar peco peco and I want to facepalm. The walking is worse than the grinding. At least with the grinding we can watch the flashy animations. The mounts help slightly, but the flying outposts are few and far between, plus they aren't marked very well. As an assassin, I could actually outrace most normal mounts by quaffing a speed potion, which was sad. To go any faster? Buy premium mounts.Interface is odd. Auction house is the most egregious example. You can't even use the search bar, leaving you to slowly search through pages upon pages of items before you find something you want.All in all, I feel like I have to recommend trying it, just because I have the founder's title and I spent so long playing. It was entertaining for a while, but ultimately I set it down when I reached the end. Not much replayability once you get to max level - you'll never want to go through certain sections again, which makes making a new character a serious pain.			"

												Ragnarok online (RO) 1 is way better than this. RO 2 lacks of a chanllenge, is buggy and very repetitive.Although they are more organized (now there is a detailed quest menu), the quests are pretty much the same, none of then are hard or interesting, very diferent from quest of RO 1 (in RO 1 the quests to change class are dificult and interesting, each class has its own change quest. RO 2 doesn't have those quests, you start directly with a chose class).The cards aren't anymore unique, all the cards I got do the same thing: give some random stats. In RO 1, each monster card has unique effects.There aren't any deadly monster in the game, even the bosses are easy to kill ( one of the first bosses you fight has the apearence of the boss Kiel from RO 1, a hard to find and hard to kill in RO 1, but in RO 2 you don't need a single potion to kill it alone). Another issue about monsters: you receive an option to automatcaly enter in dungeons and fight against a boss that will aways be in the end of dungeon, wainting for the player, you don't need to find out the dungeons entrance or compete with others party players to find the boss anymore. The worst thing about this automatic dungeon sistem is that you can enter in a top level dungeon with no worries, the game gives you a temporary top overpowered level character to finish that dungeon.The game is almost empty (this is kind of consequence of a bad MMO) and the buildings of the city (Prontera) are TOO big. You feel like an ant. The big size makes sense to a castle, a statue or a defending wall, but even to a common house? A door whith a 4 meters high to characters and NPCs that doesn't seen to have 1,80m high? Really?RO 1 has many flaws, that were amplified with the release of the 3rd classes, but it is much better than it's successor.			"

												This game is garbage. If you played the original Ragnarok Online 2, you'd know how inferior this game is. From environment to the animations, everything was completely changed to be your typical F2P cash cow. As far as I know, Yoko Kano did not do the music for this one either, which surprisingly was really good music.Too bad on a missed opportunity and betraying any fans who appreciated RO and RO2 originally.Don't ♥♥♥♥ing play it.

												All the bugs are so common they have own names and each player knows how to deal with them. They are annoying. Leveling from 1-50 is the only adventure you'll ever see, from that on ML1 foward it's grind grind grind, and dealing with players who bought refining stuff to be 40 times better than you'll ever be (unless you want to pay money for them too). The Elements used in Condors, Mukas and Osi dungeon become pointless after Osi. DPS classes like rangers have really low damage unless they can somehow afford costumes with runes. Nowdays you can't even buy rune drills without real money. It's really sad, I loved this game much but it's too annoying.			"

												Ragnarok Online 2 is a new and futuristic game of Ragnarok Online which was 2D and simple. I love the game. Something I hate with a passion really are games and developers who only have a color pallet of brown and grey. I want to see color, see vibrance and Ragnarok Online 2 delivers. The zones are all very different from deserts to canyons, to beaches to forests. I love it!Now don't get your hopes up. While I may love the zones in the game, I do not love the game. It's not eye catching or attaching. Unless you listen to the opening credits for your first spawn as a Noel, that's shockingly depressing. Nonetheless, it's just plane feeling and there's a lot of issues that just can't be over looked.For example:Rendering and LoS (Line of Sight), something you'll notice is max or not with field of view distance it's exactly the same. Not just that but it's about 30 meters around your character, so anything outside 30m is invisible on your screen. People still have issues with graphic lag. Yikes... I'm not one of them, but frankly I don't care to turn five degrees to my left and turn back only to have everything go invisible and untargetable because it decided ""Oh, time to rerender into the game!""Invisible walls, Warriors are the equivalent of Billy Goats. Litteraly ignore these walls and jump on or over them. While kick♥♥♥♥♥to get ontop of areas you just normally never could, yeah it is a glitch and some serious exploiting. Not in PvP though, they cut your legs off in there.""Event EXP"" days are lies. I got to the higher tiers of levels and once you're there your experience changes to something called ""Mastery Points"" not very long to get, but look. With no buffs at all for Exp/MP gain... I get 1 point a kill on a x2 and x3 day, same even when the days are gone. With all Exp/MP gain buffs, that jumps to 5 - 10 points a kill depending on the area. Oh and mind you, these are all buffs you buy and apply. These do not include the lying x2/x3 days.Pay-To-Win, now it's expected these days when it comes to the term Free-to-Play. It's depressing, but true. Figures mean more then player happiness. The current level cap (12/31/2014) is 81, Mastery level 30. 1-50 then ML 1-30. You can buy 1-50 for $27.00 USD. While you're not getting ML 30, you're still skipping 50 levels for under 30 bucks. You do not want to see the rest of the market.Voice Acting, if she doesn't sound like a grandmother with a stoma she sounds like a pornstar sultry teacher. The males...Either Californian Stoned Surfer or Gayer than Liberace and Andy D***. You don't have other choices, this also includes your own characters voice. Mind you  these characters are supposed to be under the age of 18.Roleplay....You're now a pedophile, yes we've added your name to the list.End game content, now while I haven't essentially gotten here. I know shocking with my play time right? I have the following: ML 7 Assassin, ML 12 Priest, ML 7 Warrior, ML 1 Ranger, Lv 17 Soulmaster along with a lv 6/20 Guild that is mine. End game content is extremely non-existent in the sense you have some raids and a new battleground, but that doesn't happen till ML 14+. Ml 1 - 14 is litterally go find a group, and grind mobs. Do you remember how much I told mobs give in MP? Your exp to ML 2 is about 4000. Guess what ML 13 is. I dare you. Half of my game time is grinding these mobs. Go do quests right? I'm sorry what quests sir, yes there are litteraly no quests from ML 1 - 30.Player Base, I'm American. I speak English and Russian, and a bit of Japanese... I do not know the Filipino language. This game is owned by them, I struggle severely with a language barrier. Worse is the timezones, even harder is the fact once the pinoy population is gone...So is the player base. It may as well be dead, group finding and dungeon going is virtually impossible and people will fight just to join. There's no population diversity, and in the worst business decision in human history of games is there's two servers. Exactly the same as eachother, as the above states.Tade Chat, dear god...The prices are ridiculous and unreasonable, but once you see that everything you can craft needs purchase materials either via MP or NPC buys you'll understand. Even so I don't think any blue item is worth 20,000 anything. It's common for it to be 25,000+ for level 20 greens, not even ML ones. My tip, figure out how to get costumes and sell them. Those go for 80,000+.The game is fun, but not enjoyable. Fun to play because it's entertaining and simple, not enjoyable because of the pay-to-win market and even worse the player community base and ability of trade and commerce.Would I recommend this game? Not unless you like cartoonish games, even than I'd say, ""Go try Fiesta Online.""Will I continue to play? I can't stand grinding anymore..Over 10 hours to get just 2 levels, just no.Is it a bad game? Not at all, just not fun trying to get even near end game content, or really even worth it. "

The combat system is really good (And that's a huge part of it for me), the variety in each class's strengths is great, and it's a great game to play online with your friends and follow the story quests together. I definitely recommend getting Ragnarok if you're looking for a good in-depth anime MMORPG to play with your friends.			"

I came back to the game after being inactive and sadly, I still can't love the game.If you are looking for a nostalgic RO experience, give it a try.The Good:- Like I've said, it gives a soft RO nostalgia.- It's fun to play with friends especially dungeons.The bad:- Gameplay: It is so slow paced in battle. During raids and boss hunts, as a support I would usually just spam a skill then that's just it. I just watched the healthbars slowly diminished then that's it. - Graphics: Graphics isn't top notched. I placed this second since I prioritize gameplay over graphics. - The Aftergame: You have two options after you maxed out, boss hunts and world boss hunts (i.e Goblin Leader) for Equipment drops or maybe PVP? Either of the two, you would be easily get bored especially if you can secure good equips earlier than expected. There's nothing much to do when you reach the level cap.-- There's too much game related factor that pulls the game down, but who knows it's still updating despite RO2 being discontinued in Korea. But IMO, I would likely play Dragon Nest or Tera than RO2.			"

												This game is hardly a worthy sequel to the original Ragnarok Online. RO2 has adopted a generic WoW-style interface and play style that aren't made up for by other features. Customization is limited to pasty beanpole types. The combat and questlines are bland and uninventive. The auction house and party finding systems are poorly designed. The music is nothing special, but there's a player-made patch to replace it with bgms from other Ragnarok titles. The good is that the monsters are the same cute critters from RO that we know and love, and there are plenty of classes to choose from. This game isn't awful, but it needs a lot of work before it can be called a quality MMO.			"

												Ragnarok 2 (or RO2) is very interesting, animeish MMO that combines Asian style graphic and gameplay with Nordic mythology. With WoW, Rift or/and Allods way of combating and good choice of classes and skills, this game is extremely fun and has interesting way of leveling your character. Other than standard quest's you can do ""achievement quest's"" know as Khara quest's that also give you experience, money or even titles that give stats when equipped. Also you can collect cards that drop from specific mobs and equip them to your character for even more stats bonus.Other than few bugs that occur ingame like constant error message that say you're in combat but you aren't, mobs that psychically hit you from 15 yard's distance, etc, I would recommend this game for players that aren't that interested in end-game and just want MMO that will be fun while leveling your character.

												I played this game a bit before it came to Steam while it was still in beta (I think).I have spent countless hours in the original Ragnarok Online. I first started playing it many years ago and I absolutely fell in love with it, and it was my very first MMORPG experience. Since I stopped playing that time, I've kept coming back to it several times, and every time I get swallowed up by it. It's still the very best in the genre that I have ever played, and I've played quite a few.When a sequel was first announced, I, like other fans, was really excited. Eventually they showed a very different game and the general opinion on it was luke warm. Gravity Interactive decided to scratch the whole thing. Later, this new sequel appeared. They have stated that they wanted to go back to the world of the original game. Finally, the game has reached the international player base. It is many years overdue.So, how does it hold up? To be blunt; the game is a bland, average MMORPG. Some elements have been kept, but all in all completely changed. There's a new card system unlike anything I've seen in any other game, but that's pretty much it. The rest is nothing special, and not a lot of fun. I think they completely blew it. It's very little impressive.If you are looking for a great MMORPG experience, this is probably not it. I suggest you try the original instead. It's free to try though.			"

												One of the most exciting things in RO1 was cards and RO2 is huge disapointment in cards system. Most cards just give +x to str/dex/etc, and its not fun at all, when you have 300+ str and find a card that gives +8 str, yay.... no... There are some interesting cards but they are rare from high level bosses.Also stats on lvl up doesn't seem very impactfull because later on you start getting gears with a lot more stats than you get in all 50 lvls.I don't have much play time but other than cards system i really enjoy this game. Leveling is easy and reaching lvl50 solo is fast and only then the real game starts. When you quest for master level 1 and equip new master gears you feel so OP compared to what you were at lvl50. But once you enter master lvl zones.. ouch :DQuesting always gives nice EXP and is faster lvling that way than just grinding. Something about questing that just keeps me doing quest then the next one and the next one. Overall it is fun game and as big Ro1 fan i can say that they did good job remaking Ro2.Oh, if you loved monk in Ro1, you will hate it in Ro2. Monks here are tanks as a heard.			"

												After 3h into the game I still feel like in the tutorial zone, with the same quests over and over again (kill x monsters of type y; get x items from monster type y etc.). Everybody looks the same (because the best gear right now is the one from the quests). It does a rather poor job of explaining itself. Especially in an MMORPG you want players to understand all the features, not just some information about every feature. If you like RO 1 or WoW, I guess you're gonna like this as well. If you don't (like me), keep your hands off this time sink. After 3h I still feel like I have achieved a whole bunch of nothing.Aside from stuttering in the crowded areas and lags everywhere, there is nothing to complain regarding the technical standpoint of the game. I don't get why such low poly models and low res textures cause it to stutter so much.The graphic style is lovely, and the jump to 2D really helps the experience. But while being lovely, it's nothing extraordinary.I appreciate what they did with RO, but unfortunately it's still not for me.			"

												For old-ragnarok players, it is a whole new game from what you know of ragnarok 1. The first thing you would notice is that  the combat system is totally new as compared the older ragnarok game. The new combat system is now similar to most of the MMORPG games wherein you press buttons to cast skills and to attack. Also, you will notice that you can no longer rely on pure attack speed alone. Unlike in the previous ragnarok, where archers and assasins have builds that has a very fast ASPD, this new game heavily relies on your skills. Another thing you would notice would be the mobs. There are new mobs in here but some mobs from the previous game is still in play. Also, the new game employs a dungeon system that is not in the previous game. So basically, you will feel that you are playing a VERY different game from the ragnarok you already know.For those who didn't played the old ragnarok, this is an game with excellent graphics as well as sound. They have quests that help the new players in understanding the gameplay. But it isn't too boring as to render old MMORPG players dozing off while playing the initial, or introductory, stages of the game. They also provide various items for new players such as free mounts, costumes, potions, etc. So overall, its a game that can compete as the best MMORPG			"

												I would have loved to have tried this game, but the graphics just don't show up once it hits character creation. The menus and everything are there, but all I get of the characters and environments is white forms with the occasional flicker of what color should be there.My computer runs far more sphisticated games, graphically, so this -really- shouldn't be happening.I just hope this isn't common.

												The game is incredibly buggy and grindy. I don't recommend playing the game alone, but if you have a group of friends, go for it. I enjoyed the game with friends (making fun of bugs, grinding in frustration together, etc.), but whenever I played alone, the enjoyment factor dissapeared. The story gets boring as the game progresses, but the different classes are fun to play. As a person who hasn't played the first Ragnarok--and thus can't be dissapointed in the ""beating nostalgia into a bloody pulp"", I found the game okay (not great, but not aweful). It's not good enough to deserve a solid recommendation though; maybe a try it if you want--since it's free.			"

												Pros:- NoneCons:- Broken promises from GM's, CM's, and dev's- dev's don't seem to know what they're doing at ALL (fix one thing break 10 more)- pay2win- extremely boring grind- initial release was great, but when they released that valkyrie expansion thing, everything in the initial release started getting phased out by them offering jump packages where you jump from lvl 1 to 50 so you can experience the extremely boring expansion right away, skipping the actual good part.- boring- boring- boring- tedious- crap-100/10 would recommend you to STAY AWAY from this game			"

No third tier class, which is a big disappointment. It is casual and simple MMORPG so if you don't like complex game and story, then you will find this enjoyable.

From environment to the animations, everything was completely changed to be your typical F2P cash cow.

												Ragnarok online (RO) 1 is way better than this. RO 2 lacks of a chanllenge, is buggy and very repetitive.Although they are more organized (now there is a detailed quest menu), the quests are pretty much the same, none of then are hard or interesting, very diferent from quest of RO 1 (in RO 1 the quests to change class are dificult and interesting, each class has its own change quest. RO 2 doesn't have those quests, you start directly with a chose class).The cards aren't anymore unique, all the cards I got do the same thing: give some random stats. In RO 1, each monster card has unique effects.There aren't any deadly monster in the game, even the bosses are easy to kill ( one of the first bosses you fight has the apearence of the boss Kiel from RO 1, a hard to find and hard to kill in RO 1, but in RO 2 you don't need a single potion to kill it alone). Another issue about monsters: you receive an option to automatcaly enter in dungeons and fight against a boss that will aways be in the end of dungeon, wainting for the player, you don't need to find out the dungeons entrance or compete with others party players to find the boss anymore. The worst thing about this automatic dungeon sistem is that you can enter in a top level dungeon with no worries, the game gives you a temporary top overpowered level character to finish that dungeon.The game is almost empty (this is kind of consequence of a bad MMO) and the buildings of the city (Prontera) are TOO big. You feel like an ant. The big size makes sense to a castle, a statue or a defending wall, but even to a common house? A door whith a 4 meters high to characters and NPCs that doesn't seen to have 1,80m high? Really?RO 1 has many flaws, that were amplified with the release of the 3rd classes, but it is much better than it's successor.			"

												All the bugs are so common they have own names and each player knows how to deal with them. They are annoying. Leveling from 1-50 is the only adventure you'll ever see, from that on ML1 foward it's grind grind grind, and dealing with players who bought refining stuff to be 40 times better than you'll ever be (unless you want to pay money for them too). The Elements used in Condors, Mukas and Osi dungeon become pointless after Osi. DPS classes like rangers have really low damage unless they can somehow afford costumes with runes. Nowdays you can't even buy rune drills without real money. It's really sad, I loved this game much but it's too annoying.			"
