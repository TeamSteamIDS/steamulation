												If you're reading this review, you probably want to know if this game is worth the money, and time. Assuming you're into rpg's (otherwise i don't see any reason you're here), and want to get your mind blown away, then this game is for you. I can't possibly describe how fantastic Witcher 2 is. While the ""general"" story might not be something outstanding, the way you progress through it, the way you interact with people completely engulfs you into the experience, and you won't even realize when it's already 5 am, and you've been playing for 12 hours at least. This is partly because of the side missions. Unlike other rpg's where they are mediocre at best, and mainly consist of something like ""Get to point B, Talk to someone, Return, ????, PROFIT"", side missions in Witcher 2 are self contained stories, some of them being more enjoyable than the main game itself. And of course if you don't want to do them for whatever reason, you'll miss A LOT. Another thing at which Witcher 2 excels is the combat. While at low difficulty you should be able to complete the game by ""pressing X to win"", other difficulty settings require knowledge, thinking, and tactical aproach. You'll have to create mixtures, craft weapons and armor, find or buy herbs and recipes, just in order to be able to survive. While this might be confusing, and hard, trust me that it's not. It's understandable, it's logical, and requires just a little bit of initial effort. At this point you're probably thinking ""Yeah, cool, i'll go buy it"", and you won't be wrong in any way. BUT, be advised that while this is a great looking game, it isn't particulary well optimised,  and you may find yourself struggling even at minimum settings if your PC isn't powerful enough.  So what is my score for the game? Definitely 10/10. I really do think it's such a good game.			"

												At first I was a bit hesitant to play this game because I don't typically like fantasy RPG themed games.  I do like games that have deep and mature narratives.  I also like games with complex combat mechanics.  I heard that this game was very good at these things, so I decided to give it a try.The story is  very good.  It is also very complex so it is important to pay attention to the dialog.  Player choices definitely have an impact on the game world and many choices are morally ambiguous which tie-in well to the mature theme of the story.  What impressed me the most was how much impact player choice dynamically altered the game world and the direction of the story.  The game has 8 different endings based on the player's decisions.  This is also the only game that I have ever played that completely alters the main quest line depending on these choices.  This means that you will not see every main story quest, characters and locations unless you play the game through multiple times.  Many games that change the world based on choices usually do so using trickery that gives you the ""illusion"" of choice.  The developers of this game actually took the time to create all of the extra story content instead of using tricks and this gives the Witcher 2 a ton of replayability.The combat system in this game is also very deep and challenging.  You will carry a steel sword to take care of humanoid opponents and you will carry a silver sword to deal with monsters.  Knowing when to switch is important to dealing proper damage to your target.  Combat also requires proper preparation so the player will need to know how and when to use magical signs, place traps, drink potions, oil swords and use bombs and other Witcher tricks to get the job done.  Simply wading into the combat only slashing away with a sword will often times get you killed.  Combat can take some time to get used to and is definitely a refreshing departure from simply auto targeting and mashing a single button.Visuals are very impressive and it is very apparent that the developers took a lot of time in creating the environments for the game.  Music is outstanding and the score sets the tone appropriately.One of the few downsides that I can think of is the disparity of the difficulty levels.  Normal difficulty can be daunting with the complex combat mechanics and is a bit harder than the normal difficulty level of similar games.  Easy is a nod to RPG beginners, but is so easy that you can ignore most of the combat mechanics and simply survive every encounter by using only the swords.  The only other downside that I had with the game was related to map design.  I found navigation on some of the maps to be overly complicated and I spent a lot of time simply wandering about trying to find a way to get to certain points on the map.  Other than these two small quibbles I found the game design to be very solid and entertaining.Lots of content in this game.  My playthrough took about 40 hours doing most of the side activities, and I mostly took my time without rushing things.  Additional playthroughs would be required to see the other 7 endings and to play the other story paths leading up to those endings.  You can easily get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to explore all of these options so lots of replay value as I mentioned earlier.I highly recommend this game.  I understand that the Witcher 3 is supposed to expand to a much more open world environment and have even more non-linear story options.  After playing Witcher 2 I am looking forward to playing the upcoming sequel when it comes out.			"

												First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going on. This a game which deals with many adult themes such as politics, racism and sex to deliver a mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books by Andrezej Sapkowski as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.

												Experienced more sex in one of hour of game time than in my entire life!( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/10!Tips:1) If you BUY Witcher 1 or Witcher 2 on steam you can claim a free copy of it on GOG using your steam CD key. The company that owns the Witcher series, CDPR, also owns GOG. Link here: http://www.gog.com/witcher/backupAside from the usual no DRM copy of the game, the GOG version also includes bonus content ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)[i.imgur.com].Please note: You have to BUY it on Steam first.CD key location: Go to your Library, click your game, on the right side click ""CD key""2) There are also numerous mods over at http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/. Including a few for Triss ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). 3) If you dislike the combat style then try the Full Combat Rebalance Mod. It's made by an employee of CDPR who worked on the Witcher series.

												Originally released in 2011, The Witcher 2 flew under the radar for a lot of people and was overshadowed by the ever-popular Skyrim. While not as well known, The Witcher 2 offers a much stronger narrative along with solid gameplay, beautiful graphics, and varied areas.You once again play as the Witcher; Geralt, who finds himself protecting King Foltest of Temaria after an assassination attempt. Ultimately, the second attempt succeeds and Geralt is framed for the murder. After escaping from a Temarian dungeon, Geralt decides to track down the real kingslayer in order to clear his name while trying to piece together his fragmented memory.The game is separated into three chapters each with their own main area along with a handful of side-quests. These areas are structured and paced well, allowing room for exploration without straying too far from the main storyline. The decisions you make along the way directly influence the narrative and can have a dramatic effect on the rest of the game. For example; decisions made in the first chapter can completely change the second, allowing plenty of room for re-playability. The game also features multiple endings, which vary based on your choices.The choices are morally ambiguous; there is no clear right or wrong answer in most cases. It’s more about choosing a side and watching the events unfold. While the first Witcher game focused more on slaying monsters, Geralt is trapped in the middle of political turmoil in this installment. These elements of the story add an additional level of complexity and immersion as the game feels almost similar to a season of Game of Thrones. Playing the first game is by no means necessary to enjoying The Witcher 2 as it provides plenty of backstory as well as a solid and cohesive narrative.The combat is solid as the game will have you balance between swordplay, magic, as well as parrying and dodging. The use of traps can also add an additional level of strategy and planning to most encounters. There is also the inclusion of alchemy, allowing Geralt to drink various potions each with different passive bonuses as well as negative side effects. The potions are generally used on a trial and error basis though, since Geralt isn’t able to use them during combat. The game does provide a reasonable challenge, especially on the harder difficulties, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other titles released these days.Orens, the main currency in the game is rather scarce, placing a large emphasis on crafting. The crafting system is solid and will have you hoarding as many resources as possible in order to create various armor, traps, weapons, and upgrades.CD Projekt Red is a company that really loves their fans. While other developers release paid DLC, CDPR released an Enhanced Edition at no additional cost which added multiple cut-scenes, quests, and additional polish. The soundtrack is fantastic, as it really adds an epic feel to the game. The voice acting for the main characters is top-notch while some of the acting for the additional characters is re-used but that is to be expected considering the overall length of the game.The graphics are absolutely stunning, as the environments are extremely detailed and varied. The character models and armor look great, although the facial animations can be a bit stiff and lifeless at times. You really have to look hard for low-res textures as even the smallest objects are carefully rendered.Overall, The Witcher 2 is a game that should be played by anyone that is a fan of the genre. It features benchmark graphics, a top-shelf narrative, and offers plenty of content along with elements of re-playability.For a much more detailed and thorough review, here’s a video I edited together for my friend Trent:

												For too long I ignored The Witcher 2 in my Steam Library. I heard that the game was great. Tried playing it twice, gave up at the very beginning of the first chapter. That was a huge mistake.The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt trailers were all amazing, and oh boy, the Hype Train was going offtrack. But how the hell was I supposed to play TW3 without even playing TW2?I've played the first one, liked it a lot, even though the game had some strange gameplay techniques.So there I was again, Flotsam. The very beginning of the game. Would I give up this time again? No!I needed to play TW2, to see if I would like it, and only then I would Pre-Order TW3.Played it. Played more. The story just got better. The gameplay is amazing. The graphics, holy ♥♥♥♥, they're amazing. And the soundtrack... Oh the soundtrack...And ever since I reinstalled The Witcher 2, all I've played was it. I forgot all the other games I had installed, I needed to complete it.I've followed Roche's Path for the Campaign. Loved all the story. So many moral choices, so many characters. I needed to know more about the world, but more than that, I needed to know more about Geralt's story.Now I can easily say that The Witcher 2 - Assassins of Kings is one of the best RPG I've ever played, and I can't wait to play The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt.If you never played The Witcher. Don't waste any time. Play it! You'll love it!			"

												As a major improvement from the first title(the first is still a fantastic game, don't get me wrong), The Witcher 2 marks a milestone not only for CD Projekt RED, but a landmark for which other games fall short of.  Too often a game preaches where choices matter and regardless of what you choose the outcome is the same.  This title puts you back in the hands of Geralt of Rivia; however, this time, the consequences of your actions merit even greater twists and deeper turns.  Not only changing the NPC's outlook on you; instead, you may find yourself in a completely different area of the game had you chosen your actions otherwise.  To stack on the improvements, this game features a much smoother combat system and graphical enhancements so beautiful, you will need a new F12 key (screenshot) by the time you finish this story once.  As an avid explorer of games, one play through of this game granted roughly 50 hours of play time on Hard difficulty.  With bigger titles for $60 giving a mere 10 hours of game play, at $20 this instalment is steal already, let alone when it is discounted.  If you enjoyed the first game, or even if you hated the first game and couldn't get over the combat, this should make its way to your library.			"

												Witcher 2 is my favorite game. It is a solid RPG with a lot of action and a brilliant story. It is very mature in a lot of its themes and situations. This game is based on novels written by a Polish authornamed  Andrzej Sapkowski. You play as Geralt, a Witcher, or a genetically enhanced monster hunter. They have been described as a kind of warrior monk. Geralt drinks special potions that let him far exceed the abilities of normal humans. These potions are needed to battle the various beasts of the realms. Witchers also have a very limited understanding of magical energy called Witcher's Signs. Basically the Signs are spells, like a fireball and a paralysis trap spell and a few others. Geralt is an interesting character because he is not quite human but hes not a monster either. Due to their methods and abilities, however, many in the world see Witchers as freaks and monsters. Which is really what the game's ideology is all about; the greyness in everyone, not the clear cut black and white. Which to me, is a welcome change from the usual: 1) ""hey I'm a good guy I will help you""  2) ""Not my problem Kachinsky"" 3) F*** YOU F*** FACE,"" that many other game are notorious for.  Geralt is often put in positions of just making a choice, not good or evil, just difficult decisions that have a lot of positives and negatives to them. The story is top notch, and eerily real in many of the stuggles of the world. Geralt has a set of skill trees (sword, magic, alchemy) that the player can advance in any way. All into one or spliced between the three. Sword fighting is a core mechanic though, so no matter how you play, Geralt will always have two swords. A silver sword for monsters, and a normal sword for humans. There are a few other weapons too but mostly its swords. Depending on the player preference combat can be a bit like the Batman games, or the Assassins Creed games. In some ways it can be like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare. Weapons and armor play a big part as well and can effect all of the skill trees. Making the game very balanced between gear and character tree choices. Not to the crazy levels of a Diablo game but enough to make for a very quality rpg.Mostly though, Witcher 2 is a lot like skyrim. I do not want to bash on skyrim here, it is also a great game that a lot of people absolutely love. I feel, however, that Witcher is far better than skyrim and think the people that love skyrim should try the Witcher. Both games have the northern lore and feel. Witcher 2 is no where near as large or open as skyrim. Witcher is much more linear but the story and combat and the world just feel so much better in every way to me. The enemies and the different races were better portrayed during the game. When I came to a new town in skyrim I did not get that feeling of truly new. Just another town and another barbarian guy leading it. Witcher was totally different, you get the feeling of racial tensions and social tensions in every part. The powers that be are very different and each very developed and very human. As it plays out you really see how the choices alter the world, instead of it coming down to ""OK I'm a good guy so I will save good guy town."" A lot of games try to get that feeling across of the characters true M.O. and demeanor but fail. Witcher acomplishes this very well. Triple AAA quality. Superb graphics, superb voice acting. I enjoyed every character. There were a few times, of course, where some tones were a bit off but that happens in every game. Overall amazing game. When I learned that this game was made by a small studio in Poland I was shocked.As someone who never read any of the books and did not play the first game, I found that after a second playthrough the story and everyhting started to click and I realised how well done everything really was. The way the game is, one would want to play it at least twice to see both sides of what is going on.It seems as though more than a few people found the game to be really difficult. It can be, but now there are plenty of guides and discussions about it. The game has a kind of reverse curve for the difficulty. It is much harder in the beginning due to a lack of points in the skill tree and low grade weapons and armor. By the end though, Geralt is pretty much on par with jezuz. I like games of this nature, because being really stong at the end makes it feel like you really acomplished something. This game also has subtitles in many languages so I found it made a great gift for steam friends who are not natural to the english language.I would reccommend this game to anyone. Especially anyone who likes Skyrim, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Chivalry, Darksouls, Lord of the Rings or any games like them.			"

												Note: With The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition I entered the Witcher universe without playing the first title or knowing anything about the books let alone having read them. So here goes.The first RPG I played where your choices actually DO matter (*cough* Mass Effect *cough*). Yes, I kid you not. Not only does the game split up after Act I depending on who you choose to side with, but the outcome of dialogues in the main quest and even the side quests offer multiple possibilites for the story to unfold. The complexity and ingenuity of the fantasy world this game is set in is comparable to the quality of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire and can therefore be characterized as a so-called ""low fantasy"" story, as opposed to ""high fantasy"" settings such as The Elder Scrolls (just google the definitions if you don't know anything about them). Personally, I prefer low fantasy due to its focus on individual character development and their story/fate, as well as a ""realistic"" depiction of violence, language and society as a whole, but that's just my preference. So in a nutshell, I liked the story a lot, I think there's a lot of exciting things still to be told. Now let's get to the technical aspects: Dialogue is great, offering many choices for convincing or intimidating and alike. Character customization is solid too (you can actually have your haircut changed to some very weird stuff throughout the game if you so desire), there's lots of item slots, but only two weapons, a fact I can however accept for story reasons. Then again, I always pick the sword in any fantasy RPG so having two different swords throughout the entire game was right down my alley. Since we've arrived at the swords let's talk about the combat shall we. Yeah, I don't like it, why don't I like it you might say? It's basically a combo-based hack'n'slash system with a very console-y feeling (believe me or not, I liked Skyrim combat more, yes really). You just lock onto a target and smash LMB/RMB with the occasional blocking. I think this is simplistic and may be fun to watch, but it's not really immersive (on a side note: the combat is pretty hard and the boss fight require true skill and creativity and especially cunning use of magic abilities, I liked these a lot more). Speaking of immersive, the game looks gorgeous for a 2011 title, mostly good textures and effects. What struck me was the very high depth of field especially in the first act. I guess that's a way to make the lack of quality of distant objects unnoticable. Arguably, the biggest plus is the sound: ambient sound, voice acting and especially soundtrack are downright masterful, I loved it.I can't think of anything else atm so let's jump to the conclusion. The game is great, with lots of replayability due to the many different paths you can go. The world sucks you in right from the start. If you're a fan of the combat then you've got absolutely nothing to fear, if you don't it's still worth it for the experience because mechanics are easy to get used to.Performance notes: The game is Nvidia optimized. With my AMD card(s), it runs a solid 60fps though. Just tweak AA a bit and turn off Cinematic Depth of Field, it makes cutscene-fps drop by half, which is not cool. It supports CFX and probably also SLI. Oh yeah and the game is capped to 120fps, which is nice too.Meaningless score: 9/10			"

												Epic game. When i first played this game, I was totally mindblown at how mature the storyline and how beautiful the graphics are. I was and still baffled how almost nobody in Malaysia knows about this game when it first came out. A problem that still persists up till now.This is not a game for the kiddies but I am sure this kind of game is recommended for people to understand gray moral choices that will somewhat help in real life decisions.The drawback:- controls are sometimes clunky (sometimes not being able to hit monsters when the target reticule is not on it, or Geralt performs a heavy attack when in actual you're pressing the light attack button)- crashes frequently when I load a save game (happens when there is a bloat of save games)- Tiring grind to get loads of gold to get and craft the Dark Armour Diagrams and materials. (you can only get Dark Armour in Dark Mode)The Pros:- Great Mature Storyline- Great Graphics for a 2011 game- Decent Moral Choices- Difficult Combat for newcomers but it will grow on you once you get the hang of it! (Pro Tips: DODGE! DODGE! DODGE!)- A developer who has managed to stay independent and still able to developed this great game- No DRM if you register the steam version on GOG.com for a backup copy for free! (the developer's subsidiary company that manages DRM-less games)Buy this game to encourage more independent developers to churn out great games like this.Plus, the sequel The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is coming out in February 2015. You will certainly have a better insight on the story if you played this first. Hey, even better if you buy both the Witcher 1 and Witcher 2!This game is an AAA title (in terms of quality) in my list and one of few many games that i have replayed more than twice.P.S. - Best played with a controller. Contains nudity and simulated sex			"

												Oh man, this game. I've now played this game 3 times through on Normal/Dark/Insane and am still missing a few sidequests that are only available on certain plot decisions. This game is massive and very well done. Here are some random pros & cons for things that immediately come to mind:PROS+ Gorgeous. This game is gorgeous. Especially if you grab an improved textures mod. (see related con)+ Story-rich. The story is grandiose and tons of fun to be a part of. There are quite a few story-altering decisions you will make throughout the game as well, providing a dynamic and involved experience.(one decision determines a good third of the game that differs completely should you have chosen differently) There were a couple choices where I had to pause the game for like 20 minutes while trying to decide what I wanted to do. Intense stuff. LISTEN TO ALL DIALOGUE, TALK TO EVERYONE. You won't regret it.+ Combat is very dynamic and an absolute blast. You really need to think about the best way to approach certain encounters. Alchemy can alter things drastically for example, so don't skimp on the potions/oils(especially on higher difficulties!). Certain enemies need to be approached certain ways, some are very resistant to sword or magic, some can shield up and block all damage so you need to approach them from another direction or use a specific sign, etc... Very well done and very well thought out by the development team.PROS/CONS(depending on your preferences/playstyle)+/- Game starts out pretty damn difficult during the prologue. You start very weak and then slowly gain strength until all at once, you are suddenly quite over-powered. This could be a pro or con depending on what sort of gaming experience you prefer. There *are* a couple mods that smooth out the combat system and even out your ascension to badassness, although I would highly recommend you not touch any sort of mods til you've completed your first playthrough.+/- Quite a bit of nudity and corny sex scenes. May or may not be your cup of tea.CONS- While the game is gorgeous, it is also quite resource intensive. I had serious issues with my 560m, almost unplayable. My desktop's gtx 780 had no issues. Check out benchmarks for your specific card and make sure you can run it decently.- QTE's(Quicktime Events) are a part of this game and they are lame. There are a couple encounters where if you miss a QTE prompt, you are dead. Playing on insane, this feels cheap and lame. *Luckily*, You can turn these off via Gameplay Options, which I would highly recommend.- Prologue is pretty damn linear. Don't let this turn you off though. It's necessary for the introduction of the story. Make it to chapter 1 and things improve greatly.- A lot of people have reported that the controls feel ""clunky"", especially during the prologue. I was one of these people. But seriously, stick with it. It gets better. Also, graphic settings affect control sensitivity. Higher = better response. I also played the game with a controller, so that could have some impact.Overall conclusion: If you like RPGs, this is a must play. The story is intense and exciting. The gameplay is dynamic and fun. I highly recommend you give it a go. Just make it past the prologue! Also, a few people have asked whether it's necessary to play the first game. My answer is NO. It's not necessary. You would benefit from watching a story recap on YouTube though. "

												Easily one of the best PC games released in the latest years. Easily one of the best surprises, too - you will see more passion and talent from those 'noobs' from Poland than you would in most of the AAA studios, combined. The sheer idea to be a rather indie studio and create a game like this, polish it (word origin nudges me weirdly here) and bring it to the extent it is available today, is remarkable and admiring.I have spent countless hours in the summer of 2011 playing and replaying the game. Because you don't get one strict and direct walkthrough; in fact, you can play 2 completely different storylines and make choices that will result in 16 (!) different endings. Mind you, I haven't seen them all (yet), but some craze at some point in the future might make me want to do so.Witcher 2 is an action-adventure RPG - you will see a lot of combat, and the combat mechanics will matter when you face tougher foes. You need a strategy to survive - button mashing won't help you. You can master either of the 3 skill paths - Magic, Alchemy and Swordmanship and use your signs, potions and gear in order to kick every monster and merc's a** in the beautiful world of Witcher 2.Speaking of beauty, as long as you have a powerful enough PC to push the game hard, you can't fail to notice how lovely it is made - the whole world looks like it is living and breathing, with NPCs having their own business throughout the day and sleep at night, lights, shadows and colours that make it all look hell pretty - the game might be 2011, but it still easily competes with some weaker attempts from more recent times.Everything in this game screams for maturity - from the portrayal of the storyline to some rather odd moments in the game - you might think nudity is not appropriate for games, but if you are old enough to think about it normally, you'll see there's nothing bad in a beautiful love scene like in any other movie. And indeed, the fantasy world of Witcher 2 is not a fantasy world meant for putting kids to sleep - it can easily be described as an alternative Middle Ages where humans have all their present strong and weak qualities, and the legends about the monsters lurking outside of the village at night turn out to actually be there for real.Comparing it to the first installment of the series, I would say I prefer Witcher 2 over it's predecessor, even though I wouldn't deny it either. Everything looks better thought of and finished in the follow-up, but the truth is, the Witcher 1 forged the path for the developers to get together and release a game like this. If you wonder, definitely play the first one first, but come back here when you've finished it.If you are at least a tiny little bit fan of books, don't think twice and grab yourself a copy of the Witcher stories- Andrzej Sapkowski is the mastermind of this world (book came first, then the game). Stories are not necessarily strictly connected between the books and the game, they are loosely situated in the same world, with the main protagonist being the white-haired cold-blooded and serious monster killer Geralt of Rivia. Who, by the way, is already one of my most favourite characters overall.In a few words - if you don't have the game yet and you are a fan of RPG, deep and mature stories and beautiful graphics: get it, get it now.P.S. Devs are real nowadays heroes as they release a ton of free downloadable content and updates AFTER the game is released. Yep, you get all those DLCs you pay for in the other games for free - and they added the Enhanced edition for free for all early purchasers too. They are also known for bashing the mandatory nowadays DRM too - if you buy the game retail, you just need the disc to play it. Like in the good old days.P.S. 2 I own the retail Collector's Edition of the game and I just had to buy it again on Steam. I don't mind it at all, I would put my money for those guys any day, as long as they keep releasing games like this (blink blink: Witcher 3; blink blink: Cyberpunk).			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: CD Projekt REDPublishers: CD ProjektInitial release: May 2011Genre: Action, RPG, Story Heavy#Worth/NotWorth: #SoVeryMuchWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationI found myself deeply enamored with the world of the Witcher. My first exposure being the book, “The Last Wish” by Andrzej Sapkowski. I started in on Witcher 1 after reading and found the mechanics slightly overbearing. Even with some background I found myself being overwhelmed by the vastness and seeming complexity of the mechanics brought fourth by what, to me, was a very cool prospect. Alchemy. The idea behind it was not as its traditionally seen, even in fantasy. It wasn't some equal exchange of two completely unrelated things. Or when it was considered theoretical science, turning common metal into gold. It was poison, concocted from traditional alchemical ingredients. This poison would kill anyone not used to it. It took years and years of borderline torture to build this resistance. All in exchange for what was essentially, a high. Which in game mechanics turns into stat buffs and regen of various meters. AND on top of all this people were kidnapped before the age of five, trained in swordsmanship and forced to build a tolerance to the poisonous alchemical drinks. All to become “thugs for hire” and slay monsters. That, is the coolest ♥♥♥♥ ever. Sadly I never completed the Witcher 1. Due to the overbearing nature. Suffice it to say. The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement. Mechanically, Narratively, and boy is she pretty. My first play through I found some of that residual vastness to get to me. But I decided to forge ahead. I found myself understanding the times at which potions were needed and when they were not, even if most of time was due to trial and error. I am sort of an obsessive quick-saver. I found the dichotomy between Steel and Silver swords very real. Making the action feel much more tactical than your standard, run into that room and whack at stuff with a sharp stick. You make decisions in this game like every other RPG. Only these choices are not so clear cut. There isn't really ever a clearly good or clearly bad option. Moral ambiguity at its best. Rather both sides seem to have very real unforeseen consequences. In fact in the mission “At a Crossroads”, Literally 20+ hours of content lay behind a single choice. My second play through I had a lot more fun because I could focus less on worrying about how to spec or do I have enough ingredients for the potion I need. I was able to focus on the story and actually see some of the political tension much more clearly and take a stance that was well informed.  I love this world. Its probably the most fleshed out fantasy world I've gotten involved with. That's likely due to the fact that this game is based on a book series and not vice versa. Much in the way the Metro 2033 series is. No prerequisite reading required to enjoy but it will definitely enhance the experience.Follow my curation for more "

			Senior Reviewer Trent takes an in-depth look at The Witcher 2. Does it compare to the giants of 2011 (Skyrim and Dark Souls?) Narrated and written by Trent Edited by Nathan Please like and subscribe...		

*I originally purchased a retail copy of The Witcher 2 and completed it before purchasing a steam copy at a later date*The Witcher 2 was perhaps one of the most criminally overlooked games of 2011. With many RPG gamers looking forward to the release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim this PC only release was lost in the hyperbolic praise of Bethesda's role playing juggernaut during end of the year awards. So, in 2012, CDProjekt Red has released an enhanced edition giving PC players ten gigabytes of additional content for free. This content includes all of the patches which added extra quests and fixed a couple of questionable design choices, adds entirely new quests, and cut scenes to flesh the game's narrative out. The Enhanced Edition opens with a rousing new cut scene depicting the assassination of Demavend, King of Aedirn. Upon starting the game the you take control of the witcher, Geralt, who is aiding Kind Foltest in a military endeavor to reclaim his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children. Success comes but the victory is short lived as Foltest is snuffed out and Geralt is blamed for his demise. From here the narrative takes off as Geralt hunts down Foltest's assassin simply to clear his name. Amidst the hunt for the assassin of kings, political turmoil unfolds and Geralt seeks details on his lost love Yennifer. It's a top shelf fantasy RPG narrative, structured like a great season of a television show, with three big narrative threads that are explored as the game progresses. Like a television show, the game ends with some elements of the narrative resolved while others are escalating and awaiting a sequel. The world of the Witcher is dark and morally ambiguous which makes the element of choice the player us given extraordinarily satisfying. Making choices in The Witcher 2 is not about being a good witcher or a bad witcher, its about what you, the player, see fit to do. While Bioware's games are top notch, relegating in-game choices to a binary moral scale diminishes the impact of many decisions. Also, the choices in The Witcher 2 do have an impact on the events of the game—a significant impact. A choice you make at the end of the first chapter completely changes your perspective on the second chapter. The quest line completely changes so you will want to play this game at least twice to get the full effect and, depending on how dedicated you are, maybe several more times.  The narrative plays out over a prologue, three chapters and an epilogue. The three chapters make up the bulk of the game and each is confined to a single location. There is no way to travel back to previous locations once the chapter concludes. This is a narrative driven game and it wants you to move forward. Many players used to games like those in The Elder Scrolls or Gothic series may be upset by this but the narrative so greatly benefits from this rigid structure that it's hard to make a case for a more open format. Each locale is loaded with side quests and very few of them feel like obnoxious chores; a problem that plagues many other RPG experiences. The sidequests mix in some character development, world building and humor generally enriching the core experience.  There are two very compelling reasons to do all of the sidequests in a location. The first is that resources in The Witcher 2 are very limited. Unlike most modern RPGs, you can't really grind for money. Reselling items, gear and raw materials nets such a small portion of the items original value that it's not worth doing for the sake of recouping your money. You will have to carefully decide what you can craft and what you should buy since simply buying the gear and items you want will quickly deplete your coiffures. The second reason to do all of those extra quests is to drink in the staggeringly beautiful world that The Witcher 2 offers. The Witcher 2 set a new graphical benchmark with its richly detailed and carefully crafted world. You really have to search hard for an ugly texture. Everything from the biggest building to the smallest environmental prop is detailed and rendered with care. One of the standout quests in the third chapter takes you to  a mage's laboratory that is filled with trinkets, equipment and murals. It's dimly lit, with sinister stones protruding from the walls. Acquiring new armor is rewarding even if the stats aren't a significant improvement over what you have just because the detail put into it is so fantastic. It's a shame that the facial animations don't quite match the graphical leap forward. They are not bad but they are decidedly current gen in a game that was ahead fo the graphical curve on release. Combat in The Witcher 2 has been massively overhauled from the first game. Geralt can lay traps, use rudimentary magics and is an accomplished swordsman. Even if you don't focus on leveling spell casting or using traps Geralt is still competent enough to make use of these abilities. Some will see the lack of opportunity to really build a Geralt to their personal style but it's as a consequence of the character's lore. You still place skill points in the appropriate trees to buff the abilities of your choice but you don't really spec into an archetypical fantasy class. When it comes to wielding his blades, Geralt has two swords, a silver blade for monsters and a steel blade for humans. He can parry and counter so timing your attacks in key. Certain traps are more effective for some enemies and magic is a mix of healing, buffing and attacking. It's quite a repertoire and you are left with no shortage of tactical options. Fortunately, a new tutorial was added to the Enhanced Edition to help players come to grips with Geralt's skills and abilities. One rather irritating quirk of the combat is the fact that Geralt can only use potions outside of battle so this can turn some encounters into a trial and error affair. You often have to fail in a battle to see what potions may be worth using. It never makes the game annoying... It just makes alchemy feel pointless. Combat requires some skill and forethought but shouldn't be too taxing to a competent gamer and generally proves rewarding.The Witcher 2 was a great game with a few annoying flaws. The Enhanced Edition addresses many of these and goes above and beyond with meaningful new in game content. It's packed with new cutscenes and the new quests are some of the best in the game. The structure is rigid when compared to some other RPGs but it boasts a stronger, more direct narrative as a result. The ability to make choices in the game is enriching and adds tremendous replay value and the visuals look great three years after it's initial release. The combat is solid though the alchemy system is quirky to the point of being almost pointless. None of the flaws present will stay with you for long after you complete this game though. It's likely that you will be more concerned with what CDProjekt Red has in store for us in the next Witcher release. Thankfully, The Witcher 3 is as amazing as you would hope it to be.			"

												I started this game right after I finished the first Witcher game, so I was still very impressed with the first game and had really high expectations of this one, however, I found The Witcher 2 to be incredibly different. In so many ways. And I am not a person who likes change upon something I already loved so much like the first Witcher.I had to push through the incredibly difficult prologue, the different combat system which really disappointed me because I loved the time based sword combat in the first game, and the change from classical painting art style for cutscenes to comic art. I was really bitter about it. However, it all changed after the end of the prologue and the beginning of this incredibly complex story that had so much going on that I was really immresed in it. Moreover, the further you go in the game, the better it gets in terms of story, gameplay, graphics and art style, music, and EVERYTHING. This game wasn't really what I hated anymore, the story kept getting deeper and all pieces from the previous game and this one were coming together somehow. I found that despite all the differences between the first and second Witcher games, they still kept the core of what made The Witcher series what it is; a story about greedy, ugly human nature when politics, beliefs and money and thirst for power cause conflict. I completely fell in love with this game, and I can't wait for the third installment.			"

												The Witcher 2 is one of the most mature, enthralling, entertaining games I've played in years. If this isn't at least nominated for ""Game of the Year"" I don't understand the Gaming Industry anymore. The graphics are amazing, the music is beautiful, and the game features some of the best quests I've seen in a long time. Everything from monster slaying, to hot chick laying, to a ""Hangover"" style quest where you have to retrack the previous night drunken revelry. This game is a MUST for RPG fans. POSSIBLE CON: The story continues immediately after the Witcher 1 and does NOT hold your hand. If you want background on characters or plot devices either play Witcher 1 or go wikipedia the storyline and get caught up.			"

												Witcher 2 is an action- rpg and like it's predecessor, it's based on novels and short stories by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. It's developed by Polish company CD Projekt Red.Witcher games are about monster hunter called Geralt of Rivia, also known as Butcher of Blaviken. Geralt has two objectives during the game, to regain his lost memory and find the Witcher who slayed the king, while being accused of killing the king himself. The main story is intriguing and full of surprises. It highly varies based on your decision in the end of first chapter. Second and third chapters have different locations, characters and story focus depenging on your path. This gives Witcher 2 great replayability since different plot points will be revealed. Just like the main questline, side quests offer the same thoughtful and witty writing. There's morally ambigious choices throughout the game and you never know when the consequences come back at you. But very often they will.  The negatives in the game would be the horrible Inventory system, it's a pain to navigate.No overwriting saves, so every save will be a new one and save folder can grow to even 5 gb. Too many saves also slows the launch menu and has been reported to sometimes even cause crashes. So I deleted my saves manually on occasion. I also wasn't a big fan of the combat changes. While the combat in first one was bit more tactical and rhythm based, now it feels a bit too button mashy. More tools to fight have been added though, like traps and throwing knives. I was also bothered that after killing an enemy, if there's another present, Geralt will automatically leap on the next one if you just keep on mashing the attack. Sometimes quite ridicilous distances. Voice acting is stellar and the music makes Geralt's journey feel even more epic. The game was gorgeous when it first came out. Still looks good even today, which makes it harder to run well on older machines. Personally I enjoyed the first game a bit more, because of the story and even the combat. Though most people will prefer the more action oriented combat of this sequel. Witcher 2 is one of the best modern RPG:s and highly recommended to anyone looking for a great mature fantasy world.[Score: 89]			"

""I'm a Witcher. I don't care for your politics!"" Geralt of Rivia__________________________________________ IntroductionDespite his words Geralt's second adventure won't keep him out of political business, as he will stumble right into political affairs, intrigues, rebellions and mysterious murders. 'Assassins of Kings' takes place after the events of the first game and throws the player into a dark, cruel and mature fantasy world full of morally ambigious (but nonetheless remarkable) characters, political disputes and an insane amount of names, lore and history. __________________________________________ The journey of a Witcher...The game's story is amazing and full of twists and remarkable events that will entertain you for a long time. Main and sidequests are very well written, diversified and more than just once the player has to make decisions where the difference between 'good' and 'bad' isn't that obvious. Geralt's journey will bring him to different cities, realms and areas and there are many things to do for the White Wolf. Sure it's no 'Open World'-game but the locations still offer huge areas to explore, that are full of monsters, characters, hidden secrets and forgotten treasures. Besides the synchronisation is all the time on a high level (even in german!) and despite its age of over four years the visuals are still absolutely gorgeous. I have spent over 40 hours on my first run on hard mode but afterwards I instantly started a second one due to the fact that the choices you make can create completely different adventures and often questlines, areas and outcomes change entirely. So far I've played it for over 70 hours and I've never been bored. __________________________________________ ContraSure the game isn't perfect. Some negative points would be that the difficulty changes between 'Geralt is Superman' and 'everyone else is Superman' (which leads to some pretty annoying situations), the fighting system is just average (...and definitly not a very strong point here), I had several CTDs and unfortunately the saving system is kind of annoying, because every save creates a new seperate data and the more data the longer some loading periods will be. As a 'frequent-saver' I had to clean out a lot...__________________________________________ Conclusion...but this is complaining on a very high level and all in all I can say that this is one of my favourite RPGs. It provides an amazing storyline with great lore and characters in a morally ambigious dark fantasy world that's far away from your typical stereotypes. And all this is backed up by one of the best protagonists of all time: the legendary white wolf, Geralt of Rivia. Every RPG-fan who skips this game will definitely miss something! (...and if only because you can import your finished savegame to the Witcher III).			"

												The Witcher 2 is a narrative driven action RPG by Polish developers CD Projekt Red. To be reductive, it contains a lot of action-like RPG combat and deep mechanics common to Bethesda games, but is also extremely narrative driven to the tune of something Bioware might put out.  Over the course of the game, much of the Witcher's many turning gears become an immensely enjoyable machine, though it jumps to a rough start and could use a more enjoyable combat system.  I did play with the Combat Rebalance mod, which allegedly makes the combat better; truly I think it just made it more trivial, but those may be two sides of the same coin in this case.I started Witcher 2 having never played the Witcher 1, and generally not knowing what the game was about or how it worked.  Let me be blunt -- that is the absolute worst way to start the Witcher 2.  The game does offer an overall useless tutorial (if you have the Enhanced Edition), but otherwise it throws you right into a pretty hot mess.  Very little is explained in the way of combat mechanics, the many systems at your control (things like potions, crafting, magic abilities), and the context of the warring monarchs and their mysterious assassin which are central to its plotline.  Overall, it’s a little daunting to start.  That said, I highly recommend you persevere; lying on the other side is a huge payoff.What makes Witcher 2 shine is the well crafted, incredibly epic story of politicking and sorcery.  What’s even more impressive is the dynamic way in which it is presented to you; very few games give you the sense of control over the story the way Witcher does.  The game is divided into 3 acts, and the second act can be completely different based on decisions you make in the first act.  You will start in a different location, have different characters to interact with, and different quests.  Even more impressive is that Witcher 2 does a good job of staying away from the typical good/bad archetypes; characters usually feel complex and your decisions almost always fall into a gray area.  It never feels like the game is pushing you one direction or the other; sometimes being the bad guy pays off...other times, not so much.  The plot itself is very interesting, though you won’t find anything revolutionary about it.  Voice acting is typically well done, which is good because there is a LOT of it.  At least half the game can easily be spent talking to characters and fleshing out the world in which Witcher 2 takes place.  Cutscenes are serviceable, but nothing extraordinary.  Like many games of this scope, much of the Witcher 2 lacks a certain polish -- the game certainly looks beautiful, but animations are often clunky and transitions are not done well.Lacking the most polish, certainly, is the combat.  Combat in Witcher 2 feels mostly like a buffer between unlocking more of the story.  With the Combat Rebalance mod, parrying is automatic and after some initial struggle, I quickly learned to spam the same ability over and over again, accented by mashing attack and rolling around.  I easily beat 95% of encounters this way.  While you have a lot of options in terms of equipment etc., the majority is useless or unnecessary and I would have liked a little more variety in loot and spells.  I wouldn’t say the combat is outright bad, but it is certainly mediocre and not the highlight here.Overall, while there is a lot to nitpick about Witcher 2, I highly enjoyed it.  It’s a beautiful game which offers up one of the most interesting stories you can find in the medium.  Decisions are impactful and rewarding, even if combat is not.  If you like Skyrim, or Mass Effect, and wish there was a game which blended the two together into a great PC game, look no further than Witcher 2.			"

												One of my all-time favourite games. Geralt of Rivia has never looked better than here, everything about this game still impresses me. They took the first game and improved on almost everything except the stances..bring back the fighting stances .  This came out the same time as Dragon Age II which i also purchased and i have to say after that dissapointment i could have kissed CDPR's feet after playing this gem 7 times to completion. The game requires you to play it twice to get the full story...but i just loved it that much. The dev is also awesome and deserves everyones support, they actually treat us with some respect and not cash cows .EDIT : Unbelievable but they actually did it ! Witcher 3 is better than this amazing title. Its really something special when a dev improves on each game in a trilogy MANY other large companies could learn a thing or two from these guys.			"

												the Witcher II is one of the best RPG's I have ever played. The game is based on series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski named ""the Witcher"". The story overall is a sequel to the Witcher SAGA. The game has a very extrodinary combat system, along with character development. The choices and the dialogs that you chose have a big impact on the overall story. the PROS: + great combat system+ pretty Geralt and pretty girls.+ long + huge amount of replayability+ rich fantatasy world and storyline+ amazing graphics and texturesthe CONS+ can't think of any. - crashed twice.

												War. Deceit. Terrorism. Murder. Sex. Treason. Prostitution. Violence. Loyalty. Espionage. Racism. If somebody tells you that Witcher 2 is for mature audiences, this isn’t because it’s exceptionally bloody or gory for a title of its genre – it’s because of the world and stories that it presents.It’s true: the graphics are mostly really good, even stunning in places. Battle is tactical and you have to learn how to use both your weaponry and your magic abilities in order to succeed. Music and sound are pretty good - the nice use of different dialects is a good reason that you should consider playing it in English even if that’s not your native language. The flaws that actually bothered me were few - like the fact that Geralt (your character) puts up the same facial expression for 80% of his dialogue. Yet it’s the storytelling and the way you shape WHAT story unfolds that I enjoyed most.Geralt has a real talent to end up as the “right guy in the wrong place”. And even though he progresses through the quests for pretty personal reasons, he constantly finds himself forced to make decisions that have a much larger impact than his personal fate.  Who will you trust? Who will you help? By the time you finish the first chapter you will have made decisions that will not only control the way you experience the rest of the story, but also will shape the lifes of many of the characters you met and – in the end – maybe even the rise and the fall of the nations that you cross. As usual in the Witcher games, you will find that not all of your decisions have the effect that you hoped, and often you only can try to choose the lesser evil. When I finished the game I felt the urge to play the Witcher 3  (which isn’t released at the time of this writing). Not because of the (hopefully) good gameplay and graphics that I expect – but because I wonder where Geralt's personal story and the big events that happen around him will finally lead.So do yourself a favor, get past the crappy tutorial and average prologue and then – starting with the first chapter - play one of the finest RPGs that are out there.

												If you already played The Witcher 3 and came here looking for something like TW3 in terms of graphics and gameplay, you might wanna think two times before buying TW2... The gameplay is a ""little"" different and way more limited than TW3. In terms of difficulty, TW3 is ""piece of cake"" compared to TW2. But, if you want to see Geralt dealing with an extremely complex political plot, romance, sex  and a story where your choices can change dramatically the storyline (8 different conclusions!), you must buy this game right now! It's serious, it really worth it. P.S.: And you can play it on Linux!!! =D			"

												Now, really, can you say something bad about Witcher games in general? The series are pinnacle of RPG gaming, and developers really tried to present the best RPG experience to the gamers, and, I dare to say, they succeeded. The story of Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings takes place after the first game. Someone blamed you for murdering a King, and you set off to find out the culprit. Simple as that, but, the story is also about Geralt regaining his memories.  The graphics are quite good and enchanted in relation to the first Witcher game. Attentions to the small things are amazing, from the detailed characters and environments to special effects, and Witcher is a truly an eye candy for gaming masses. In regard to that, you really need a high end PC machine to play the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. The world of Witcher is huge and along the way you will meet a bunch of interesting characters, have a lot of...virtual sex, fight many kind of monsters, etc. Sometimes the game feels a bit to grindy, but your choices and fights you are engaging yourself into really impact the outcome of the story. Sometimes the battles seem a bit to tough, and RPG beginners could find the game more challenging, but, once you gain enough experience under your belt, the battles become easier. All Witcher games are highly recommended, and this one is no exception. This is simply something best that RPG games can offer. Don't miss it.			"

												Reviewing the first game of The Witcher Saga I remember writing ""this is a badass RPG""... well, this second installment is at least ten times better. The combat system is much more fluid, allowing spectacular kill-streaks, and the game is pretty fun to play even with a gamepad (but navigating the inventory with it is kinda frustrating). Graphics-wise the game is just wonderful, it seems impossible that it was released in 2011. The story is compelling and full of humour, intrigues and plot twists, and since you'll have to choose between two possible paths at the end of Act I, you need AT LEAST two different playthroughs to explore all the content (but to really see everything you'll probably need to reload your savegame at least 4 or 5 times in certain situations). I cannot think about a single reason not to try this game, especially if you're a RPG aficionado. They're pretty cheap (Summer sale is about to start and I guess you can buy both games for around 6 or 7 euros) and they're absolutely awesome. Plus, you'll support CD Projekt RED, a GREAT developer that will also give you a DRM Free copy on GOG if you enter your Steam Key on their website. Try The Witcher Saga. You won't be disappointed.

												Witcher 2 deservers the title “The Best RPG of the Year” in my opinion. Graphically the most impressive RPG to date is truly a PC game, not some mediocre port from consoles. It was developed for PC and will squeeze every bit of your PC power for its full beauty. Gameplay wise, Witcher 2 deserves high praise for its rich story and dialogue. Multiple possible endings will increase its replayability, as well as possibility to permanently fail certain quests. Rich crafting, character development, large beautiful world, interesting characters make this game a must have for all RPG fans. Witcher 3 can’t come soon enough!Gameplay 8/10Sound 9/10Story 9/10Graphics 10/10Polish 10/10Overall Score 9/10 (outstanding game)			"

 Immersive story with a terrific graphics The Witcher 2: Assassins of The Kings is a game which is able to devour you for days and you still won't have enough of it after finishing. The game noticeably focuses on storytelling and explicates everything to the detail so even the most curious and demanding players get their money's worth. The famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia, lost his memory and slowly remembers what had happened. On his way he has many options what to do, how to respond or react, but still everything revolves around a mysterious slayer of the kings. This assassin might be the key to Geralt's past. Geralt's path is completed by a wide range of cutscenes which complements already thrilling story.Pros✪ Detailed story and background✪ Breathtaking cutscenes✪ High quality graphics ✪ Large scale of possibilities✪ Elaborate 3 branch talent treeCons✪ Complex background could be chaotic for new players and takes a while to understand who is who and what is going on. On the other side players can simply ignore parts which are not directly connected to Geralt.  They will miss a lot though ✪ Combat system is something I personally didn't enjoy much and had a problem to cooperate with. Still it's something players get used to. 8.5 /10 "

												This is a good game. It improved on the first game by a generous amount obviously. Graphics are impressive, not only for the year it was made, but still to this day in 2016. Dark, tense, and epic story. Combat to me wasn't very fluid and I highly encourage using a controller. I tried with mouse and keyboard and I got very confused and frustrated. There are moments that should be much more epic. Certain battles and stuff seem....lacking. Builds are pretty simple. One rule: never invest in the alchemy skill tree. Completely useless. There is a combat mod that cdprojektred themselves created if you wanna try that out. It is significantly better than the base game's tree system. This game could be so much more epic than it already is. You will see why if you play it. It is a good game. I was more enamoured with it before Witcher 3 came out, which set a new standard for me. Pick it up for a good adventure. Try your best to get it on sale though. Still pretty cheap regardless. Sometimes they bundle Witcher 1 and 2 together for like $10 or something like that. Pick it up then. Still recommending because it is good. Worth the money and the time.			"

The sex scenes are also better than mass effect.-Video fanmade trailer I made -

			Just something I worked on for my return on reviews again, . Enjoy since i'll need some time to work on it, something to hype you up on. I'll be writing my honest opinion on this game .		

Anyways to start off you play as Geralt of Rivia who Is a witcher, witchers are monster hunter beings who uses alchemy to hunt demons, vampires, monsters so on. Geralt is on the search for his memory because he has forgotten his past and must rediscover who he is. While on this quest he was fighting for the king when suddenly he is now framed as the killer of the king. Geralt will have to find the killer and prove his innocenceOne of my top all time favorite game. This game has amazing graphics, Great voice acting, Great story, and devs that supported free updates. Based loosely on the book that is Polish you'll love this game and come to embrace the world of the witcher.+ One of the first few games that didn't start as a Console created port+ Well done Graphics (has high end settings)+One of the first few companies that did not feature DRM in a very long time on thier game.+Great soundtrack+ Best sex scenes ever seen in a game lol+ Well done voice acting+ Story keeps you wanting to know more+ The multiple path is great for replayability (mainly 2 major branch choices by who you join)+ Enhanced version includes Dark mode .- Lack of customization of character- The combat can be very unforgiving- Monsters don't really respawn and some of the quests are kinda boring sometimes, could be much better- Controls can be awkward at times- NEED MOAR COMBAT! (once you kill all there isn't much)- combat use to be clunky but that was fixed with update and is much better than it was			"

IntroThe Witcher 2.... Where to start? The company is offering free DLCS and long term support and also made the game no DRM. Which means there is no negative effect on performance due to protection. Choices MatterThe game itself has excellent story telling elements. Alongside the fact that every mission you do effects the outcome of you're stories which can result to 16 different endings makes this game have alot of replay value. GameplayThe gameplay however is a deep learning curve. Anyone who hasn't played the witcher 1 prepare for a bit of dieing. The basic idea is that you use steel sword against humans, and silver against monsters. They took a odd approach in making you need to drink potions before combat in order to use them to your advantage. I found this a very huge turn in how difficult a rpg can be. Generally in other rpgs like Skyrim for example you had the handicap of being able to pause the game and drink some HP or mana potions. In this game you need to really know what your doing and what your about to fight in trial and error to prepare well.Mini-GamesThe game has a few mini-games that really add to the overall experience (Brawls,Gambling). The dice games and brawls have their own narrative in which you will get certain items or information you otherwise might not have obtained and has some-what importance though they are not vital to the overall experience. GraphicsThe graphics are constantly compared to Crysis. While it might not have better graphics tech wise. Many agree its artistic value is far superior to that of Crysis. ConclusionOverall the witcher 2 is a great game that I would recommend anyone who is already into fantasy RPGs and is looking for another solid game to play with good story elements.			"

												For a long time Rhadras urged me to play Witcher 2, knowing I hadn't overly enjoyed the first game due to the horrible swamp chapter. I finally caved in and... I enjoyed it!Just like in Witcher I put the combat level down to easy, or should I say the game decided I should play on easy after the brief combat tutorial at the start. I didn't mind this, as I'm not overly fond of the combat in the Witcher games, yet I didn't feel like it got in the way of the stroy like it did in the first game. The general feeling of Witcher 2 is that everything is bigger and yet it feels quicker, more refined - streamlined.There wasn't a point in Witcher 2 where I felt like I was just going back and forth forever, and the somewhat open chapter hubs kept things interesting even if there wasn't much to explore.The story does a great job of filling in the blanks for both the player and Geralt, setting up Witcher 3 very nicely.

												Oh god, how can I start this? First of all I hope you understand my position and dont downvote just because of a fanboy impulse. Thanks for reading. I tried I REALLY REALLY tried to like this game but I just can't (look at my play time, no joking around or justifying over false basis). The story, graphics and music are awesome but the combat mechanics and the insane amount of walking around with a robotic-like animation kills it. I've even tried to play it again with the full combat rebalance mod but... the mechanic itself its soooo broken that I just can't like it. I feel like I have little to no control over Geralt or combat in general for many reasons:- The awful auto targeting mechanic... Anybody would expect presing a key or pushing the stick towards a specific direction and hit the strike button and see your character attack in that direction but no... Geralt attacks the character that he is auto targetting. I've died SO many times because of that. Trying to cast an Igni sign to the front and seeing Geralt turn around and cast it on another direction is priceless... The same goes with sword attacks. I really felt like I had more control on the witcher 1 and that is saying A LOT.-Animations are confusing and illogical. Sometimes I hit an enemy and it doesn't count as a hit because the did an evade movement (even though the sword actually FULLY touched them). I thought ok then the same goes for me right? NOPE. On your evade/roll animation, if you get  touched, you are hit... Then sometimes the enemies appear to be stun locked and you think YEAH I can keep hitting them. NOPE. They magically recover from the middle of a ""stun"" animation in the middle of your next swing and OWN YOU (on higher difficulties). You really can never tell when its safe to keep slashing or back away so the game becomes a slash roll away, slash, roll away, repeat and pray that your next slash doesnt get ""magically evaded"" and your foe attacks you in a second of invincibility... -Attack animations are not in your control, sometimes the animation is ""cooler"" but it takes longer to land a hit and you never know when will what animation appear so you are basically F-ed since you can plan your attacks so well. Theres no pattern the animations are random, no combos.-You cant block while you walk, yes you read right, YOU CANT.-Did I mention the walking? You have to walk too much, the backgrounds look nice but will get old and boring once you complete the monster hunt missions and get an empty area.-Parry+Riposte mechanic is broken. Sometimes you get the symbol to do it and even though the parry animation shows and you block the hit and actually execute the attack, the enemy sometimes keeps attacking you and OWN YOU since you are in the middle of a swing, defenseless.-You cant drink potions in the middle of a fight and it gets annoying if you sum the time it takes for geralt to sit down, open the menu, make the potion, drink the potion, then stand up.-At some point you'll find out that you can beat the game spamming Igni signs.And the cherry on top of the cake of the cake: the game doesn't run so well. Witcher 3 and Gorund Zeroes run much better than this game, and that's a shame :( The game autosaves a lot and dont erase the much older saves. There are so many saves that on one point the load game screen starts to need a considerable amount of seconds to even show up. Sometime it just crashes and brings down Steam too (I have to end the process and restart steam).Sum up: Personally I think this game its a step in the right direction but it didn't reach the goal as it was supposed to. Thankfully the witcher 3 fixed every detail I'm complaining about. Even though it still shares the auto target function it lets you back away from the middle of a possible suicide attack by letting you cancel it through rolling or evading. The monsters' health bar blinks when they are about to attack, potions during combat and quick navigation through menus are back, etc. That game is what this one was supposed to be, but died trying. I reapeat: I hope you understand my position and dont downvote just because of a fanboy impulse. Thanks for reading.			"

												Bigger, more beautiful and far more complicated, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a terrific game, but beware, you might find yourself missing certain details and plots if you haven’t read the books.StoryWe continue our adventures as Geralt of Rivia, the famous monster slayer, this time, we face new difficulties as a mysterious group of people has started killing kings, we find ourselves struggling to clear our name after being framed for one of these murders. Following clues, finding key people and killing monsters will be the foundations for this new quest for the Witcher. More and complicated political issues and alliances are part of the story this time, as we have to take sides, each side leading to new missions and characters.GameplayThe Witcher 2 is a totally different game if we compare it to the original title, controls have been changed making gameplay more difficult to get used to, as we must learn how to use every new control and key. Bombs, traps and daggers were incorporated to make gameplay more varied, we still have the use of signs and our well-known steel and silver swords.On this occasion, signs feel more significant, they have a different touch, this time signs make you feel they are important to use depending on the battle we are having or the danger we are facing, they are concise and powerful to use, they deliver powerful blows and do a great deal of damage, even more if you level up the power and use of stamina.Bombs, traps and daggers are a great new addition, but in my case, I stuck only to bombs as they are more reliable and have more variation, poisonous, shrapnel, explosive, you name it, we have many different bombs for different situations, they are created the same way potions are created, by meditating, just get the right ingredients and the formula and you are all set.The new system includes quickslots, very helpful in fighting situations, here you can select which kind of secondary attack you wish to use, bombs, traps and daggers are the only options.Meditating is still tactical, as you may know, the witcher games are not the typical hack ‘n’ slash game, before going into any battle against monsters or humans, meditating is important and a must for you have to drink the right potion and brew what you need for battle, this characteristic has been improved as well, we no longer need a fire to meditate, just any place with no danger around will suffice. Leveling up will give us points we can spent on the skill tree where we have four paths, each of these paths have multiple options we can improve, so choosing correctly is up to you.Depending on the development of your skill tree Geralt will start showing more fighting moves, the power of signs will increase, toxicity tolerance will improve and also a new addition has been introduced, the adrenaline rush, a perk that will deliver a killing move as an in-game cinematic.TW2 offers more variety regarding armors and swords, the previous title was very limited and the creation of new swords was narrowed to some few silver and steel swords, even worst for armor sets, here we get to find new and better armor sets with many different perks and characteristics, the same for swords, blacksmiths are more common and ingredients for the creation of new tools are plentiful.GraphicsTW2 is a beautiful game, it is a gigantic step taken if we compare it to the original witcher, gameplay changed so did graphics and effects, it feels smoother and more defined. While the graphics are one of a kind here, the game also offers a great detail in weather effects and it adds a more consistency regarding the climate as well as day and night cycles. The engine really shines every time many of these aspects interact whether in battle or just when searching for clues related to any of the many missions and side-quests. There are little details in all sort of vegetation, the skies show multiple effects depending on the levels and sometimes in the distance the firmament is shown full of stars. More importantly, the engine is very keen to show off the diversity in the main cities we visit. Especially Upper Aedirn, a fantastic city built by dwarves, every stone, from a little stone to the biggest of the constructions the city is of a great design, it really captures the atmosphere of a place that has seen countless battles, magnificent.Sound and voicesThe series has always been very serious regarding sound and voice acting, and this time is not an exception, voice actors did a great job on every aspect of the acting, characters are believable and demonstrate different kind of accents during the story, we even get to listen to more of the elves’ language, superb work, nothing negative here.As for sound, TW2 is solid, we can feel the atmosphere on any landscape’s sound, nature, monsters etc. Everything is unique and deserves attention while the music adds intention and action to every battle, mission and interaction. Outstanding.The bad but not seriousPerhaps what makes this game difficult to get used to is the amount of characters, their personal views, politics and different story lines and past events that make the lore of the witcher a deep abyss of details, it might be complicated for people not familiar with the books, at least, on my first play through, I felt lost in the middle of the politics, unlike the original witcher, TW2 shows a more mature and adult view of the world. I would mention not to pick this one without a little bit of knowledge related to the lore, I strongly recommend the books to get a better insight of the witcher world and politics, after that, the series starts to be easier to understand and at the same time it helps appreciate even more the different aspects of the game, the kingdoms, lands and peoples, wars and history.ConclusionAs I said before, The Witcher 2 is a more mature game, a more adult-oriented title that will not disappoint at all, it has the depth regarding stories and lore, and it shows a more complex game style, definitely a must for RPG lovers and fans of the books.

												Playing this game once is like getting 40% of the story. (Even when you spent 50 hours to do all the side quests and trying to read in-game books, chat with NPCs and trying to get much info about in-game world as possible)When you playing the game second time - just curious what happen if you change your choices and play style (harder difficulty, different skill tree) - you would stay stunned like ""HOLY ♥♥♥♥! There are so much possibilities, characters, events, new unexplored areas, new quests, connections, consequences and points of views I could not even imagine on first time play.""  There it comes the moment you start really realize what have you trully done, changed, and to whom you probably helped on the first play. (In game there are lots of shady characters and you can never be sure of their goal and side when you just look at them from one point of view). Obviously the second play results in decision, that you have to play that game at least one more time.To deeper understanding the story I really recommend to read all Witcher books from Andrzej Sapkowski which are events before Witcher games. And in Witcher 2 you would need those information much more then in Witcher 1 (one could say that you really dont need to know much about books in W1) to get full understanding about what is really going on. And what is finaly going to happen in W3 Wild Hunt.The impact of your choices to the game characters, lands and whole word order is HUGE and will probably means a LOT in grand finale in Witcher 3 so far as I can see and will be very interesting to see how they change the next episode. Thus I reccomend you to keep your final saves from Witcher 2 to import them to Witcher 3. (I heard that steam cloud only stores last 100 saves. I have about 250 saves on 1 ending, which means you are not able to keep all your endings in cloud after uninstaling. Keep that in mind)Summary:+ Great story continuation of Witcher books by Sapkowski+ make your choices and face their consequences+ singleplayer you can and should play more then once (multiple endings)+ choices and results imported from Witcher 1 and to Witcher 3+ shady fantasy world in its real nature (nothing is black and white)+ amazing graphic world+ nice cinematic scenes+ nice soundtrack+ swordmanship, magic and potions- too much saves results in crashing (you need to clean up your old saves in folder from time to time)- players thad didnt read books could be a bit lost in plot and could miss much important things (but still could enjoy the playing :p)- playing on the highest difficulty is both: incredible easy (most of the time) and almost impossible (on specific event when you lack some specific skill - ""riposte/position/feet work"" seems like Holy Trinity to surviving - which result in ""hours"" of reloading trying to beat the game with different skill tree. Simply boring and makes you angry. Especially without riposte it takes much much much more longer and its very hard to survive when you controll ghost soldiers in ghost battle (it seems that this is the only skill that is usable in that fight and your increased vigor - not through potions though - all other stats, improvements, and skills you choose are not applicable in that part of the game making this one skill like a must-win / must-lose-hard choice. Yeah it is possible even without it if you have the nerves and time ;) I did. Just warning you :P "

												RECOMMEND WITH A WORD OF WARNINGThis game is really fun - but a word of warning:  The steam game is not fully updated through Steam for some reason.  Because of this you may run into game breaking bugs like I did.  These are only fixable by loading a save hours and hours back.So do yourself a favor and visit the developers support page and manually update the game to fix this.  Currently they are up to patch 3.4 (download 3.3 and then the game launcher will update to 3.4)http://en.cdprojektred.com/support/?support-product=the-witcher-2 "

												I only played it to get a better understanding of the witcher universe before starting on Witcher 3.Overall Graphics - 8/10 Pretty good for a game that came out in 2011, with mods its even better, not as good looking as skyrim modded but its good.Gameplay - 7/10 You can't jump in this game which is annoying. Combat Mechanics feel abit clunky but it gets the job done. Its not a hack n slash game, you have to plan before the fight and make use of other mechanics such as parrying, dodging, spells, oils and potions besides spamming left click - sword attack button. Else, you'll get rekt.Story - 8/10 The choices you make affect the places you go to as well as the outcome of the storyline. You could play through this game twice to experience entirely different areas and outcomes. Overall: Bought it for $2 during steam sale, You got an almost polished AAA title. Its a no brainer, get it.			"

												This is my first time finishing the game, and I have also played through the first game. Although it kept the same quality of epic storyline, a lot was noticeably different to the first game, is more complicated in a lot of its mechanics and I found the combat more difficult, although I got used to it in the end. I liked the way you had to think about things a lot more, use more strategy in battle, use all the signs, traps and bombs, not just Aard/coup-de-grace everything in sight. The quests are also more complicated, they are no longer WoW-style kill 20 things/collect 20 things quests, they almost all have multiple ways to resolve them and some of the possible ways require you to find out things the game doesn't automatically tell you about. Even shopping is more complicated, there is a crafting system with templates to buy, and money is often scarce. A lot of potions have drawbacks and levelling up involves a more detailed skill tree. I enjoyed the return of the poker dice quest, as well as Geralt's adventures in arm-wrestling and prize-fighting. I would recommend playing it, as it has a good story, good music and satisfying gameplay, the most important things in an RPG for me, I have a few complaints: The game sometimes hangs for no discernable reason (I am using a fairly high-end Windows 8.1 laptop), which the first game also did. The 'mature' aspects of the game are getting more tacky. I quite liked the erotic artwork and occasionally bizarre implied sexual tastes of the first game, but they've been replaced by the same incredibly repetitive cut scene that leaves virtually nothing to the imagination. Even when Geralt meets the succubus, there's nothing particularly remarkable about his amorous adventures. Also, ALL the NPCs make ribald jokes and swear for no particular reason ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE GAME. And, inevitably, there are lesbians for humorous effect. It feels kind of immature, not mature. The level of explicit violence is also getting more needlessly extreme and gratuitous. and the cut scenes in the strange animated style faintly annoy me.The story still feels unresolved, as the problems you solve mostly come back as soon your back is turned, which gets my mood a little low. Geralt doesn't seem to really have much effect on the wider story of the world, he just solves his own personal storyline, mostly getting his memory back. Everyone is still at war, everything is still a damn mess. It's like a tabletop game where the GM won't let you actually change his beloved world. The growing Wild Hunt theme is the most interesting part of the story that seems to actually concern you, and the third Witcher game is called Wild Hunt, so maybe the plot will actually get somewhere next game?

												Right after i finished number 1, i started with the second witcher game. And I can safely say I am pleased with this game. This game has the perefct balance between story, gameplay, and game lenght. There's quite a bit of dialog, but if you dont like it, you can just skip the talking. This is a rpg game for adults. There's politics, ethical problems, and a bunch of hard choises to make. I spent about 35 hours, and I did almost everything the game has to offer. There's an arena mode wich does not have anything to do with the story of the game, where you fight against increasingly hard waves of enemies, wich game me an hour of enjoyment, but you can play it for quite a bit. In summary, this is one of the best games I have played. The story is amazing, and i was caught in the situations of the game at all times. I was suprised when the game was finished, since I didn't feel time flowing. The gameplay is an HUGE upgrade from the last one, and skill is a bigger factor than stats. The lore and immersion is fantastisc, i actually went through all the books i found. It altso looks amazing, still, in 2016. This one is among the best games I have played, and it deserves a 10/10. Now, I'm starting the third, and probably the last game in the series. Va'fail!			"

												What an immersive tale! This game really ticks all the boxes (except for one very minor point) for a great RPG.Since I played this game right after finishing the first Witcher game I need to say how much more fun the game is to play. Even if there's a fair amount of 'backtracking' it never feels like a chore. My main problem with the first game (the fighting mechanics) got a complete overhaul and are now actually one of the game's stronger points.The presentation is great. The graphical style, the oversaturated colours and the effects really add up to an amazing experience even today. The music and sound effects are very atmospheric too. The voice acting is even better than in the first game and that's quite a feat to achieve.One major issue with the game is the length. It's just too short! It's an intense ride and after 30 to 40 hours you just don't feel like letting go. Luckily there's a really good incentive to replay the game right away (which I'll do now).Another minor complain is the save system. You can save manually and can quicksave, but you can't overwrite older manual saves nor quicksaves. That leads to a huge amount of save files if you don't delete them manually... one by one. Really don't know why the game does it this way.The plot and the characters are the main flesh of the game and they are making the whole game the gem that it is. The three chapters are perfectly balanced and not at all streched out this time. I only wish there was a bit more to do besides the main story, but I gladly take the 'no filler' approach if it's this well made.The game is great and even if it's packed with cutscenes, they are all worth it. Just a great RPG that makes me hungry for the third part.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced EditionDeveloper:  CD PROJEKT REDPublisher:  CD PROJEKT REDGenre:  Role Playing GameGeneral ImpressionA sequel that improves in almost every way compared to its predecessor and paved the way for the masterpiece that is The Witcher 3. The trilogy has constantly changed to cater the needs and desires of its fanbase, a thing most evidently found in the streamlining process of The Witcher 2 in regards to the first one in the series. The graphics in Assassins of Kings are gorgeous and demanding even after 5 years since its release. You will need both a decent system and plenty of time to enjoy this game. It's not worth rushing through it or skipping any dialogue. In fact, I highly recommend that you play and finish The Witcher 1 first, so that you may import your very own save file (and game choices) into Witcher 2. This save system and the choices that ultimately matter, make the series as fascinating as Mass Effect or Dragon Age. Only the best crafted RPGs care for player choices throughout several gameplays.Strong Points+ Gorgeous graphics.+ Excellent storyline and setting.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  A few glitches.Rating 10/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												The 2011 Game of the Year.Let me start off by saying that the first Witcher finally made me start playing RPG's. It's a game that I am still thinking of once in a while even years after I beat it. It's a game, although with limited amount of NPC (even the enhanced version) and some minor issues, that will stand the test of time. It's a game, whose soundtrack I am still listening to. It's a game whose folklore still captivates me with its creativity and versatility.The art direction in this game is bound to get some awards at the end of the year. It is perplexing just to look at the distant vistas that are missing from so many games. The first Witcher pulled that off on occasion. Such areas as The Lake provided you with the feeling like you were in a big world even though you were confined to an average-size area. Witcher 2 takes this to another level. Not only do you get to enjoy the distant cascading vistas that are staggered by layers and layers of the nearby and the faraway horizons, you also get to enjoy the near environments teeming with life. Yes, we have seen some impressive NPC behavior in the past but this time, the behavior of some of the NPC is near unpredictable. And don't expect them to stand around this time and have same faces.The game features extremely well written dialogue with plenty of words that I had to look up. The story arches in many different directions depending on your actions or inactions. This is a very very mature game. I was able to import my last saves from the first game - which supposedly influences some of the dialogue between the characters. Some of the events are also going to be influenced, supposedly...The long loading times when you enter a new area or even a small house are gone now. Also, if you walk inside someone's premises, you will be amazed by the attention to detail. They devs haven't missed anything on this one.In general, Witcher 2 instantly sucks you in with its immense ambience. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings I had when I was walking through the forest for the first time. Sometimes I find myself standing still in the forest and attempting to look as far as I can and behind every tree you can see another tree and so on...I have never seen anything like it. I also love the background blur.Do not expect this game to be easy though. It is pretty hard. The combat system takes a while to get used to. You will have to time your attacks with almost near precision. Not only that, you will have to combine your regular attacks with your special attacks to cause the maximum amount of damage. The battle system in the first game was sort of a war of attrition. You would usually be surrounded by enemies and you'd have to quickly switch in between your fighting moves to finish everyone off before you yourself died. It will probably take you a while to be able to come out of the fights near-unscathed. So at first you will most likely die and die and die.The game however, gives you plenty of opportunity to roam around and collect herbs before you get into doing heavy quests. In most RPG's, there is no indication of how hard one or another quest is going to be. But we always assume that we will be able to complete it. This game does not let you do that.And unlike the first game that heavily required the use of potions on the Hardest mode, this game require the use of potions on the Medium mode. This time, you really have to look for those ingredients.The ironic thing is that even if you are able to stuff your pockets with the ingredients, you still only know the very basic alchemy at the beginning of the game. So using the temporary oils that will temporarily enhance your melee attacks is essential.Quests. Ok, do you remember all those silly fetching quests in Dragon Age 2 that take place on the same areas over and over again? Now you can forget about all that. I cannot believe that the writers of these games still haven't run out of original ideas for the secondary quests.I am also happy to see some of the Witcher 1 monsters coming back. Not to mention the fact that they look better and move more realistically.Just like with the first game, there is this dichotomy present within human interactions. On one hand, you are the monster slayer, but you are not necessarily the protector of the people. So do not expect to always find sympathizers and allies within the immediate human communities. The racial tensions are still here too and there's plenty of vulgarity to go around.The soundtrack is perfect. Does anyone remember ""Peaceful Moments"" from the first game? You'll hear plenty of that here.There are also easter eggs pertaining to Assassin's Creed and to the Lord of the Rings.Anyways, I never gave any game a ""10"", but this game truly deserves it. I really cannot see much wrong with it and I've been playing it since midnight. One thing that is annoying is the disappearing bodies and the ability to loot people's homes without any repercussion. In addition, you really DO have to think ahead and anticipate the movement of your foes.All in all, I got myself a collector's edition. If anyone can afford to get it, please get it - the devs need our support. I won't hesitate to say that this is the most beautiful game ever created, so far; and so far it is my favorite game of all time, until the Witcher 3, of course...I am also happy to boast that on May 13, 2013 after approximately 170 hours of trying I was able to beat the game on Insane difficulty (as in beating the game with permadeath difficulty).

												In the simplest terms, starting to play Witcher 2 is a lot like taking a vacation to a country where you go only sightseeing: you'll sure see some amazing and cool stuff, but you'll have to suffer a lot of unnecessary punishment, fatigue and stress (I pat myself on the back for this analogy). I mean the difficultly curve, interface and mechanics sadly limit the game's appeal. But maybe it's because the developers intentionally don't want to cater to the mainstream audience. And that's probably the attitude that is needed in order to create one of the few adult video games that confidently stands tall as a good game with it's own heart and identity.

												A great Role Playing Game.What i felt was good:+ The design of the world, it is beautifully handcrafted.+ Rich lore (there were books before there was a game).+ Voice acting is great.+ No pansy censorship.+ You have to actually study/read ingame books to figure out how to battle certain enemies or what piece of puzzle you are missing to finish a quest (one does not simply ""find an Endrega Queen in XY coordinate marked on your map""). Of course you can accidentally figure it all out, no triggers. Completing quests feels rewarding.+ Difference between Prepared for combat and Casually going somewhere hacking away is very noticeable.+ Preparation for combat is more important than ""leveling up"".Not that good:- There is no potion for sprinting. Sometimes I'd wish one could sprint for brief moments. You will find yourself running across big towns a lot, at least they are beautiful.Unsure:~ Getting used to combat mechanics takes a while, but partially it is about knowledge of enemy and how to counter it.

												Firstly, if you seek to play the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, I recommend getting the Witcher 2 first.I have never bought the first game in the series, with outdated graphics and combat, but I am really glad to have played this.The highlights of the game are quite definitely the graphics and the story. For a 2011 game, the world looks beautiful. Textures can look a bit grainy at times, but they are so colourful and vibrant you'll end up loving them.As for the story, what the Witcher series does best (at least the 2 games I've played), is make you feel like you're the main character, you ARE Geralt, his friends are your friends. This is what makes the franchise special. The plot is about Geralt trying to get his memory back, him getting framed for a crime, and all this is intertwined with a political plot. It might get a tad confusing at times though.The game is a lot about decisions. Remember, a single line of dialogue can change your whole journey.As far as combat goes, it's fun, but I HIGHLY recommend playing on normal or hard, as easy mode makes fighting human enemies a joke. I figured this after having played easy for a while, and I got rekt.Onto the caveats.The ui is a bit hard to understand, and not too user friendly. Alchemy is not too fun, although it might be me hating consumables (which is another reason why I love Wild Hunt!).The world is not exactly open world. The game is divided into three main zones, through which you can progress by doing the main quests. You can freely explore one area, but you can't go back to previous ones. And you really have no reason to explore much other than doing quests or destroy monster nests.The most frustrating part about the game for me are the invisible walls. 98% of the time you can't even fall off a ledge or go in water. The Flotsam Forest is actually a maze, because you can't go through bushes. Still, I did play this game just after playing 2 ""wall-less"" RPGs, so maybe it's just me.Anyway, definitely recommended, will help to understand the Witcher 3's story (you might wanna look up The Witcher 1's story before playing this, it will help you with your initial interrogation).8/10 "

												First of all I’d like to state that although I have clicked the ‘do not recommend’ option, my position toward the game is one of neutrality, neither dismissing it as unplayable nor condoning the exuberant praise that The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings seems to receive. The game has many redeeming features which shall be discussed shortly, however I feel as though there are just as many aspects that make the player underwhelmed with his/her experience. Secondly, I should say that this review builds upon my review of the original Witcher, which I have also reviewed on Steam, so I will be making a few comparative points in light of my disposition toward the first instalment in the series.The Witcher 2 is driven extremely well by an engrossing narrative of political intrigue, racial prejudice and social injustice. Although the hybrid of Medieval and fantasy themes has been done before and is far from original, The Witcher 2 fully embraces the combination and creates a three-dimensional world with rounded and well thought-out characters that have their own individual agendas and follow them accordingly. There are a few plot twists along the way which I, of course, won’t mention, but these keep the narrative feeling fresh and engaging enough to continue playing til the end. I would say that the story, fresh from the pages of the original comics, is the main factor encouraging gamers to try this game.Furthermore, we aren’t babysat. Nothing has been toned or dumbed down, which is preferable as too few games are made in modern times that have been made for an adult audience. We are shoehorned immediately into the action and I think that’s why the game puts many people off in the initial stages, claiming it to be unfriendly to new users to the series. I would argue this is a commendable feature however, as the harsh and merciless world of Geralt is directly reflected in the games content and contextual features. The combat is far more engaging than in the original WItcher, due simply to it being more enjoyable. That being said, it is far from perfect. Battles range from being far too easy to far too hard far too quickly. We can quickly descend into the ‘trial and error’ form of gaming, constantly reloading previous saves in order to trial new ways of beating a difficult enemy. You can also only drink or create potions before a battle, not during it, which is more realistic I accept, but ultimately make many aspects of the combat frustrating. If I realise that a potion improving my vigor regeneration will help me win a battle in its opening stages, why not just let me drink one? The guise of this being ‘unrealistic’ simply makes alchemy and potion consumption frustrating; constantly saving, reloading and drinking potions before a known fight drastically effect the pace of the game and cause a stuttering experience that is cause for concern.Perhaps the most disappointing characteristic of The Witcher 2 though is the world itself. I don’t mean its concept, I mean in its literal physicality. The areas you can explore are minuscule in terms of a 21st century RPG and the areas are quickly covered and recovered time and again. This makes the quests fairly limited, as there is only so much to do in a rather small gaming arena. Quests such as competing at arm wrestling, dice poker and brawling are irrelevant sideshows, yet if you take  these out you are only left with half dozen side quests in Act I and II respectively, and only a couple in the rather brief Act III. The overall longevity of the game is actually rather small, with a completed game taking between 16-30 hours (and that would be being generous). Essentially, there are a fair number of things to do in the world, but there really aren’t that many, certainly not deserving of high merit.Quest exploration (in terms of the map and quest markers) is a rather touchy subject for both fans and haters of the series alike. Fans of this game state that the map and quest hints are intentionally cryptic because the game encourages you to explore yourself, and that we shouldn’t be spoon fed as gamers. Haters of The Witcher 2 point on the map and quest markers are totally useless, broken, and ruin the gaming experience completely. While I totally back the formers idea in theory, in practice the latter is nearer the truth. Quest markers as you approach them do sometimes teleport elsewhere without explanation, whilst the game map has no concept of ‘levels’, meaning that you may arrive at your destination only to discover that its several floors above you, a particular problem in Vergen. If the developers didn’t want to spoon feed the gamer and it was all about exploration and realism, why bother with a quest marker at all? Why, at the beginning of the majority of quests, does it tell us where to go? The quest exploration in the game seems to be a halfway house between attempting to help the gamer and encourage exploration, yet it ends up failing on both counts.A problem with the critiques of the Witcher are of course, the critics themselves. Haters of the series have complained of a lack of fast travel. There is of course, no problem with that whatsoever. The developers have created a game that is very graphically impressive with some engaging characters, all of which they want you to experience. Removing fast travel will enhance the possibility of experiencing these things. Furthermore, the confines of the world itself is rather tiny meaning that fast travel is, for the large part, totally unnecessary anyway, as it does not take particularly long to run from one side of the map to the other. One of my main bones of contention with the previous Witcher instalment was its ‘mature’ content. I stated in my review of that game that having maturity in the game does not make the game mature, and I think that unfortunately still applies to the sequel. I’m not sure if it’s because the translations from Polish to English are not clear enough, but much of the dialogue feels awkward, with characters using expletives, talking of ♥♥♥♥ and ‘ploughing’ for the sake of it. I think the developers could have included this content without making it so blasé, and it still seems as though the developers are trying to show off to kids and young teens. Nearly all dialogue refers to some obscenity and it becomes tiresome rather quickly. In fact, many of the characters are unlikeable because of this fact, most noticeably Roache and Ioveth. This does help serve the ‘shades of grey’ approach that the developers are going for, using a ‘lesser of two evils’ mindset, yet it is hard to play out an entire game without at least having a couple of likeable characters that we wish to associate with.  A positive note however, is that the ‘Sex Cards’ from the previous game have been removed, presumably because those who were amused or aroused by such content hit puberty and discovered internet porn.Overall, the experience is okay and the narrative really is interesting. But the content of the game, although acceptable, really is not the experience that many exaggerated reviews on Steam that lavish the praise make out that it is. It has many issues that make it fall down. However, I would say that the commercial success of The Witcher 2 should allow the developers the funds to make The Witcher 3 into something special, reflecting an intriguing and exceptional storyline with equally impressive gaming content (for a change).Please review and comment, any feedback is welcome and thank you for reading.

  OVERVIEW  The Witcher 2 is a single-player fantasy role-playing game by CD Projekt RED, starring Geralt, the hero from the first game released in 2007. Geralt is a witcher, a ghost-haired mutant that can wield swords and magical powers to dispatch foes. Expect a large cast of characters to interact with, plenty of ways to upgrade and customize Geralt to suit your play style, and at least one boss fight against a giant tentacle beast.From what's been said about the game so far, The Witcher 2 is enormous. The official word is 38 hours long, though it's unclear how much that may vary if you decide to take part in all the side quests and minigames. Like in the first game, your actions while playing affect what happens later. In the sequel, this may mean you'll miss entire towns (as well as the associated storylines and side quests) on your first playthrough. According to the game's official site there'll be four different beginnings and 16 possible endings.  COMBAT SYSTEM  Combat has also received a significant overhaul. Gone is the restrictive timing-based system used in the original, replaced by a more free-form system that should be more familiar to those who play third-person action games. You'll be able to equip lots of different armor pieces this time, as well use weapons, spells and alchemical components to kill your enemies. It's best to use Geralt's steel blade against humanoids and the silver one for monsters. Geralt's active target is painted with an icon, letting you know who you'll strike with an attack.The most important thing to be mindful of in combat is your command wheel, which can be brought up by holding the Ctrl key. Bringing this up slows time and allows you to select one of Geralt's magical signs, as well as switch between combat items. Using the magical signs is a must. Even before they're powered up through leveling, these abilities can set enemies on fire (Igni), stun and root them in place (opportunity to perform finishing kill), knock them down and a temporarily dampen incoming damage (Aard), shield (Quen), trap to immobilize enemies (Yrden) and triggers a hex that causes an enemy to fight alongside with us (Axii).  Axii is my favorite sign while fighting with group opponent. Hexing them to fight along your side will reduce their enforcement pressure towards us when they are tightening their fight.   PERFORMANCE  The Witcher 2 looks great. Only hours in you'll be treated to stunning views of enormous, sweeping vistas from the side of a castle under siege. Nearly every scene is populated with plenty of characters; the animations are more realistic than the first Witcher game during conversations and combat. Contrast lighting and warm color tone really brings up Witcher 2 among the best-looking games in existence - only the facial animation is imperfect. Background music and sound effect suit the atmosphere so much plus good voice acting supports a charismatic script really brings up Witcher 2 as a whole fantastic game.   ACCESSIBILITY  Approaching a sequel to a dense role-playing game can be daunting. If you never played the first, The Witcher 2 stars an established character you may know nothing about and is set in a detailed fictional world you're likely not familiar. Why bother playing if you're not already invested in the story and characters?So far, a number of reasons The Witcher 2 feels like a older style of role-playing epic: a rich, detailed experience packed with curiosities, creative and flexible quest designs, powerful reasons to explore and deep gameplay mechanics. And, as a bonus, it's much prettier than its predecessor.Witcher fans that played all the way through the first game are definitely getting something extra here. For you there's an existing emotional bond with some of the characters. When Triss and Geralt walk across the screen and reference past events and the names of lands and cities, there's an added layer of meaning.If you didn't play The Witcher you'll be missing out on context, but it won't be long until you're caught up in the pressing drama of the sequel. I certainly wouldn't say you should wait to play The Witcher 2 until you've completed the first game. Due to a number of changes, mostly for convenience's sake, The Witcher 2 for now appears to be the better game. There's a definite learning curve when it comes to things like combat, managing the numerous menus and brewing and using potions, but it doesn't take long for it to make sense.  CHOICE AND CONSEQUENCE  Some role-playing games present choice and consequence in very clear terms. Sometimes you're given points for being good and evil. Your overall moral standing is displayed as a giant glowing meter on your character statistics page. All your decisions are distilled into one numerical value. Sometimes your appearance changes and characters react differently to your presence. The aim of all this is the make your decisions feel like they're having an impact in the world, that the virtual people you're helping or terrorizing remember your actions and, as a result, feel a little bit more human.In The Witcher 2, there's no meter for good and evil. Instead, Geralt operates outside the reach of a persistent morality rating. During a quest Geralt can choose to help out or tell people to get lost in blunt, explicit terms. The results aren't as simple as unlocking a few extra dialogue options. Instead, there are significant changes to the direction of the quests.In The Witcher 2, choice is not an illusion. At no point has this been more obvious than how the story develops toward the end of the first Chapter. A decision needs to be made about how to proceed forward, and the impact will radically change how things evolve. It determines the next city you visit, the cast of characters you follow and the quests made available. It changes your entire perspective on the main events of the game.  CRAFTING AND ALCHEMY  Though the core sword-slashing combat of The Witcher 2 might strike you as straightforward – time mouse clicks to string together slices – there are a lot of ways to modify Geralt's effectiveness in battle. One of the best ways to secure upgrades is through crafting. Most of everything that can be used and equipped in The Witcher 2 can be crafted. You can make traps, steel and silver swords, armor and even crafting components. When you have the appropriate Diagram, usually purchased from vendors, you need to go talk to crafter NPCs standing around in town. By interacting with them a crafting menu can be called up that displays all your Diagrams as well as whether or not you have the proper components. If you do, then after a simple button press the item is generated. There's no percentage chance to fail and there's no associated mini-game.The value and function of potions in The Witcher 2 differs from fantasy role-playing game standards. You can't consume health restoration potions mid-battle in this game. Instead, you need to drink them before a fight begins, which gives Geralt temporary boosts to things like damage and health regeneration. It's a great system because it means you can't run into a conflict without thinking. Making potions is similar to crafting gear. Vendors sell Formulas for potions, and by combining the appropriate plants special brews are created. The actual process of creation isn't handled by a vendor, but instead accessible through Geralt's mediation menu. Here you'll find listed all your Formulas for potions, bombs and oils. If the proper ingredients are in your inventory, the product can be outputted with a keystroke. Simple enough.  REPLAYABILITY  Of course, if you have dozens of times. The Witcher 2 has four different beginnings and 16 possible endings. Enjoy !   VERDICT  8.5/10			"

												I like The Witcher series so much that I buy extra copies, when they go on sale, and give them out to everyone on my friends list like candy. I then, like a mindless monkey, dolled up my Steam account to be all about The Witcher. Why? Because the game is so ploughing good that I've deemed it my most favorite game of all time and I cannot recommend it enough. The Witcher 1 might not be good for everyone, but I still recommend giving it a shot. If you don't like it, then ignore that and move on to The Witcher 2 instead.Oh, I also bought all the books. Witcher!			"

Story:""The Witcher 2"" was inspired by a polish book series  called ""Wiedźmin"". The game tells the story of Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher who is trying to recover his lost memories. Witchers are basically superhumans who can also cast spells and work as mercenaries, who can work as bodyguards, monster hunters, etc.In the beginning he is blamed for the murder of King Foltest (who he was working for at the moment) and went to jail. While there, he is given a chance prove his innocence and goes after the King Slayer while still trying to get his memories back.It's good story overall. I might not be the best but it's certainly good, especially due to the fact that your choices can completly change the Storyline and it has around 4 major endings.GameplayMany people keep complaining about the battle system, but I actually enjoyed it. However, it takes some time until you get used to it.Geralt has 2 different swords: one is made of steel and the other is made of silver. The steel sword it's used against enemies such humans and elves and the silver one it's used against monsters. He can perform a quick and a heavy attack.Geralt can cast 5 different spells, a.k.a. signs: -Aard: Knocks back the enemies, preventing them from blocking your next attacks. There's also a chance of stunning the enemies, which allows you to kill them with just one hit;Yrden: Creates a trap which stuns the enemies and prevent them from defending themselves;Ignis: Geralt casts a fire ball;Quen: Provides full damage protection for a short period of time against a few hits;Axii: Used to turn an enemy against their allies and to persuade NPCs during some dialoguesHis health regenerates very slowly even when you are not in combat, but he can speed it up through potions. However he only drink potions by meditating (which can't be done in combat) and he can't drink too many because they're also toxic.Visuals and SoundtrackThe game still looks pretty good, especially considering that it was released back in 2011. To make things even better the soundtrack was also very well produced. Combining both elements you can get easily immerse in this fantasy world.ConsNow it's time for the cons:-It's not an easy game, but that's not a problem by itself. The real problem are the difficulty spkies, which can be really frustating and some enemies that might seem cheap;-The lack of a fast travel mechanic or even a vehicle or an animal to walk around the map can be annoying at times. It might feel good to walk around exploring the world, but when you pass multiple times through the same area it can get a bit annoying;-The game doesn't explain certain parts such as mutagens and alchemy.Overall it's really solid title and I recommend it to every RPG fan.

THE WITCHER 2: ASSASSINS OF KINGS ENHANCED EDITION
REVIEWThe Witcher 2, even before entering the main menu, shows us maybe the best CG intro ever in a video game. After the shocking ending of The Witcher leaving us with a cliffhanger, The Witcher 2 starts shortly after the predecessor. Geralt of Rivia, after saving King Foltest of Temeria, works for him now, as a personal bodyguard. Hunting traitors, Foltest sieges a castle and “invite” Geralt to help his army. Something shocking happens in the action-packed epic prologue, and now Geralt must prove he is saying the truth, and have his vengeance, seeking a mysterious man. The Witcher 2 storyline is more action-packed than the first one. It’s epic, it’s complex and have a lot of politics involved. Also, you have to make dramatic choices, that even before the half of the game, show a totally different perception of the entire story, making it almost two in one. (Beat the game two times for the full experience!) Personally, I prefer the first Witcher story, but the second one is really better in showing it’s themes and involves a lot of more things happening in the world, with decisions that matter even in The Witcher 3, drawing to one possible conclusion, showed in an epic CG. The ending does not disappoint and put another cliffhanger that serve as a promise for the epic The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the conclusion of the saga. Character development is very good and you will possible love two characters, Saskia and Ioverth. They’re amazing and shows a good background. But… it’s The Witcher! Everyone have their own personal story and unique quests, everything in the world have something behind it. The game’s campaign is shorter than the first one, because is kind of divided in two, but its more action packed like I also said and includes even more epic Boss Battles, that I bet will surprise you. Besides the campaign being smaller, the game itself is bigger, have more quests, bigger areas to explore and more content! The graphics are impressive, as still of today. The darker style of the game shows beautiful scenarios and regions, and well done animations, a problem from the first game. Alongside the epic soundtrack and sound effects, it all boils down to the amazing fantasy atmosphere the game shows you. The movimentation is more fluid than in the first game and you can even climb some obstacles. Combine this with combat that also shows an amazing innovation. Maybe the worst aspect of the first game, turned in one of the triumphs in The Witcher 2. The combat combines the Signs again, but now it’s not a totally combo-based like the first one and have a lot of movements and sounds like more a hack’n’slash game, with truly epic fight scenes with all kinds of monsters, that are now bigger in number than on the first game. Contracts are back as always and you have to clean monster nests and destroy them. As this is the enhanced edition, it features better graphics, bugs correction, and all of the released DLC, so you may find trolls in the game world with some interesting stories, and there is also the special Arena mode where you fight waves of enemies. Talking about the game itself again, there’s a lot of weapons again, and this time, a lot of armors, something I found lacking in the first. You can breed potions as always that help you in combat and sometimes is even necessary for quests. The world feels alive and you have a lot of romance options, but this time with no romance cards, but explicit scenes, even more than its successor, including specially one with Triss…There is also a crafting system for the armor and weapons which gives you the best ones in the game. Now you can meditate (to pass time and brew potions) anywhere if there’s no enemies, so it’s more practical than the predecessor. Dice poker is present: you can play a game with almost everyone and it's very fun and have quests related. The perk and level up system is cool and works well. The bad aspects for the game includes some bugs, random crashes that make you lose your progress and even lose your save in some cases (do a lot of them) and the lack of “RPG interactions”. The first one had a lot of food, drinks that you could eat and an animation was showed. This one does not feature all of that and no animations are present. Ok, that's a minor thing but...my opinion. Another thing is the game can be too punitive at the beggining, not stimulating someone into proceeding in. After you level up a bit it becomes fun, however. Mini games are present in boss battles. And they are annoying. The inventory menus are kind of chunky for me, also. +High Replayability+Choices and consequences+Epic story with political background+Epic and amazing soundtrack and sound effects+Big Immersion+Customization, lots of weapons, armors and skills+Top quality realtime weather and passage of time +Charismatic characters +Beautiful scenarios with large areas+A lot of sidequests and talk+Cool scenarios+Variety of monsters even a dragon!+Lots of content+Fun combat+Romance scenes+Epic CGI in the start and in the end of the game.+Level up system+Dice poker+Boss battles+Arena mode-Some bugs-Random crashes-Annoying boss battles mini-games-Lack of minor details-Over-punitive beggining-A bit chunky inventory menusVa fail, Gwynbleidd. The Witcher 2 takes everything the first did right. And do it better. To be continued.9,5/10 "

												This game is pretty amazing. But sh!t there's a lot of reading and learning. There's like 40hours worth of cut-scenes in it, about 1 of them includes boobs.

												Awesome game.   I initally had a hard time getting into it, as I found it was harder than most rpg's that I play ( I'm a big fan of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, though the Witcher 2 difficulty is different from those kinds of games. )  I also found it akward to play with a keyboard, and once I switched to a controller, my gameplay satisfaction significantly increased.  Once I got through the first chapter, I hit my stride then and figured out how to be a more effective Witcher, and the initial learning curve was overcome.  Gameplay is good, coupled with really good fighting animations, proves for a satisfying experience. Graphics and audio are very well done; the game has a satisfying and fitting soundtrack.  The story is interesting, and I always felt compelled to find out what happens next.  However it does allude to the first game quite a bit, and while it does fill in some details for you, it may be better to play through the first  game, but in my opinion it is not absolutely necessary.  The game also features multiple meaningful choices and there are several endings to obtain, giving alot more playabilty. All in all I would highly recommend it.			"

												This game is worth well over two, maybe three playthroughs simply because the amount of actual content, storyline branches and replayability is absolutely ridiculous.Although I'd suggest you enter with a gamepad, a mouse and keyboard works almost as well, and no matter what you do the game will always, always have more to show you if you play your cards differently every playthrough.All this combines to create one of the single greatest RPG's on the PC of all time.

												The Witcher 2 as a game is the meaning of the word progress. Everything from the graphics to the systems behind the game are an amazing feat, one you would expect from a big named developer backed up by a huge budget. The looks of the game are not only unparalleled due to its PC only nature, but also because it presents a world that feels hand crafted. The attention to detail borders on the extreme: the clothes, the houses and buildings, the faces of the characters their weapons and in general every corner, nook and cranny of the world has a distinctive touch. The scenery is simply breathtaking, and if you are like me you will want to make a screenshot out of every frame. It also shows that you don't need an overabundance of browns and blood reds in your palette to show a gritty dark fantasy world. This game shows its maturity not through a pretense of adult topics or over the top action animations, but through a careful use of its elements and by showing the player some respect: yes, you are an adult, and you can handle these topics, because indeed the Witcher's is a dark world filled with conspiracies, racism and characters in between every single shade of gray. It is a living, breathing, unforgiving world.The story is as complex as in the first game, filled with twists and choices that may change the fate of many, and forking paths that make a replay of the game not only encouraged, but required in order to see the extent to which they occur and diverge. Normal and hard difficulties are recommended and will test your skills if you don't face every battle with all seriousness, preparing beforehand by brewing and drinking potions and using all of your abilities during the fight, i.e. your swords your magic signs depending on what enemy you face and traps and bombs for your crowd control.The actual combat is in no way dumbed down. It will still punish you if you go unprepared and you can't mash your way out of battles. It is in much better shape than in the first game, and friendly to both the use of a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. The user interface is slick and great looking.The ending of the game comes abruptly, and you might feel that it doesn't solve every issue the game presents (the main storyline issues ARE solved, though). It is no excuse from what many will consider a downbeat ending, but in all honesty it doesn't detract a single beat from what this game does right, which is almost everything else. Even if you don't like the ending you will feel that the journey was worth it.In the end I feel like I'm required to praise this game so high despite its shortcomings not because it is a perfect game, but because it is an honest one. When more and more AAA releases are done with specific quarters or demographics numbers behind, or executives who never play games are calling the shots, The Witcher 2 really feels developed to please it audience, to show them they too are tired of these.There is a certain level of quality you expect from bigger developers which have more of a history and a name, because they deliver experiences that go way beyond what you might get from the indie guys. It is OK, they have the money and the numbers behind. This is a trend that has been changing in the last years and that no longer holds true in most cases though. In this case in particular neither of these apply. In my mind CDProject RED are already the big name, from whom I will expect unrelenting quality. Because after what they achieved they can't be considered the little guy any longer. With the Witcher 2 they delivered a game that is truly above and beyond any RPG from the last years, that feels like a product of love, careful planning and an overall shout to fans and the gaming community that says ""we know what you want, and we can deliver. Where others have failed you we will prevail."" And God if they don't.A serious contender for the best game of 2011, and frankly there is little in the horizon that looks like it might compete with it. Five years from now when other games made by bigger companies are all forgotten in the $5 bargain bins of the world, many will be reinstalling this game to reminisce and fondly say: ""yes, I played a game was this good in 2011, and it was glorious.""Congratulations CDProject RED, you just released your first masterpiece.

 The story The witcher 2 continues the story from the last games ending, where an assassin attempted to murder the king of Temeria, king Foltest. The assassin was unsuccessful, Geralt murdered the assassin before he could kill Foltest. When Geralt unmasked the assassin he is revealed to be a witcher.There's alot of hatred towards nonhumas in the witcher universe. Many nonhumans flee to the forests to join the Scoia'tael, an army of nonhumans who fight for freedom. In the witcher 2 you will meet a commander of the Scoida'tael, Iorveth. Some time go by. An unkown assassin kills Demavend III, the ruler of Aedrin. Perhaps not the best ruler as he was known for being rather cruel, but also quite intelligent and knowledgeable about the tactics of war. More time go by, Foltest with his army and Geralt at his side, attacks La Valette castle. They are successful in taking over the castle. King Foltest reunites with his two children, Anais and Boussy locked up in a tower, with the help of Geralt. In the tower with Foltest's children is a blind monk. As Anais and Boussy leaves the room, the monk throws off his cape to Murder king Foltest. This time the assassination on Foltest was a success. The assassin is reavealed to be yet another witcher. He flees and jump out of the castle tower. Two soildiers enter the tower only to find Geralt with king Foltest's corpse lying on the ground, Geralt is framed for the murder of the king of Temeria. He is taken to the castle dungeons for interrogation, this is how he meets Vernon Roche, a commander of the Blue Stripes, a special force in the Temerian military. He trusts Geralt and thus he decides to help Geralt find the real murderer. Geralt is still trying to recover his memory which he lost in the beginning of the first game.The dialogue system is very good, the voice acting is superb. It doesn't feel like you're talking to a wall anymore. The graphics The graphics have certainly seen a big upgrade from the first witcher game, it actually looks quite amazing for the time it came out. Characters also look much more unique. They have also added more cutscenes and the animations look very good. The UI has also seen a big upgrade, The UI in the first game was a mess but it looks alot better in the witcher 2. Something i miss with the UI from the original witcher game, is the 3D witcher medallion in the corner, it looked very nice. In the second game it's just 2D medallion next to your health. The sound and music The sound quality is much better than it was in the first witcher game, and of course the music is still amazing, the soundtrack has become one of my favorite soundtracks of all time. The soundtrack is epic and it fits the theme of the game. The gameplay Perhaps one of the biggest changes to the witcher 2 is the new action combat system, the group fighting mode is gone now you can use either fast attacks or strong attacks in battle. They have added rolling and blocking to the combat, the combat is much more fast phased. I have to say i really like the new combat system, its not as frustrating as the first games combat. You still have your magical witcher signs, and this time you have every sign unlocked from the start of the game.There is also a brand new alchemy system, now you can only create and drink potions while meditating, and you can only have three potions active at a time. The potions also last very short, in the first game they lasted for several in-game hours, now they only last 10 minutes. A big problem with this is that potions and other buffs last over cutscenes which means that some potions wear off before a fight, and you can't drink a new one since you're in a fight and you can only drink potions while meditating. The character building is not as good in the witcher 2 as it was in the first witcher game in my opinion. You can however get some quite satisfying finishers. The alchemy tree is not very good, and thats due to the bad alchemy system, so if you're planning to play this game i wouldn't recommend to do an alchemy build as it might not work out so well.The game runs pretty good on my computer, but I have heard of people having optimization issues. I have however experienced a couple of hard crashes and freezes, which is pretty annoying if you haven't saved your game in a while, I learnt that the hard way. Cons and pros  Pros:  Great story, perhaps not as good as the first game but still an amazing story Amazing graphics that look ahead of its time Epic soundtrack that really fits the theme of the game Great sound quality, a big upgrade from the first game Great combat system UI looks way better than it did in the first game Fantastic experience Cons:  The game can be a buggy mess sometimes I experienced some hard crashes and freezes which slowed down the story and led to some frustration The combat can still be very frustrating poor alchemy system  The wicther 2 is shorter than the first witcher gameThe game has its flaws but it's still an amazing game. I'll give an 8/10 to the whole game as I didn't really like the alchemy system nor do I think that the story can match up with the witcher 1 story, but the combat is definitely a big upgrade to the games gameplay and a kick in the right directionThe witcher 2 - trailer

												Don't buy Witcher. Buy Witcher 2. Need explanation? Read on.OK, let's make something perfectly clear. I've spent at least 17 hours in Witcher and although I've recommended it in my Steam review, I don't think too fondly of that game. I've never got through it. Although the story is OK (but not great), I consider Witcher to be ''buy it on sale'' title. Game mechanics are so broken I've lost all of my will to play it. I just couldn't stand it.Although a friend of mine (Witcher fanatic and a gaming journalist), a guy that says Skyrim can suck his balls, recommended Witcher 2 to me on more than a few occasions and although he pointed out the game is different than the first one, somehow I've managed not to get it until this last summer sale. And I didn't buy it this summer, either - this friend bought it for me as an act of protest because I've neglected an awesome game.Did I say awesome? Yes, I DID. Witcher 2 is AWESOME. It goes straight into a Chamber of greatness which includes titles such as Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake II and Morrowind.Witcher 2 brings an awesome and oh-so-needed upgrade to every single system of Witcher universe. The story gets really suspenful and interesting now, so great it leaves the first one in the dust. It makes it funny. Combat? ♥♥♥♥ing finally. No more mini-games click-on-time attacking that made me so nervous. This is a proper sword-wielding and cast-spelling game. Fighting numerous opponents is a joy now. You can dash and stab almost in perfect harmony; fights in Witcher 2 are soul-soothing experiences. Quest finding and resolving is easier and more logical, menus are no longer a cluttered mess, girls are more naked and dwarves curse and drink like late GG Allin.Witcher 2 is a great, great game that shall be rewarded with a CLASSIC title as the time goes bye. Its living and breathing world will suck you in and you will choose a side. And you'll ENJOY IT.Once again, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON WITCHER. Get Witcher 2 and don't let the first game keep you away from this masterpiece.P.S. Dwarves. I love MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING DWARVES!!!***If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews "

												I HIGHLY recommend this game as an intro to Witcher 3. Being on sale now for Christmas, it is definitely worth more than $3, make sure to pick it up. The story and lore are hard to get into at first for Witcher noobs, but 2 hours or so in the game immerses you in lore and facts.By far one of the best RPG's out there on the market. Your decisions actually make a diffrence in the storyline and in Witcher 3 ! Choose wisely .... There are no good or bad decisions, only ones t hat test your morale judgment (Which is a huge +, especially since choices actualyl matter). Get this game NOW, do not think about it, do it NOW......Done ? Bought it ? Now enjoy ! Make sure that if you are also picking up Witcher 3, to pick up and play this one first as it provides plenty of lore and background material and is a nice seguey to Witcher 3 !			"

												Witcher 2 improves over the original in almost every way. The combat is the biggest change it’s much better overall.  Just like the first game the story is one of the best stories I have played in a video game, I feel so involved in everything that is happening. The amount of detail in the lore just makes the whole experience very rich. Amazing writing, character depth and voice acting sell these characters as real people. Every character is fascinating and you want to learn more about them and in doing so you become more connected to them. The way the story changes by the choices you make has never been so expansive as it was in this game. One choice in particular about a third into the game changes the outcome in the story completely and it almost becomes two games in one because the outcome is so different between each other they end up being completely different experiences. The only thing that keeps this game from being a 10 is the linearity, it is a very linear experience overall, there isn’t much free roaming you can do it’s only strict linear paths. This is something I know the witcher 3 addresses which I am looking forward to.9/10 (Amazing)			"

												Right then... I absolutely adore the first Witcher game. It introduced me to the world, lore and books. I expected more awesomeness from the second entry in series. Well, to be honest with you, i am a bit mixed on it. I love the story, the characters, the voice-acting, world, graphics, every little sound, but i can't say the same about combat system. Yes, i have problem with one of the most important part of videogames. Gameplay itself. I feel like i'm just going around this beatiful world on rails, spamming the ""X"" button, occasionally mixing it with ""A"" button to roll away from attacks.I really don't know how to feel about The Witcher 2. I love it, but at the same time, it feels often like a chore to play. Let's just say, don't buy it for gameplay. Buy it for pretty much everything else. If you are a fan of the books or Witcher franchise as a whole... Well, then you have already played this, haven't you... I can't say i don't recommend it, because i love it. But i hate it when it comes to combat. I'm sorry, just buy it for yourself and try it on your own. It's really cheap most of the time.			"

												TL;DR version: Despite a rocky start and painful setup (graphics), it won me over within no time. The story is amazing, voice acting is great, maybe not as polished as the Witcher 3, but still great. Playing through this will help understand a lot of things in TW3. Buy it, it's great value for money, especially considering there is a lof of replayability, given the 16 endings based on your choices, and different Acts 2/3.Detailed:Initially almost refunded it. The installation includes a scan for 'optimal' settings, which is completely broken. It was so unoptimised, the motion blur gave me motion sickness... 2-3 hours of my playtime went into that launcher toying with the settings until I got it right. Even though I cover it sufficiently, and should be able to play on max settings, I had to tone down a few things and disable all motion blurs. Boom, now it was playable.The Enhanced edition seems to have the Arena tutorial, which I only used to test my graphics setup to be honest. It's something you may like to skip, pretty awful. I actually used the Prologue as a tutorial, works fine.Combat is a bit clunky, not as polished as in TW3, but after getting used to it...makes sense. The Space key is your friend. The game is not as linear as the first game, but not open world like TW3. You still get plenty of areas to explore and side quests to do. I disliked the carry weight limit, but that can be fixed with mods. Some people dislike the lack of fast travel, I was okay with it. Apart from some mob farming for a certain armor in Act 1 that took forever and Geralt wore the shoes off his feet, there isn't too much tourism.The story is great. Your choices matter, and for some of them there are real repercussions, like SPOILER ALERT the fate of entire kingdoms! Yeah, plural. Intricate story-telling, not too pushy, keeps you interested, although can be confusing at times for people new to the Witcher world. It actually made me buy the books to learn some of the references, so there you go.There are indeed ♥♥♥♥♥houses. I must have paid 2,000+ orens for such services just for the fun of it. Great stuff. There are also other options, ahem, but you'll find that on your own.All in all, it's a great game, if unoptimised for a lot of devices. The story wins you over and it's definitely worth the money. Even better if you buy the game during a sales period, like I did. Will definitely make the TW3 more enjoyable and enhance the experience there. Also ♥♥♥♥♥houses.Buy it.			"

												I wanted to like this game, It appeared to be right up my alley and It has everything I love in an rpg but I just couldnt get into it. First of all its hard as hell, thats not necessarily a knock against the game itself but for a casual gamer it surpasses challenging and crosses into the realm of frustrating. The story is compelling but it doesnt draw you(me) in and the characters are kind of bland. Quests are sometimes unessarily confusing (i.e. follow this blood trail....multiple irrelevant blood trails) I would still reccomend this game to rpg players because its well made and has a lot to love (Graphics, intuitive crafting, super customizable player etc.) just not for me personally.

												Ah Geralt of Rivia , the one character that i love the most...I know its been a while since the game came out but still i felt the need to write a review, because this game is simply a masterpiece, in every aspect i could think of... so here goes my review: Gameplay For some people the gameplay mechanics are outdated n lots of stuff they complain about, but honesty whats wrong with it? i know the counter is a bit tricky but meh u get to kick everyone's ♥♥♥, what else do you need? and throughtout my experience, i've loved to do every side quest n kill every enemy infront of me, the gameplay was smooth n entertaining.... Graphics Firstly u don't judge a game by its graphics but still i'd have to say ""damn son"" the view, the textures, the character animations, Triss's boobs, ofc how can i forget :3 .... n everything else was simply superb n it still looks amazing after all the time thats been passed since its release... Witcher's Story ``SPOILERS`` ``WOSH``WOSH`` BE CAREFUL ( ͡ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) A man seeking for his love, in the process gets blamed for a murder he didn't commit, continues his journey to clear his name and find his love.... damn am i not a fan of these kinds of stories, truly i enjoyed the story to its core, listened to every conversation, made every decision carefully... ah what else can i say, the story of this game cannot be expressed in words, you just have to feel it..Triss the one and only true campainion of Geralt, vowed to stay be his side no matter the circumstances, no matter the pain, no matter the concequences, honestly i feel in love with her...and Triss & Geralt have always been like "" Friends With Benfits "", y u du dis Geralt ;-; Conclusion i'm just gonna say this in the end, if u haven't played this game, get it now.how can u not play this game? seriously buy this game already... the gameplay, the graphics, the story everything is perfect, what more do u need?

												*might contain minor spoilers*Almost 5 years after the release, I finally played Witcher 2. You play as an imprisoned witcher, Geralt of Rivia, who is accused of murdering a king. The game begins with compelling flashbacks in which you storm a castle, and it shows how the murder happened. Through the game, you are chasing the real killer as well as try to recover your memories about the Wild Hunt and Yennifer. You meet interesting characters (some from the 1st Witcher game), and in one point have to choose who will you follow. This changes the story quite a bit (mainly different location in chapter 2), so the game can be enjoyed in the 2nd replay. The game has prologue, 3 chapters and an epilogue, with different maps you cannot return to when you finish the chapter. I don't think you must play Witcher 1 to enjoy it (I didn't finish it for instance). Pros and cons:+ The game still looks very pretty.+ Good voice acting and quality mature dialog (even non clickable npcs ramble when you run by).+ Intriguing main story, the world is rich (although you might get lost with all the different names).+ You can 'steal' anything and nobody will attack you.+ You can sleep with a number of women (there's a cut scene with boobies and booties).+ Sweet soundtrack that fits nicely.+ Not black and white: monsters aren't necessarily bad. You also have a choice to kill or spare     some people which effects the political map of the world.+ You can skip dialogue and cut scenes.+ Some of the quests are very interesting...- ...but some are classic monster slaying type. Either eradicate xxx or you fight through monsters to get to the place, find item etc.- Walking back and forth can be a chore sometimes.- You must meditate to drink potions.- If you are trying to collect materials for crafting weapon/armor, the local shop will have good alternative relatively cheap, which makes crafting undervalued.I cannot really comment about fighting difficulty as I played on easy (focused on the story), but for me, the fighting mechanics were better than in Witcher 1.The game has a few puzzles, but I also cannot comment on difficulty as I was mostly too lazy and just googled correct sequences.All in all, it is a great game which can be bought really cheap on sales. If you haven't played Wild Hunt yet, I think these ~40 hours into Witcher world can be well spent before throwing yourself in the latest installment of the Witcher saga.			"

												The Witcher 2 has well made story and smooth feel to the combat.-There is a lot of lore etc. behind this game and I do expect the story behind this was good, but I personally never played the first Witcher game, and didn't feel the need to. You decide whenever or not you want to know more about the backstory and such or if you want to just jump straight in.Review:All the rolling, swings and magic usage feel incredibly fitting at almost all times which is very rare in a game with swords as well as magic. Sure the enemy lock on system is bad, but otherwise there is little to no complaints to be made. Just remember that you have all the bottles and magic  for a good reason and you will need to use them a lot.Each enemy has their weakness and the combat is extremely hard. (If you are new to gaming, you might want to play on a lower difficulty setting than normal) I am still amazed by the people who beat this game without grinding for money to get better gear at the insane difficulty, just shows how much skill you can gain at this game as I can barely survive the very first moments at the hardest difficulty setting.The world you explore feels very open even though it is as a matter of fact very linear and restricts you to a few chosen paths. It's very fun to explore the maps for items, which are gained trough killing enemies and completing tasks which people give you.They also have this alchemy system in which you craft these potions which give you buffs to help you find items in the environment as well as to help you effectively deal with your enemies.You also have a vast amount of armor, swords and recipes for potions, which some of appear to be behind the wall of rng. While yes it is quite a shame that some equipment may be inaccessable for you, but on the positive side you do get more things if you happen to feel like playing trough the game again.There are also some moments in which you see nudity at, or some small scenes in which you can optionally have sex with other women, just as a small disclaimer in case you did not know this already.Hmm, so the characters do seem to each have a personality which you can really get attached to and you can as a matter of fact interact with a lot with these people besides the NPC's which some of you can interact a little with. But I personally did not like the talking scenes that much at all. Otherwise this game has been a blast to play.Highly recommend it to every person.			"

												Compare to Witcher1, 2 has a lot more combat actions, you can't just stand still and hit them combos like in 1, Geralt needs to dodge attacks, parry, roll around and stab enemies in the back to gain more damages. The boss fights are even more interesting, you need to use potions, signs, and enhancement smart or you can get stuck at the boss for a long time. For me , it took me almost 1 hour trying to kill that karyan and another 1 hour figuring out how to beat Letho for the first time. Also, weapon choices are super important in 2, so keep in mind you need to constantly upgrade your weapons or you will have a hard time fighting the bosses as you go down the storyline. *SPOILER* For the ones who chose Shanni in 1 like me, she didn't even appeared in 2. Triss is the one always sticks with Geralt.Make sure you watch or fastforward through the credits(somehow i could magicall scroll the credits down real fast using my laptop mouse pad), it just makes you wanna buy 3.Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone who wanna play a great RPG game while enjoying a long movie at the same time.

												Much like its predecessor, The Witcher 2's greatest strengths lie in its storytelling. The characters are deep and flawed and you feel for both the heroes and the villains, the dialogue is at times witty, at times profound, and the twisting, turning intrigue of nefarious plotting, civil war, and the corrupting influence of power is always engaging and motivating. On top of that, TW2 is a vast improvement in terms of visuals, and I dare say it remains one of the best looking games ever made.  But again, like TW1, it's flaws lie in the games technical aspects. The combat system is the most frequent target for criticism, and I must admit, when I first played the game before the balancing was patched it was the single most frustrating experience of my life. Perhaps it was the benefit of hindsight that assisted me, but my second playthrough was a breeze by comparison. In saying that, the combat remains difficult to learn and beginners are unfortunately punished for lacking the clairvoyance to know when one must save before a big battle. Generally speaking, the autosave points are placed a little more kindly than in TW1 and restarts will often only send you back to the start of a fight, but when they don't it can be an annoying experience. There's also a single poorly implimented stealth section towards the start, which again tests the commitment of newcomers. But once you understand that you can dodge-roll infinitely and you put a few points into your skills you'll find that, while not the most elegant system, it's far more interactive than that of TW1 and allows the player to become quite powerful when they get the hang of it. Criticism aside though, I'd say that this is a must-play RPG for any fan of the genre. It streamlines a lot (if not all) of the inconvenient gameplay quirks of the first game, and continues to build on Geralt's epic story in a beautiful and detailed world. I played through both games in preparation for TW3 (come on Steam, discount the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!) and while I felt every one of my 33 hours in TW1, this game never felt like it overstayed its welcome. Ultimately I was sad to see it finish, especially as the last moment of gameplay is a wonderfully powerful emotional climax. I recommend this game at whatever price it's sold for.			"

INTERESTINGLY-Witcher is about spell casting, dragon slaying, medieval ages.-My love for Witcher starts with (gasp) Witcher 1, and remains LOVE rooted from there, with only a technical appreciation for WITCHER 2, and (wow the graphics) WITCHER 3. (I appreciated the layout of Witcher 1 being simple in its story telling effect, Witcher 2 is definitely a change compared to that, many of my friends may disagree with me saying how much ""better"" Witcher 2 is to Witcher 1, I shall remain unconvinced, I guess its the IMPRESSION it made on me, I wouldn't mind if Witcher 2 were delivered in Witcher 1 format :-)) -Although the genre is loved, to the credit of the series is the voice actor for Geralt, a smooth talking baritone, that may have won easily 30-40% of the core audience loving this game.
-I have hated myself for liking WITCHER as; it is fictional, and has little redeeming truth or/& facts in it, rather than being historically based like Assassin's Creed and an educational experience, we gorge on storytelling. 
The creator of The Witcher is still with us today and though NOT without merit (he has received recognition for promoting Polish culture).GAMEPLAY-The format is much like any Assassin's Creed game, 3rd person and open world. If that's your thing, this is going to be enjoyed by you.-The world is the same as in Witcher 1; the people, the culture, ""the orens"" :-) -I was SO excited learning of the possibility to transfer saves from game to game in the genre (by the time I learned of this Mass Effect was doing so too, :-) I just loved anything to do with Witcher).CRITICISM -If you think I just won't stop praising this game, apart from an obvious comparison with Lord of the Rings, THIS GAME and all Witcher games CONTAIN GRAPHIC CONTENT, unlike and to the credit of LOTR, I would appreciate if there was a setting in our OPTIONS menu we could input that may limit the level of this CONTENT we are looking at without affecting gameplay, HEY, there are some young children looking at  cartoon images here of WHAT, then there's unbridled SWEARING that they are exposed to??!!. I would agree with stricter measures for censorship of the sale of these games to certain age-groups otherwise.  ; in conclusion,I recommend Witcher 2.GAME ON			"

												The Witcher 2 by CD Projeckt Red review.I will start off by saying that I was late to the Witcher series. (Still haven't played Wild Hunt) With that being said, they are games that should not be overlooked by RPG fans, even though the first 2 are 5+ years old. I played The Witcher about 3 years ago and I wish I would of played it alot closer to my Witcher 2 playthrough because I had forgotten details about some of the previous characters and locations. A quick trip to google cleared up all my confusion and my gameplay experience was great.Story -> 9/10I was fully immersed in the story once I cleared up a few things I had forgotten from the first one. It moves along a steady pace and ramps up to a good finale by Act III. I imported my character from the original which added a few weapons and armour (as far as I could tell) as well as a few references and minor story alterations. There are some very tough decisions to make which can alter the course of the game. The voice acting (English) was a little wooden from some of the characters (Dandelion, Triss and to some extent, Geralt himself) but it didn't diminish my experience any. The dwarves in particuliar were great as they are vulagar as f*** and are always good for a laugh. I am also happy to report not a single character took an arrow to the knee.Sound -> 8/10 [Creative SB X-FI Platinum]The sound effects were very well done, especially in combat. Ambience while walking around really pulls you in. From the idle chatter in towns to the various sounds while out for a stroll in the wild. I found the music score to be great but there was not as many tracks and got a bit repetitive. The music in the taverns is burned into my memory probably forever now.Graphics/Performance -> 9/10 [Asus Maximus VII - 4790K - 16GB 1600MHZ - R9290X Crossfire - Freesync]From a 2011 point of view, the graphics are amazing, from a 2017 point of view.....I still thought the graphics looked great.(Looked better and ran better than Skyrim all modded up) The enviroments were extremely detailed, in particular the forest in Act I. Textures were fairly hi-res and the lighting was very nice. Character models look good and the clothes/armour all looked great. Some minor clipping and characters teleporting around abit but nothing major.From a performance standpoint everything was top notch. The game scaled amazing with multi-gpu, I had no problem maintaining 144 fps. (Dips down to 115-120fps in some places) With that being said I played alot of the game with a single gpu with the framerate locked to 90 fps because my monitor only can run Freesync up to 90hz. If I ran Freesync on with multi-gpu, the framerate would just rocket out of control (sometimes to 200fps) turning my room into a sauna. I ran all settings on max except the Uber setting, which just tanked performance, at 2560x1440 resolution. I experienced about 5 crashes in 45 hours of gameplay which is exponentially lower than the Bethesda games I've played on the same system.Gameplay -> 7/10 [Normal Difficulty]The Good: The overall feel of the game was generally good. I was able to map the keys in a way that I was not fumbling around like some games. The combat was improved from the first one. It feels rewarding as you start to accumulate better talents and equipment. By the end cutting down 6+ enemies at once was easy using a combination of weapons and signs. I didn't use alchemy much as I couldn't be bothered to meditate everytime I wanted to drink a potion. Also it is nice you don't need to be near a fire to meditate anymore.The Bad: The quicktime events are horrible and whoever puts these in the game and continues to use them to this day should be shot. I was kind of let down by some of the mini games, especially the dice, you can't win!!! The economy is sort of crappy. I found a rare elven sword and I went to sell it and I was given enough money to buy 5 apples from another vendor. WTF? If you are a completionist and need every book and every crafting diagram (which I will do on another playthrough) you better enjoy killing harpies for hours on end. Money is scarce. I believe there is a mod for it which I may use on my second playthrough.Conclusion -> 8.5/10I would recommend this game to anyone that even had their eye on it in the slightest. You can always pick it up for cheap. Halfway through the first act I realized I should had the difficulty alot higher since normal was a leisurely stroll. I put 45 hours in one playthrough and like I said I never went through it with a fine toothed comb. I see myself putting one maybe two more playthroughs so I could easily have over 100hours in it before I never look at it again. I recommend play the first Witcher prior to playing this one because it sets up the world and events happening. I felt that this game felt smaller in scale compared to the first Witcher. I felt that way about Mass Effect 2 & 3 as well. But still, 45 hours for a game I probably paid 5 bucks for on a Steam sale is great value. Now on to The Wild Hunt!!! "

												I'm amazed. I finally found the time to start playing this game and I'm glad I did. I was of course expecting it to be good, maybe a bit mediocre compared to TW3, but to my surprise it never felt that way. It holds up better than I expected. While it did take time to grow on me, I still enjoyed almost every second of the ride. I ADORED the story. Especially near the end, it was even more engaging than TW3 at certain points. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend you do. Its length is on the shorter side if compared to the Witcher 1 and 3. It took me about 35 hours to finish it while doing all the side quests available. But I think I'm going to replay it to see the outcome of different choices. The game also fills the gap between the books and the games, they're actually tied together way more than I thought.			"

												An awesome RPG with beautiful gameplay, graphics, characters and storyline. If you didn't play the first chapter then i suggest you to play it before you start this game, since it will give more background about the story. You will be required to make choices, like who you want to ally with, or who you will want to kill, but to be honest i hoped for a more variety of choices since there aren't many overall. Also i wish the game had better longevity, i have done it in around 25 hours on the hardest difficulty, including all side quests, but i guess the game deserves a second playthrough making different choices to fully enjoy all the content. Overall i really recommend this game for any RPG lover, and for who wants a more mature game than the vast majority of RPGs around.			"

 The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition  The Witcher 2 is an amazing production that I finished a couple of times and I had a lot of fun at the same time. In game we play as a Geralt of Rivia who, along with Triss Merigold serve the king Foltest. The story is divided into three acts and an epilogue in which we will visit four different locations depending on our choices. As for choices there is a large amount of them and they will have affect on the whole world and on the storyline of The Witcher 3. According to me, this is a must have for those who intend to play the third part. Cool story, choices, soundtrack, locations, graphics and combat system are well made. The production is worth the time and money. Especially that it can be cheaply purchased on steam sales.  "

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Mature; Adventure; Fantasy; Choices Matter  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 30-70 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition provides a great experience, and tells a captivating tale... although it has a somewhat bland and frustrating combat system.  The game boasts a myriad of mature themes and storylines, and it is very enjoyable for those who appreciate impactful decision-making in their games.  However, the sheer magnitude of the game may cause it to drag a bit for completionists.This game is absolutely beautiful.  The story is deep, rich, complex and mature.  The world feels immersive and lived in.  There are sufficient RPG elements (crafting, items, leveling, spells) to appease any fan. In order to experience everything in the branching storyline, you will need to play through it a few times… or at least play through sections of the game a few times to see the results of different decisions.  The combat is probably the weak point of the game, as it is pretty bland and on higher difficulties can be frustrating.  You may want to consider playing on a low difficulty to just enjoy the story and avoid frustration.  If you can afford both the time and the money, I suggest you play the first one through at least once before playing this.  Or at the very least read a synopsis of the plot of the first game.There are dozens of aspects I could go into detail describing when it comes to The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition, but it doesn’t seem necessary.  If you are a fan of epic RPGs with dark, immersive stories and captivating atmospheres then you will most likely enjoy this.  If you are someone who has trouble getting invested in story-driven, slow-paced experiences, then you may want to look elsewhere for your next game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Pinning down precisely what makes the world of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings so enthralling took me some time. It's not that the fiction is particularly ""mature,"" though that's undoubtedly a term that will be tossed around until the next hyper-gritty fantasy game pops up. Think about it for a second: The Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, is a crag-faced, cat-eyed, gravelly-voiced mutant hardass who only stops screwing and fighting when occasion calls for a philosopher, at which point he dutifully duels scholars and monarchs with a tongue as sharp as either of his two swords. He is a character straight out of a 15-year-old boy's misused English notebook; the wounded warrior poet who, by the way, gets all the consequence-free sex he can handle, since he's totally shooting blanks, bro. And sure, he's stoic -- but he's also got a sensitive soul somewhere beneath that scar-laden chest of his, damn it.No, what makes the Witcher's world so absorbing is an amazingly cohesive and consistent visual vocabulary that is -- and I know this is going to sound ridiculous -- far more logical than is typical for fantasy games. The impoverished fishermen of the riverside village of Flotsam shuffle around in nothing but ruddy underwear. Dumpy town guards patrol in filthy rags that still bear their national colors. Ornate attire is (for once) consigned solely to the upper class. Buildings look planted and properly dilapidated. This may seem a small thing, but from the first minutes of the game, it's clear how much effort has gone into researching how a society like the one portrayed would look; this medieval civilization, infused with -- but not dominated by -- magic and mystery (props to developer CD Projekt), is just awesome.Similarly impressive: the degree to which the story changes based on your actions. Game makers (and publishers, and shareholders, and preview writers) love to crow on about choices and consequences. Hell, if you buy the PR spin, every single BioWare game in the past decade has been a watershed moment for cause and effect in video game storytelling. But frankly, the lofty language usually leads to a letdown -- the best we usually get are mundane tics on a morality slider that may or may not unlock a new dialogue tree, or perhaps a new companion somewhere down the road. I'd go so far as to argue that the only stable of games that's been quietly, consistently offering a serious set of genuinely game-altering forks-in-the-road for nearly a decade now is Acquire's Way of the Samurai series.Not anymore.While we have the underlying storyline of murder, intrigue, and (more stupidly) amnesia to which The Witcher 2 continually returns, the minutiae is wholly malleable. The allies Geralt makes on his journey and the enemies he combats shift with your mood swings; larger decision points alter the landscape of the world dramatically, but even minor events can cause repercussions much later in the game -- and how the whole thing ends is entirely your choice. Reading after-action reports from fellow players is like a game unto itself. Nobody seems to experience quite the same scenarios.Not all is well in the Pontar Valley, however. Combat, for instance, is a serious problem made even worse by a poorly implemented, obscenely difficult and unhelpful opening segment. Plow into battle unprepared, and you might as well expect the worst: Even on moderate difficulty levels, this is not a game in which potential sources of aid can be ignored. Traps, bombs, magic, daggers, pre-battle potions... every tool in Geralt's arsenal is an absolute necessity.Once I got the basics down, the extremely acrobatic, constantly active feint-and-parry style of Witcher warfare became seriously enjoyable -- just don't expect the prologue section to teach you much of anything valuable. And even when I finally felt like a proper monster-hunting mutant badass, I occasionally came across the rare room or fight so absurd that I had to wonder if CD Projekt understood the limitations of its own combat system. Geralt in a room too cramped to allow for falling back and trap placement? Battles before which you have no time to meditate and drink potions? No thanks.Worse still, the user interface only exacerbates the combat system's flaws by forcing the player to keep an eye on everything but the melee itself. Geralt's vigor (read: mana) meter, health meter, buff/debuff indicators, and equipped spells/items are all scattered across the screen, which is a serious drawback when you're surrounded by screeching harpies.But not even a terrible introductory sequence can take away from what is otherwise a fantastic game. Sure, the story is goofy, and at times the fighting is offensively clunky. The world isn't as colossal as the first Witcher's, and the ending is a bit of a tease. But in a time when I rarely bother to finish single-player games, I'm happy (and slightly embarrassed) to say that I'm already several hours into a second playthrough of Assassins of Kings. And I can't think of a better compliment than that.Pros:Engrossing worldstory has more branches than a sycamoretechnically astonishinggreat voice acting.Cons:Combat takes getting used to and never becomes fantasticpacing problemstoo many quick-time events.My Rating: 9.2/10 "

												The Witcher 2 is a sequel to CRPG's The Witcher . The game sets after the Witcher timeline (No spoilers, just in case). You play as Geralt of Rivia, a monster-for-hire. He was framed for murdering the king, so he had to clear his name somehow. It is your choice how you play and how you interact to people. Story is what this game more interesting. Once, you have made the decision, it affects the environment, also the characters as well. The atmosphere is based on Medieval structure (I think).+ Pros + Great Story + Import Save file from Witcher to Witcher 2 + Dark and violent side quests + Atmosphere + Graphics (not bad for 2011 game) + Story about under 50 hours (Replayability available) + Characters- Cons - Combat seems to be repetitive (dodge rolls, slashes animation) - Consuming potions by meditating - Skill trees - Slight steep curve on controls - Messy User Interface (UI) - Crafting seems to be dodgy (because of picking up sums of any particular ingredients)This game is recommended if you are insist to play the game. It is enjoyable game but the combat seems to be mashing clicks and space button to dodge. I forgot to mention how messy the game's UI is. Overall, it's a great game to play.Updated: 13 Apr @ 10:21am: adding the Messy User Interface (UI) for Cons and headlining the Pros and Cons			"

												I highly recommend this game and this is why:Storyline:The storyline is packed with distrust, politics and personal agendas which I found very interesting. Every character had their own ambitions, attitudes and reason for their actions. I found that I either liked or was undecided about a character, with a few characters that I hated. The storyline flowed well and almost every side quest made sense given the situation that the character was in. You even had some sidequests were you had to track creatures nest and blow them up which was fun and a different version to the usual kill x collect x formula . You were able to make multiple choses in the game and almost every chose matter towards either the main storyline or a sidequest and possibly both. Many of the choses that you choose from had its positive and negatives. You rarely got an option that seemed like the best option but more like 3 or 4 options that could be good but also could be bad. I like this and made me think of what option I should choose. Some warning there is a lot of dialogue about the political issues of Geralt's world and they do shoot out a lot of names which may push some people away. But if your intrigued about  political struggles, regicide, betrayal, mystery and even some romance then you will love this storyline. Gameplay:Utterly love the gameplay. It is an action rpg with a skill tree, some what, similar to diablo or other action rpgs. But the overall gameplay is different then your typical action rpg where you kill a huge mobs of monster one right after the other. In this game you do more exploring around and talking to people than killing creatures. But when you do kill creatures they are incredibly dynamic battles were you have options on how you want to kill your foe. Do you want to ensare the creature in a trap and stab it with you sword or do you want to shock it with a bomb and run in for the fatal blow. Also you do not stand their and fight the monster exchanging blows, no you try to dodge or parry the blows so you don't get killed because you can be overwhelmed in the game pretty easily if your not careful. Oh but dont forget your potions. There is an alchemy system where you can make potions using herbs that you find in abundance in the wild as well as oils and poisons that can be added to your weapon for a short period of time. These potions will increase your stats, or allow you to see in the dark, some even give you advantages at a cost of another stat being reduced. These potions are extremely helpful and usually only last around 5 to 10 minutes unless you have some points in the alchemy skill tree. Potions can only be used before a battle starts and you have a limit on how many potions you can drink. So I enjoyed thinking about what potions I should use and when I should use them. You are also capable of creating bombs, traps, armor and weapons which I have seen before, but still adds something to the game, especially the bombs and traps. Graphics:The graphics is just amazing for its time and I was suprised at the differences between the looks of some characters that were from the first Witcher game. I also liked how original the creatures looked  in comparison to many other games I have played. This difference added to the dark tone of the game quite well. The graphics made exploring around a lot more enjoyable overall. Replayability:There is some good replay value to this game. There are several different difficulty levels that you can play on, and the storyline branches out in two different ways. Therefore, you will have to play the game again to see the other part of the storyline that you missed the first time. There are also differences in sidequests depending on which storyline branch you choose as well as different results to the side quests depending on your choices.Cons:Yes, like all games there are some cons to this game. The big one is... the map. It might just be me but I found the map to be utterly confusing to understand.  Some things on the map that looked like walls ended up not being walls and other parts of the map that didn't look like walls ended up being walls. I was playing on the controller and there seemed to be no shortcut button to see the bigger version of the map, you had to open up the selection menu and press map every single time which got on my nerves a bit. Another con to this game is the game's inability to work properly. Sometimes the game would either slow down making gameplay difficult or just crash. Also this issue could very much be an issue with my computer and not the game. Another issue I had with the game was although the towns were well thought out and dynamic the same people walking around kept saying the exact same two or three lines every single time you would pass by them, unless you were having a conversation with them. Next time I hope that the people have atleast a few more lines that they could say.  So overall, this is a great game that you should play to get prepared for Witcher 3, which looks amazing.			"

												For me, Chapter 2 made this whole game. I made some poor decisions that caused me to likely not get enough out of Chapter 3 than I otherwise would have had I made better decisions so that's on me. I may make another pass at it in the future. Started out with the tutorial, which cause me to get discouraged because I couldn't get past it either, lol. But this game is overall worth playing because chapter 2 is so good. I would have liked to see a bit more in most aspects of this game such as more weapons, armor, stats, character levels, side quests and so on. Not much money to go around but its enough to buy everything you need. But I understand this was only one step in the overall story that I will likely continue in Witcher 3. NPC banter is fairly entertaining. Loved the LOTR references that they all have a laugh at. Not much more entertaining than midevil sex talk either. Ploughing was a word that took me a second to understand that that's what they really meant. Just keep small children away here, gets much more graphic than just talking (depending on whether you have Geralt sleep around or not, I was fairly promiscuous). Great experience for the most part.			"

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is an example of a video game that was made as a labor of love. The developers of this game have created one of the best RPGs that I've ever played. The combat in this game is a vast improvement over the first game and feels very fluid. The characters are very well thought out and I can relate and connect to many of them. The storyline is one of those that makes me forget about everything else and focus on it with great intensity.			"

												Долго я воротил нос от серии Ведьмак. Потом от скуки с играл в первую, которая понравилась. Вторая часть, просто гигансткий скачок вперед. Я потратил 44 часа на прохождение игры. У меня не разу не было чувства, что меня задолбали однотипные занятия. Потому что их нет, все уникальны. Для примера можно взять Ubisoft со своими играми с открытым миром. Я только поэтому не играю ни в Ассасина, ни в Фар край. Тебе обещают 40 часов геймплей из них только 5 часов, что то интересного. В ведьмаке такого нет. Все сделано на высшем уровне. Интересная не линейная история, приятная музыка, отличный геймплей и конечно же ГРАФООН =) Не знаю, кто занимался русской локализацей, но к ней не подкапаешься. Актеры подобраны хорошо и говорят реалистично. Единственный минус в том, что, то что я делал в первой части, никак не повлияло на вторую, ну вроде только броню дали и все. Я теперь понимаю, почему для третьей части не будут делать дрм защиту. Такую качественную игру стыдно качать с торрентов. Вообщем очень жду финала и охота узнать, чем все закончилось.

												Let me begin by first congratulating you on clicking this wonderful game. Kudos to you. Let me next congratulate you for looking at the reviews of this game, as rightly you should. Now let me slap you in the f*cking jaw for clicking on ""Negative Reviews"". Entrance a little too strong? Well consider it a wake up call.If you have played many an RPG and completed it with a lingering craving for depth and lore, then this game is your healing salve. This game has some of the richest storytelling I have ever had the pleasure of being part of, paired with it's sheer beauty and somewhat impressive mod support, you can not go wrong with this purchase. The voice acting is on point, similar to that of Fable, with its regional 'Typically British' dialect which is laced with humour and one-liners. The gameplay, whilst some suggest is 'clunky', works well considering the type of game this is. The graphics are demanding, but if you have the power to run this at high settings, they will leave you awestruck. The storyline is fresh and cleverly written (with enough room for plenty of side quests), and although it seems typically linear, the areas you visit are open enough to allow you to breath. The game is without a doubt targetted at a more mature audience, with an abundance of nakedness particularly from the female cast (which is brilliant for us single men - am I right?!) as well as a great deal of 'curse' words throughout. I can not say exactly how to play this game, nor can I elaborate on how much you will enjoy it - you quite literally just have to sit down and indulge its richness and take your time, let yourself break away from the quest grinding, go explore, talk to NPC's, loot houses, do some crafting... whatever it is you take delight in, just... do it. Its simple, and your decision to purchase this game should be too. The negative reviews that flood this page genuinely are talking out of their ars*s, their play time alone is enough to suggest they havent actually PLAYED the game. They have obviously gotten past the tutorial and cried because everything wasn't handed to them on a silver plate. For roughly the 6th time now I've seen this game go on sale for less than £5... If you are worrying about ""wasting"" £5 then you have issues. Seriously, you could find that on the street. Or you could go busking for an hour, whatever. Buy it.			"

												When I played the Witcher 1, I enjoyed it, but felt it had some annoying bits which unfortunately lessened the overall experience.In The Witcher 2, almost anything I was bothered with before is fixed. The combat is much improved. It's not perfect, but it's an solid improvement. There's also a mod out there that changes the combat fairly significant, for better or for worse.The story is awesome, although I feel the first one had more of an impact. It starts right after the first one but it gives enough info to still get the general gist of the story. I still highly recommend you play the first game since it's still a good game and you won't get lost here.The graphics are amazing. It's really jaw-dropping, especially once when you realize that it came out in the same year as Skyrim. It's simply stunning. Ubersampling is nice as it makes the obvious aliasing disappear, but it taxes even my GTX 970. You may prefer turning it off completely and dealing with the aliasing or using SweetFX.The music was less memorable to me than the first one. There wasn't anything I really particularly liked, but in general it's acceptable. The music might be the weakest part of the game for me, it just wasn't really noteworthy. It's not bad, but compared to the Witcher 1 it's meh.The content in this game is huge. I've played it twice as much as I have the first game. Without spoiling anything, you have to make a significant choice at a certain point which changes the game so much it's as if it's completely new. While there's still no jumping, and some invisible walls, they never irritated me in my playthrough. The maps are so large and the motion of climbing and descending cliffs are fluid. Signs and potions were a much bigger deal in this game than the last. I played it on normal difficulty, and while not as hard as Dark Souls, without a proper strategy and using brewing potions you're going to die...very easily.One noteworthy con is that the skill tree alchemy is useless. There's a limit to the number of skill points you get, and you'd much rather spend them on tangible things that affect your overall combat skills, not potions. Similarly, I probably used only one mutagen in the whole game. There's a wide range of weapons and armor in the game, so you won't really need to buy from merchants. You'll likely want to craft them yourself, or find good ones through quests and loot. Also this is personal preference but I found a gamepad to be better than KB+M, ignoring the inventory which is good with a KB+M, but annoying with a controller. I'd constantly unequip my boots when using one and found it really hard to manage my stuff. I still enjoy using a KB+M, although I think I prefer a controller with this game.It's a really solid game that any RPG fan should at least try. The environment is vast so you won't feel restricted even if it's not open world. The combat is good, not Dark Souls level but not Skyrim level either. Story is excellent as expected, with minor hiccups here and there.Although I feel like it's a great game, it's not perfect. Replayability is low for those who don't like seeing the same story again and combat can be tedious and downright frustrating at times (Not to mention targeting sucks).You'll want to save often as dying can send you way far back but too many saves causes frequent crashing. There's no way to move quicker, no sprinting or mounts. There's rolling, but it can't be done in areas like towns where they don't want your sword out. I also think the general atmosphere in the Witcher 1 was better, it had a darker and more serious tone although quite bleak.And...let's not forget the existence of the Witcher 3. I'll say this, play this game before TW3. TW3 is more of an improvement from TW2 to there compared to TW1 to TW2, and that's saying something. TW3 is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece, better music, visuals, gameplay, story and pretty much everything. Playing this and TW1 will make your TW3 experience that much better.			"

												Definitely one of my most favorite games of all time and the best RPG EVER. In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings you play as Geralt of Rivia, a legendary Witcher, based on the novels of Andrzej Sapkowski. Witchers are monster slayers for hire, with their mutated bodies and skills they wipe out monsters for a pay. But in this saga Geralt tries to regain his memory which he lost when fighting the Wild Hunt. (Read novels or play TW1/2 to know more about the story) on his way he has to deal with choices that have influence on your progess in the game.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS+ Beautiful breathtaking graphics+ Epic long and interesting story+ Non-linear gameplay+ EXTREMELY immersive atmosphere+ Choices are important, in the game you always have the possibility to make choices you like and they all have their different consequences.+ Awesome soundtrack+ Interesting sidequests, unlike other RPGs or games these sidequests will totally not get you bored.+ Great and original characters+ Possibility to lay traps and hunt+ Different Monsters are spread throughout every location+ You are able to explore caves, areas, forests, etc+ Dynamic combat, dodging and attacking on the right time is VERY important. + Alchemy, you can craft potions and enhance your weapons in order to prepare for a battle.+ Really nice boss battles+ Skill tree that has 4 different ways with useful abilities, Training, Swordmanship, Magic, Alchemy+ Huge arsenal of weapons, magic light armor to heavy, obtainable through sidequests, lootable chests, barrels, etc throughout the whole world, even forgeable with the right materials and diagrams!+ Steam trading cardsCONSThis game totally has NO cons at all. I will just state some stuff that might be a con to other people. But in my opinion this game is way too perfect to have cons.- It really seems complicated in the beginning but you'll get used to it, dont give up to fast. (You'll understand what I mean if you play the game for the first time)- The combat system is not like your average RPG game, it has special and dynamic mechanics. Every enemy has a different pattern and the way you approach it is very important. Dont start rushing to kill your enemy, block and dodge till you learn how he moves and attacks. And maybe which magic is fatal to him. Even when playing it at easy mode you will struggle at a certain moment. Even I, myself, had died a couple of times at a boss battle because of not being serious and not knowing his pattern and style.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I double-recommend you this game, you'll totally fall in love with it. TW2 is a huge improvement to TW1, you can start at TW2 since you get the storyline told of TW1. TW3 is coming in May so while you are reading this review dont hesitate to get TW2 and prepare yourself for the third saga of The Witcher after you finished this game. The atmosphere, characters, maturity, choices (Which are VERY important to a lot of people, no one likes scripted stories and wants it their own way while they progess through the game) and many other stuff makes this game so special. This game is totally a must have for RPG lovers, even if you never tried RPGs or dont like them then try this one. Its worth the money and wont disappoint you.			"

												While I had to use an xbox 360 controller to enjoy the game, it is a ery solid RPG. The story telling is solid and original. The game starts out on rails but opens up a lot. The bulk of the gameplay is town-base with surrounding countryside questing. The player decides what objects to pursue and how to develope his charcter.  THe towns are just the right size and have interesting npcs.			"

												This review will not be kind, and I will be covering nothing but its flaws. If you're looking for someone to sing The Witcher 2's praises, there is nothing for you here. Just downvote me and move on.After spending 31 hours playing this game, I am finding it extremely hard to understand why this game and the developers (CDPR) are seen as some sort of hallowed, sanctified version of perfection and PC development done right. CDPR (and this game specifically) are brought up as a shining beacon almost every time there is a discussion about other devs making stupid decisions (whether it's QTEs in Tomb Raider, or devs not optimizing for the PC platform, etc), and I honestly could not tell you why.I really tried to like this game. I REALLY did. I played the vanilla version, and when I found the combat to be impossibly clunky and frustrating, I downloaded the Full Combat Rebalance mod, which definitely fixed the combat but unfortunately didn't fix any of the rest of the clunky, frustrating base game.-The texture work is distractingly disjointed (with awesome high-res textures right next to disgustingly cheap ones). Overall the game looks good, but why put hours and hours into an awesomely-done texture, and then stick it next to an asset ripped from Mario Kart 64?-The dialog is well-acted but was recorded at seemingly random volumes. Two characters talking calmly when all of a sudden one of them is talking REALLY REALLY LOUDLY, BUT STILL IN A NORMAL VOICE. It is beyond weird, and ridiculously lazy/shoddy.-The story is political intrigue by everyone towards everyone, secretly involving everyone. It gets UNBELIEVABLY tiresome, and you stop being surprised by it halfway through. Twists stop being interesting when that's all there is.-Dialog-based intimidation and charm are always successful (at least for me) so there's really no reason for them to even be there.-EVERYTHING is pre-scripted. fist-fights are QTEs, story battles that are supposed to be time-based will continue until you kill X number of enemies, and even WALKING THROUGH A DOOR is a scripted event. No loading screen, just stand in front of door and press X, Geralt centers himself against the door, opens it and goes through, and closes it behind him. Repeat for EVERY character! If you have a group of 5 guys, each individual one centers themselves, opens, walks through, and closes. Unimportant, sure, but it is SO HIDEOUSLY STUPID, and would be SO easy to fix.-Story fights that need to be repeated over and over and overandoverandoverandover.-Speaking of fights: Combat ends up being a slash or two and a sign or two, followed by 27 rolls around the arena while your signs recharge and the enemies un-bunch. Repeat for 40 minutes.-You cannot walk freely. You can't jump, and can only climb in pre-ordained places. You can only jump down in pre-ordained places. The whole thing is SUPER stuffy, and this game does NOT deserve to be called ""open-world"" at all.Ugh, there are so many more things that I could not stand about this game, but I'm done spending time on this ""review"" so I'll stop.If you've made it this far, it's worth saying that the game is not TERRIBLE. If you can put up with its problems, you might enjoy it. I, however, had been lead to think that it was a fantastic world-changing game, and when it turned out to be merely a good game marred by frustratingly stupid design decisions, I was beyond annoyed. Combat was a let-down, the plot was a let-down, movement in the world was a let-down, etc.I have been a PC gamer all my life. My Dad bought me the full version of Doom when I was 8. I cracked Dark Forces to work without the CD when I was 10. I've played Strife, Ultima Underworld, Wing Commander, Earthsiege & Mechwarrior, Jedi Knight, all the Descents (including both Freespaces), etc.I have ALWAYS loved the PC, but this latest brand of blind fanboyism just because some dev shows 12% more attention to the platform? I want none of it. Either a game is good because it's good, or it's bad because it's bad. THERE ARE NO OTHER QUALIFYING FACTORS. I wanted to love this game, but I couldn't even like it. 31 wasted hours. Fool me twice, CDPR.			"

												I only discovered The Witcher due to the extensive media buzz aroudn the third. Not wanting to leave empty handed during the Summer sales I decided to see what the buzz was and picked up the second for £2.First impressions are good, the game looks like it has a massive world and story to discover with graphics that suit the scope it aims for. It's nice to feel early on that I'm not missing out by not playing the first game, picking up the basics as I go, learning a bit about the main character Geralt as I play.For an older game the graphics are brilliant, showing Skyrim up for what period pieces should look like when money is spent wisely. The game runs at high settings on my machine, the ultra for the first time seem to run awfully, though I'm hesitant to just blame the game rather my PC showing it's limits finally. The landscapes are fantastic, big broad views and draw distance keep the world wide open. Character models look great though the voice acting sometimes drag it all down into parody territory.However the controls, combat and UI are just short of disgusting. The layout of the buttons is annoying on keyboard, using Alt to aim while trying to cycle to 'R' or 'E' to parry and press the mouse button to attack, he's not the quickest at reacting to the key presses so it becomes tiresome fast. Switch to a controller and discover the preset key bindings are barely configured, these can't be changed in game so you have to exit if you want to correct them. The fighting itself is slow and calculating, opting for a more realistic approch with two main options to fight, strong attack or light attack. Then there's powers to be used, traps/ranged attacks and an option to attack after a parry. It feels like everyone had an idea on what the Witcher fighting should be like and no ones ideas were shot down.Walking feels cumbersome and janky, it works but there's something odd about it. Perhaps it's the camera that doesn't really attempt to follow the character in any decent fashion, often gifting you the view of the back of a bush while you struggle to fit a small army. There's no jump feature either so the world has a very linear feel, restricting you to a set level.The UI is horrible at best, an entire screen filled to the brim with all kinds of options, inventorys and menus. There's no realy layout scheme that makes any sense, compared to Skyrim or other RPG's that utilise all of it's features in a nice easy to view way. Crafting, levelling up, sub levelling up and this weird power menu and another power wheel where you can take a nap or quick view your weapons all feel like over kill, you don't need to add that many features. I honestly can't be bothered to learn it all, I want to immerse myself in the world not get bogged down trying to earn my degree in Witcher menus.Overall, this is much more beautiful than Skyrim ever was and the story is engaging. However the actual gameplay drops this title into Two Worlds territory for me. Absolute ambivelance I'm happy to part with £2 for.			"

""Souls-like"" combat, interesting characters and a believable world full of magic and intrigues which will keep you in front of your PC for 40+ hours / not to mention high replayability.Just do me a favour:  read the books (8 official novels if I'm not mistaken) if you want to fully understand and immerse into this wonderful world			"

												The witcher 2 is set in a fantasy medieval world inspired by polish and Russian mythology and based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s books. You play as Geralt of rivia, a witcher. Witchers are white haired mutants engineered to be professional monster slayers and are generally feared and looked down upon by regular people, Geralt uses two swords, a silver sword to fight monsters and a steel sword for humans. Because the game is a direct sequel the opening prologue puts you right into the action and new players to the series can get a little lost, however you don’t need to play the first game to fully understand what is going on, plus the witcher 2 has an extensive journal with all the information. The prologue starts off with Geralt imprisoned after being framed for assassinating the king during a siege, he’s being interrogated by the kings special forces and you play through his memories as he explains what happened during the siege. Later you manage to escape from the prison and your quest to clear your name and find out who’s really behind the series of assassinations begins. The story will take you to a number of different kingdoms and cities and you’ll meet lots of very interesting characters, how different events happen during the story is based on the decisions you make, As the story goes on the plot gets deeper and deeper, and the bigger picture becomes clearer ,who will geralt save? who will he kill? who’s side will he choose? the faith of entire kingdoms can be directly or indirectly be affected by the choices you make, the line is blurred between pure good or evil and there’s no clear morality, you do what you think is best, sometimes choosing the lesser evil in the name of the greater good, The role you play in the game has a very heavy effect on the story. The game has 16 very different endings and fully completing it will take you around 40 hours. Also i have to mention the game and story touch on drugs, murder, torture, ♥♥♥♥, incest, racism, nudity and more, however they all fit very well into the witcher universe and make the game feel very realistic and mature. If i was to compare it to a tv series it’s like game of thrones but with a richer world and with an eastern European flavour added to it.Gameplay wise the Witcher 2 is in third person and you fight in real time, combat is not easy, Geralt is not invincible and a group of knights could easily kill him if you’re not careful. Geralt can you use a number of potions and traps as well as his mutant abilities to give him an advantage in combat, potions can help him do more damage to certain monsters or improve his health, while his mutant abilities can be used to deflect arrows or stun opponents.The witcher 2 is a fantastic sequel, everything that was great about the first game has been immensely improved, the combat, the story, the characters all have been improved to a degree that is almost unbelievable, graphically it is one the best looking games ever made. The game is truly a masterpiece with a rich and detailed world, good gameplay and a deep and interesting story.			"

												To start with I must say that Witcher 2 is the best RPG I have ever played and one of the best games out there. It is an absolute masterpiece of a game with an awesome storyline, graphics that stay beautiful and full of detail throughout  the game, interesting characters and a fun and exhilarating combat.The story is an exceptional beauty throughout , with moral choices that effect small changes like killing a character or letting them go, and huge changes that effects the entire story and leads you on different paths and goals. the game is full of cleverly thought out and designed quests, from the wonderfully interesting main plot to side quest that'll have you finding and killing ghosts , solving crimes and if you don't want to go out and discover the mysteries beyond the walls you can stay in at the tavern and earn yourself money by gambling on fights or competing in them .  The combat can be quite challenging and can require preparation like the placement of traps, the drinking of potions that will increase weapon damage , health and many more and covering your weapons in oil and poison so the sword deals more damage and has effects. This all has to be done before combat so the player must cleverly think and path his next battle. once mastered the combat is a very fun and accelerating departure from other games combats that involves hacking and slashing by simply mashing a single button till the target is dead.The Graphics are a outstanding astonishment ( on maxed out anyway) , with an unbeatable lighting effect and texture that doesn't get poorer and poorer  the closer you get to it and focused on, the games textures stay amazing throughout . overall Witcher 2  is an incredible game and if you have a powerful enough rig it can be an amazingly beautiful one as well, with a different but fun and creative combat and a cleverly written and presented story  Witcher 2 is a master piece of a game and without a doubt is worth buying .   	Just a little something to add this game can be made even better or made different by adding these two mods that can be found on the Witcher 2 nexus. ( There are other mods but these are the most effective and a thrill to use.) Rise of the Sword - this mod changes and adds in a huge amount of features that includes changing the shop to buy new and epic items and changing the combat to use more attacks and most importantly the ability to change and customize the camera to have it be where ever you want it to be. ( doesn't have to be but would recommend playing the game through and then playing it again on a second play through with this mod installed to get the full effect and fell the difference.)       http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/672/?tab=1&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fwitcher2%2Fajax%2Fmoddescription%2F%3Fid%3D672%26preview%3D&pUp=1Extreme Quality Flora v1 - This mod Dramatically increases grass , trees and moss rendering distance. it also increases the detail on bushes , shrubs and trees and most importantly Grass pop-in is completely eliminated. ( this is a huge recommend if the grass pop in is annoying anyone and you simply want the game to look even more better.)http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/653/? "

												I bought this game for $3.99, is it worth paying that. Yeah!Some positives---1. I like the combat with the varying swords, and steel and silver depending on your opponents. Throw in some magic and it feels balanced.  The combat is better than Witcher 1.  Witcher 1 combat; some people just got fed up with the combat system in the game and stopped playing because of it, sadly missing out on the story in 1.2. I like the crafting, you have potions and sword oils to improve your combat and health perks.3. The story line is good, it flows and it keeps it's reference to Witcher 1.  4. The characters are rich with personality! Each character has their own personality.  Elves, Dwarfs, humans, mutants,  monsters have their own environments, attitudes.5. Dialog choices are pretty clear, and there are two paths you can take in the game.  It isn't entirely clear whether you are going good, evil or more evil through the game though. However the 2 paths effectively give you 2 different playthroughs, with some side missions available on one path and slight different missions on the other path.6. The environments are unique and atmospheric, and feels large enough for the game.7. It has Steam Achivements, and for me they are like an added guide to things and directions to take in the game that I might not have otherwise discovered on my own. (there are secret achievements as well)8. Merchants are great, they vary on what each sells.  However make sure you don't accidently sell the wrong thing or the buy back will be expensive (save often in case of mistakes)9. There is a primary storage location so you don't have to carry all your crap around, and it is maintained in each town as you progress through the chapters.10. Will I play it through a second time to experience the other story path? Yes!Some negatives---1. Sometimes the combat for magic is delayed even when mashing it... which causes you to die.  I did a lot of cursing! Read on a forum where one guy said to disable the enhanced features, so I did but it didn't fix it.  Maybe it's a keyboard thing? All I know is I wasn't the only one who experienced it.  And I've got a custom high end machine, and my keyboard is a G11 gaming keyboard.  Regardless the magic works on time sometimes, but not instantly another time. (it's also noted as a bug on some of the forums)2. The potion creating system can get tedious and a bit over drawn out, even picking up plants gets annoying with having to click mouse, then move mouse to yeah pick it up and then click again.  It'd be better if it was quick like ES:IV Oblivion, picking up and creating.3. No fast travel.. and I would like fast travel (I've read where people say you don't need fast travel because the environments are small enough).  Here's 2 reasons I feel it could use fast travel... 1) the running is like a jog and would be nice if it was faster so give me a sprint option!  I even searched for a way to increase run speed (like you can for FO New Vegas in the console) but couldn't find a way to increase it though.  2) the second reason I'd like fast travel is the map pretty much sucks a$$! If you don't believe me then watch this video another guy created!

			In this glorious video Renn tells you why the map system in the witcher 2 is crap. Come check out our LOVELY site - http://avidgamerreviews.com/ Go ahead and throw us a like on Facebook -...		

 4. The map sucks!!! Hire a cartographer for the mapping system, someone who understands the importance of elevations in maps! LOL  Refer to YouTube link above! When you get deep into the game, yep you'll likely start yelling like this guy does in the video listed above. I had to keep going to YouTube/Google to find certain locations... it was really annoying! And when you don't run really fast and you wind up on the other side of town and want to see if the mission is the other way you have to keep going back and forth and back and forth it's annoying! Again a sprint or fast travel would have helped! Luckily in the second playthrough having already found the locations it should be less of a headache to find places.. if I remember where they are.. LOL5. The nudity is tacky, plain and simple! LOL  Seriously the make out session with Geralt and Ves, Ves is completely naked makin' like she's banging him but Geralt still has his pants and boots on!? LOL It's a double standard plain and simple, saying it's okay to exploit women but not men. If they are going to have gratuitous sex, that will only appeal to guys who can't get laid in real life then at least make it something like they had in Dragon Age Origins.  I could do without the women are all sl_ts attitude, minus the mages who are apparently b*tches and can't be trusted in this game.6. Lastly the Quick Load could use an improvement to the programming and insert an algorithm to speed load times, so it looks for the last created quick save to load instead of reading oldest to newest file then load.  If you save a lot then later in the game your huge save folder will slow load time.  I'm a chronic saver, due to my need to explore dialog options and I accumulated 2 gig of saves in one playthrough. The slow loading can be avoided/fixed by moving a chunk of your oldest saves elsewhere if you find your quick load slowed.  This is a case where it was fast when you started the game but suddenly noticed the load times slowing, towards mid to end of the game.  If it was always slow to load then it's prolly your machine...Don't let my negatives deter you from buying.  Just be aware it's not perfect! I bought it cheap so no skin off my butt! I'd like to see a Witcher 3, but with my negatives eliminated.. LOLThere are also mods here that will enhance the game: http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/top/? "

												Really, I could probably summarize Witcher 2 by saying it's an improvement over the original in almost every game-related way that matters, subjective things like atmosphere and alike being debatable, because CDPR upped their game significantly and actually worked with the engine of their own making, but that would be an easy way out and I like to complicate my life.First notable change is a clear 180 towards making the game into a more action-based installment, further enforced by removal of old combat styles and instead focusing on light and heavy attacks which give you more freedom in a sense that you can combine them on the fly without getting locked into a carefully choreographed sequences. Other than that there are changes which I would tentatively summarize as ""streamlining done right"" which is quite a claim in this day and age – alchemy removes the need for alcohol basis which finally lets Geralt stop being a walking cellar lugging around all kinds of high quality alcohol. It should also be noted that changes like these don't really simplify the game in any significant fashion primarily because other elements, like actual gear variety, addition of proper crafting and traps, etc easily offset whatever may have been removed.  That's not to say everything is perfect because some people had problems with the way combat works and overreliance on Quen aka protection Sign as a crutch, but I never really went through those problems so I can't testify to that.Story and characters of the game are an entirely separate beast worthy of being mentioned on their own. Witcher 2 continues after the first game, but works perfectly fine as a standalone story, although it is HIGHLY recommended that you're familiar with the original to understand who's who and what's happening in general. It retains the same old moral ambiguity and holds back no punches for the player but it's even better this time around thanks to increased world reactivity as well as choices & consequences which are really cranked up to 11. Fact that Act 2 is different depending on a choice you make previously practically guarantees at least two playthroughs to get the entire story and even then you'll still miss some modular things which can be done differently. Even though the stakes have escalated as far as the story goes, it's still a story very much grounded in reality except you now get to dabble in politics beyond just a cursory introduction.In the end Witcher 2 gets a resounding thumbs up from me. Importing your old Witcher  1 save file is also recommended. Not so much for the imported gear you'll replace fairly quickly so much as for decisions you made previously.			"

												The Witcher 2 is a great game where your choices matter a lot. Choices matter so much the entire second act is completely different based on who you decide to follow at the end of act 1. What's even more satisifying is that there is no black and white here, only shades of grey.Witcher 2 is rich in detail, the voice acting is terrific, the graphics are among the best and the stories and consequences of your actions are well thought out and believable. However, be warned that this is a difficult game and there's a lot of boring backtracking to do. Also, there's very little hand-holding; you'll have to listen carefully to dialogue (and read books and your journal!!!) to know what to do and where to go instead of just walking blindly to your next map marker.

												This has been probably one of the best gaming adventures I've ever had. It's hard to compare its weight, story, dialogue, character and mood with any other. It's choices are the of the weightiest I've ever had to make. The world, script and atmosphere made several of these major choices nerve-wracking for a variety of different reasons. There is no ""good"" path or ""bad"" path, it's just choice and consequence, and it's not always 100% clear what those consequences are, but the reactions and effects are fantastic to see unfold.It's improved over the Witcher 1 in every single way, and even now, years after it's release, the graphics are still downright great, the combat challenging but fun, and it still feels humble, well-acted and a solid adventure title. I would extremely recommend this to anyone looking for a good story that isn't squeamish. It's very adult, and it treats you like and adult.My cons with it would be perhaps a better tutorial, and a few other specifics like certain abilities better explained. As well as fast travel wouldn't hurt a few times. I played using keyboard+mouse and found the controls decent, though it seems to be well-made for controllers too. Overall, I had a total blast and definitely will be playing it again in the future, using a different path and different choices. Very few games I've ever played could match this for quality writing, content, script and atmosphere.			"

												I bought this game for $2.50 and all I can say is, wow. After purchasing the first and second games for the price of a chocolate milk, I have spent over 85 hours on the games. I really enjoyed the first one, then when I played this it blew my expectations out of the water. The story, the characters, the settings, but most of all the highly improved sword and fighting mechanics. I finally felt in control of Geralt. This game was smooth and well polished at the time of playing. Although some of the game seemed quite easy, it regularly proved to be difficult in others requiring you to think about your steps. Not challenging enough to make you give up, but enough to really involve you in the battle. Yet, this is where my one complain of the game comes up. You cannot consume any of your alchemy items or oil your blade once the fight has started. A lot of the time you may not know who you are going to fight or when. Since all consumables are timed, you don't want to always use them up. This meant sometimes saving your game, running around, loading back to the previous save to know what you should consume. I hope in the 3rd title this is changed back. Over all, amazing game. Will play through again since the story can go 2 ways. I want to see both paths that Geralt takes and am really looking forward to playing through again. Also want to see how many boobies I can convince women to show me since so far it's 100% more in this game than real life.			"

												Probably one of the best RPG games I've ever played. Storyline, graphics, writing, visual's, cinematics - immersive characters and settings with multiple choices that make this gem replayble time after time. The mod community is brilliant, not quite skyrim, but none the less they have enhanced and fixed things putting a new edge on The Witcher 2. Do your self a big favour and buy this one on sale, it's still worth $20 and has more staying power than many many others.			"

												This game is actually great,Great voice acting, visuals, and the developers know how to get things done.One of my few dislikes is the controls you need to get used to, and many visual bugs that don't really interrupt gameplay, but do come in quantity. Which you do hope to have been fixed in the 3 years since release.Maybe not a game for everyone, I myself am not heavily into RPGs, but definitely something I'd recommend picking up during a sale to atleast try it out.

												Witcher 2 is by far the best RPG i have played in many years. I features graphics way ahead of it's time and amazing story which is based on a book series. The combat is indepth and requires alot of thought before entering a battle. You character Geralt requires preperation before fight, He is not invincible and unstoppable like Kratos or Dante. The world has alot of packed lore into it and this all given to you in beautiful cutscenes, indepth monster species books, ancient texts and all the interactive npcs that you can encounter on your journey. Witcher 2 is overall a Hardcore RPG that deserve my approval of a 10/10			"

												The Witcher 2 is one of the best action-RPGs around.  Well-written and mature story, plot, and dialogue.  The characters are well-developed. And, the decisions that you make throughout your journey changes the game dynamically.The controls are fluid, intuitive, and mapped in a style that is conducive to gameplay.  For those that are curious, I played all 60 hours of gameplay with a mouse and keyboard.Visuals are excellent for its time, and it has aged well.  Also, it is well-optimized.  My graphics and video options were set to ultra, 1200p, all maxed except for uber-sampling.  When I played The Witcher 2, I was using a GTX 670, i5-2500k.However, The Witcher 2 focuses less on monster hunting lore, and more on the political aspect of The Witcher universe.  Even then, there is some monster hunting and ghouls to fight during your downtime before you return to the game's political intrigue.If you are a fan of The Witcher books, The Witcher 1 videogame, and its universe, you owe it to yourself to play this game.  Maybe, even twice.  9.5 out of 10Highly recommended			"

												Just stop reading and give CD Project your money! Witcher 2 is a great improvement to the already great Witcher 1. Not to mention that you get a huge Patch for free with the  you get the Enhanced Edition which Adds more Cutscenes, Quests and even new Difficulty Modes with Extra Armor-Sets. EA would have released it as a 20$ DLC. The Graphics are beautiful, but the Game is pretty good optimized so you don't need a super high-end PC. I would recommend to play Witcher 1 before you get to Witcher 2. You can import your Savegame and keep your awesome Weapons/Armor you got in Witcher 1. And you will encounter some more NPCs in the Witcher 2 that you already know from the first Game, that may even thank/attack you for what you have done in the Witcher 2.If you like  Action-RPGs with a very rich Lore: The Witcher is the way to go!

												Easily one of the best RPG's I've played in years. Skyrim may have a gigantic landscape riddled with dozens of ""fetch quests"" but The Witcher 2 blows it out of the water in nearly every aspect.*It has an engaging story, and you'll learn more about the plot after subsequent playthroughs.*It has a practical crafting system.*Many of the quests actually make sense. You rarely meet random NPC's that ask you do something important even though they barely know you.*Combat can be improved with FCR.*The game is 4 years old but the graphics are still AMAZEBALLS.*Soundtrack is epic!I put this game on hold for a long time, but I'm glad I actually got to finish it. 11/10			"

												This is one more of those cases like Portal where the first game felt like a real PC game and the next one feels more like a console-optimized interactive movie. (To a modest degree, but in that direction.)Yes, the production value might be high, the story might be interesting, but I'm not reviewing a movie here, but a game.While in the first Witcher game, I liked the style, all its strong points so much, I could easily overlook the various weak points, but in this game, from the very beginning, I saw little but its flaws.And because I saw way too many to edit them elegantly, here is a list of notes of the things that bothered me, in no particular order:- Dithered lighting!- Anisotropic filtering is enforced in the nVidia driver (since the game doesn't seem to have the option), but it still runs on trilinear!)In these two points the graphics in Witcher 2 are actually worse than in the first game.- Almost immediately vanishing corpses. (Same in the first game, but come on! Go with the times!)- No graphics engine or keyboard config settings in game, only via launcher. The first game had all of this.- Some fast-mouse-click QTE (quick time event) minigames are unnecessary and kind of harm immersion (sometimes practically ""click now or die"" - especially one scene in the prologue was annoying, since it was multi-phased and involved a sudden 180° change of camera view) - It makes little sense to expect very heightened adrenaline-pumping awareness while watching a cutscene and feels more like harassment.Even the relatively lame fist fight mechanics of the first game I found more appealing than mere WASD button pressing on command.- The precise-aim crosshair for daggers and such is almost invisible.- Some quest/dialogue progression in the prologue doesn't make much sense, i.e. leaving continuity holes- Selectable dialogue texts don't really match the Witcher's response that well. It's generally difficult to lead a conversation according to your true intention. You might end up accepting a task without wanting it. I often had to reload and try all options to at least get an idea of what I was doing.- Some dialogue barely audible because mumbled, need to reduce music volume (e.g. inn), but might be too low in other cases then.- Blood and dirt splatter on screen in cutscenes - harms immersion (4th wall breaking)- Some gold bags might be untouchable due to usable objects nearby.- An occasional geometry flicker issue that I saw in the first game, too, but no other game. Also some texture gaps.- Not being able to take a killed guard's sword during a prison break is kinda stupid, and it's not like it would be overpowered in that situation.- Game crashed before boarding a boat in one scene - couldn't save in that segment for some non-apparent reason, so had to redo and loot all the stuff I took there.- No launcher bypass possible using witcher2.exe or via other means. Launcher then places a symbol in the task bar just to add annoyance to the whole thing.- Inventory UI is kind of stupid in that it shows no stats for items in the list while highlighted, and menu items change size when highlighted, which impairs usability.- The game package doesn't even include the manual. It's just 7 MB, but I had to download it separately. Also outdated!- None of the 4 inventory sorting icons (whose meanings I had to find out by myself) gives you a value-for-weight sorting.- Inventory sorting keeps reverting to time-of-pickup.- Dropping an item from the inventory scrolls the whole list back to the top.- Key-based inventory scrolling doesn't use Windows settings. Repeat rate and trigger delay is way too high for my convenience. Also, PGUP/PGDN have no function.- Voices during conversations often have a strong reverb that doesn't match the environment at all.- A more general issue that was already in the first game: You can take stuff out of storage crates and such, and none seems to be owner-tagged, although most of it should. In a game that seeks to create immersion, this common RPG trait is always disturbing that.- Message ""item cannot be sold"" when trying to put it in my storage. Thus, unsellable items cannot be put in storage. Apparently the storage is just a crudely repurposed vendor.(which can lead to bugs)- Quest texts go ahead in time, telling what's gonna happen later or supposed to happen. The player doesn't seem to be considered relevant in these things and it feels like a bit of a spoiler.- Wavering camera during dice minigame is unrealistic and annoying.- Missing comparative feature of inventory item stats with worn item stats.- Fight club quest - when I'm asked to lose, I cannot decide to just quit, only accept the scam or fight (to win) anyway.- Often repeating NPC lines. Less would be more (immersive). They say the exact same thing every time you pass after an area has loaded.- Dialogue response timeouts - stupidest thing ever. For most dialogues it's perfectly fine or you to think about what to say for as long as you like (and I don't see a problem with that, and it's often necessary because the dialogue options are so unclear), but for some reason I don't see some dialogues will default to whichever option your cursor is on after a few seconds. If you don't notice the timer icon right away, you won't even know what you just chose.- When moving through the world, occasionally there's a loading symbol in the lower right corner, but loading is almost lag-free, so that icon is distracting, because when it briefly flashes, I keep thinking I just walked over a lootable object.- Geralt looks straight and not down when he's talking to a dwarf.- Small things like cursor not staying on menu when exiting to main menu with intention of selecting quit game. UI usability sucks in this game.- At least one quest didn't allow me a proper outcome in the journal and a quest tied into that one was absurdly unrealistic regarding changing a shop owner's conscience.- I am led through endless cutscenes that last long enough to let any potion run out and then right after that I'm in battle with a boss enemy, without potions. (Maybe the timers halt, but if they do, that would actually harm immersion again.)- First boss battle sucked, because while the game wants to look like a movie, the difficulty style is like hardcore indie games where you are likely to fail dozens of times, which I literally did. I must have tried 30 times. I felt like an actor and the director was shouting at me because I didn't do every move exactly according to script. I had to concentrate more on the ""click now"" like symbols on the screen than on the boss itself. I also at first didn't know when exactly the battle started and had to reload just to be able to drink potions in advance without wasting some of their meager 10-minute effect. Then I was frustrated because it used the wrong trap, despite me having selected the special trap for the boss. I eventually realized after several tries that I was supposed to left-click the marker with my mouse to place it. During the battle with a gigantic menacing boss, crows were sitting on a nearby corpse as if nothing was happening.- Many events could be enacted in a non-instantly-lethal way and especially in normal game mode. But instead: cutscene after cutscene. One time I was to play another character in a short event and fought someone in a duel. I fought well. The moment I defeated him... cutscene where I fail. This is disappointing and borderline insulting to the player. Don't let me fight if you intend to cheat me out of my deserved victory.Bottom line: This game often feels like it's trying to make me its trained monkey and has its fun toying with me, like I'm just an employee meant to move the story forward.A lot about this game is the same stuff that put me off about games like Castlevania LoS 1+2 (of which I played the demos).It gets surprisingly easy later-on though.- Geralt of Review			"

												The Witcher 2: A.O.K. is a linear, chapter based story game inwhich you to decide the fate or future through the choices you make throughout your journey, that's as straight forward as it can get.Aspects of Witcher 2 Worth Praising● The Ability To Save Wherever. Sadly not many games allow you to save on your own time and it's certainly appreciated at least by me when a developer includes it. You can save anywhere when you're not in combat or a cutscene.● Unique Outlook Through Different Eyes. One unique aspect of the Witcher 2: A.O.K. is that  throughout the game you're able to play as different characters and the choices you choose with those characters greatly impacts the story.Aspects of Witcher 2 Worth Criticizing● Quick Time Events. An overwhelming majority of quests involving melee combat include this ""mechanic."" I've said it time and time again, quick time events are not a valid combat mechanic and only conceal the developers incompetence.● Lack of Game Funtionality. You can't swim or jump in the Witcher 2: A.O.K. and there's invisible barriers preventing you from falling or going more than knee deep in water.● Can't Rebind Particular Keys. In the Witcher 2: A.O.K. you use Mouse1 to activate doors, talk to people, light torches, fight, climb up or down ledges, and quick time events; pretty much the majority of things in this game. This is ridiculous as you constantly swing your sword or light a torch when you want to open a door.For a linear chapter based game that heavily uses cutscenes, I enjoyed traveling through the game and felt the story was an interesting experience; I'll recommend the Witcher 2.

												The Witcher 2 from a gaming standpoint is the meaning of the word progress, and how they improved from the first in the series. Everything from the graphics to the moving parts behind the game are an incredible feat, one you would expect from big named companies backed by a large budget. The looks of the game were not only unparalleled in 2011 due to its PC only nature, but also because it gives us a world that feels hand crafted. The attention to detail borders on the insane: the clothes, the houses and buildings, the faces of the characters, along with their weapons and in every corner, nook and cranny of the world there is that distinctive touch. The scenery is simply breathtaking, and if you're like me you will want to take a screenshot out of almost every frame. It also shows that you don't need an overabundance of browns and blood reds in your palette to show a gritty dark fantasy world. This game shows its maturity not through a pretense of adult topics or with over the top action animations, but through a careful use of its core elements and by showing the player some respect: ""Yes, you're an adult, and you can handle these topics!"" Because indeed the Witcher is a dark world filled with conspiracies, racism and characters who live between every single shade of gray. It is a living, breathing, unforgiving world.The story is as complex as the first , filled with twists and choices that may change the fate of many, and forking paths that make a replay of the game not only encouraged, but something you'll want to do in order to see the extent to which they occur and diverge. Normal and Hard, as easy is just that, difficulties are recommended and will test your skills if you do not face every battle with all seriousness, preparing beforehand by brewing and drinking potions and using all of your abilities during the fight. i.e. your swords, your magic signs, depending on what enemy you face and the traps and bombs for your crowd control and a little breathing room at times.The actual combat is in no way dumbed down, even if it feels less based on timing then the first. It will still punish you if you go unprepared and you can't mash your way out of battles. It is more finely tuned than in the first game, and friendly to both the use of a gamepad or mouse and keyboard. The UI is slick, easy to figure out and great looking.The ending of the game is abrupt, but one youve worked for. You might feel that it doesn't solve every issue in the game (the main storyline issues ARE resolved, though). It is no excuse from what many will consider a downbeat ending, in which it still sets up for the next in the series greatly though.  In all honesty it doesn't take away a single ounce from what this game does right, which is almost everything else. Even if you don't like the ending you will feel that the journey was worth it. There are also quite a few endings, 8 in fact, more if you consider all the side choices that could affect it.  Some are much better feeling than others, and all of which lead into the next game quite nicely.With the Witcher 2, CD Projekt RED delivered a game that is truly above and beyond any RPG from the few last years, it plays and feels like a product of love, careful planning and an overall shout to fans of the gaming community that says ""We know what you want, and we can deliver. Where others have failed you we will prevail."" And man did they ever. I would play this game again 5 years from now, just to remember how great a game it truly and to see how masterpiece RPGs are done.			"

												Without  a doubt I would say that this game was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. It is challenging at times and the game refuses to hold your hand and guide you through it like a baby. It is a refreshing change of pace from games like Skyrim. It is incredibly immersive, beautiful in almost every way, and the world itself is so engaging and interesting that I was actually sad that it wasn't more open for me to explore. Combat is challenging, skill oriented, and at time not forgiving or errors. However, right off the bat the game gives you all the tools you need to succeed and as you level up you can fine tune your character to reflect your personal preferences...even if that Talent Tree could use a bit more deviation.The dialogue (and there's a lot of it) is fantastic, the allies lovable and the enemies hateable. You care about characters and persons are portrayed in a very realistic and believable way. That's the thing about the Witcher 2. It's Believable and by extension is wonderfully immersive.If you want a challenge and an immersive adventuring experience, then you need to buy this game. ---Rags' Rating - A Yummy Strawberry Cheesecake / 10			"

												The Witcher 2 is the second game in The Witcher trilogy based on the books of the same name. Compared to the first game, TW2 improves on every single aspect. The graphics are amazing, probably one of the best in recent years. The music is great. The combat feels a lot better compared to the first game. The voice acting is also better. You can feel emotions behind the voice. The facial animation in TW2 feels real compared to the stiff faces in the first game (Zoltan's crazy eyes). The story this time takes on a larger scale which involves different sides that you can choose, meaning the choices you make in this game matter a lot.   Overall, The Witcher 2 does an amazing job serving as a sequel for the first game and as the second game in the Witcher trilogy.If you're interested in the books. I suggest reading the books first before playing the games. The games take place after the books so there are a lot of dialogues and references that spoil the events in the books. Besides, there's a satisfying feeling when you meet the characters from the books again in the games. The books order: The Last Wish -> Sword of Destiny -> Blood of Elves -> Time of Contemp -> Baptism of Fire -> The Swallow's Tower -> Lady of the Lake			"

												The Witcher 2 is a really well made RPG. The 31 hours that i put into the game had me really immersed. Even if you do not plan on getting the Witcher 3(but why wouldn't you?)I would definitely recommend this game.Pros:-Great story-Decent characters with good voice acting.-Good combat system(in my opinion) that is not too easy nor too hard.-The biggest highlight of the game is that the choices that you make has a really significant impact on the game unlike many other RPGs and choice based games which only give you the illusion of choice/choices with insignificant outcomes. You end up on two completely different paths with different quests and allies based on your choices. Also core decisions that you made in the game carries over to the Witcher 3.-Great graphics for a 2011 game and also relatively bug free.-Has many side quests which are fun to do with good story.Cons:-Not very optimized.-No fast travel. Sometimes it can be a pain to walk long distances.			"

												It's the second game of The Witcher Franchise.  The whole game mechanics and graphics have improve greatly compared to the first game. It's beautiful looking game with a strategic combat mechanics. Yes, as an RPG game, more of the Action RPG side, it have a quality storytelling campaign with a challenging combat. You have to learn how to time your combat rather than just go with a 'typical' mob mentality. It's hard at first but rewarding along the journey. Once you get the rhythm, it will be Dark Souls like kind of enjoyment out of fighting, especially if you ramp up the difficulty. But for people who just want to play it for the stories, just choose the lower difficulty. It's no shame on choosing it, cause you do have to strategise before you enter combat with potions etc.Campaign wise, it's way wayy better that Witcher 1 for sure, and it's even have two seperate campaign after 1st chapter and its totally different set of environments/quests and you might want to replay the other side of the game later on (keep extra save games for that part). Both set line of quests offer a different agenda rather than just same old RPG style quest that make no different in the end. In Witcher 2, both side have their own agenda and it's up to you which one you like to explore. The sidequest also interesting and most of the time it's not requires too much time to be completed as it is near etc. So pick it up and enjoy the quest.Along the way, you will be presented with a lot of choices in term of how your choices affect the game storylines. The result of some choices might appear straight away or only near the end of your journey. You choose what you like, there's no definitive right or wrong. Most of the time, it's just a lesser of two evils ..... it's your choice.""In Witcher's world, there's no right or wrong, only decisions and consequences.""			"

												The Witcher 2 is the best storyline in a game I have ever experienced. A cross between Skyrim and Lord of the Rings, the story is compelling and movie-like. You feel attachment to the characters, and you genuinely care about what will happen to them. The scenery is stunning, the tasks are varied and not repetitive at all, and it keeps you involved right to the end. Yes, the swordsmanship is a little clunky in battle, and it's annoying that you can't change the controls, but these are seriously minor ailments of what is probably my new favourite single player game. I highly recommend this game, but if you need any more convincing:  there are boobs in it.			"

												This definitely is Game of the Year 2011. The single best RPG I have played since Planescape: Torment. The characters are deep and complex, the storyline develops depending on your actions and choices. It takes what was good from every single RPG released in the last 15 years and makes it into something better. The graphics are simply the best ever seen in an RPG to date, if not the best that we have so far in any game (compare to Crysis if you want to). The flaws are few if any. The stealth sections are not the best, but they are optional, and there are a few bugs and such. There is no ACTUAL character customization, but you can change what the protagonist is wearing with quite a bit.The combat system works quite well. It may not be the best combat system in gaming history, but it does exactly what is is supposed to do. But all that is just beside the point. The atmosphere, the music and the character lines are just amazing, combining to create one of the best RPG's of all time.			"

												The Witcher 2 is one of those rare games in which you do not predict what is going to happen, one of those amazing games that, if you make the wrong decision, you will face the consequences. The thing that makes this so good is that not everything is clear, it is not black and white/paragon and renegade actions. Of my current hours (37.7), I have played within the span of 3 days. It is an addictive and excrutiatingly hard game(on dark difficulty, which I decided to start on) and while the learning curve is quite steep for begginers, it's well worth it.Alas there are a few cons to every masterpiece, for example, very little carry over from the first Witcher game (coming from a Mass Effect background) and was quite dissapointing that there were very few references to Alvin or any of the major decisions you made (eg. The scoia'tael beating on your ♥♥♥ even if you helped them in the first). Also, I finished the game without any need for the alchemy skill tree, and a lot of tasks such as building the Oathbreakers outfit is long and tedious.The lack of big bossfights were a little dissapointing and for me personally, the bosses were too easy (except that damn squid).However, the game makes up for it with breathtaking graphics (especially seeing as it is around 4 years old) and quite fluid combat, along with amazing storytelling elements and interesting plot lines. Although the lore can be boring for some and confusing for others at times as the game attempts to keep you in the dark on various matters.All in all, fantastic game.			"

												This review is from the perspective of a new player to the series. Yes I have “played” the first witcher but dropped it after realizing how broken the game play is.The points:+ Controller support+ Combat+ Dialog+ Characters+ Art/Level Design+ Solo+ One Ring to Rule Them all/ Lesbomancy~ Animation~ Story (my bad)~ Menus- The world- Short- Triss’s BS8/10-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Okay let's start off with the middle ground issues, the ones that were annoying but didn’t break it for me. The animation at times was great the problem is the other 50% of the time they look like ventriloquist dummies, which is worse than the Mass effect stare. The story is very hard to follow and get into the swing of understanding it however after about 3 hours in I could fully understand what was going on. The menus leave much to be desired but it’s a huge step up from witcher 1, it took about an hour to get used to after that didn’t have much issue.Now the negative, the world makes no sense I don’t understand how 8 tiny countries smaller than rhode island can pump out more then the huge southern nation. I’m sorry but these nations are conquered. The story is short like COD level game short for a RPG. And Lastly Triss’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is not a damsel in distress issue. The issue with Triss is it’s obvious by the 80% mark of the main story that ALL this time she has been lying and manipulating you, BUT NOTHING COMES OF IT. no dialog, no nothing, I’ll be starting Wild Hunt sometime today if this is not brought up I will mark that game down as well for this. Now for the good, I glad this game has controller support because rolling around using a keyboard would have been a massive pain. And it’s done very well, I have some issues with inventory but besides that everything was handled well. The combat is actually combat in this game I can sense hints of Dark Souls, which isn’t bad because this game has a better combat system then Dark Souls (no one likes a game that ques your button presses). The dialog is not Mass Effect level crap of good, funny, and mad. It’s actually a bunch of options that may lead you to what you need. The Dialog system shines best with the Golem in the mission The Secrets of Loc Muinne. The characters are properly developed and have depth to back them except for Triss(her whole character is “she wants your D” -.- not joking). The world is beautiful and the levels are large enough for the time spent in each area to make it worth it. And lastly the solo experience, this is Geralt’s story not “Geralt and his friends” story. At first I thought I would hate this, but as time went on it made you feel more awesome. Do to the fact you were doing everything on your own.			"

												One of the best RPG games I've ever played!Game is really highly enjoyable and a must-buy especially for european RPG fans.It's a lot better than Witcher 1 and more fun.The story is good and branched in several ways and the quests are fun to do, giving you good reasons doing multiple story paths, endings that depends on choices and a good replay value. Only cons in my experience are the lack of sprinting, fast travel and bugs (There are some severe ones) and the fact that you can't bind some functions like map and journal to the mouse. And the combat system is bit annoying sometimes, Although the Enhanced Edition improved it a bit, but still there's a mod to make it better if you still don't like the original one.9/10			"

												Excellent storytelling. Great characters. Your choices have a profound impact on the story. The second game of the Witcher franchise is rather short (compared to W1 and W3) yet captivating. This is one of the few games you actually want to play several times (this reimburses for the overall time it takes to actually beat the game) in order to see the different outcomes of your choices. Only downside to this game is the rather abrupt ending. It basically ends when you acquire the best gear which is a little bit unfortunate for players who like to gear up properly.			"

												One of the best RPGs I've played. The story is compelling, the characters are likable, the combat is decent. There are enough decisions and story branches that you'll want to keep all your saves so you can go back and experience them all. Unfortunately, the save files are massive so you have to keep a close eye on them.			"

Introduction:A second chapter of the world of Geralt.Good: graphics (looks good but my eyes were bleeding in the beginning); a story line (nice trick to split it into two ways of completing the game); soundtrack (still good and not so frequent as in the first game but sometimes you lead your hero through the silence); fighting system is changing when you level up some skills; crafting system (a great variety of things available to craft); atmosphere of mid-ages battles is really impressive and you feel yourself a part of them; a strong link between games (Witcher and Witcher 2) those legendary armor and swords imported from first game were the best for a long game-play time; game stability is increased (it crashed only once for me); game saves don't take too much space anymore (comparing with The Witcher EE).Bad: an amount of side-quests is reduced (no more hidden quests you can get from some random NPC while talking. Now each active NPC is shown on mini-map); no more gifting thing (I mean in the first game you could gift some ring or something to NPC and get something for it in exchange, now all those jewelries are just a useless trash) too much bad words in the game; no more alco *parties* no more romantic *cards* (currently only porn cut-scenes :-(In total: 7 / 10P.S.: 50 hours only in total (yes, mate I completed the story once and I don't have any wish to replay it again). Sorry guys but I liked the first game more while this one is still good but not perfect.			"

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is a decision-driven fantasy RPG released by CD Projekt RED in 2011.  Like all The Witcher games, The Witcher 2 is based on The Witcher series of novels by Andrzej Sapkowski.Story (mild spoilers):The Witcher 2 (W2) takes places in a fantasy world heavy inspired by Slavic mythology and Polish history.  The universe of The Witcher games is steeped in political intrigue and features strange monsters and magical forces that influence people's lives for the better or worse.  In this world, a sect of mutant warriors called ""witchers"" (or hexers) serve as itinerant monster slayers for hire.  One of these witchers is the famed Geralt of Rivia, also known as the White Wolf.The game picks up shortly after the ending of The Witcher (W1), which showed Geralt of Rivia defending King Foltest of Temeria from a mysterious assassin.  In the aftermath, King Foltest ""orders"" Geralt of Rivia to serve as a glorified bodyguard.  However, a sinister plot by a mysterious faction compels Geralt to search for answers, reacquainting him with certain figures from his past.  Still suffering from amnesia prior to the events of W1, Geralt must regain his memories and find out who is killing the Northern Kingdoms' monarchs.W2 feels fairly shorter in story length than W1.  Nonetheless, the decision-driven storytelling of W2 remains strong, and I found the supporting cast highly memorable.  The game presents almost entirely different story paths which start near the end of Chapter 1 and dramatically change your character's quests and location for the majority of Chapter 2.  The grey morality surrounding monster slaying, philosophical issues, and political matters remains a key aspect of the decision-driven narrative.  The game ends on a bit of a cliffhanger and some plot lines seem unresolved...at least until The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.  Nonetheless, the narrative remains fairly compelling.Finally, the import system is not as comprehensive as in games like Mass Effect 1-3, but some decisions (e.g. decisions on Princess Adda, Siegfried [Order] or Yaevinn [Scoi'atel], and a couple other characters) add/change dialogue options and alter certain NPC interactions.Rating: goodGameplay:The timed attack clicks of W1 have been replaced with a more ""Dark Souls""-esque combat gameplay style (if you want to use that analogy).  Geralt has a basic skill tree alongside three other skill trees for alchemy, swordsmanship, and magic.  I favored a build centered around swordsmanship with some perks in magic, but found most of the alchemy tree useless for this build.  Like in the first game, your character uses two swords: steel for humans, silver for monsters.Enemies can feel RELENTLESS early on.  You may find yourself underleveled at first, but can become a powerhouse of destruction near the end.  This unbalanced difficulty, however, may deter many players.The alchemy system of W2 does away with alcohol bases for potions in W1.  Instead, you simply combine ingredients and voila: a masterpiece.  You must have the necessary ingredients and recipes beforehand from looting and finding merchants.  Meditation is now required to consume potions, but is offset by being able to meditate almost anywhere outside of combat.  In addition, you can utilize bombs, specific sword oils, throwing knives, and traps against your aggressors.As this is a decision-driven story game, dialogue remains key to discovering info and shaping the outcome of the narrative.  You can utilize persuasion/intimidate/axii abilities to steer a conversation to your benefit provided you have the required level for each.  Be mindful that your decisions can have drastic story consequences.  This game does not hold your hand.  You are free to choose the path you believe is right.The game offers several side quests, from contracts to arm wrestling, brawling, and dice poker.  There is no fast travel, so you'll be backtracking a lot to complete these.Rating: goodAudio:I played the game in English since that's my primary language.  W2's voiceacting has certainly improved since the last game and features quality vocal talent for many NPCs.The music is AMAZING.  It is highly atmospheric and more than captures the mood and identity of each area you're in.  Some of the combat music may really get your blood flowing during fights.Rating: excellentGraphics:The game looks gorgeous, especially if you have the hardware to enjoy the lighting FX.  On high graphics settings, the environments and character models are bristling with detail.Rating: excellentOverall: I loved this game, and it certainly improves over some of The Witcher's shortcomings.  My biggest concern was the story, which felt like it was on a slightly smaller scale that that of The Witcher to me.  The cliffhanger ending is an obvious setup for The Witcher 3, but I still felt right at home playing this game. "

												I love this game as much as I love my GF, it's underrated and I regret not playing it on release. It's never too late.+ Simpler, objective combat system as compared to Witcher 1.+ Superb Graphics that make you feel like its a 2013/2014 game+ Skill and problem solving oriented combat+ The true RPG, multiple choices, multiple outcomes and affects how you experience the game. + Dark mode and Insane mode is a good challenge+ Fantastic voice acting and character models+ Extremely re-playable+ Digital porn (Yes girls get naked in this game and you'll be choosing who to skoodilypoop with.)+ Realistic ambiance, Immersive and epic soundtrack/score+ Camera rotation has this blurring effect that makes combat feel even more fast paced than it already is.- Dodge heavy, making it seem like combat is about 80% dodge, 10% hit with a sword and 10% magic usage- Although it has multiple choices, it's still linear in comparison to Skyrim- Limited gear and weapons- For a powerful and legendary Witcher, you'd get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by the smallest things sometimes.- Some choices are instant deathIt's very different from Witcher 1, and I only sunk 3 hours in Witcher 1. Witcher 2, I had my first playthrough and spent 48 hours. I will be going back for more playthroughs for different choices and experience once I complete my other games that are collecting dust. This is the biggest bang for your buck during Steam sales. Trust me.			"

												A good rpg game. Very well made, and thoght out. Is it Skyrim? No. Does it need to be? It never attempeted. This a not so classic rpg in the old school sence. There are no GOOD GUYS and BAD GUYS. There are only sides, ony choices, no one is evil or bad. Just like life. Thats what makes the world and story interesting. It is a novel come to life in video game form. A mature, complicated tale, with ood gameplay to support it.(cause if the gameplay sucked, kinda hard to say its a good game  afterall) .The Witcher 2 is what made me a fan of the seres. Its a bit old school in the sense that it does not hold your hand, which might force you to google a thing or to, but it is well worth it. The action is satisfying, the sound is as it should be. The graphcis are beautiful no matter what generation you are from. No one will say its too ugly to play. Now the only warning i could give is, it is complicated. You need to read up in the journals what happneded before in the world, who hates who and why, and so fourth. It takes dedication. Somethign not every game has. But if you do, grab a sword and go fourth WHITE WOLF.			"

A Paladin’s Review: Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings: Enhanced Edition: It's A Fun Time But....Plough The Lilies. Err, I Mean The Combat.Genre: 3rd Person Western RPG, In-Depth Conversation System with Combat.  Developed & Published by: CD Projekt REDPlatform Support: Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.Business Model: Base GameCopy purchased by myselfRead the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Preamble and DisclosureRPGs are a difficult genre of game to review. With their vast worlds to explore, hours of gameplay that measure into the 50s or 100s for a single run through and each experience guaranteed to be different, well, it can be challenging to say the least. Laying my cards on the table, I played The Witcher 2 at hard difficulty for one playthrough. I did another playthrough at normal difficulty but only got part way through. I believe those two campaigns have given me enough experience to create my thoughts for this review. The Witcher 2 was purchased on Steam by myself, two years ago. Yeah, it has been that long. So, without further ado, I present A Paladin’s Thoughts and Review of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings: Enhanced Edition. 3rd person RPG for Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsOne half of the game is having a lot of long conversations with multiple NPCs. Participating in said conversations allows for world building, acquiring side-quests, trading and/or participate in….distractions.  These are generally well fleshed out conversations and you can skip a lot of lore if you want. There’s also different conversation options that can influence the responses you’ll get. It’s not as black and white as say Mass Effect’s paragon/renegade system. Instead, it generally influences how diplomatically Geralt will approach a situation. You can also use signs or intimidation to influence the conversation to your liking, provided you’ve leveled them up enough. The other half of the game is looting materials & personal possessions from every house, building, cave and castle Geralt can get into. Right from under people’s very noses. It’s insane how often Geralt is able to just steal from nobles or kings. Hehe ok, the actual other half is the combat system. It’s a fast paced hack-and-slash system that tries to encourage tactical and quick thinking as well as planning ahead. While it is possible to avoid some fights, usually by choosing the right response or avoiding a quest altogether, it’s not possible to avoid the majority of it.Story ThoughtsMany of the characters are an unlikable lot. There are very few good guys and Geralt isn’t one of them. It feels like a lot of attention was given to Geralt, Iorveth and Vernon and the rest were mostly regulated to side arcs or doomed to two-dimensionality. Despite TW2’s attempts to subvert tropes, many characters still follow many traditional tropes and stereotypes. After all, it’s kind of hard to find characters surprising when they’re given such obvious names like Dandelion, Triss Merigold or worse: Deathmold. I mean, really? Deathmold was the best name you could up with for an evil villain? Why not just have him give us an over the top laugh when we meet him? It would have been more subtle. Everyone else is pretty easy to figure out once you meet them. They rarely stray from their outward appearance and are largely predictable. There was little attempt to justify some of the heinous acts committed by evil people. They just did it because that’s what the universe expected.The Combat SystemThe combat system seems to be designed for tactical and lethal swordplay. It rewards prepared Witchers and punishes mistakes and overconfidence. Getting yourself surrounded by the enemy will lead to a quick death while setting up traps and oils will result in a lot of dead enemies. It doesn’t help that Geralt is often outnumbered by enemies. So, he’ll need to use all of his kit in each encounter to survive. 1v1 fights are very rare in this game. Though I wish they hadn’t been. While every fight has different enemies and somewhat different attacks, I found that I had to deal with them all in basically the same way. With lots of dancing, rolling and quick poking into enemies when you can. Occasionally using a sign or bomb, hoping all the while that Geralt’s health doesn’t get nicked to death. It’s too repetitive to be ignored and towards the end of the game, well, it’s just a tiresome chore.PC Settings & Port ReportThe Witcher 2 still looks impressive after all these years. There’s a decent amount of variety in locations, character models, rich weapon & armor designs, flora, buildings, you get my point. The realistic style TW2 went for is consistent with nothing looking out of place. However, the cracks are beginning to show and I can’t ignore them. Texture quality is all over the place. Geralt and other main characters can have impressive looking armor or clothing. Take a glancing look at some other people though and you start to see some gnarly texture quality. Heck, there were some textures not far off the beaten path that looked incomplete, missing or bugged out entirely. They seemed to have a hard time keeping a consistent quality at any point, which can pull you out of the world. Worse still is the view-distance. Even at max settings, pop-in is a constant problem. Foliage being the worst offender of popping in right in front of you. Combined with character models sometimes being a bit old looking and I suspect this will lead to problems in the future. That’s if we ignore a number of animation glitches, visual clipping and others. I think that TW2 will start to age just as poorly as the first Witcher has in the coming years. It’s still not a bad looking experience for now, and a lot of these issues aren’t major, but it will add up over time.Final ThoughtsIf you’re up for a fantasy story with a solid adventure, political intrigue and interesting conversations, The Witcher 2 is certainly good for it. However, it comes with some major problems that are hard to ignore. Character’s are often two dimensional. The combat system is overly difficult and punishing even on Normal mode. Not to mention, the difficulty curve can swing wildly from fight-to-fight, especially if you install the combat overhaul mod. I’m finding it harder and harder to recommend story-based games with poor combat systems. I think it’s long overdue that devs pay equal attention to both the story & combat so that each are enjoyable to experience. I give this a very hesitant recommendation. It gets that for what the devs attempted. The Witcher 2 tried to go big and very nearly succeeded. Given more time for polish, I think this truly would have been a remarkable game. For now, it is what it is. Perhaps its sequel will be what The Witcher 2 couldn’t be.Read this Review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]A Paladin's Review: The Witcher (1): Enhanced EditionA Paladin's Review: The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.

I don't like how infinity ward didn't sexualize Geralt enough, why isn't he a Chris Redfield? I just want to see huge meat, infinity ward!!!! gosh!!!!! this game is also hard, which sucks because its targeted for no-life nerds.

Elves too sneaky, they are cowards, they are liers.I just dont like em and i'm found - Witcher 2 game. This is the first game i've played where truth revealed about elves ever.I'm found game scenario quite cool, even for single player its still very nice with Great story line.I've never player Witcher before, but im sure i'll order Witcher 3 for myself. Some stuff is really missing in Witcher 2. You character is unable to jump, swim, make short-cuts.The rest is just - Perfect. Im rating this game with 9/10. Highly recommended.			"

												Hands down the absolute best pure RPG I have ever had the pleasure of playing.Its gorgeous visuals are only exceeded by its deep plot and detail to every facet and aspect of the game.You can see the dedication CD-Projekt Red have put into the game.The combat, the focal weak plague point of every RPG in existence is amiss here, on the contrary it is satisfying with balanced levelling system and chosen skill trees.The ingame choices actually make a difference on how the game plays out especially midway in the game.No quest feels halfassed and each one is fullfilling in its own right.The only way to go is up from here.CD-Projekt Red have outdone themselves each time with every subsequent iterations and I am positive it wont be any different this time with what the already impressive gilmpses we have seen of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thus my mortal spirit is once again ready for CD-PR to awe me all over again with further tales of the White Wolf , The Geralt of Rivia.

												Amazing RPG. Exactly what a sequel should be.Great storyline that reveals as you play through the game and just keeps pulling you in more and more.Beautiful graphics, great voice acting and as usual UNIQUE and AMAZING soundtrack.Combat is refined since the first game and is good enough to provide a challenge but could be better.I reccomend to play the game at Dark or Insane difficulty to get the absolute maximum feeling from it.If you import a save from the first Witcher don't expect to see a lot of the choices made there have some influence here. The game itself has many choice which affect a lot in the game (and except a lot of things to be affected in the Witcher 3) therefore it has replayability value.Overall i recommend this game.

												The Witcher series is an odd one for me. I enjoy the atmosphere, the art, the story telling, the boobs, but I outright hate the combat.  I've tried several times to sit down and go through this game but the clunky combat keeps me from really diving into it. Not this time, though, NOT THIS TIME. I've put my big boy pants on and I'm finally ready to enjoy this Action RPG masterpiece of Gaming known as The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. WIth my hatred for the combat I still have to give this game a two big thumbs up. I see it's often on sale for next to nothing. Go for it. Also, easily still one of the best looking games out there. There seems to be a fair amount of mods for it as well. I came across one that addresses the combat with numerous fixes. So pull your pants down, mod it up and enjoy yourself with some epic Fantasy.

												The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings is an incredible game. It has great graphics, great gameplay, awesome characters and dialogue, a fantastic soundtrack, a fascinating universe and lore, an incredible storyline and the best political intrigue I have ever seen in a video game. It is awesome how the choices you make affect the game and how the branching paths differ from each other, giving you the chance to experience the game's story from two opposite perspectives. The only problems I have with the game are the interface, which is hard to navigate, and the hit detection is kind of weird, but the latter is quite easy to get used to.Overall it is a brilliant game.

Review - The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition""A marvelous adventure RPG that makes you really think of what decision you should make.""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is an Adventure/Action RPG that welcomes the player once again to the world of the witcher, Geralt of Rivia. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition starts off with Geralt being detained in dungeon as he was accused for murder of the Temerian King Foltest. He is then interrogated by Vernon Roche, the leader of the Blue Stripes, to tell his part of the story. After persuading Roche, your adventure then begins.The game has very much improved in terms of graphics and gameplay. The game's environment and atmospehere is so detailed and very engrossing that just removing the minimap can really get you lost (well, unless you have memorized the area). The soundtracks and voice actings are great. Even if you're just performing sidequests, you'll actually feel that those tasks really matter as if it's as important as the main plot of the game.One thing that sets The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings apart from other RPG games is its combat system. Geralt's swordplay is very different and unique. There will be times that hack n' slashing enemies head on could lead to your own demise.As you explore the game's world, you'll eventually come into crossroads of decisions and this is The Witcher series strong-point. Just like in the first game, your decisions really matter and affects the flow of the story, the actual ending of the quest and it even affects how the NPCs react to you. Siding with the humans can lead to elf merchants ignoring you and not giving you the service they provide. The decisions you take can either lead to death, a scar on a relationship, a new item, a battle or even a romance scene with one of the girls, etc. The player's decisions shape what kind of personality you want Geralt to portray whether you want him to be a merciful hero, a seeker of justice or just a plain old witcher doing his job.The game is quite short with having only 3 chapters (4 in all if you include the prologue) but its immense design on each quest makes the game very long. After your first playthrough, it'll make you want to start all over again as you'll wonder what would have happened if I made this decision instead of the other.The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a totally great game that once you finish it, you'll end up looking for more of it. I highly recommend this game to big fans of the Witcher series and to those who really love Action/Adventure RPG games with great story content.Personal Rating:Story/Plot: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Music: 9/10Grapchics: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10			"

												The Witcher 2 stands out for its gorgeous graphics and superlative storytelling. The world you explore is enormous, stunningly rendered (assuming you have a PC powerful enough to handle it), and filled with secrets that players must seek out. Among these secrets are countless side quests that introduce you to memorable personalities and shocking events that help shape Geralt’s personality. Playing the game feels like seeing an adult-oriented fantasy novel spring to life and then stepping into it. Just get this game and enjoy!			"

												The Witcher 2 is a game with memorable characters, beautiful towns and landscapes, and a story filled with political intrigue. It's rare to come across a game with choices which feel impactful while avoiding typical 'black and white' or 'good and evil' situations. What lacks in gameplay is made up through the narrative.The gameplay is sub-par. Geralt of Rivia is equipped with two swords: one for human-slaying and one for monster-slaying. With magic-like abilities called signs to go along with his swordplay, Geralt is a force to be reckoned with. Dodging and parrying are two important aspects of the combat system. Geralt can die in a moment's notice if the player isn't careful, so it's vital to know when to be aggressive or defensive. However, The combat feels sluggish. The tab-targeting feels unresponsive at times, dodging does not always go the way the players want it to, and contact with enemy units does not feel responsive. A huge plus though is the way a player has to prepare for each encounter. Geralt cannot use potions during combat, only when he is meditating, which a player can do at anytime outside of combat. Potions range from boosting his recovery rates to increasing his attributes and resistances. It's a fairly comprehensive system and adds a layer often missing from other games.To level up, the player is given a 'skill tree' to add attribute points to four different categories, each composing of their own active and passive skills: Training, Alchemy, Signs, and Swordsmanship. The leveling up system is not complicated, but the choices you make are important. Geralt can level up to 35, which for example can fill up  the Training Tree and one other. So the player is given the choice of specializing in a certain tree, or become a jack-of-all-trades, balancing their skills points across all areas. It's a simple system which relies on player choice as a main driving force.The story is interesting enough to continue unraveling its many mysteries. Geralt meets friends, foes, and backstabbers along the way. What's great is that each character has a sensible motive to their actions. Voice-acting is great and the writing is well-done. The cutscenes do not offer much in terms of action, but the dialogue options and the strive to know more about the characters is enough to justify the more static encounters. Visually the game is absolutely beautiful. The lighting was and still is the best in the gaming industry. It benefits to take a second and marvel at the scenery surrounding Geralt. The forest around Flotsam, the first town Geralt encounters, is stunning. It helps make the world come alive, and like Mass Effect, creates a very convincing world, as if there's a lot more going on than what Geralt sees in his eyes. The character models, although great, could use some variety. It was common to come across the same character models across various parts of the game.If you are a fan of mature-themed RPG adventure, this game ranks among the best of them. It comes highly recommended.			"

												Beautiful graphics, mature plot, explicit language, nudity & gore are one of the main reasons to play this game. The Witcher triology features a (restricted) induvidual storyline (depending on your decisions/answers), which makes the story even more gripping. Btw, did you know that CD Project didn't know ♥♥♥♥ about codeing/developing videogames like 10 years ago? It's been a long time, and eventually they've learned a lot about their business as you can see in Witcher 2 & 3.			"

												If not for Skyrim this would be the best RPG in the last couple of years. Its Skyrim meets Dark Souls meets Game of Thrones. Hard to not like it if a RPG fan, the world and lore is great, the plots are like an episode of Game of Thrones, and wandering the areas doing side quests is as fresh as going for walk-abouts in Skyrim.Its more linear then other RPGs out there, esp sandbox ones like Elder Scrolls, but does well because of it, theres dozens of choices you make that do actually effect outcomes massively, the whole of ACT II is in a different area and people depending on how you end ACT I for example.Still one of the best looking PC games out there too, get it.(Also has boobs)			"

												The Witcher 2 is a big improvement over The Witcher and that's saying a lot because The Witcher was a really good game!

One of the acts can be played in two different locations depending on your decisions. The game has about sexteen endings, some of them are very different from each other Characters are well developed and are very convincing Cons Some stability issues, game can crash from times to times The are some minor issues with gamepad supportAnd you can get this game for like 2,99€ from times to times (like right now)			"

												I think this game is great and will be even greater if I ever pass chaper 1, act 1.But on Linux (Kubuntu 15.04, Nvidia drivers) it's just unplayable. I cannot recommend this game for any Linux gamer as it is too buggy for now (and I don't think this will change ever).The game begins with a great and epic prologue, telling you what happened after the ending of Witcher 1. The game is far more polished than Witcher 1 with a new fighting system and more variety of weapons and armor.I was only able to play the prologue and the beginning of the first act. With the first act, the bugs begin to appear: Since ever I installed this game (on multiple versions of Linux - upgraded installations, fresh installations, newest drivers, Ubuntu's supported drivers, ...) I am not able to trade anything, resulting in crashes in the trading menu. Sometimes the game still crashes from nowhere.If somebody says: ""Then play it on Windows - dualboot!"" - No - I - won't - dualboot - !What if it would be the opposite direction and somebody tells you to dualboot to Linux to play Witcher 2?Conclusion: Great game, bad port and unplayable.Chance of getting fixed: Almost none			"

												Drawing from it's rich source material the Witcher 2, continues the tale of Geralt of Rivia as he seeks to uncover the truth behind a mysterious group of assassins who are after royal blood. Building on the amazing story which started with the first Witcher game, considered a classic by many, Witcher 2 also improves the experience of being a professional monster-slayer. The combat is challenging and realistic ( no chugging fifty potions in the middle of a fight :P ) and the visuals and voice acting are excellent, and the story as aforementioned is gripping filled with impactful choices, characters that you will grow to love and others whom you'll want to introduce to a witcher's blade.  For those who have played the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and want to immerse yourself more in the witcher world but find the first witcher to have not aged particularly well Witcher 2 Assassins of KIngs is an excellent game detailing Geralt's adventures leading upto the events of Wild Hunt. Overall an amazing RPG and good entry point for those who have never played a Witcher game as well as returning monster-slayers.			"

												The Witcher 2 improves upon the first game in terms of combat, graphics and scale, however the game world is more linear in design and the story is debatably not as compelling as the Witcher 1. The choice and consequence system is brought to a new level here, with one decision changing half of the game entirely. The game has a somewhat darker atmosphere than the first and the soundtrack isn't as memorable. The combat is greatly improved with more options and tactics thanks to the extensive skill tree. Overall, this is a great game and a worthy successor to the first.			"

												A good game, but not a perfect game. The atmosphere, the graphics, the idea behind the game are wonderful.  As are many of the characters, even the character you play is quite amazing himself. It's an immerssive game that captures the player and throws lots of enemies at you and lots of very neat little details. This game, based on the books definately does feel like an RPG. The gameplay is relatively satisfying, with visuals probably outdoing the gameplay itself but they create a very uniqe atmosphere which I prefer to other RPGs.In this game the choices actually do matter, there's quite a few and it's not just black or white (morally speaking). What is also unbelivably suprising about TW2 is that, despite the game coming out in 2011. This game on Ultra looks still up to date as ever, it looks astonishing truely.While this game succeeds in delivering a good RPG experience, there are some issues which don't make it a 10.. - The saving game system is far from perfect, not allowing you to save over games or choose the name of your saves instead every time you save it creates a new save. Doing this can make a huge cluster of saves which freeze your game every time you click load. So you must periodically clean old saves.- 3 big skill trees to pick from but very few skill points make it quite difficult to build the ultimate Witcher. - The game is actually quite short, especially if you don't do the side quests. Of course, after this there is the Witcher 3 which only continues the best kind of fun. The amount of hours I have are not correct, as I tried to play this game before but never completed it so it's more hours than needs be. - The facial animations are subpar, not really great at showing off emotions of the characters.- The combat is unforgiving at the begining, defiantely needs getting used to and remember Space is your friend.

												The Witcher 2 EE is like your neighborhood cougar. A fine woman who's grown wise through her experiences. Seductive in her gaze, can treat you to a good time then read you a bedtime story. (Compares a computer game to an attractive woman.... descending ever deeper and deeper, are we?)Right, Right...... The Witcher 2.An essential chapter in The Witcher video game trilogy. Unlike the original game from 2007, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is an absolute must for those interested in playing it's sequel, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The state of the Northern Realms in the third game is a direct outcome of major events that transpired over the course of Assassins of Kings. The Witcher 2 continues the tale of an amnesia-struck Geralt of Rivia. After foiling an assassination attempt on King Foltest's life, the legendary monster slayer turned royal bodyguard must accompany Temeria's king into battle against traitors of the realm. As stated, a player need not play the original for an enjoyable experience, but for those who prefer complete participation, emotional investment, and absolute understanding of its references and characters, it is advised. Positives:  - Stellar choice-driven narrative. - Immersive gameplay mechanics. - Soundtrack is brilliantly enveloped around a player's every action; electrifying during combat yet sentimental when required. - Believable fictional world brimming with interesting interactable characters. - Stunning visuals. (Dem textures doe!!!!) - Punishing difficulty that forces players to use all the tools at their disposal. - Pixilated tittays! ...in your face literally a few minutes after you start the game.Negatives (More like knit-picks):  - Conversation persists even when paused by the player. - Geralt's Grayish silver hair rather than the lore-appropriate milky white. (Easily corrected with a mod) - Glitch where unlooted items from fallen enemies disappear after reloading a save.  - Geralt's movement constantly interrupted by invisible surfaces belonging to furniture and vegetation. So F*ckn good, y'all don't even know.			"

												I bought this game years ago... when I played it the first time I didn't like it tried another five times still no dice. Now I'm here don't know what changed maybe I just didn't understand it but I'm glad I gave it a shot, better later than never right?So let's get all the good stuff out of the way first, the biggest and greatest change has to be the combat it's fast paced full of action and well it just feels great. The game looks good and has aged well, has a tonne of options to mess with too always a plus. The keyboard and mouse work great but default key binds feel odd and a controller works perfectly. The audio is amazing from the voice acting to the sound effects all the way up to the soundtrack. I would say the game length is good took me roughly about 30-35 hours to complete, there's also a tonne of side quests to do and of course heaps of main quests. The user interface is great with a mouse and keyboard but a bit weird with a controller still works fine though. There's some great game changing choices to be made and that's to be expected from a heavily story driven game. It also comes with a arena mode it's as fun as you'd expect from a survival based mode but it's still a great pass time.Now the bad... first thing I want to get of my chest is the navigation I don't think I have ever played a game with such a detailed but useless map and mini map, I found myself getting lost often because of it. There is no sprinting and at first it's fine but later you'll find yourself pulling out a sword just to dodge everywhere. A downside to the new combat is once you corner a single enemy excluding main bosses they get stuck and can't fight back, small gripe which made it feel cheap. The games pacing feels off most of the time, sometimes it's quick sometimes it's slow other times it's super quick etc it never seemed subtle. There doesn't seem to be enough different armor and weapons to go collect and spend time on, which is fine I suppose but I excepted more. A minor bug I found on dual screens was an invisible second mouse pointer would appear on the second screen hovering over things, not a big deal but annoying.I honestly think the game is great if you are craving a story driven game, it might not appeal to some but it's definitely up there with the Mass Effect series.

												The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings is by far one of the best RPG's ever made.      I will attempt to explain the why in my review. I will cover all levels of thegame, graphics, story, combat etc.      I will start off with the story that is being told. As someone who loves adeep immersive story and world this game is a delight. The characters areall well voiced and feel like they have a lot invested in the world as wellas them not appearing to be cardboard cut outs just conveying the nextplot entry to the player. You have to make choices in the Witcher 2. Whichfor those of you who played the first will find a bit urking if you enjoyed taking the Witcher path (neutrality). However the stakes are greatly raisedin the sequel. The fate of the entire northern realm is being decided and your choices as Geralt will have long term ramifications on the world.      This is the only game I have ever had to sit back, get up out of mychair and weigh the pros and cons of my decision. I have never feltmore invested in a series than the Witcher series. It is such a believable world, so well crafted with so much attention to detail and love it is unmissable. The story is exciting, if it does feel over a bit too soon. Inmy 2nd playthrough I played on normal, did just about everything youcould do with some additional grinding out levels etc and that took meabout 45 hours. Where as my Witcher 1 play through took me 60+. That being said the enhanced edition of the game that I played for thefirst time since the games original launch has added a lot of contentand interesting things that make the game a bit more fleshed out togive players a bit more of a satisfying conclusion leading up to the third game.     The graphics to be honest are still the best we have seen on the PC.I believe that if they released a brand new game (story, combat etc)with the existing engine everyone would still be blown away. The factthat CD Projekt said ""Nah its not good enough"" and created a newengine for the Witcher 3 is insane especially by todays standard oflazy ♥♥♥ developers copy and pastaing as many god damn games asthey can to meet their annual release schedule (♥♥♥♥ you Call of Dutyand Battlefield) is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant market. I boughta 980 superclocked for the Witcher 3, and I can't even run Witcher 2with ubersampling (I don't even think it does anything other than cater to the egos of nerds with quad titan blacks) but other than thatI can ultra this game at 80-100 FPS constantly at 1080p. The gameis absolutely beautiful, the textures the character models. Everythingis picture esque. It is the exact thing we pc gamers love to see. Detail.     Now onto Combat. As a fan of the original games fighting style alaJedi Knight esque ""stances"" combat which I know a lot of people hatebecause it can come down to just button clicking at the right time. Iinitially hated the Witcher 2 combat, it was sluggish and felt ratherconsolized. After 4 years passed I picked the game up again now thatthe enhanced edition has improved combat it feels much more responsive and fun. Even if it still feels to be a bit of a ""Roll fest"". Ido feel that combat still needs improvements to make it more interesting, a hybrid of one and twos combat systems could workout incredibly well and make the game feel unique in its own right. That being said the combat has been improved and I have heardthere are mods that made the combat even better.      I have a lot of love for this game and for this series. I think thatCD Projekt red has proved themselves among the best developersof games to this day. Their mentality is that of the days of old. When people who loved games, made games. It wasn't a dayto day job. It was done with passion and commitment. You can tell CD loves their IP, and their franchise. Their commitmentto their fans has been something truly admirable. They givefree content out that most companies would charge a boat loadfor. Most of you would say ""Well that's nothing special they shoulddo that anyway"" I agree with you in theory but that is not the point. The point is they do not HAVE TO, but they DO. They care about the people who play their games. That is why I love them and am eagerly awaiting The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. This game is a must if you love RPG's. It is an absolute must.9/10 "

It is such a believable world, so well crafted with so much attention to detail and love it is unmissable. The story is exciting, if it does feel over a bit too soon. Inmy 2nd playthrough I played on normal, did just about everything youcould do with some additional grinding out levels etc and that took meabout 45 hours. Where as my Witcher 1 play through took me 60+. That being said the enhanced edition of the game that I played for thefirst time since the games original launch has added a lot of contentand interesting things that make the game a bit more fleshed out togive players a bit more of a satisfying conclusion leading up to the third game.     The graphics to be honest are still the best we have seen on the PC.I believe that if they released a brand new game (story, combat etc)with the existing engine everyone would still be blown away. The factthat CD Projekt said ""Nah its not good enough"" and created a newengine for the Witcher 3 is insane especially by todays standard oflazy ♥♥♥ developers copy and pastaing as many god damn games asthey can to meet their annual release schedule (♥♥♥♥ you Call of Dutyand Battlefield) is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant market. I boughta 980 superclocked for the Witcher 3, and I can't even run Witcher 2with ubersampling (I don't even think it does anything other than cater to the egos of nerds with quad titan blacks) but other than thatI can ultra this game at 80-100 FPS constantly at 1080p. The gameis absolutely beautiful, the textures the character models. Everythingis picture esque. It is the exact thing we pc gamers love to see. Detail.     Now onto Combat. As a fan of the original games fighting style alaJedi Knight esque ""stances"" combat which I know a lot of people hatebecause it can come down to just button clicking at the right time. Iinitially hated the Witcher 2 combat, it was sluggish and felt ratherconsolized. After 4 years passed I picked the game up again now thatthe enhanced edition has improved combat it feels much more responsive and fun. Even if it still feels to be a bit of a ""Roll fest"". Ido feel that combat still needs improvements to make it more interesting, a hybrid of one and twos combat systems could workout incredibly well and make the game feel unique in its own right. That being said the combat has been improved and I have heardthere are mods that made the combat even better.      I have a lot of love for this game and for this series. I think thatCD Projekt red has proved themselves among the best developersof games to this day. Their mentality is that of the days of old. When people who loved games, made games. It wasn't a dayto day job. It was done with passion and commitment. You can tell CD loves their IP, and their franchise. Their commitmentto their fans has been something truly admirable. They givefree content out that most companies would charge a boat loadfor. Most of you would say ""Well that's nothing special they shoulddo that anyway"" I agree with you in theory but that is not the point. The point is they do not HAVE TO, but they DO. They care about the people who play their games. That is why I love them and am eagerly awaiting The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. This game is a must if you love RPG's. It is an absolute must.9/10 "

												The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings is not only one of the finest RPGs but also one of the best games ever made. It boasts an insanely amazing intellectual mature non-linear driven story made by your own choices, and it lives up to it's word. Very well written, memorable characters, some dam amazing dialogue and very well structured. One has to play this at least twice to realize/understand the entire game as every playthrough will have something different to offer. And this is with no doubt THE best looking game out there (until The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt comes out), real feast for the eye.For fans of RPGs and rich complex story telling, this is a must play.My full review: http://expedition-megacosm.blogspot.in/2012/05/witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced.html "

												Drawing from it's rich source material the Witcher 2, continues the tale of Geralt of Rivia as he seeks to uncover the truth behind a mysterious group of assassins who are after royal blood. Building on the amazing story which started with the first Witcher game, considered a classic by many, Witcher 2 also improves the experience of being a professional monster-slayer. The combat is challenging and realistic ( no chugging fifty potions in the middle of a fight :P ) and the visuals and voice acting are excellent, and the story as aforementioned is gripping filled with impactful choices, characters that you will grow to love and others whom you'll want to introduce to a witcher's blade.  For those who have played the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt and want to immerse yourself more in the witcher world but find the first witcher to have not aged particularly well Witcher 2 Assassins of KIngs is an excellent game detailing Geralt's adventures leading upto the events of Wild Hunt. Overall an amazing RPG and good entry point for those who have never played a Witcher game as well as returning monster-slayers.			"

												Although 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings' happens to be my least favourite game in the trilogy, I still found it very enjoyable. It begins with a very exciting introduction, and the new combat system is well-explained in the opening quests. Also rather early in the game we meet the antagonist of 'Assassins of Kings'.My favourite of all the 'Witcher' villains is from this second instalment: Letho of Gulet. Letho is a man of colossal proportions, and matches his incredible power with a sharp, cunning mind. Some of the other characters introduced in this game are also rather memorable, but none so much as Letho. The perfectly written villain is just one element of a very good story.These days, we're all familiar with RPGs offering players a choice. We were also very familiar with this feature five years ago when this game released. Still, none of the games I've played have offered a choice quite as significant as one of the ones presented in this game, in which your selection will change at least 6-8 hours of gameplay.I wish this game had been as open to explore as the other 'Witcher' games, and I think more investment in side quests could have been made. Still, play 'Assassins of Kings' and you'll be signing up for a first-rate fantasy adventure, full of highly entertaining battles and well-written, well-acted characters.			"

												It's a great game.  As in Witcher 1, your choices matter.  When it was released the graphics were next-gen, but it was nearly unplayable on my system due to bugs.  Here we are years later with the Enhanced edition for which I am playing it through a second time, and there are still bugs.  Nothing game breaking, but highly annoying nonetheless.It's still a great RPG with an intriguing story, though I am betting you'd appreciate it more by reading the books, which I have not read.  Gameplay wise, it can sometimes be a little hack and slashy, but on the higher difficulties you're forced to use a bit of strategy; it differs a good bit from Witcher 1 and takes a little getting used to.  If you're an RPG fan it's not one to miss, but you really should play the games in order to know what's going on (I actually like the 1st more than the 2nd in a few ways).			"

												The game's a masterpiece. It's pushing bounderies on how a sword fighting game can be handled. I haven't played another game that so well binds melee fighting with alchemy and sorcery. The three and like the legs of a tripod for successfull advancing in Witcher 2. It's also one of the hardest games out there, mistakes in battle are unforgiving and depending on what choices you make you can have 2 completely different playing experiences. Below are some pros and cons:Pros+ The game is unique in many features.+ You actually need to combine magic, alchemy and fighting to be successful.+ Geralt is more of a brute and not such a playboy as he was in the first game.+ The difficulty of this game is way beyond your usual RPG.+ Water looks the best I’ve seen anywhere in games + Might be the most tactical swordfighting game. Bombs, signs, traps, oils, potions + the right weapon - there's so much to take into account before going to battle.+ Complex and interesting story with memorable characters.Cons- Under Mac the game crashes on reload almost every time. The game crashes a lot under Windows as well but much less than under Mac.- Mac issue: whereas the game doesn’t take that long to load, it takes ages for the load screen to come up.- Poor optimizing of graphics. With max settings the game is an artistic masterpiece, yet it takes a great computer to run full graphics. For some reason Witcher looks a little better in Windows than in Mac. - Looting takes time and precision.- The game get's easier as you play, a lot easier. Also, the gaps between difficulties are extremely jumpy, going fromdying in 10 seconds to not getting a scratch.- The city of Vergen was a navigational nightmare, a maze in it's worst form.- There's a weird delay at the end of the sword swinging move that starts to feel painful in battles, especially when you wanna hit and dodge. Verdict:I highly recommend this game, it's a positive challenge and highly original. There were few things that bugged me, most of them had to do with optimization, but I'm completely ready to forgive them all for the outstanding work of art that was built.			"

Time of completion: ~21 hours (68 days total)Date of writing the review: 22.February.2015Difficulty I played at: Easy (with a little twist, read below for more info)My rating: 7.5/10=====================================My review will be separated into different parts covering the many different aspects of the game. First let me give you my overall opinion and if you want you can read about every small detail about it.This game is great, I loved it. Unfortunately it suffers from many design flaws, which really make your experience frustrating at times. It seems that the developers didn't learn their lesson too well from the previous game's problems. I had to stop playing for about a month because of how the missions were layed out and the unclear mission markers.I played it on EASY difficulty, but only used the armor I imported from my ""The Witcher 1"" save and that armor sucks. I did not use trophies or good trousers or gauntlets. This really gave me a challenge and made the game a lot more enjoyable. Graphics and performance  I played it on a PC with an i7 4770, GTX 770 and 8GB ram on MAX settings. The performance was perfect. Stable 60 fps in every part of the game. It only dipped to 40-45 fps while exiting out of a cutscene, but it wasn't for more than 3 seconds anyway.The loading times are way too long though. The one that really stands out is when you die. After dying it takes a huuuge amout of time for the ""reload"" text to appear, staying in a black screen for more that 10 seconds. That forced me to constantly quick save so I don't die and have to wait for the black screen to disappear, I reloaded the save before the final blow.The graphics at first felt very weird to me. The whole prologue has this yellow overlay and makes the scenery look cartoony and fake. After the prologue is over the graphics look just right. Lots of greenery, beautiful scenery and an amazing view. Story:   I had no trouble understanding the story of ""The Witcher 1"", but this one was too much for me. I found it very difficult to follow. I often asked myself: Why does this guy do this ? Why is this here ? Why can't I just do this instead of this and all our troubles will be gone? The multiple choices were great though because I didn't like certain characters in the game and I wanted to see them suffer. Choosing to kill someone instead of saving them gave me the feel that I am in control of Gerald's life and I am not just there for the ride. This opens up the option to replay the game and have a different experience. I will definitely replay the game again in the future. Combat system A HUGE improvement over the combat system in The Witcher 1 in my opinion. There is just so much more to do than just mashing the left mouse button. You can dodge, parry, set traps, use mutagens to increase your abilities, meditate to drink potions and more. Unfortunately some of these options are completely unnecessary. I never once used a trap and never threw a dagger at someone's face.The meditation system is terribly implemented. In order to drink a potion (something which will decide the outcome of the battle) you have to meditate. You can only meditate before a battle and not during it. Then how the hell am I supposed to know when exactly a battle is gonna start ? How can I know when to prepare ? I know it looks more realistic this way, but in my opinion the game suffers because of it. This forced me to constantly quicksave after moving 20 meters because I didn't know when a battle wound start. Controls: The controls are not bad, what annoys me is that one key is used for so many actions. For instance the left mouse button is used to: attack, put out fires, jump down, climb up, talk, open doors and pick up items. I play on a PC, I should have the option to choose, not to have everything on the same key. I often picked up items I didn't want instead of opening a door, or climbed down a ledge instead of picking up an item. This adds to the frustration I mentioned earlier. Freedom: ... or the lack there of. There is not much freedom in movement. The Witcher 1 suffered from this too. The world is big, but it doesn't feel big at all. There is a pre-determined path you have to walk on. What if I want to go behind this house, or go and see this bush up close ? I can't. The world is very limited in terms of where you can go. Another thing is the ledges. I can't jump down from a half a meter tall ledge without clicking the left mouse button and waiting for Gerald to align himself to the exact spot where he can jump down and wait for an animation. I cannot just jump down from anywhere, no, I have to find the ledge where it says: jump down and then click on it. both TW1 and TW2 suffer from this and really slow down the game play a lot. Speaking of that... Gameplay: This is a story-driven game and unfortunately the gameplay will be constantly interrupted by a cutscene. I swear the cutscenes are so abundant that you can't walk 50 meters before being interrupted by a villager or a dwarf wanting to arm wrestle me. Not much gameplay to be had here. Fortunately the battles and especially the boss battles are very well made and some take a long time to complete without an interruption. Length: I was really surprised by how short the game felt. That must be because about 40% of the game is cutscenes or dialogue. If felt really short. Even after replaying the first 2 hours, starting from scratch, completing the game, spending an hour or 2 on arena mode, the game still felt very short for some reason. I mean it's 2 times shorter than The Witcher 1 and that game did not have so many cutscenes. ( 39 hours in TW1, 21 hours in TW2). Side missions: While the first game had very lengthy side mission, which made sence and gave you great benefits after completing them, this one  has none of that. Most (maybe 80%) of the side missions consist of: kill X number of enemies in this area and bring me proof, or win X number of arm wrestling contests, or win X number of dice poker games. Speaking of which, dice poker was my favorite distraction in TW1, in this one the dice are way too dark and hard to see, the symbols on them are almost identical, so I avoided playing it, that's unfortunate because I really loved that mini-game in TW1. Other small nit-picky things, which didn't fit anywhere else: + Boobs: You will see boobs, lots and lots of boobs. You will see and touch at least 5 pairs of boobs, if you search for them, you might get to see even 10 pairs.- Mission markers: Very difficult to determine where exactly they are. Often you will be standing on one, only to figure out that it is several floors below you. Now you have to find another way to get to it. Even games from 2002 had mission markers that indicated if the objective is above of below you and actually made sense (GTA Vice City)- Vergen: There is this city in Chapter 2 that has the worst layout ever. I am willing to bet that about an hour and a half of my playtime was spent trying to figure out how to get to a lower lever or find where exactly the mission marker is located. This chapter made me stop playing for about a month because of how annoying the layout of the city was.=================================================There is more to talk about, but I will leave it here because I ran out of characters. If you have questions then ask away, I will answer everybody. That's it for the review, I recommend the game, I paid 4 euro for it on the summer sale, but would not buy it for full price. The game definitely does not deserve the ""best RPG ever"" award and does not even come close to it. It is highly overrated and does not deserve a score higher than 7.5/10.Please play The Witcher 1 first, it was incredible and this one is a downgrade from the original.			"

												An excellent rpg with great soundtrack and dark humour where your choices does make a difference. The game has pretty interesting lore. I suggest you play the first game or read the books to have a better understanding of the story. The graphics were pretty good for an 2012 game. I find that their dialogues can be quite humourous at times. Be warned however, as this game's combat system punishes those who rush into the fight without preparation. Use everything in your arsenal including potions, spells, equipments and buffs to fight your enemies. The only problem with this game is that it always crashes when you have a lot of saves. All in all, I'd give it a solid 9/10.Glad I spent money on such a dedicated team. Look up CD PROJEKT ;)			"

Or you know, I guess you could also not click it, that's cool. You know, you could just go about your life not playing a game that was actually developed for the personal computer platform which is built upon the best graphics engine to grace the industry, you could also not experience a game that treats you like a grown adult rather than an imbecile. It would also be completely fine that you wouldn't want to support a game that has improved virtually every single component from the first game which won countless awards and won the hearts and minds of the computer role-playing populous. Yeah, I bet you'd feel like a cool guy.			"

Amazing story (follow-up to The Witcher 1 in some ways but with a few new twists in the plot), awesome gameplay and really memorable characters. Keep in mind that the game has a bit of a ""steep"" learning curve when it comes to the combat mechanics. You really need to kind of ""study"" and pay attention to your enemies' moves/patterns (sort of like Dark Souls but not near as difficult) because you die pretty quickly, even on Normal difficulty.You need to get this game, even if you don't like RPGs, just the story itself is so compelling that you will have the desire to finish the game just to see how it unfolds. Buy it. Buy it. Buy it.			"

												This game is about our beloved witcher, Geralt of Rivia. Join him on an epic journey to clean his name and help the kingdom from falling apart. This is a game where your choices will have some affect on the later parts of the game. The games about The Witcher are very story-driven, so I would recommend you to read or play through the first ""The Witcher"". The combat is fun, and not only Hack and Slash, so it is challenging, and after some fights you will need to combine attacks with potions, poisons and Signs, magic spells Witchers use. The story is great, and after a while you will find out that Geralt is a character with great depth and a incredible backstory. If you want a monsterslaying game, a game with good story and atmosphere or just a game with good combat, this game is for you.			"

												Honestly im torn on the witcher 2, one the first hand it has so many improvements to the first game. On the other the story ending seems extremely rushed, a 4th act would have made this from a great game to an instant classic.The story continue to be amazing however the use of ""ploughing"" nagged me something awfull.The Combat is by far the best of all 3 games, being challeging and so bloody rewarding that forced me to change style multiple times in the game in order to become just that little bit more effective which makes it even more rewarding when beating each challenge that geralt faces. The first and epsecially the third games don´t do this to nearly as great an effect imo.The alchemy system is not nearly as good imo with potions and especially oil lasting wayyy to short cause of a bloody upgrade tree :< i will take my aard and igni upgrades thank yougrachics are still extremely good even 4 years down the line however it seems that cd-red took of bit more than they could chew with quite the few grapichs glitches even in the ""enhanced edition"" Which just leaves me with my biggest complaint! Since i don´t want to spoil the story i will just say the ending(s) feel super rushed and it´s just one gaint infodump that leads up to a gaint war that in the witcher 3 isn´t played up nearly as much making it super anti-climatic. Also as i said the game really could have gone with a 4th act as the games ending again feels aprupt.Note: if all you want is the sex scenes, youtube it cause its just the most awkward thing to watch 3d models rub against eachother-.-Note 2: this game is quite a bit shorter than the witcher 1 and 3 as seen here:Witcher 1: 50 hours (50% of sidequests)Witcher 2: 30 hours (about 60-70% sidequests)Witcher 3: err im at 182 hours atm and i think at 100% (this game is soo ♥♥♥♥ing good)Lets grade it:Story: B+Combat: A+Graphics: BValue for money (19.99 euro): AOverall Grade: A (Must buy)			"

												Witcher 2's great in all fronts, graphics, gameplay, story, lore, charecters and so on. The action-RPG's a unique one, having been developed by CDProjekt Red, a Polish dev company bringing us a real prideful offering as to how a western action-RPG presents itself on the global stage. Unique in what regards?Positive:W2 has plenty of choices in the story arc, even outside the main forks in the road such as Roche's path, or Iorveth's path, there's certianly multiple ways to handel meeting up with bosses, and other key plot points. There's ways to close/not initiate certian mission b/c of xyz, so I sugest watching the ""Changing Locations"" vid from the devs on the multiple stories. W2 is indeed practically 1.5 games in 1.  The dialogue trees fill a convergence in the emersiveness and gets away with some pecilular takes on the cast's rogueish attitudes, Geralt picking up on chicks, the dice minigame, midevil slang, such as bugger, wh0r3son, ba$tard, all terms you don't really hear in the modern Americas, but used in Scottland, the UK, and such, however b/c this is a myere'd and dark time, synergysticaly it all plays to the story. Negative:The combat can be handled via simple mash to progress, however if you get into the rolling and dodgeing, you can fine tune your fighting tactics. Geralt's the archetypical battlemage w/ rather straightforward skilltrees for wizardry, and alchemy, however his swordplay and dodgeing whilst in combat are his coup de' grass. The skilltree progressions are linear, un-complicated, and arguabley a bit of a toss. Wizardy allows you to throw spells at a one shot per meter rate in battle, giving enemies status effects such as catching fire, while the alchemy tree has you crafting interesting potions that, unfortunately, can only be used just before the battle commences. The weapon/armor progression system's unique in an unfavorable way in regards to the story's tendancy to branch meaning you can miss a NPC needed that would have given you quests, or items, or even find yourself in custody, or in a dundgeon, and if you didn't explore it just right, you will lose your confiscated gear.W2's submenu's and UI are still difficult to nagivage, and aren't user friendly, however they're mods to it.Witcher 2 has a modding community as well, w/ game dev's even adding to the combat w/ advances from Witcher 3.

												I understand why people love this game—I get it, it has fantastic graphics, a great story, wonderful music and characters—so much to love. But what in the liviing hell is up with the terrible menus and AWFUL controls?! ""Oh, I see I'm surrounded, better roll around and make sure to attack in the direction I'm facing""*Geralt attacks blindly in opposite direction while getting hacked in the backWhy can I not look at the key bindings in-game?Why can I not adjust the graphic settings in-game?Why does Geralt REFUSE to attack the guy with the shield who is on his &$#*ing KNEES?! He's right there, Geralt, it doesn't take a #$*ing witcher to NOT swing your bloody sword over his head, or for some unknown ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason turn your back to him while attacking in the general direction of the camera.I want to love this game. I love everything else about it. But without something resembling competent gameplay, a game is NOTHING to me. If the gameplay and UI were any clunkier, it would a box of rocks (that you pick up with the same button as attack, because yes, the gameplay here makes THAT little sense).This game isn't hard (I think I'm one of the few people who thought Dark Souls 2 was too easy), but I feel like I'm being punished by simply playing the game.What a massive dissapointment.**I am still going to try to get into this game (again), and if my opinion changes I'll update, but this is now my third time, and I still hate the combat in this game.

												The Witcher 2 is not an RPG for the faint of heart. It will NOT cater to your needs - do not expect it to be easy, or lighthearted, or something to play when you have nothing better to do. It expects you to be Geralt of Rivia, the world's greatest witcher, and you WILL be him or GAME OVER trying. My advice: get a week's supply of popcorn and coke, lock the door to your room to keep out everyone in order to be able to get absolute peace and quiet, and press the PLAY button and disconnect yourself altogether from real life. Allow the living, mysterious world of Andrzej Sapkowski's work to devour you, wasting innumerable hours of your time. The story is incredibly well-written: only in this game is a character who barely survives half the act portrayed as few companies manage to portray characters in a whole frickin' game's plotline. Become the Witcher: it certainly couldn't be simpler.			"

												I was on a fence about Witcher 2 for a long time, because I didn't like game mechanics of first game at all. But curiosity and steam summer sale convinced me to try.Now I lost my sense of time, the game is a blackhole. I mean, really. On par with DA, ME, TESV.Story is overwhelmingly captivating (I wonder if witcher saga author himself had his hand in it).The game looks incredible (especially for 3 year-old title).And here's a little checklist to grab:Elves, dwarves, magic users, dungeons and dragons. Check.Realistic and ever-changing world, resembling middle-ages europe. Check.Political intrigues, plots and coups. Check.Tough choices, moral crossroads. Check.Visceral, really fun combat (unlike 1st game). Check.Bar brawls, brothels, arm wrestling, dice poker. Check.Racist insurgents, spy wenches, infamous special forces unit. Check.Drunkard troll. Check.So? Do I have to say more? Grab the ploughin' game and go play it!			"

												Before we proceed, understand that I actually like the gameplay in The Witcher 2. In fact, it's exceptional. Combat is easy to play yet hard to master – an elusive quality in action RPG combat mechanics – with plenty of difficulty and interesting combat scenarios. By the end of the incredibly well put-together tutorial, you'll feel like you honestly participated in medieval siege. A rich and complex crafting system underpins plenty of gameplay interactions and makes many of the incidental bits of junk you collect through the game have real value. And on top of all of this, The Witcher 2 is one of those rare RPGs that flirts with having real consequence to player decisions throughout the dialogue.Thus, I feel I have to give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings a good review score; by every objective standard of game design, development, and production values, it is an excellent game. I cannot recommend it unreservedly, however, as a few things about the game never quite clicked into place for me. I found myself, at the end of it, more stricken by some of the evident gaps in story and gameplay direction than enthusiastic for the inevitable sequel that, presumably, will tie together the numerous loose ends of the storyline.The first Witcher was a game that I had a very hard time playing through. On the one hand, I loved the writing and variety of choice available throughout the dialogue and intrigue portions of the game; on the other hand, most of the momentary gameplay was painfully overcomplicated and obtuse. Any game requiring that I explicitly enter combat mode and then explicitly choose a stance before I can start wailing on dudes loses points in my book. The Witcher 2 eschews many of the more glaring flaws of the original game—a more streamlined UI, a closer camera so you can really see what's going on, and a combat system that emphasizes skill are all welcome additions to the series.There are some distinct flaws in the gameplay, though nothing major. The first and most obvious one is how side quest objectives are communicated. The Witcher 2 has joined the slew of recent games that basically lead you through the objectives to complete side quests (and, actually, main quests) by hand. While I have some objections to that in general, my complaint in this case is more about some of the little gaffes in how that's presented.The next major flaw in the gameplay is that autosaving is used in the game, but not always in intelligent ways. At some boss fights, the game will autosave right before the big introduction cut-scene of the boss. This makes sense if you walk away from the game for a few days after dying to the monster once; but if you're like me, and try again... several times... then needing to blunder through the cut-scene time and again becomes a real nuisance.The third major flaw is that there are unique gameplay modes – such as stealth – which will activate contextually, but you are explicitly told to enter them. Since the game decides when you enter into the mode, why are you telling me to go into the mode? What button is that? Not a big deal by any means, but a little irritation all the same.Graphically and aurally, the Witcher 2 is a very well put-together game. Lush visuals, fantastic texture work, great visual effects, and clear iconography keep the game attractive. The music is, by and large, very fitting, and the sound design tactfully places you in the middle of the events of the game. Lots of nice little touches – folks chopping away at wood in a little village, the crumbling of nearby rocks as you climb down a cliff face, or the occasional snap of twigs as you tromp through the forest – pop out of the speakers regularly. Voice acting is also quite good. I think I take the most issue with the writing and character design. By and large, the Witcher series has a very dim view of most people. Just about everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in The Witcher 2; even Geralt's sorceress girlfriend, the character who the writers tried hardest to make sympathetic, comes off as a catty, jealous ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. It's not that I believe people are always nice and friendly, but when there's not a single decent person to talk to, it gets hard to take any of the characters seriously.The other side of this is that some of the best written, most charismatic and genuinely fun characters to be around don't last terribly long. This is made abundantly clear by the end of the tutorial. Apparently in Witcher world, fun people aren't fit to live.By the end of the game, I found myself left with a distinctly ashen taste in my mouth; the victories are left hollow and incomplete. Partially because the ending doesn't fully resolve the numerous sub-plots of the game, but also because the storyline felt arbitrary and disconnected. The Witcher's style – weirdly dark and artificially edgy, especially for a fantasy title – creates disjointed storylines that, even when the promised ending occurs, are a letdown.I also might mention that The Witcher 2 represents a... particular view of women. If you are comfortable seeing women portrayed as little more than ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥, then this is the game for you! If, on the other hand, you find the lack of strong female characters in games to be irritating, then this really isn't for you. Triss and Ves, two of the notable female characters of the game, don't count, by the way; both spend most of their screen-time in form-fitting outfits, prancing their overly shapely asses about the focus point of the camera and generally requiring Geralt's manly help to accomplish much of anything.Despite all the little flaws and caveats, The Witcher 2 is, ultimately, a fantastic game; any fan of darker, more consequentialist fiction will find themselves right at home. Nevertheless, those of you looking for something more upbeat, more uplifting – and frankly, less draining to play – will want to look elsewhere. The Witcher 2 is bittersweet.			"

												It's certainly a Badass Action/RPG but considering it's a Sequel, I gotta compare it to the original. 7/10 as a Sequel - 8 or 9/10 if it were an original IP.-Can't stumble around drunk.-No nude cards.-No Sky! Big deal for me. I want stars and ♥♥♥♥. There are some...clouds...I guess...sorta?-Boring companions. At first I was hype to see Dandilion and the Dwarf, but they end up just hanging around not saying ♥♥♥♥. You interacted a lot more with your homies in TW1 and there was some funny stuff, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Voice Acting aside/included.-Crazy bad texture pop-in. Still one of the best looking games around, but the pop-in nearly ruins it.-Dice board isn't as pretty. Just a nitpick, and obviously just my opinion.The main thing that made The Witcher 1 an incredible game was an actual sense of being a Monster Hunter. TW2 does a good job in many ways, but not in the one that I think was most effective.Money. The struggle is real in TW1. You NEED to go hunt down x Monster to make that cash. You need to bar fight and play Dice sometimes. I always really felt like I was truly hunting monsters as a profession, because I -had- to do what I could to make scratch.The other element in TW1 is just being a Witcher in general...potions. I had to max the difficulty of course but, drinking potions and using spells was a huge deal in TW1. Before you enter a cave, you make sure you're set with potions. You take a moment to prepare and drink up before going in. It mattered. At first I thought it was lame. He felt weak, and it seemed pathetic that he needed potions to even fight. But, I adjusted to the fact that he's a ""Witcher"" and that's how they roll, because normal people can't even drink the potions without damn near dying. I mean, I'm sure he can whoop anybody's ♥♥♥ without the potions, but these are monsters. It made sense when I really thought about it, and added to the strategy.Combat too..not everyone agrees but I thought combat in TW1 was sick as ♥♥♥♥. Loved the stances.Game just had this ""vibe"" that you can't really put into words as well. Thank you for reading my TL:DR TW1 review.			"

												My favorite RPG of all time, The Witcher 2 continues the story of Geralt of Rivia. Very adult, shocking at times, gory and with a genuinely interesting storyline as it is based off of the Polish novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. This is not Skyrim, where your decisions are very clear cut to be ""good"" or ""bad"". Or Mass Effect, where you are graded on a light or dark scale depending on the moral direction of your decisions. The decisions you are presented with are a series of grays, that you have to evaluate in the moment for not only the manipulation of the kingdom, but also personal gain and survival. Oh, did I mention that some of those decisions you have to make within seconds of being presented them?! No waiting around, researching which story arc you close or open depending on the decision... You have 3 seconds, and you have to deal with the consequences. The world actually reflects a bit of the Game of Thrones attitude... The good guys don't always win.The world itself is full of political intrigue, racism towards elves and dwarves, and tensions between the kings ruling throughout the region. The world, though it can be gorgeous... Reflects this downtrodden atmosphere, and gives a very midieval ""grunge"" to everything. The graphics themselves are incredible, assuming you have the system for it, and have more ""weight"" to the textures and character models than I've experienced in some time. The last time I felt this kind of wow factor it was playing the original Gears of War back in 2006, my first real experience with Unreal Engine 3. The combat doesn't babysit you, and if you choose not to use magic or potions you won't last long. There are various oils and gems you can augment weapons with for extra damage, potions you can consume for more resistance to a type of magic or poison, and others yet that help aid your sight in the dark depending on the mission or quest at hand. It includes an alchemy section, wherein you can craft your own potions from herbs and ingrediants you pick up through the game, as well as a very satisfying skill/ability tree that you expand upon throughout the game.All in all, HIGHLY recommended if you can get past the difficulty.

Allow the living, mysterious world of Andrzej Sapkowski's work to devour you, wasting innumerable hours of your time. The story is incredibly well-written: only in this game is a character who barely survives half the act portrayed as few companies manage to portray characters in a whole frickin' game's plotline. Become the Witcher: it certainly couldn't be simpler.			"

												Before we proceed, understand that I actually like the gameplay in The Witcher 2. In fact, it's exceptional. Combat is easy to play yet hard to master – an elusive quality in action RPG combat mechanics – with plenty of difficulty and interesting combat scenarios. By the end of the incredibly well put-together tutorial, you'll feel like you honestly participated in medieval siege. A rich and complex crafting system underpins plenty of gameplay interactions and makes many of the incidental bits of junk you collect through the game have real value. And on top of all of this, The Witcher 2 is one of those rare RPGs that flirts with having real consequence to player decisions throughout the dialogue.Thus, I feel I have to give The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings a good review score; by every objective standard of game design, development, and production values, it is an excellent game. I cannot recommend it unreservedly, however, as a few things about the game never quite clicked into place for me. I found myself, at the end of it, more stricken by some of the evident gaps in story and gameplay direction than enthusiastic for the inevitable sequel that, presumably, will tie together the numerous loose ends of the storyline.The first Witcher was a game that I had a very hard time playing through. On the one hand, I loved the writing and variety of choice available throughout the dialogue and intrigue portions of the game; on the other hand, most of the momentary gameplay was painfully overcomplicated and obtuse. Any game requiring that I explicitly enter combat mode and then explicitly choose a stance before I can start wailing on dudes loses points in my book. The Witcher 2 eschews many of the more glaring flaws of the original game—a more streamlined UI, a closer camera so you can really see what's going on, and a combat system that emphasizes skill are all welcome additions to the series.There are some distinct flaws in the gameplay, though nothing major. The first and most obvious one is how side quest objectives are communicated. The Witcher 2 has joined the slew of recent games that basically lead you through the objectives to complete side quests (and, actually, main quests) by hand. While I have some objections to that in general, my complaint in this case is more about some of the little gaffes in how that's presented.The next major flaw in the gameplay is that autosaving is used in the game, but not always in intelligent ways. At some boss fights, the game will autosave right before the big introduction cut-scene of the boss. This makes sense if you walk away from the game for a few days after dying to the monster once; but if you're like me, and try again... several times... then needing to blunder through the cut-scene time and again becomes a real nuisance.The third major flaw is that there are unique gameplay modes – such as stealth – which will activate contextually, but you are explicitly told to enter them. Since the game decides when you enter into the mode, why are you telling me to go into the mode? What button is that? Not a big deal by any means, but a little irritation all the same.Graphically and aurally, the Witcher 2 is a very well put-together game. Lush visuals, fantastic texture work, great visual effects, and clear iconography keep the game attractive. The music is, by and large, very fitting, and the sound design tactfully places you in the middle of the events of the game. Lots of nice little touches – folks chopping away at wood in a little village, the crumbling of nearby rocks as you climb down a cliff face, or the occasional snap of twigs as you tromp through the forest – pop out of the speakers regularly. Voice acting is also quite good. I think I take the most issue with the writing and character design. By and large, the Witcher series has a very dim view of most people. Just about everyone is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in The Witcher 2; even Geralt's sorceress girlfriend, the character who the writers tried hardest to make sympathetic, comes off as a catty, jealous ♥♥♥♥♥ at times. It's not that I believe people are always nice and friendly, but when there's not a single decent person to talk to, it gets hard to take any of the characters seriously.The other side of this is that some of the best written, most charismatic and genuinely fun characters to be around don't last terribly long. This is made abundantly clear by the end of the tutorial. Apparently in Witcher world, fun people aren't fit to live.By the end of the game, I found myself left with a distinctly ashen taste in my mouth; the victories are left hollow and incomplete. Partially because the ending doesn't fully resolve the numerous sub-plots of the game, but also because the storyline felt arbitrary and disconnected. The Witcher's style – weirdly dark and artificially edgy, especially for a fantasy title – creates disjointed storylines that, even when the promised ending occurs, are a letdown.I also might mention that The Witcher 2 represents a... particular view of women. If you are comfortable seeing women portrayed as little more than ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥, then this is the game for you! If, on the other hand, you find the lack of strong female characters in games to be irritating, then this really isn't for you. Triss and Ves, two of the notable female characters of the game, don't count, by the way; both spend most of their screen-time in form-fitting outfits, prancing their overly shapely asses about the focus point of the camera and generally requiring Geralt's manly help to accomplish much of anything.Despite all the little flaws and caveats, The Witcher 2 is, ultimately, a fantastic game; any fan of darker, more consequentialist fiction will find themselves right at home. Nevertheless, those of you looking for something more upbeat, more uplifting – and frankly, less draining to play – will want to look elsewhere. The Witcher 2 is bittersweet.			"

												It's certainly a Badass Action/RPG but considering it's a Sequel, I gotta compare it to the original. 7/10 as a Sequel - 8 or 9/10 if it were an original IP.-Can't stumble around drunk.-No nude cards.-No Sky! Big deal for me. I want stars and ♥♥♥♥. There are some...clouds...I guess...sorta?-Boring companions. At first I was hype to see Dandilion and the Dwarf, but they end up just hanging around not saying ♥♥♥♥. You interacted a lot more with your homies in TW1 and there was some funny stuff, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Voice Acting aside/included.-Crazy bad texture pop-in. Still one of the best looking games around, but the pop-in nearly ruins it.-Dice board isn't as pretty. Just a nitpick, and obviously just my opinion.The main thing that made The Witcher 1 an incredible game was an actual sense of being a Monster Hunter. TW2 does a good job in many ways, but not in the one that I think was most effective.Money. The struggle is real in TW1. You NEED to go hunt down x Monster to make that cash. You need to bar fight and play Dice sometimes. I always really felt like I was truly hunting monsters as a profession, because I -had- to do what I could to make scratch.The other element in TW1 is just being a Witcher in general...potions. I had to max the difficulty of course but, drinking potions and using spells was a huge deal in TW1. Before you enter a cave, you make sure you're set with potions. You take a moment to prepare and drink up before going in. It mattered. At first I thought it was lame. He felt weak, and it seemed pathetic that he needed potions to even fight. But, I adjusted to the fact that he's a ""Witcher"" and that's how they roll, because normal people can't even drink the potions without damn near dying. I mean, I'm sure he can whoop anybody's ♥♥♥ without the potions, but these are monsters. It made sense when I really thought about it, and added to the strategy.Combat too..not everyone agrees but I thought combat in TW1 was sick as ♥♥♥♥. Loved the stances.Game just had this ""vibe"" that you can't really put into words as well. Thank you for reading my TL:DR TW1 review.			"

												Unique and rewarding experience since I played it on Dark mode strait away.Armed with patience finished a game in about 50 h (all quests done going Roche's path) .Used the combination of swordsmanship tree and magic tree.Prepare to die a lot until you learn the mechanics of the fighting and using oil's, potion's and skill's.Great story and lore (reading the books optional :)) maybe a bit too much politics unlike the first Witcher game.All in all one of my favorite games all time for this genre, I recommend playing the first game which is a little dated by now but equally good and fun. With the release of Witcher 3 this trilogy should become one of the masterpieces of gaming industry. Recommend highly for anyone looking for a great action role-playing game.

												I was a big fan of the first one, despite it seeming a little old school. It had a rich story, and the choice and consequence system gave it a depth and replay value not unlike Mass Effect. This one, the combat got upgraded to be more action paced, which was VERY nice. Everything awesome about the first one has been continued or improved with the small exception of potions/alchemy. There are some features they took out from the Witcher 1 to Witcher 2, but you learn to get past it. This game feels a little shorter, but a little better paced, especially if trying to be a completionist. I have unlocked every achievement on this game and there is no sweeter feeling than earning Madman! The way the story unfolds gives this game just as much if not more replay value than its predecessor and should prompt anyone to be excited for the upcoming third installment! This is a great game in a great series!			"

But curiosity and steam summer sale convinced me to try.Now I lost my sense of time, the game is a blackhole. I mean, really. On par with DA, ME, TESV.Story is overwhelmingly captivating (I wonder if witcher saga author himself had his hand in it).The game looks incredible (especially for 3 year-old title).And here's a little checklist to grab:Elves, dwarves, magic users, dungeons and dragons. Check.Realistic and ever-changing world, resembling middle-ages europe. Check.Political intrigues, plots and coups. Check.Tough choices, moral crossroads. Check.Visceral, really fun combat (unlike 1st game). Check.Bar brawls, brothels, arm wrestling, dice poker. Check.Racist insurgents, spy wenches, infamous special forces unit. Check.Drunkard troll. Check.So? Do I have to say more? Grab the ploughin' game and go play it!			"

												TLDR:-This game is phenominal, buy it.Long Version:My first experience with The Witcher was the third game. I decided to play through the first two for background then the third one again. I expected the first two games to be a drag, especially after being spoiled by the graphics and gameplay of The Witcher 3. I was pleasantly surpised, to the point that I decided to restart the first game after skipping most of the side quests in the first two chapters. I also decided to read the novels and short stories to gain a greater understanding of the characters and story in the games. I am extremely glad I did. Not only do they obviously give you a much greater understanding of the aforementioned elements, but they are also phenomenal stories by themselves. This game has stood the test of time surprisingly well, and is definitely worth your money, even at full price, though, if you are willing to wait, you could get it much cheaper on sale, as I did.

												PC conf : Core i7 / 8 GO Ram / GTX 560. Running smoothly at full settings EXCEPT UBER SAMPLING.I 100%d this game (yes I did the insane mode thingy I have no life) so you may guess I quite liked it.The Witcher 2 is sequel to The Witcher (which is actually a really boring game in which developpers took too many risks that didn't really pay off ; and I wouldn't recommend you to buy it). You are Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher (some kind of Mutant with magical powers and high sword mastery) and you have friends (!!) that follow you in your quest, aka regain your memory.What is a Witcher :

			Views: 0		

			The video presents the history of the legendary class of monster slayers known as the witchers from the upcoming action RPG, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition.		

At the end of The Witcher, Geralt saves King Foltest from another witcher's assassination attemp and afterwards Foltest asks him to join and protect him. At the beginning of The Witcher 2, Foltest does die and Geralt is somehow accused by the entire realm. His quest will then be to find the real assassin and to burnish his acts. So despite his notorious ""neutrality"" the famed witcher Geralt will be forced to make alliances and choices that will define his story and most importantly the story of the world around him.And this is what I enjoyed the most in The Witcher 2 : its non-linearity that makes it highly replayable. I'm not spoiling anything but in chapter 1 you are given the opportunity to make a choice that will COMPLETELY CHANGE THE GAME (I'm talking WHOLE DIFFERENTS AREAS AND QUESTS !) ; so when you buy this game it's like you're buying not just one but 2 or 3 games, son ! And the quests are really attracting in the sense that you will really want to do that sidequest because it's fun and well designed... and you need money to stop dying in two hits with your naked butt.Let's talk about the character and the lore : The Witcher's universe is a very dense and complex universe, hence you should feel free to have the wiki open next to you when you play the game (of course making sure you don't spoil yourself too much) to make sure that you can enjoy every bit of this complex universe and not just give up because ""♥♥♥♥ it, the story is too complicated and what the ♥♥♥♥ is that amnesia people are all talking about"".Characters in the Witcher are designed so that they are all different, all have political implications and are memorable thanks to their design, agressivity, sexual orientation/relationships with the hero since The Witcher 2 is a mature game (sex boys !) ; or whatever... The graphics and level of details given throughout the entire game also helps a lot with this (yeah the game is one of the best-looking thing ever designed and I hope you upgrade your PC or it could have a bad time).The universe in which you play in is pretty big although it is far from being any kind of open world. The developpers focused on bringing some kind of ""medieval reality"" back to life. Reality is something important in The Witcher and you will have to deal with both small fighting areas and huge lands.Fighting and the combat system may give you a hard time at first (do not hesitate to change the difficulty level to easy if you're more of a casual player and difficulty prevents you from enjoying the game), but I hope that like me you will feel like it's one of the best and realistic combat systems ever designed : Geralt isn't immortal, he dies fast, however he can roll like a car tyre. If you are really having a hard time in the early stages then don't give up and let me tell you that the game becomes easier as Geralt levels up (which goes really fast with the main quest, and there is a max level of 35).Hardcore gamers rejoice, Dark Mode is here for you. Get ready to cry if you do it on your first playthrough.The Witcher 2 is unique and I deeply thing any kind of player can enjoy it in some way, probably the best RPG of its generation, I found the story much more compelling than Skyrim and have to go with the10/10, must play and precommand The Witcher 3 !

												A lot can be said about this game. It has its great moments, but also some very lame sides. First, the positive things about this game: It is a nicely done rpg with lots of costumization possibilities. You can not travel between cities and have to follow the plot of the game, but once you're in a city, you are free to explore it however you want to. There are lots of side quests and the main plot itself is very interesting. The side quests are also meaningful and mostly fund, not of the ""fetch me this flowe"" kind. The game is clearly made for adults, since there's a lot of brutality and nudity in it. This is nice to see in an era where almost every game is being made for all audiences. The crafting system is also one of the strong features of Witcher 2. You can craft weapons, armor, potions, traps etc.On the other hand, there are some things which ruin the game. The checkpoint (aka autosave) system is a failure. You watch a cutscene, you listen to a conversation and then get to the fight scene. If you die, you don't get to fight again immediately; no you have to watch the cutscene again (which you can skip btw) and listen to the conversation (which you can click through). It is very annoying to constantly have to click your way to the fight after every death and it only adds to your frustration. There are also instances in the game where you don't control your main character, but you are rather given the control of a character in the story to fight. The game is almost telling you ""Hey remember all those skills you gained through collecting experience and all? Yeah, they're gone. Have fun!"". This is very very frustrating. In the end, you should make up your mind: can you endure the frustration of this game to enjoy its exciting plot and positive features?tl;dr Witcher 2 is a beautiful game with some very annoying bull**** in it.

												This game is superb in almost every aspect. It has a very well connected story with mature content and its ""replayability"" is  enough to spend more than 40-50 hours playing it. The game is closer to a linear than a non-linear game, but in a certain way that's what makes the story special, because you can realize how the decisions you make change the story/world through each chapter (still, the player has a wide freedom in each chapter, excluding the prologue/epilogue). The script is written in a way that sometimes decisions are extremely hard to make, something that I liked a lot. Sidequest in this game are well made and worth your time since they are mainly separate stories which will engulf you even more in the game, also, they sometimes have *minor* impact in the main plot.The combat and skill tree is ok, better than in TW1 IMO, in the end it depends on your tastes.Graphics are really well made since this game uses dx9. Personally, I didn't like the way the shadows were made and I miss some tessellation especially on the floor, but I guess that it is the cost in exchange for better perfomance.The soundtrack is awesome and every track fits every part of the game. A must have for RPG lovers. 8.8/10			"

												TLDR: If you tried to like the original The Witcher, but failed like I did, get The Witcher 2. If you liked the original The Witcher, definitely get this one.I found the original The Witcher an intriguing but very confusing mess of a game. Even with the release of the Eanhanced Edition of the original I could not get into it because nothing in the game made eny sense to me.Enter The Witcher 2 (:Assassins and all that stuff I'm too lazy to type out each time). Here is a game that throws you into the deep end of a non-conventional RPG mechanic, as well as a lore-rich story that will most likely be very unfamiliar and quite foreign to most players. And yet the game presents itself in a way that draws you into the story and lore, and teaches you just enough about its game mechanics to get you confortably started, but lets out enough detail to make you feel like you're getting better at it as you start to fine-tune your approach to the game.Even though the story and lore can be seen as very standard fare fantasy at a glance, I advise any player to take the time to read up in the Journal to learn more about the characters, events, locations and monsters. You'll quickly see that this is not just another Middle-Earth clone, and the quality of the lore leans much more heavily towards the Game of Thrones class of fantasy world. People are driven my human desires, and no-one in the game is an idealistic representation of virute. In this world, no-one is perfect.Then you get to the gameplay anr RPG mechanics. Yes, you have skill trees you advance through to earn new and better skills and abilities. But the game leans heavilty toward strategic planning for each fight you're going to face. Drink potions and apply temporary enhancements to your equipment to give you the edge you'll need to survive. You're not playing a standard RPG here where your character is basically a demi-god able to wade through armies of enemy troops at a whim. You may be a mutant bred for slaying monsters, but you're still very much human, and very much mortal, so you better put some thought into what the world is going to throw at you so that you can meet it prepared.When combat erupts, things hardly go exactly according to plan though, which forces you to improvise within the general planning you had laid down. You have a wide selection of Signs (spells) and items at your disposal to help keep the odds in your favour. Drop  some traps during a fight to snare up your enemies, trow bombs to stun and damage as you hack away, and even use mind control to tun an enemy against his mates and tip the scales.One of the things I found hardest to comprehent in the original The Witcher was the combat system. I can beilieve that it was a brilliant system, but I just never felt comfortable with it. In The Witcher 2, the combat is redone completely, feels much more action-packed and impressive than the original.The game also forces you to go through certain choices that influence the game as you progress. And unlike other ""morality-based"" games, there is never a clear-cut definition of which choice is the ""good"" and which is the ""bad"". You need to make up your own mind, because the the world of The Witcher 2, things work in shades of grey, and nothing is Black & White (see what I did there?)All in all, I highly recomment this game. I bought it on special during the Holiday 2014 Sale, because I wasn't too impressed with the original, but after playing it for a few hours I'd gladly pay full price for it.Well done, CD Projekt RED. Bravo!			"

												Currently doing a letsplay on this game and all I can say this if you are interested in an awesome story-driven RPG, I would deffinitely recommend this game! The leveling is intricate, the story is rich and long, and it will keep you entertained for many hours! Controls can be wonky, but aside from that, its awesome. The social interaction and communication is fantastic! Love the banter between characters!If you can get this game on sale, please do! (Unless you have a low-end PC, though. This game might run poorly for you D: sorry in advance)			"

												This game is superb in almost every aspect. It has a very well connected story with mature content and its ""replayability"" is  enough to spend more than 40-50 hours playing it. The game is closer to a linear than a non-linear game, but in a certain way that's what makes the story special, because you can realize how the decisions you make change the story/world through each chapter (still, the player has a wide freedom in each chapter, excluding the prologue/epilogue). The script is written in a way that sometimes decisions are extremely hard to make, something that I liked a lot. Sidequest in this game are well made and worth your time since they are mainly separate stories which will engulf you even more in the game, also, they sometimes have *minor* impact in the main plot.The combat and skill tree is ok, better than in TW1 IMO, in the end it depends on your tastes.Graphics are really well made since this game uses dx9. Personally, I didn't like the way the shadows were made and I miss some tessellation especially on the floor, but I guess that it is the cost in exchange for better perfomance.The soundtrack is awesome and every track fits every part of the game. A must have for RPG lovers. 8.8/10			"

												Even more mature, bloody and artistic. The Witcher 2, offers an experience like few other games can even get close to.  It's exactly where gaming is supposed to be heading to - interactivity, artistic freedom, proper showcase of sex and it's proper representation and of course a great game. It improves very much over the original game, the combat system for instance is replaced with a more action-like(always reminded me of Prince of Persia), yet it still remains an RPG, giving you choice... and consequence. This time the Polish developers have outdone themselves, you have to play it to understand it. Waste no time and try it out! It's definetely worth it.			"

												Assassins of Kings is a gem of an RPG. It features a rich and mature setting and story, with complex, flawed characters and tackles concepts like racism and class warfare. The game will force you to make choices, and not just between good vs evil, but bad vs worse, or ambiguous choices that are hard to judge, but which will have important consequences for the people in the story. The RPG gameplay is very fun, and the combat is fairly action oriented. This game is definitely worth a play through, especially if you have any interest in playing the next installment coming out in 2015.			"

												If you liked the first witcher then this game is definitely for you. If you never played the first witcher but like RPGs then this game should be given a chance. Gameplay is fun and never felt boring. Story was engaging with a good amount of replayability to see what would happen if you did a scenario differently. Then there's the ♥♥♥♥ factor which was a fair amount.   Only problem I have with this game is that it never fixed the issue that Witcher 1 had with side quests. Sometimes if you did a certain quest before another quest one of the quests cancels or even sometimes if you want somewhere the game doesn't warn you you won't be able to return (I guess which gives a poor reason to come back and play again). Other than that when I got this game for $4, it was one of the best $4 I spent in a while.			"

												This is a game for those who appreciate a well-rounded, deep, and engaging RPG. The game's vanilla difficulty curve is strange. It starts out balls hard, then becomes a cake walk towards the end. If this becomes problematic for some, go to   The Witcher 2 Section of Nexus Mods [www.nexusmods.com]  and install the ""Witcher 2 Full Combat Rebalance"" using Nexus Mod Manager. I recomend using NMM unless you are comfortable with installing mods manually and dealing with the files themselves.Overall I, as a fan of RPGs such as this, would give it a solid 9/10 for:(Good)+Great graphics/animation+Interesting art+Good story/writing+SO MUCH CHOICE+Combat mechanics(Bad)-Gameplay style uncomfortable for newcomers-Throws player to the wolves in the beginning, recommend playing tutorial			"

												Pros :+ Pretty good graphics.Not THAT good,though+ Beautifully written story line+ Tons of things and quests to do+ A lot of items variation available,from potions,weapons,enhancements,etc,so there's a lot of thing to find,craft,or buy so you won't get bored after several hours+ The words you choose to speak will affect the story+ Uncensored nude girls characters sometimes appears along the game story.This game even has some sex scenes in it.I'm not sure to put this in the Pros.But since I'm a guy,so...Cons :- I don't really like the combat system.It's a little bit crude and it's impossible for me to win without getting hit if multiple opponents attack me.- Characters have no expression.It's vital to add facial expression and good voice acting in a story rich game.The voice actor for Geralt (main character,the white haired guy) isn't a really good one for me,and there's no facial expression at all- Crude animations during the 'talking' session where you choose what do you want Geralt to speak- Strange movement animation.The animation when you walk to right/left/back direction is really,really bad.- Controller support is a failure for me.I can't manage my inventory at all using my controller.No,mine is not a third party controller.I don't know the problem is me or the game,though.Overall,the cons are meaningless and it's totally acceptable and it won't ruin your gameplay.Unless you can only play with a controller,of course.I love this game so much for its story line and the ability to control the way Geralt respond to other characters (not for its nude girls and sex scenes).This game is totally worth it an I'm really looking forward to play The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt.Buy this game if you want to know the whole story.

												Now I sit here with the Witcher 2 finally finished.I am not a big fan of it's combat but then I am spoiled with the Dark Souls series. The game although bring a lot to the table. Anyone playing Crusader Kings 2 will feel like they are playing a minor hero character in a big world of politics and schemes. It is brutal world, a beautiful, brutal world! The story continues from the first game and puts Geralt in a messy messy time full of troubles. This game was released same year as Dragon Age 2 and Skyrim. It is probably not as big and as long as these two but I think it out perform Dragon Age 2 with flavour and story, I care more for the characters in Witcher 2 than those in Dragon Age 2. In Dragon Age 2 I wanted to kill them. In Skyrim I did not care even that much about NPCs and many places felt very empty. The Witcher is a very gorgeous game. As I said before the combat is not my favourite but I can see if people prefer this over the more unique Witcher 1 combat system. The sound is good and the voice actors are in my opinion very good. The models also come in more flavours this time compared to Witcher 1. It feels a bit shorter than Witcher 1 but comes with a big replayability with the a split in the road. I do hope that all your options, Kill A, Let A go, Save X over Z, Help Nr 1 and fight Nr 2. I hope these options have consquences in Witcher 3. The game is not perfect but to consider what a failure the big guys at Bioware itself released this year and how they continued to release overrated games with plenty of flaws, it is hard then to judge this Polish studios struggles. It is a excellent  game in a grim world! Showing the darkness of humanity and the chaos errupting from a dead king. Resembling the chaos in Europe in the middle ages in a bit. It is a grim bloody world, full of prejudice, hate, treachery and  destruction. But also lot of comeraderie, courage and love shown. 9 out of 10. Trigger Warning: It is not a game for you SJW wimps! Go play Dragon Age Inquisition with you.			"

												The Witcher series turned out to be one of my gaming diamond. It's not about graphics, but strong plot and solid RPG elements will stick with you in every moments of the game. The Witcher 2 still remain its standard of story (some parts are modified from The Witcher novel). You might want to catch up from The Witcher 1 to gain full experience of the story. The highlight is various decisions along three main chapters which point you out and force you to deal with consequence. This give high replayability like The Witcher 1.The combat system is changed from point-and-click (The Witcher 1) to dynamic hit-and dodge (The Witcher 2). For me, the combat is greatly flexible, but less complexity in strategy (The Witcher 1 gives your more different sword styles and Sign charge). The skill system is quite stricted than The Witcher 1 skill pattern). However,  the game provides you a lot of armors and weapons choice (Yeah, you can hit boss with a scoop).QTE is also another factor that's shouldn't be in RPG game, I feel kinda disappointed they put QTE in the end of boss fight and fistfight minigame. Cause the game lacks some challenges.I may complain too much about its problem. However, it's just minor issues and I understand it's hard to keep its previous standard if you attempt to change something. The Witcher 2 still one of my strong RPG game all the time. even it's not deepest, longest, or toughest, but I feels very very enjoyable in every moment of this game and I have high hope for The Witcher 3.

												♥♥♥♥ing Brilliant - Is tied in my Top 3 RPG's of all time list.I originally purchased 'The Witcher' after reading positive reviews about a week after launch - With the Death metal band VADER helming the official music video that I checked out on youtube; it was SOLD for me, I purchased it via Direcct2Drive as it was not on the Steam Platform at that time. TW1 on its launch was hailed by critics and myself for having an amazing story - and even more impressive: (Re-Coding the BioWare ?Aurura?) engine used for Neverwinter Nights into a Third Person Action / Tactical combat system; with optional WASD movement.-As soon as The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings popped up on Steam for pre-order I pre-ordered with huge excitement. I checked out the system requirements and I had just ordered my 560 ti SLI's from that era; along with 120hz monitor and Nvidia 3D Vision 1.0 - -Once it came to launch day I was able to play everything on Ultra aside from having Ubersampling on (Now with my 780 ti's in SLI ubersampling is cake; it was also 100% smooth when I had SLI 680's and SLI 780 GTX MSI OC edition) - The Visauls set the bar for the Genre, perhaps ""in house"" engines in general. The art design was outstanding, dark and gritty edged with realism in every nook and cranny. The lighting/Shadow, weather+day cycles all realistically done in a mind blowing fashion.  ""Nvidia 3D Vision Ready"" - I popped on the original Nvidia 3D vision 1.0 wireless glasses with the old asus 120Hz monitor I had. This may still be the most brilliant 3D vision title ever released. Geralt's swords literally (unsheath and just stand holding it) would pop out in a way that it seemed the blade was coming a foot+ out of the screen and right into my face; the tip of the blade. - I had an entire play in 3D Vision and it was the most astonishing ""3D"" experiences of my lifetime in gaming. I've completed the game 5 times, with one being totally 3D Vision, one Playthru when I got my 680's initially, then began a playthrough that I finished when I received my 780s (each series I had dual SLI) - Seeing the transformation of all ultra with Ubersampling enabled from SLI 560ti's to 680's was outstanding and jaw dropping; then not worrying about hitting 70Cish once I git my 780's was even more-so outstanding -laughs- : I was still being held back a bit in overall performance due to my CPU an AMD 8150 that would bottleneck such great CPU's; and using all 4 slots on my MOBO for ram with an AMD CPU is a no-go idea for performance; as I had 16 gigs of G.Skill ripjaws. - despite this I finished that play, and finally decided to play it with a non ""Vernon Roche"" chapter 2 (yeah I was stubborn, I always intedned on the next play being the completely different chapter 2 but had to keep going with Vernon Roche's ideals as it felt like who I was as a player, and the Geralt I wanted to play as. I upgraded my CPU to an AMD 9370 8 core liquid cooled at 5.0GHz, and grabbed 2x8GB G.Skill Trident X's with very low (fast) timings and higher over-all speed of the ram and saw amazing boosts in all my benchmarks; and Played thru-once more. I began a playthru again; just completing all but one of the interrogation flashbacks with Vernon Roche - When I upgraded my SLI 780's to SLI 780 ti's (Each Nvidia GPUs mentioned have been the MSI Manufactured versions). The 780 Ti being the fastest GPU ever created with 1GHz faster memory speed per card than the prior ""OC Gaming Edition"" 780's I had, and 800 more Cuda cores amongst other very impressive improvments.- Having a 144hz monitor with Nivida G-Sync Kit attached in and working (the asus 144hz Nvidia 3D Vision 2.0 / Nvidia lightboost 24 inch monitor came G-Sync kit ready 6 months prior to G-Sync being announced; I am glad this was the monitor I purchased back then; I was dissapointed when I read about G-Sync specific monitors then elated when I saw this was the only current monitor that was G-Sync Upgradable.- For the most recent play-through I contacted Nvidia for a G-Sync kit; used a phillips head on the back of the monitor and easily plugged in the chip (has a nice clear and labled spot for it to just plug right in) It's hard to even describe the difference until you actually groove with it and see / play with it yourself! My PC is totally ready for Geralt's Finale in the gaming franchise (I have yet to read the original books that the games are based)With many RPG's coming out for each platform; I had a huge J-RPG crush during the SNES-PSX era; Highlights being FF2 cartridge(FF4)-FF3 Cartridge(FF6) and the reason I purchased a PSX for the timeless Final Fantasy Vii, The dissapointing FF8 comes to mind as I forced myself to play it due to hype and having it pre-ordered the same date the Dreamcast was released on 9-9-99, and then despite having amazing adventures on my PC With Baldurs Gate 1-2, Planescape Torment etc - I gave Final Fantasy IX a chance which blew me away and was able to give Square another chance in my book; for the awful FF8; releasing a rather fantastic and ""Interesting FF9"" - Still J-RPG's forced linerality which defenders proclaim ""It's about the story"" (It seems these defenders have never played PLANESCAPE TORMENT or Baldurs Gate 2 The Witcher 1 suffered SOME gameplay and combat elements for an excellent story; Dragon Age Origins and The Witcher 2 had far superior stories than any J-RPG I've played without the lineraty style seen in J-RPG's, but thats a battle between fan's that  will never end as JRPG diehards assume any PC/Western RPG is an Elderscrolls style Open World Title with very poor story (Although Morrowind <3 <3 had a rather excellent story; despite the shallow characters that Bethesda still continues on with) - Perhaps the Witcher 2: Enhanced Edition release on The Xbox 9800 or whatever (Atari Jaguar 720 etc) was an excellent wake up call to many console Atari Joystick gamers; they got to finally experience our 2011 GOTY / RPG of the year; which then was a GOTY candidate and RPG of the year winner again in 2012 due to the Enhanced Edition console release (Confusing indeed.) which brought more revenue and spotlight towards the wonderful minded CDProjektRED; without that occuring and having TW3 be multi-platform (WITH PC as the Ultimate Intended platform still; partnering with Nvidia for hardware owning only options that are mindblowing in the Press Conference highlighting them all by Nvidia <3) - Then perhaps TW3 would not have been on the cover of Game Informer pumping up people who perhaps didn't even notice the 360 version on store shelves as ""Skyrzrimz"" is all they've ever heard of in the Role-Playing Game Format; or ""Falloutz"" Not that these titles have anything wrong with them The general public just murders anything excellent with their subpar Console versions while being blown away by the graphics (I saw skyrim on a friends 360 and threw up in my mouth a little)-I was sent a promo copy of the 360 version to review due to CDPR knowing my love for The White Wolf and his awesome adventures, I grabbed a 360 and blasted through the 360 form of the title which seemed to have pushed the console to its limits and then some, arguably the best looking 360 title to date - I was happy gamers who settle with 8 year old hardware could enjoy TW2 on Less than Medium PC settings!-Now with The Wicther 3's release looming; my PC being ready for the game to run smooth on Ultra; I cannot wait to be immersed completely rec. footage via Nvidia Shadowplay & Twitch.TV No Death Ruleset streams; with SLI 780 ti's prepared for all the Nvidia exclusive hardware graphical / immersive implementations that will not be possible with the ""Next Gen hardware from 2010"" consoles but when I shut up and think about it, Atleast more people are still experiencing TW2 and will experience TW3 (even if it is subpar to the build we'll be pre-ordering here on Steam). Geralt The Riv. Geralt of Rivia, The White Wolf.We have more adventures in store for us.			"

												Bloody Violence, dragons, full frontal nudity and bad language... Wrapped up in gorgeous graphics and a story line that's actually interesting and makes you want to watch the cutscenes. Apparently it supports mods too, which is always a bonus :)I was on the fence about buying this after playing the first Witcher game. I really didn't like the combat system in the original, but I read that it had been reworked and improved. What can I say? I bought it in the sale thinking ""♥♥♥♥ it I'll give it a shot"", and my only regret is that I didn't buy it earlier. The combat system is massively improved. Quite a lot of 3rd person action games should take note, because THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT.If you're undecided about buying the game like I was, stop thinking, and buy it while it's on sale (though I'd have been happy to pay full price if I'd realised how damn good it is).If that doesn't sell it to you, you must be one of these sad freaks who's scared of hearing a bit of colourful language...

												Some my Pros/ConsPros:+ Mod support+ Ritch storyline+ Nice looking visuals even on low settings+ Perfect soundtracks+ A lot of craftable items+ High quality NPC voice acting+ Fun during monster hunt (preparing traps/poisons/reading up on the creatures etc)Cons:- Unrealistic sword combat. It doesn't feel right. - Unbalanced gameplay mechanics - Oils and potions barely last long enough to be of any use, and forcing you to drink them in meditation mode is tiresome. Also fairly unrealistic and breaks immersion somewhat. Many skills over/underpowered (i.e. dodge-roll, shield sign, alchemy tree etc.)-Clunky UI and menus. Bad sorting options, unintuitive selection design (i.e. hover over recipe with mouse cursor, then press space or enter to complete recipe. but don't click and make sure not to move your mouse away from recipe in list). The map, while looking totally freaking awesome, is almost entirely useless. Many more problems with UI.-Lack of camera controls and options.-Unclear or non-existent tutorials.-Also, doors. OMG DOORS. Another obvious piece of the game programmed with the fortcoming console port in mind.Overall. 6/10.  I can recommend Witcher 2 if you are keen on fantasy setting and magic items crafting...			"

												I highly recommend this game simply for the facts that the Story is great, It's good looking, the fighting mechanism is really good and it contains hard puzzels (you got to read the quests to make progress).  It's not a rush game (where you kill and proceed) in this game you have to dodge, parry and barrel roll and then strike.  The fighting mechanism is more like dodge until you find a great opportunity to strike and prepare before you go into combat (drinking potions, use poison ETC).The cons though would be the ""target select mechanism"" because when you're fighting a lot of enemys, the character ""Geralt"" attacks (often) the nearest enemy pointed in the direction you're looking at, and also when you have a companion the enemys rather attack your companion than you (which makes the game a lot easier).8/10 IMO "

												Bought this game on the 360 due to not having a decent computer to play it. It was that good meriting another purchase on the pc. CD Projekt Red are one of those rare developers that give a damn about their fanbase, and want to provide you with a memorable journey through The Witcher universe. The books that this game is based on are a very good read as well.			"

The Witcher 2: Assassins of KingsPros:. Well written, easy to follow story. A lot of choices which are divided into 'Major' and 'Minor', the major will affect the story and the minor will usually be something personal to Geralt, such as a choice between Orens (the games currency) or some gear. All of the main characters are fantastic, and even then, the more minor characters will have some short story behind them. Very good graphics which still hold up today. Good combat for the most part, knowledge is key in this game, if go into some fights without correctly preparing with oils and potions et cetera, you're probably going to die very fast. A good 'rewardingly difficult' system similar to Dark Souls (although not as hard) . Fairly good replayabilty. Good game length for the priceCons. Game is pretty unoptimized, I bought this on my old pc, which was bad but still above the recommended requirements and couldn't this game at a stable frame rate at all. Now, however with my 390, the framerate dips from the usual 60 (on ultra) all the way down to 20 in certain situations. The game is quite buggy, such as the game not allowing you to do simple things like climb a rock which can halt your progress into the game. The horrible targeting system the game uses for its combat, you can only target one enemy at once which can screw up entire scenarios as the target is chosen via who is at the centre of the camera, which leads to things like being unable to attack another enemy with easeOverallI give this game a 8.1/10 and heavily recommend it to any Witcher or RPG fan for its great narrative, characters, and gameplay, but be wary of the games bad optimisation and bugs.

												I'm still not sure what to think of this game. Visually it's absolutely beautiful. The story and the lore are great, there's a branching path which makes the game play differently, there's no ""right"" and ""wrong""... But the actual game itself, as a game with its technicalities and mechanics, falls short of my expectations.The user interface is confusing, and not only because there are no tooltips:The only witcher sign whose purpose I could remember was Igni, because it burned things.Inventory management is a mess; they have tried simplifying it compared to the first game, but again, without any tooltips, the only sorting options I figured out were ""by newest obtained"" and ""by most weight"". The others... I have no idea what they're about.The character skill tree won't list where mutagen slots are located. I've talked to a couple of people who played the game, and they all mutated their first ability with something stupid. You can't remove the mutagen, so you're stuck with that choice until the end of the game. If you're reading this, don't do it until you're absolutely sure that you chose correctly, because it won't be surprising if you used a lesser mutagen and got a greater mutagen five minutes later.You have to decide early on which path to take: magic, alchemy, swords. Not enough talents to push all three branches.Looting is a problem, as there is no ""highlight loot"" key, and there are no labels. If a corpse leaves more than 4 things to be looted, you won't see them until you enter the loot window. Positioning the character to loot items and rotating the camera is too hard.The map is confusing, especially if you're outside a city. Sometimes it seems you can go a certain way to get somewhere, but it's blocked by some bushes and you have to go back and find an alternate route. You can't leave markers, nor is everything on the map marked: for example, in Flotsam I found a book merchant in a random house.Buying weapons/armor from merchants doesn't let you compare stats to items you own.You can get good items by crafting diagrams, but you have to find someone to craft; Geralt can't do it. He can just make potions. I actually had to use pen and paper to write down what I want and what I need to craft it.Speaking of potions - you can't drink them during a battle. You have to do it before, but... How are you supposed to know you'll be in battle? Some people like it, some don't, but for most, if they desire challenging combat, it'll be a case of ""save often, reload often"".Eventually I dropped down to easy difficulty, stopped caring about my inventory, looting, oils, potions, bombs and all of that, and just concentrated on the story and the quests. Before that, I was fighting the game itself, instead of monsters.And the game became fun.If you want a deep story - go for it. If you want perfect and streamlined game mechanics, go for it still, but you might want to do what I did.Recommended anyway. Looking forward to the third game!			"

												This game was good, I don't really know what to say about it.Amazing soundtrack.The artwork is appealing and it transmits the atmosphere that the game is living in.The combat system I don't know I think I liked more of witcher 1 combat system although in w2 it's much more free so it has is advantages and disadvantages, there was also some fights that were ridiculously hard for example the first one against letho, you do that and you beat the game honestly.The story was ofc really good I think, good interesting characters, but I have to say the ending was a ♥♥♥♥ cliffhanger, it's like they gave you pizza and you only drink the soda, but whatever. Also Letho for the badass character he was I think it deserved a bit of more an highlight throughout the game, you just get to know more and see more of Letho at the ending but again that's probably the way how the game ended abruptly.But it was a really good game overall.

												Played it in late 2015 with Windows 8.1. I did not play Witcher 1 previously.This game has its flaws. It is not perfect. Among the bad things, we have:- Several Crashes. In my 35 gameplay hours, it crashed like 4-6 times. - Awful UX. I didn't like the menus. For instance, when buying a new weapon, you don't have the option to compare the new weapon and your actual weapon. You have to exit vendor's menu, enter your inventory, memorize your weapon, and then enter vendor's menu and compare both weapons. Awful.- The combat is a little rough.Among the good things:+ The story is great. I really liked the story and the plot twists. + Your choices matter.  There are several endings based on your decisions.+ The bosses are incredibly hard yet fun. I cursed at the screen several times, yet I couldn't stop playing.+ Graphics are nice even as today.+ Playing Witcher 1 previously is not a requirement.			"

												Haunting and atmospheric just like the first in the series, and very fun and challenging to play through. The series seems to be becoming more action/adventure oriented than an RPG meant for purists, but what this game does it does very well. The combat system has become more oriented toward player skill rather than Geralt's attributes, but this turned out to be pretty fun once I got the hang of the controls. Branching storylines encourage replayability, as in the first game. At first I had a problem with the excessive use of bloom and shader effects, though these things are implemented far better and more artistically after the first chapter, so I suggest everyone keep these settings enabled. Overall this is a very well-written and clever game and I would recommend it to fans of the first game or fans of the fantasy fiction genre in general. You won't be disappointed!			"

												Is the game good? Yes. It's a flawed gem of a game and one that could well have been one of the best RPG's ever made, if it wasn't for one thing: the combat. The combat is either shallow and dreadfully easy on ""Easy"", or absolutely impossible on ""Normal"". ""Normal"" is really hard mode and they need another difficulty in-between.Putting that aside, pretty much everything else in the game is good. Graphically it looks very pretty when maxed out for a game this old. Having never played Witcher 1, I found it's not very beginner friendly with regards to the story - but then I kind of expected that anyway. Nevertheless, if you have not played the previous game, expect to be confused... a lot. When you finally get your head round it you will find it has significant depth and is highly engaging.Your companions all have back stories of their own and they are well fleshed out. Not many games have had me caring for characters I have only spent a minimal amount of time with in game, but this one got me!The RPG elements are solid and allow for quite a bit of customisation. It has an interesting potion mechanic, based on your ""toxicity level"", so you can't just swig every potion you have before a fight.So, all in all, it's a good game. It could have been brilliant if a few issues were resolved. Regardless of which, it has made me want to get Witcher 3 this February, so consider me hooked!Jimbo Rating: 7/10			"

												Really fluid combat system. Beautiful graphics. In-depth gameplay with lots of game mechanics (skills, combat moves, items). Also tons of side-quests for you to do. HOWEVER! No rebindable keys! System requirement that is too damn high! Lousy port to Linux, especially for non-Nvidia gamers! I'm talking about a ""native"" game that runs much WORSE than using Wine.If you have to use a wrapper, use Wine instead of an unknown one. Would not recommend this game to someone using Linux with non-Nvidia video cards. Otherwise, I recommend it :P			"

												The Witcher 2 world is simply wonderful, picturesque, varied and vast, incomparable to any other role-playing game.It isn’t open world game. But don’t worry, you won’t run along the paths on both sides limited by invisible walls. CDPR replaced them seamlessly with natural obstacles like chasms, giant trees or very thick bushes. Locations are very diverse. These are cities, villages, open areas, and covered with dense vegetation and ancient elven forest where tree crowns blurring high in the clouds. All amaze diversity and ingenuity. The new proprietary engine Red Engine perfectly shows a play of lights, creating a magical atmosphere, paradoxically also realistically.Combat plays crucial role in the game at any moment we have the opportunity to duel difficult opponent and even take part in the epic battles. The fighting has changed since the first Witcher. We have stronger and more powerful attacks to choose from, varied by passive and active skills. There are three paths of character development: swordsmanship, alchemy and magic. Generally, fighting system is fun, scenic and rewarding, it requires constant attention and feline reflexes, because sometimes we literally have only split seconds to activate protective emblems or attack an open enemy. Not everyone will like this rule, since some players might get frustrated fighting larger groups or one difficult enemy. Overall, The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings is a beautiful game with modern graphics and addictive gameplay, with its emphasis on realism, psychologically complex characters, original and surprising missions, elections burdened consequences, rewarding combat, good music, humor, sex and climate. First of all, the climate! All these elements form a coherent whole for making up the unique atmosphere.

												Witcher 2 is a major improvement of the previous game: it has a more intricate story, the combat is not dull anymore and it's even more atmospheric. and graphics are spectacular even by today's standards.However, there are some old issues that haven't been addressed since the first game. I've recently started playing Witcher 3, and it seems that those flaws are consistent throughout the trilogy, namely:1. The game offers choices. But the consequences aren't very different. Your choices mostly determine, who will be your ally, who dies and who lives. OK, it's kind of relevant, but it's nothing radical, because the global events stay the same, no matter what you do. The protagonist is a mere pawn in the hands of the destiny as any other character. What I'm trying to say, is that THE GAME DOESN'T PUNISH OR REWARD YOU FOR YOUR CHOICES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. And in that aspect, your choices don't really matter.(Note: Ok, in Witcher 3 choices matter, but no matter what you do - someone dies :D)Although, I must admit that Witcher 2 is a minor step forward in this aspect, because what you did in Witcher 2 partially determines who is your ally in Witcher 3 and how strong/independent are some of the fractions in the game universe. Whereas nothing but tiny details were transfered from Witcher 1 to Witcher 2. It was like starting from a blank page.2. Level scaling problems. Gameplay is challenging in the beginning, but a cakewalk towards the end.3. Constant shortage of money (orens). I used two mods to address this problem: Zero Weight mod that allows to infinitely store items in your inventory and a Price Changer mod that makes everything cheap, except the armor.Witcher 2 is very atmospheric, as are the other games in the trilogy. It offers a very tangible experience of a medieval world. And the NPCs are very complicated and interesting. However, it's much shorter and the story felt rushed towards the end. There was less and less to do with each following chapter. It takes ~70 h to complete every quest in Witcher 1 and only ~30-35 h to complete every quest in Witcher 2.Also, there are only a few sexual encounters, contrary to Witcher 1, where there were many and you could collect romance cards. Not that it really matters, but I liked that card feature quite a bit.On a side note, I would like to say that some of the bombs and all the throwing daggers are too weak. Only Stinger is quite strong, but, anyway, the daggers have limited number of situations were they are useful, as is the case with traps. The opportunity windows are just too narrow. They are cool weapons and bombs like Grapeshot, Dragon's Dream and Dancing Star, do come in handy, but, in overall, swords and magic are superior to alchemy, meaning that the Alchemy path is not equal to Magic and Swordsmanship path. One would expect that all the paths are balanced.On the bright side, there are barely no fetch quests in Witcher 2. You do a lot of interesting investigation and every quest falls in the overall picture nicely. As you are working on one quest, you are simultaneously solving the others. I very much liked that. Everything was well thought through. And the amount of detail – it's just lovely.I am writing this review after my second playthrough, and I must say that I still enjoyed the game very much. Witcher 2 is one of my all time favourite games. I have started Witcher 3 now and it seems that it's going to be my number 1 game of all time.CD Projekt Red, keep it up!My overall rating: 9.5/10.

												As a happily initiated fan of the very first edition in the series, I went into The Witcher 2 with high hopes and expecations of splendid gratuitous immersion and further storytelling excellence. My thirst was well quenched in the cries of a thousand embattled souls. The embers of my spirit's flame soared high as I fed their crackling wisps with the blood spatterings of innumerable smitten heathens, embracing lass Triss Merigold as I roamed the countryside, cherishing each moment I'd chance a listen at a grown man telling another grown man to eat ♥♥♥♥ and die.Adventure, intrigue, culture, passion, battle. It has it all. A story you'll most definitely want to delve into.			"

												While The Witcher 1 was a big first and successfull attempt to bring the world and feel of adventure of Witcher books to the video games, Witcher 2 wanted to up the quality. Tell an even better story, look better, play better... Which might've worked if not for all the issues this game had during the development, issues that are felt throught the rather messy experience The Witcher 2 is.They did succeed in making it look better, obviously, but the look actually aged a bit worse due to the colour filtering choices and the fact that for all the looks it achieved, the world feels smaller, more cramped, more boring to look at. Not everywhere, of course, act 2 has few locations that look nice and the opening scenes can be impressive, but most of the game just looks like a mess of drab colours.It tells the story in a more interesting way, but the story itself is less interesting. It has more nuances, it has some very exciting global implications on the game world and choices feel more natural, are provided in a more personal way. It does bring even more wit and humour from the books, it evolves the characters. And it is the very best thing about the game. Although, it seems, that in Witcher 3 most of the choices are invalidated by events out of your control anyway. Oh and if you do play for story - just go with Iorveth. While Roche path has some pretty interesting (and also mostly invalidated in TW3) choices, all of Act 2 and most of Act 3 will be extremely boring, as Roche gets the most boring locations, quests and dialogues in his path, seemingly mostly due to the fact that this path was developed last.As for the gameplay... If you play on Normal, it's not bad. If you try the Full Combat Rebalance 2 mod it might make some things more interesting. If you play Dark mode or something like that, then don't try the FCR2 mod... Actually, just don't play Dark mode at all, or any other higher difficulty. Despite some attempts by CDP RED to make gameplay fun, gameplay is mostly pretty frustrating and is either simply not fun, or in some cases maddeningly broken. A lot of ideas, with recipies, crafting and such are just a mess (and Dark mode only ""benefits"" depend on those). In addition, all those small animation limitations, you encounter everywhere and things like that make The Witcher 2 to be not a particularly fun game to play.But the story can be worth it. And was for me, twice. Just, don't expect to like anything else.			"

The rest of players who love building your own story, with consequinces for every decision you take then you should already have this game in your library, if not...what are you waiting for??			"

												This game has violence and nudity, do I really need to say more? Well if that doesn't convince you, you should know that the game also tells an amazing story, and you do NOT need to play the first game to understand it. I tried the first game and hated the combat, but this game's combat is much more action oriented, fast paced, and fun. The world is incredibly immersive, and while small, it drew me in much more than larger worlds ever could. Also, boobs. Seriously, get this game, it's awesome.			"

												Well, I played The Witcher 1 a little bit, a few hours and eventually dropped it not because I didn't like the story because I did but because the combat was really, really boring and well, there was quite a lot of it so it was hard to avoid it, especially in RPG games.Moving on, The Witcher 2 got released, didn't play at launch but a few years later I decided to give it a shot. It is so much better than the first game in my opinion. The story, the gameplay, graphics and most especially, combat, they're all better.Now, the game itself is not THAT huge as you might think it is. At first glance it does seem so but after finishing it you realize it's really not. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean there aren't things to do. There's plenty of side quests, lore to explore, books to read (I think, didn't touch them that much), monsters to slay and yeah, you get a lot of content, especially for the lowered up prices you can find right now.I really recommend this game because CDProjekt really nailed it.Get it m9s ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

												Very in depth, great title, worth replaying 3 times if necessary to conjure up different endings, setting up the Witcher 3. Controls are tight using the 360 gamepad, combat could be described as well timed button mashing, while everything else is very responsive. Having 27 hours for my first playthrough, this was a great purchase during the steam summer sales. Story is well written, with a variety of interesting characters (featuring a badass intro movie) and with the inclusion of choices that changes the outcome of the story dramatically. The Witcher does a good job of explaining what happened prior to the events of the game with the exception of some names and such (being a newb to the series it's hard to keep up with names). And finally, the graphics are soo damn pretty, I spent a great deal of time admiring the art direction and landscapes of the various HUBS and feilds. 11/10 would play again (after I finish the original), done.

												Hmm, again the Steam recommendation system provokes thought. This isn't a great game, it's a good one. It has numerous flaws. Ridiculous boss fights (thank goodness for easy mode), stupid missions with auto fail conditions (I nearly was reduced to tears by one idiotic sequence where you had to follow someone through a greyscale cave where the mission was restarted if you put one foot wrong), display and path finding glitches, and a bizarre plot that lost me some time ago. But it also has much goodness - smashing combat, once you figure out you have to roll a lot, stunning visuals, a fantastic main character and decent supporting cast, including several strong female characters - don't be deceived by the pandering to teenage boys with the top heavy character models. There is action aplenty and a reasonable amount of exploration to do, however I feel it didn't live up to it's predecessor and it does feel curiously amateurish in places. I really have no idea how this devteam is going to pull off something as ambitious as Witcher 3, but I'll certainly be playing it. Recommended? Yes, but with the caveat that the game is deeply flawed and a definite slog at times.			"

												The Witcher 2 is indeed a title that needs to be experienced by every single RPG fan out there; however bear in mind that this title does carry a PEGI age restriction of 18, and is not suited for anyone below this age limit. As stated before, this is not just because of the nudity or the graphic violence, but due to the fact that The Witcher 2 has an in-depth storyline that covers a diverse range of political and racial aspects, which allows it to be the spectacular mature title that it is.When it comes to lasting appeal, The Witcher 2 will take between 30 to 40 hours to complete, depending on your skill level and whether you partake in various side-quests. If you have not picked up a copy of the Witcher 2, I can highly recommend it wether on sale or full price, it's worth every penny of your cash.			"

												Really, really solid Action-RPG. The story is engrossing, full of well-developed characters and locales. Many choices are made throughout the game, and all of them feel like a moral shade of grey, being much more interesting than the good-or-evil binary in some other games. The game feels like it covers only a small section of a much larger canvas, and it is always obvious that important events are happening around Geralt and company. The world feels alive and lived-in, and there are many small details that draw you in. NPCs gather in town centers and taverns and banter between each other. Some of the dialog ends up repeated if you stick around one area too long, but it is written well and does not become grating. Creature design is good, and some of the larger ones are very intimidating. Monsters in the wild form packs and hunt and attack other monsters (and you).The combat in this game is good, but not great. Most fights can be either rushed down quickly or kited around, getting in a few hits at a time. Strong attacks seem more effective than fast attacks almost all of the time, and I sorely missed the ""group"" attacks from the first game. The signs are useful to varying degrees. I found myself using Quen, Aard, and Yrden signs fairly often, but Igni and Axii signs were hardly ever used. Preparing for combat by drinking potions and using sword oils is very important, especially for more challenging fights. For some reason, you cannot lock on to bosses, but the camera is still cooperative and not too much of a pain to manage.The inventory system is streamlined from the first game, and is less of a chore to manage.

												I started this game a few days ago and unlike the first witcher game where I could dump hours at a time, this one feels like a chore to play for a number of reasons. 1. Combat.  The combat isn't hard, it's cheesy. It's impossible to lock on to a target, there is no sword stances like the first Witcher and you die extremely quick in any difficulty and there were fights early on where the only option I could find was to exploit the AI programming. There's a fight with 10-15 creatures(you have no aoe and can't agro only one at a time) in act one and if you dive into them they will gather around you and you just die with no ability to escape(Fair enough, realism... BUT the only way I found to do this fight after multiple attempts is fight them one at a time at the limit of their programmed agro range. 2. Map and NPC's. I can't find f*%$ing ♥♥♥♥ even when it's marked and NPC's that have valuable items you need to buy for quests are no where to be found. I resorted to googling a lot of quest locations and even then couldn't find a lot of them.  3. Menu. the UI is god awful and is a chore to navigate around. 4. Boss fight. My first bossfight I died a dozen times just trying to figure out what to do and how to execute it, this isn't Dark Souls FFS. Finally when I got through phase 1 (yay) a f%%king rock just drops out of the sky onto my head killing me. I died a handful more times in phase 2 trying to figure out what I was suppose to do, walk up to the boss, instantly die, run around, rocks kill you. 5. Dumb mini games. They are boring, clunky and again feel like a chore to play. The first witcher was more fun throwing dice in.5/10 would not reccomend.			"

												The Witcher was a fantastic game. For some reason, the devs felt like they had to change the combat system and slow down the pacing of the sequel. I am sure the control changes were to appeal to the console market, and it was a big mistake. It completely ruins the game. Not only the controls overly complex and counterintuitive, but they are made worse by a very steep difficulty curve. This combined with the lack of clarity in the storytelling and what is far and away the worst menu system I have ever seen in a game and you wind up with a disappointing shadow of what could have been. I love the story and really wanted to experience it in its entirety, but could not do so due to the game's awful controls, terrible pacing and confusing menus. Also, as much as I like dialogue heavy games, this one overdoes it. Too much of a good thing. I can't count the number of times I've wished an npc would just shut up already. When you can sit down in a game for an hour or two and accomplish nothing, something is very wrong.			"

												Lovely story, but the gameplay is a burden.I haven't seen such a buggy game in years...It's much better than Witcher 1, but not enjoyable for me.It feels like a beta, maybe Witcher 3 is the full version.Some of the bugs I encountered:- Serious Input Lag issues.- Bad gamepad controls (and more input lag than with mouse)- Mouse & Keyboard controls aren't too great either. Interacting with the world feels sluggish.- Getting stuck, because a candlestand is lying infront of the door.- Getting stuck in the stealth mode, only able to sneak left or right along an invisible wall- Talking to invisible NPCs (that was quite funny to be honest)I recommend watching a let's play or a longplay, but not actually playing the game.

												By far one of the best games I've played. It has it's problems, but they don't take away from the game enough to ruin the experience in any meaningful manner. It has a slight old school feel to it as well, which I liked very much. Feels good to die over and over and over again in a game like this for a change as well :) You get to solve how to beat the game, learn it, and then finally beat it when you've figured it out, which reminded me of some good games from the past. Way past, that is... This game also respects the players intelligence and maturity, and won't try to hand you everything sugar coated.And then there's the story, and the different branches of it. It definitely surprised me how much of a difference your choice might make in the game! It won't make it obvious either, so if you don't play the game again, or check the differences on a video, you have no idea what the changes are, how big they are, and how much they affect your playthrough. Certainly recommended for anyone interested in fantasy, rpg, good story, or just a good gaming experience.			"

												The Witcher 2 is well worth the price.  It has a long a deep storyline.  I am an avid RPG'er and this game definitely didn't let me down.  With The Witcher 3 coming soon I had to finish this game.  It has been in my steam library since I picked it up in 2011 and stopped playing about 85 hours in.  Also The Witcher 3 will use your last save and those decisions made in The Witcher 2 will effect how your game is for The Witcher 3.  If you enjoy story and voice overs, great questing etc. but this game.			"

												Amazingly addictive. Has many flaws, but the way the game produces the story is unparallel in any RPG. Choises matter, and sometimes you really have to think before you act. To kill or not to kill, to help or not to help. Many choises come with mistakes, most are never perfect, which makes the game fare more believable.			"

												 Really interesting storyline and characters, and actually manages to make you feel emotionally attached to them. An awesome RPG that deals with difficult topics such as racism and sex in a very mature and adult way. Combat is incredibly hard to begin with - it has an enormous learning curve for people who haven't played the original game, but it is the unforgiving combat and reliance on quicksaving that makes it such a challenging and enjoying game. As with any other good RPG, the lore is intriguing, the characters are varied and engaging, and the choices the player makes will have real impact in the future. Graphical fidelity is still top-notch desite being a slightly older title than new games. Overall a timeless classic, and a great example of how other games in this genre should be. TL/DR - 10/10 would highlly recommend. (Please note, the time played above is only whilst logged in online, but including offline time it probably adds up to about 30 hours so far :P)			"

												I warn those in advanced.  This is not your typical RPG.  It is not a sandbox, create your own empty character kind of game.  This isn't Dragon Age.  If that's what you're qxpecting, look elsewhere.  This game is complex, difficult, and treats you like an adult.  There is no hand holding.  But it is, overall, quite the amazing game.  I had already played the Witcher 2 on xbox 360, but I always wanted to try it on PC.  It's even more wonderful.  Load screens, in comparison to the 360 version, are a breeze.  The combat is better and I don't need to mention the graphics.  Play it before Witcher 3 that way you better understand the world.			"

												One of my flat out favorite games of all time. Maybe I'm finally an old RPG gamer who's become a sucker for graphics. But the combat was good, the story and quests excellent, the production values extremely high, the progression and game design concepts quite nice to boot.At $2.99 during this steam sale it is a steal and... not a half. A whole. Of course, it's a steam sale that brought this game to me. And the game, along with the guilt at getting such a steal, that got me paying full price for Wild Hunt. Even if it sucks, the devs deserve it.			"

												Not really sure what this game was about. I was in prison but then I was running from a dragon, only seconds later to be boning a sorceress and thrust into the center of a war-torn battlefield only then to be suddenly teleported back into a prison cell being beaten by two men.I can only conclude that the main character has inter-dimensional teleportation abilities but felt this aspect wasn't represented well in gameplay. I could only roll and slash with my sword and do some wierd fire thing. Wtf Nintendo? Please fix this.I also found it strange that a man can apparently kill a king in broad daylight in his own room in his own castle, only to escape by jumping out of a nearby window and plummeting to freedom whilst the main character sort of just stands there with his sword out and takes the hit for the whole thing. Why didn't Geralt just teleport away like he did earlier? On the other hand, almost every female character is naked at one point during this game, which is edgy for Nintendo to say the least. So I guess there's that.			"

												After messing around with the tutorial and prologue, I never truly gave the Witcher much of a chance. It appeared to have a deep story and well-developed setting, but I didn't particularly enjoy the combat with a keyboard and mouse. Returning with an Xbox 360 controller, I now find the combat thoroughly enjoyable. The controls take some time to learn, but the combat is fair and requires thought (unless playing on easy). I am at the start of Chapter 2 and have officially become hooked on the Witcher universe. This has been one of my most enjoyable playthroughs this years. I greatly look forward to continuing the story in Witcher 3. If you are a fan of fantasy, adventure RPGs and clever dialogue, then I highly recommend the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition.			"

												""The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition"" is the title almost compulsory for fans of Geralt, but also for those who like a really dynamic fight. The story has great plots and you can go throw gameplay in many different ways and therefore there are different endings of the game. In addition to the main campaign is worth noting the arena mode, which occurs in the enhanced edition. Really worth to play!			"

												Just finished The Witcher 2 and I got to admit it's like it tries to be both a RPG and a VN, yet fails (as I see it) to be either. I guess that's just because I like my RPGs to be action RPGs and my VN be no action (in the sense of text and choiced only, nothing else). Yet I will recommend it for I suppose it's not that the game is bad, it's that I wanted not the things this game has to offer me and it's kind of my fault for not having thought this through.The fights are either too short (too few enemies) or either too hard (too strong enemies) the only fun being those fought when approaching the Harpies nests and on the Vergen's walls. Oh! And no experience for you, level up via the quests only, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (well, you technically can gain 2-3 levels by fighting during the game, but you have to fight loads of monsters, more than the game actually gives you. And you will not get the exp for them after some time, so no grinding for ya). The loot is poor and you are poor as the Price/Sell ratio is like x5, more for better items (buy for 2500, sell for 100, yeah, right. Or the crafting! Buy a recipe for 100 gold, buy ingridients for 150 gold + pay 20 gold to craft a subart... which you can buy for like 25 gold. Why, again?). Do I have to mention the horribly sluggish system of potions, alchemy, crafting, trading and menus in general? I had to ggole how to switch off the mouse smoothening (there is not a single PC player happy with mouse acceleration/deceleration)The ""VN"" element is... well it's not bad in and of itself, yet the differences in the endings are minute and the dialogue is diluted by the need to fight - or just run around - in between. So I won't be playing it through again, not in the nearest half a year, at least, I see no reason to. Fun is heavily diluted. For me at least.What an irony, but for the aforementioned combination the game might have been actually fun for me. Like if the action RPG elements were to be enhanced and stripped off of all the dialogue nonsense OR if the VN elements (well it's kind of R part of the RPG, so you should give them credit for that) were to be enhanced with meaningful differencies in endings and without the need to have to fight 2-3 enemies in between (come on, 500 enemies slain only after playing for good 30 hours?)But I assume all the modern ""story rich"" RPGs are in some way like that (ME, DE, whatever else). Or am I mistaken and the fighting system and other ""action"" elements of an RPG in those are fine?All in all I suppose personally I should have picked the Skyrim instead. Or Diablo 3, still haven't played but for its Demo.			"

												Note: You do not need to have played the first game in the series to play this. Many people turn it away due to it´s poor graphic quality. I say give it a go. If you can´t stand ""old style"" games you will however easily get immersed into The Witcher 2.  CD PROJEKT RED has brought Andrzej Sapkowski´s novels to life. I am 100% certain no other company could have done it as marvelous as they have. (Yes I have read all the books.) You are in for a real adventure with this one. If you are into linear RPG style games + Some added optional quests in each zone. The optional quests sometimes yeilds something you can always use as examples - Potion recipes, a treasure map, a book with useful information about some of the creatures you are battling or they can have some information about known characters. Then there´s the lustful side to Geralt. Sometimes you will be awarded sex with very graphic imagery and profanity. It´s a adult game so of course adult situations will occur.This is not your usual RPG -  You will come to love Geralt whether you´re a guy or a girl. The witcher 2 is a wast game with many memorable characters and monsters that you will meet on your quest to find out who the Assassins of Kings is. The game is divided into three acts each with their own unique environment. This is truly a epic game that deserves all the awards it has won. You will need to play through the game more than once (or watch a youtuber) play as in all RPG´s your decision has in impact in the world. Each decision needs to be considered as you will not know how it will impact the story ahead. One question that might seem insignificent can have a very big impact further on. I have played this game for many hours searching and discovering hidden caves with monsters or a tomb with a treasure chest. If you are not customed with this sort of game don´t go Hard mode and make yourself frustrated resulting in you not wanting to play anymore, however if you are up for a challange go ahead, there are so many magnificent encounters and I do believe playing them for the first time on Hard and not giving up will really reward you it will get your adrenaline pumping when you have just beaten a hard encounter.

												Very bulky combat that holds a lot of weight behind each swing, allows a lot of personalization in the way you play with a fully customizable skill tree along with an alchemy system that lets you experience combat differently with every potion; combat is skillful and interesting.

												Witcher 2 inspires awe, every game you play after you finish this game is a slight dissapointment. The story in this game has so many different choices and endings it feels like a different game everytime you choose a different path. The graphics are unreal and beat everything realeased, even today, the animations and voice acting is superb and the sounds are so clear and music is amazing and it fits really well into the dark fantasy world. There are some memorable tracks to this game which have made their way into my playlists.The combat style is not different from most rpg's, hack and slash, magic spells (called signs) and potions. Some people say it came out as half baked, but I love it and it really gets you to think about your stategy, especially against large groups of enemies. The constanting rolling around that you ahve to do to avoid enemy attacks is rather tiresome, as blocking is ineffective against many different enemies. The different skill trees are all very well balanced and each skill impacts combat and how you play big time. The drawback with the alchemy system is that potions can only be consumed outside of combat, so constantly saving before entering a new room is advisable, so it is possible to reload without worrying if you have lost a large portionof time spent doing quests. The main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia is a badass monster slayer who you just love form first sight (much like his hot girlfriend Triss!!). And the most hyped up and important part of the game, the story is written and directed like a AAA movie title, only ten times better! Going through the prologue is like watching Game of Thrones, it is awesome.This game also utilises Witcher 1 saves so all the different choices and descisions you made in that, impact your Witcher 2 game! The story's allusions to the whole witcher univerrse allow you to roleplay the witcher effectively, but the main plot pulls Geralt out of his main profession, he turns away from his witchering throughout much of the main plot, with only a few quests showing off his full monster hunting aspect. This game is magnificent, it is a visual feast and contains a plot which constantly twists and turns and gets you to think long and hard about decisions you make over your favourite characters.Overall - 99/100 Must play!

												The Witcher 2 is a well rounded and deep game. I've played upwards of 50 hours and am sitll in the infancy of the 2nd chapter of the game. The monstors are unique and the alchemy/crafting system is pretty detailed and rewarding. The story, thus far, has been pretty well thought out and the characters in the universe fit their role, from the main villians that motivate you to quest to get to them and defeat them, to the dock worker who tells you to screw yourself when you walk by. The only main gripes I have about the game are that, one, the inventory systems is clunky. You have some categories that help but you don't for junk and formulas need to be kept in inventory to use/take weight. The second is that the game isn't optimized. I had to go to minimum settings with a PC that should be able to run maximum. It's been improved in patches but is still somewhat of a problem.			"

												One of the best current rpgs. The Witcher 2 represents great dedication of developers to improve upon the original Witcher. Sequel is better at every aspect. Witcher 2 contains everything that good rpg needs: interesting world you will want to spend countless hours exploring, many different foes, good skill progress and exhilarating storyline. In addition, the devs continued to add new content for free and even released the improvements made for xbox version to pc users for free also. It is a rare sight nowadays when other companies are releasing countless dlcs cut from the game for additional price.			"

												I warn those in advanced.  This is not your typical RPG.  It is not a sandbox, create your own empty character kind of game.  This isn't Dragon Age.  If that's what you're qxpecting, look elsewhere.  This game is complex, difficult, and treats you like an adult.  There is no hand holding.  But it is, overall, quite the amazing game.  I had already played the Witcher 2 on xbox 360, but I always wanted to try it on PC.  It's even more wonderful.  Load screens, in comparison to the 360 version, are a breeze.  The combat is better and I don't need to mention the graphics.  Play it before Witcher 3 that way you better understand the world.			"

												This was the best RPG of 2011, and for me, 2013 as well. After two complete playthroughs to get the full story, I believe this is the most well written story in a fantasy RPG to date. The combat is also a joy once you get the hang of it's initially unintuitive style. Witcher 2 is more narrative heavy than most action RPGs, but that's what brought me back for a second full play. Two years later the graphics are still striking to behold at times. This game is definitely not for everyone, especially if you get bored with long story sequences. Passive or casual gamers will quickly get lost in the narrative. It was the most enjoyable RPG played by me the year it came out, and I was hard pressed to claim an equal this past year when I played a second time.			"

												Great game. One of, if not the best RPG i have played. Its not as free as Skyrim or such but its beautifully made, the characters are strong characters you care about and the game is deep. At first it can be off putting, but stick at it and you will be rewarded, make potions, traps and use them. The combat is frustrating at first, much like the first, and you will only start to get the hang of it half way through, but its great. As you progress you realise Geralt is agility based, and excells when you keep him moving and taking on the enemies without getting in the middle of them and slugging it out. Once you realise he is not a strong slugger but an agile fencer, combat all becomes a dream.The story is complex, the decisions are also so, and though there isnt a right and wrong choice, each one has a strong repercussion. You shape the game as you play. Great fun, and at some points i was stuck for minutes trying to decide who to help or which path to take. By the end of it you will be itching for part three, and if not, you are dont have a pulse or are a drowner...4 Thumbs up. "

												Picked it up for € 3.99 on special offer and boy, was that a deal. People talk about ""the graphics"", but that's the wrong term actually. Yes, the 3D engine is good for a 2011 game, but what really blows your mind is the LEVEL DESIGN. Screenshots don't do it justice since you really have to experience the diversity & complexity of the world hands-on. The entire visual design of the game is just so masterfully done that I don't even mind the fact that it regularly crosses the threshold of kitsch I can tolerate. Especially the sex scenes could do with a little less stilted moaning & catwalk moves, and instead some more teasing & creativity in general.So while I'm recounting the downers here's the rest of them:- Animations (doors, climbing, taking/dealing damage etc.) sometimes lock other movement annoyingly long. Especially casting sometimes gets locked for no apparent reason, so I end up standing like a dork in the middle of battle while hitting the cast button until it finally happens.- Male characters are quite well done, both visually, substantually and vocally. They are diverse and relate to the world in a meaningful manner. Female characters however seem generally a little more shallow. There are very few meaningful female roles, and all female characters in the game seem to fit a much more narrow blueprint. They look more alike, they act more similar, heck, they even seem to be all the same age. It's like somebody wanted all the women to fit a particular stereotype of ""hotness"" which gets boring very quickly (I still like Triss though, but she's about the only deep female NPC).Other than that I really can't think of any more downsides to this game, so since the ups have been discussed in other reviews extensively, it should be clear that this is a SUPER-awesome ARPG.

												The Witcher 2 is unlike any rpg that came before, because of one word only ""story."" The witcher 2 might not offer a open world but what it does offer is a great story. Have you ever been lured in to a rpg with them saying ""choice will change your game."" Well, The witcher delivers in aces, not only will your choice change the future, but where you are in the world and the people you meet. Sure the're are set pieces and story character you have to meet, but i found they always had something new to say or a new quest for you to do. The choices witcher 2 supplies has you picking from one evil or another evil, with no one being greater than the other. You don't gain lightside or darkside points, you just are the way you chose. Combat is pretty straight forward, you have a sliver sword that kills monsters and a iron sword to kill humans. Potions can be consumed before a fight to say increase your ability to dodge incoming attacks or see in the dark. Geralt of rivia has large skill tree, and each point you put it makes you feel stronger, wither it be strength, wisdom, or alchemy. Geralt the character you lead through this adventure is a anti-hero to a T. Geralt's profession is monster slaying, with a bit of humans on the side. All and all I enjoyed the game, set paths and hand holding hurt the opening, but what is to follow is indeed a rpg to be had. P.S with your steam purchase you also get the game ""DRM free"" from Good Old Games website as well.			"

The combat is fun, while also being challenging as long you're not playing on Easy.  There's multiple ways to go through the story, so there's definite replay value.  The only con I can think of is the game isn't optimised very well, so either have a great computer, or run it on minimum settings (Still looks pretty great, imo)TL;DR  Great game, get it!

Rank: 8.5/10Recommendation(s): Play another Witcher title before (The Witcher 1)Major Theme: Slightly sluggish, but a great mix between 1 and 3.Bought at Price: $2.75 - Steam SaleI honestly thought I was going to have enough will power to play the Witcher series in order, but that turned out to be not the case. The first title turned out to be so dry; it was equivalent to having a dry mouth, being dragged face down in a desert for kilometers. There was a serious lack of humor, but the combat system proved to be greatly overhauled. While the system having its own new issues, made gameplay more pleasant than the machine like structure of the first.Graphics are vastly enhanced from the first, but still do not compare anywhere close to that of the third (and last?) Witcher title. Maybe that’s why they called it the “enhanced edition”. On that note, I cannot describe the difference between the two editions, as I have not played the original release.While the story was logical, and easy to follow, was a little let down. By no means was it horrible or not worth playing, it just again lacked humor. At some points in the game, you will find yourself playing a part just to move the story along (which felt very much like the first game in the series).I probably will not be replaying this title as I will be doing with the 3rd, but that should be no judge of quality.

												Geralt of Rivia, aka Gwynbleidd, the White Wolf, the Butcher of Blaviken, is the son of a sorcerer and a warrior subjected to mutations and rigorous sword and sorcery training as a child. Therefore he became a monster slayer, a mercenary known as a witcher that wanders the world seeeking work. His friend, and also a bard, Dandelion recounts his adventures as ballads and poems of the most famous witcher against monster and other evils thrown against him by fate. Geralt is not a good man, as Dandelion says himself, but he tries to maintain his humanity. He does not believe in destiny but he acts as a balance while using his steel swords against human adversaries and the silver sword to slice through monsters alike. In The Witcher 2, Geralt is mistakenly confused as a Kingslayer and as so must search for the real Kingslayer to bring him to his justice. You will face many creatures and monsters, elves and dwarves, and you will have to choose who are your allies and who will feel the wrath of your blade. Geralt is always searching for his lost past and to help him, he can count on his friends the sorcerer Triss Merigold, the bard Dandelion, the dice poker addicted Zoltan, and others that might or might not help him in his endevour. A truely epic tale, that deserves all the praise it got and more to come when Geralt, once again, start wandering the lands of the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire in search for more work and blood against all kinds of monsters. After all, that's what the most famous Witcher is after, isn't it ? Maybe not.			"

												This is a worthy sequel to one of the most engrossing and original RPGs to come out in years.Best features: - Visually stunning. A blend of technical wizardry and gorgeous design - if your PC can handle max settings and ubersampling then you're in for a treat! - Sophisticated storytelling. This game does not patronise the player - the sheer depth available within the backstory and surroundings puts most contemporary RPGs to shame. - Decisions. The huge and meaningful choices you are faced with contribute to some very immersive storytelling. - Quality franchise. The world in Sapkowski's books makes most fantasy games look pitifully childish by comparison. - Soundtrack. Way above average for a game.Worst features: - Savegames. Once savegames stack up (which they will) the main menu will load very slowly and eventually trying to load a game will crash to desktop. Easily fixed by archiving your saves elsewhere, but not good enough. - Pacing. Major plot triggers are sometimes sudden and unexpected, so the game whisks you along too fast. Ideally the quest designers would have found a better way to blend narrative with exploration. It sucks to sit through a long story sequence only to reload because you decide you weren't ready yet. - Decisions. This may seem odd, as I already listed this as one of the best things about the game, but the developers get a bit too excited at times and some of the big decision points in the story feel very artificial. Binary choices appear which are at odds with the plot, presumably just because the game hasn't thrown one at you in a while.Hopefully I've made these minor drawbacks sound like what they are; minor. I was extremely impressed with The Witcher 2. It's a seriously high-quality effort from a studio that has the guts to do things a bit differently.If you're even remotely interested in RPGs and fantasy, my advice is to play it.			"

												A masterwork. The only problem I find in this game is that sometimes cutscenes feel a bit awkward, with Geralt moving his arms in a weird way (could be a bug/glitch but I'm actually not that sure) or looking at someone else with weird face. It could actually also be me.One of the best action-RPG games without any doubt. The combat is pretty awesome combining spells and two swords. There's also crafting recipes in towns and upgrades, loads of gear and awesome locations (play this game on a high-end machine - if you have a not-so-powerful PC just go for the console version).A pure gem - buy it (you have to prepare yourself for Witcher 3!!).

												The Witcher 2 is somewhat linear compared to the first game, with a heavier focus on action and story than variety and depth, much like the difference between Dragon Age 1 and 2; The first game didn't look as good, nor was the combat as fluid, but it certainly felt more like an RPG. That being said, it's still an exceptional game that walks a fine line between maturity and juvenile fantasy. Luckily though, even with all the sex and violence, it manages to maintain a respectability that only a dark fantasy done very well could hope to obtain.			"

												This was the best RPG of 2011, and for me, 2013 as well. After two complete playthroughs to get the full story, I believe this is the most well written story in a fantasy RPG to date. The combat is also a joy once you get the hang of it's initially unintuitive style. Witcher 2 is more narrative heavy than most action RPGs, but that's what brought me back for a second full play. Two years later the graphics are still striking to behold at times. This game is definitely not for everyone, especially if you get bored with long story sequences. Passive or casual gamers will quickly get lost in the narrative. It was the most enjoyable RPG played by me the year it came out, and I was hard pressed to claim an equal this past year when I played a second time.			"

												The Witcher 2, is my favorite game of all time. Here is why:When you first get into this game, one of the most incredibly made cinematics bids you welcome to the world and story. I am amazed that a small company like CDPR (used to be) could possibly deliever one of the most beautiful PC titles of all time, even in 2014. But these guys did it right. With a huge focus on story and it's characters, this game slowly opens up for a world that has so much more depth and feel to it than many other AAA open world games. This world has the advantage on being based on a great bookseries and a having a company behind it, that has the best intentions for everything that is behind it.It can be confusing to begin with, but without a doubt fully playable, without having played the first installment of the series. The mechanics can be a little clunky, and the developers have been forced to limit the world to big explorable areas instead of making it truly open world. But it works out for this game - Simply because everything you CAN do, is so incredibly detailed and perfected in every way. The lore and story is absolutely amazing and along with a great soundtrack and mindblowing visuals, it adds up to be the very best game I've ever played.I write this review after completing the game several times, on each difficulty and gathering all achievements. It is extremely challenging in beginning, but in this game, preperation and strategy, is highly rewarded. This is what makes this game so different and so much better from other games:- Choices matter. The choices you make can change the story completely. There's actually two completely seperated chapters based only one single choice in the game. It makes everything so much more interesting.- Everything is means something. There's no generic sides quests, like you know it from Skyrim and WoW. There's a lot of content, but they are all well thought out. You won't be forced to gather resources for hours - It will make sense in the end.- The story is so rich and incredibly well put together. Unlike many other RPGs, you don't get to costumize your character, but also means that the story becomes much more personal, mature and interesting. - The world, based on a book franchise, that I have now read, because of my love of the game gives this game a huge advantage. The lore is deep and detailed and CDPR has truly taken care of this in the best way possibly. This game also features some of the best soundtracks I know of.I am incredibly excited for The Witcher 3. And I believe that, to be the only game to ever beat this. That experience will show a truly open world, with a much bigger budget and therefore, far fewer limits. The simple fact, that the main story is around 50 hours long, says a lot about how important the story is in this franchise. I would recommend anyone who want to play Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, to begin here. It'll give you a wonderful time, and prepare you for the third installment. I like the first game as well, but I think it might be a little too outdated by now. TL;DR: If you want to be a medieval jedi knight, you should play this game. And who doesn't want to be a medieval jedi knight? Seriously?			"

												The Witcher 2 is a vast improvement over its predecessor, and, as the franchise is known for, has many new and variable tropes for a Fantasy RPG game. To highlight some of the game's best features, The Witcher 2's combat is reminiscent of Batman: Arkham Asylum, but requires far greater skill and preparation. I'm not new to Action-RPG's by any means, but I found the first half of the game very challenging and new to grasp, which is a good thing. The combat is by far the most enjoyable, compelling, intense, and straight forward experience I've had in a while, and for the first time, the magic, enchanting, and alchemy systems aren't overly convaluted.The story of The Witcher 2 is dark and riviting, and is filled with lots of mystery, political strife, and several player-driven decisions during major events. The only complaint is that the game takes too fondly to the objectification of most, if not all, of it's female characters. I won't get into detail, but if you're ok with that, then I highly recommend playing The Witcher 2 for a new Action-Adventure-RPG experience.			"

												I was very excited to try out the Witcher series since RPG/Adventure games are my favourite type of genre. The trailer was hype and the atmosphere was immensly pretty. At the start, the game itself gave off a complex vibe. I thought the Witcher was going to be a very difficult game to learn. Thankfully, I learn new things quickly. The cutscenes were also very interesting to watch. However, there was one scene that caught me by surprise. Near the beginning of the game, there was a scene with Geralt and a random chick in a bed. Out of nowhere, It shows Geralt and the female attempting to do bad things with each other. She's ♥♥♥♥ing bare ♥♥♥ naked, my peepee doesn't know what's going on and I'm looking around to see If one of my family memebers are going to walk in and look at this nasty scene. Like, seriously. I don't want them to come in here and see this scene. Like, come on. If they see this and they think: ""Oh my, you're a freaky person' They think I'm a freaky person, they gonna take my ♥♥♥♥ing computer away. So, we gotta be more careful next time, eh? Anyway, the scene was called ""Day of the assault."" I thought it was going to be some badass fighting scene and I was LITERALLY going to call my younger brother over to come watch this ""Day of the assault"" with me. At least call the scene something that implied nudity, such as: ""Dominating the battlefield"" or maybe ""Pounding the enemy from behind."" Regardless, It's a good game and I like it a lot.			"

												After messing around with the tutorial and prologue, I never truly gave the Witcher much of a chance. It appeared to have a deep story and well-developed setting, but I didn't particularly enjoy the combat with a keyboard and mouse. Returning with an Xbox 360 controller, I now find the combat thoroughly enjoyable. The controls take some time to learn, but the combat is fair and requires thought (unless playing on easy). I am at the start of Chapter 2 and have officially become hooked on the Witcher universe. This has been one of my most enjoyable playthroughs this years. I greatly look forward to continuing the story in Witcher 3. If you are a fan of fantasy, adventure RPGs and clever dialogue, then I highly recommend the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition.			"

												 Really interesting storyline and characters, and actually manages to make you feel emotionally attached to them. An awesome RPG that deals with difficult topics such as racism and sex in a very mature and adult way. Combat is incredibly hard to begin with - it has an enormous learning curve for people who haven't played the original game, but it is the unforgiving combat and reliance on quicksaving that makes it such a challenging and enjoying game. As with any other good RPG, the lore is intriguing, the characters are varied and engaging, and the choices the player makes will have real impact in the future. Graphical fidelity is still top-notch desite being a slightly older title than new games. Overall a timeless classic, and a great example of how other games in this genre should be. TL/DR - 10/10 would highlly recommend. (Please note, the time played above is only whilst logged in online, but including offline time it probably adds up to about 30 hours so far :P)			"

												First let me say The Witcher 2 is an incredible game that should not be missed by any fan of the RPG genre. The goods are as follows-Great combat that combines magic, swordplay, and crafting very effectively-Excellent story that's well written-Good voice actingThe cons are as follows-Bad map system. I found myself many times getting lost and in some way either on top of the objective marker or below it. Being a long game in the first place wasting time navigating the bad map was a bit of a disappointment.-Not enough loot to really feel rewarded from combat-There was a lack of accomplishment upon leveling up. This is due to the fact that the leveling system never really shows you where you are in level so your leveling is out of sight and out of mind. Although this isn't a huge drawback, it does subdue the desire to reach level capOverall I would highly recommend this game to anyone, especially with the witcher 3: the wild hunt coming up as well as the low cost during steam sales.

												One of my flat out favorite games of all time. Maybe I'm finally an old RPG gamer who's become a sucker for graphics. But the combat was good, the story and quests excellent, the production values extremely high, the progression and game design concepts quite nice to boot.At $2.99 during this steam sale it is a steal and... not a half. A whole. Of course, it's a steam sale that brought this game to me. And the game, along with the guilt at getting such a steal, that got me paying full price for Wild Hunt. Even if it sucks, the devs deserve it.			"

												The Witcher 2 is somewhat linear compared to the first game, with a heavier focus on action and story than variety and depth, much like the difference between Dragon Age 1 and 2; The first game didn't look as good, nor was the combat as fluid, but it certainly felt more like an RPG. That being said, it's still an exceptional game that walks a fine line between maturity and juvenile fantasy. Luckily though, even with all the sex and violence, it manages to maintain a respectability that only a dark fantasy done very well could hope to obtain.			"

I gues the game will be at its best on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (More open world, more variety, more quests,better graphics,better story) . Can't wait for that *-----*			"

												This game is a masterpiece. A fantasy RPG with gorgeous visuals, decision based progression, great sound design and a mind blowing story. The few shortcomings this game has (the skill trees and the odd combat) are easily fixed by an official mod released by CDProject Red free of charge to everyone on their Redkit website. http://redkit.cdprojektred.com/index.php?c=mod&m=show&p=77As a gamer you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game, I strongly suggest you play trought its predecessor before moving on to this game despite it being quite old.P.S.

												One of my absolute favorite games of this decade. The grim, unpredictable story is just amazing. Character development is great. Dialogue is exciting. The choices you are gonna have to make, are many in numbers and impacts the story greatly, leaving you the desire to play it again and go different routes. Definetely not a game you wanna rush. Combat is good. Skill progression is fun, with lots of options. Graphically, it's still amazing, even when compared to recent games. Exploration feels great, and rewarding. Good variety of fun, interesting and well designed side quests, with well written stories. Overall, this game is a piece of art. This is one of those games you should play before you die. And I'm not lightly saying that. It is a great example of how a game should be.     I cannot wait to see what CDR does with The Witcher 3. I have no doubt it will be a great game, and maybe even more than that.Need I say more? Go, minions.. Go, and BUY this game.			"

												Witcher 2 inspires awe, every game you play after you finish this game is a slight dissapointment. The story in this game has so many different choices and endings it feels like a different game everytime you choose a different path. The graphics are unreal and beat everything realeased, even today, the animations and voice acting is superb and the sounds are so clear and music is amazing and it fits really well into the dark fantasy world. There are some memorable tracks to this game which have made their way into my playlists.The combat style is not different from most rpg's, hack and slash, magic spells (called signs) and potions. Some people say it came out as half baked, but I love it and it really gets you to think about your stategy, especially against large groups of enemies. The constanting rolling around that you ahve to do to avoid enemy attacks is rather tiresome, as blocking is ineffective against many different enemies. The different skill trees are all very well balanced and each skill impacts combat and how you play big time. The drawback with the alchemy system is that potions can only be consumed outside of combat, so constantly saving before entering a new room is advisable, so it is possible to reload without worrying if you have lost a large portionof time spent doing quests. The main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia is a badass monster slayer who you just love form first sight (much like his hot girlfriend Triss!!). And the most hyped up and important part of the game, the story is written and directed like a AAA movie title, only ten times better! Going through the prologue is like watching Game of Thrones, it is awesome.This game also utilises Witcher 1 saves so all the different choices and descisions you made in that, impact your Witcher 2 game! The story's allusions to the whole witcher univerrse allow you to roleplay the witcher effectively, but the main plot pulls Geralt out of his main profession, he turns away from his witchering throughout much of the main plot, with only a few quests showing off his full monster hunting aspect. This game is magnificent, it is a visual feast and contains a plot which constantly twists and turns and gets you to think long and hard about decisions you make over your favourite characters.Overall - 99/100 Must play!

												The Witcher 2, is my favorite game of all time. Here is why:When you first get into this game, one of the most incredibly made cinematics bids you welcome to the world and story. I am amazed that a small company like CDPR (used to be) could possibly deliever one of the most beautiful PC titles of all time, even in 2014. But these guys did it right. With a huge focus on story and it's characters, this game slowly opens up for a world that has so much more depth and feel to it than many other AAA open world games. This world has the advantage on being based on a great bookseries and a having a company behind it, that has the best intentions for everything that is behind it.It can be confusing to begin with, but without a doubt fully playable, without having played the first installment of the series. The mechanics can be a little clunky, and the developers have been forced to limit the world to big explorable areas instead of making it truly open world. But it works out for this game - Simply because everything you CAN do, is so incredibly detailed and perfected in every way. The lore and story is absolutely amazing and along with a great soundtrack and mindblowing visuals, it adds up to be the very best game I've ever played.I write this review after completing the game several times, on each difficulty and gathering all achievements. It is extremely challenging in beginning, but in this game, preperation and strategy, is highly rewarded. This is what makes this game so different and so much better from other games:- Choices matter. The choices you make can change the story completely. There's actually two completely seperated chapters based only one single choice in the game. It makes everything so much more interesting.- Everything is means something. There's no generic sides quests, like you know it from Skyrim and WoW. There's a lot of content, but they are all well thought out. You won't be forced to gather resources for hours - It will make sense in the end.- The story is so rich and incredibly well put together. Unlike many other RPGs, you don't get to costumize your character, but also means that the story becomes much more personal, mature and interesting. - The world, based on a book franchise, that I have now read, because of my love of the game gives this game a huge advantage. The lore is deep and detailed and CDPR has truly taken care of this in the best way possibly. This game also features some of the best soundtracks I know of.I am incredibly excited for The Witcher 3. And I believe that, to be the only game to ever beat this. That experience will show a truly open world, with a much bigger budget and therefore, far fewer limits. The simple fact, that the main story is around 50 hours long, says a lot about how important the story is in this franchise. I would recommend anyone who want to play Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, to begin here. It'll give you a wonderful time, and prepare you for the third installment. I like the first game as well, but I think it might be a little too outdated by now. TL;DR: If you want to be a medieval jedi knight, you should play this game. And who doesn't want to be a medieval jedi knight? Seriously?			"

												The Witcher 2 is an exemplarary sequel that manages to build upon the strengths of the Witcher 1, namely it's combat mechanics and plot twists, while addressing and improving on it's predecessor's flaws . An outstanding Role Playing Game, no two replays of this game will ever be the same. In the Witcher 2, you are thrust into the character of Geralt of Rivia, famed monster slayer and unintended savior of a king, where you must make the decisions that alter the fates of not only the protagonist but the world and its many characters about him. Its a compelling narrative about maintaining neutrality in a world that is morally ambiguous and deceptive. You will feel the sting of unintended consequences, and with a variety of supporting characters, all whose lives and motivations you will come to understand, decisions in this game are not made lightly . Aside from its storyline, the actual mechanics of the gameplay are superbly executed. Combat is visceral and tactical. Magic, Alchemy, and swordplay are your means of defeating your enemies, and the Witcher 2 introduces a menagerie containing all sorts of monsters, both fantastically gargantuan & sometimes human, whose strengths/weaknesses must be taken into account, especially on the hardest of difficulties. In the end, the Witcher 2 is a satisfying video game with a storyline that leaves it's impression upon you because of it's relation to your impact as Geralt. I'm optimistic about this franchise and look forward to future sequels.			"

However in terms of story and gameplay I will absolutely attest to Witcher 2 having the highest caliber of both. The plot and story may be  my favorite ones told and experienced in the video game medium, and I've spent at least a hundred hours just to experience all the little choices and actions that this game has to offer. And that's without me even mentioning the soundtrack or general atmosphere of the game, which I enjoy very much. For its current price it's an absolute steal, and I say this as someone who purchased the console version at full price. I'd buy it multiple times again and again if I could, just to show my support for the game studio that released this.			"

												This game is pure crack, and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Rough in a number of areas, sure, but this is definitely one of the best RPGs I've played in a while. The world is not your typical fantasy world despite having elves and dwarves, your choices really do matter, character building in this game is solid, the combat system is lovely (save for a few quirks here and there), and the graphics are just plain gorgeous!

												The Witcher 2 was a wonderful game in all aspects and a major improvement over the first game in the series. Geralt isn't only dealing with Temeria anymore. The fate of all the Northern Kingdoms is at stake. The story and narration lives up to the hype of the first, and in fact, has Geralt making many more decisions with varying consequences. Characters are much more fleshed out. Be prepared to face situations where you're wedged between two characters that you like, only being able to help one of them. Many times, decisions simply don't have a right answer, and other times it can be good vs bad mystery that you have to decipher by paying attention to clues given to you. You get to shape Geralt to become the character you want. My main complaint, is that the game eventually forces you to a fork in the road. This decision essentially takes over a full chapter in the story, and I although you get to visit places from both paths in one playthrough, you can end up missing a lot of important story elements if you aren't careful. I ended up glossing over the sidequest for an important character in the Witcher 3 because I was so invested in finishing the main quest. It's also totally neat to see decisions carry over from the previous game, and don't forget, the decisions you make also carry over to the Witcher 3!Combat has been completely overhauled. Say goodbye to the timed clicks, because the new combat system is entirely momentum based. The new perk tree allows Geralt to fight as a swordsman, a mage, a hunter, or any combination. Sword swings are dictated with the left and right mouse buttons, alllowing Geralt to alternate between fast or strong slashes. Enemies will flinch when attacked, giving your offenses a sense of weight. Spells and sidearms can be conveniently selected and used via a quickbar, and Geralt can roll around dodging attacks like a madman. There's still much room for improvement, however. Fighting still feels a bit clunky at times, and ragdolls (or the lack of) can make killing enemies really awkward because they just topple over. Attacks from bosses can also have extended hitboxes, as I have died many times over after getting clipped by an attack that was seemingly out of my range. Rolling may become your primary means of mobility, and it can be troublesome to use. Enemies will tend to swarm you, and blocking/reposting leaves you vulnerable from other angles while rolling may tumble you into other enemies. It's all about tactically positioning yourself, which can be seen as a welcome challenge, or an eventual annoyance. I will definitely say that there is a high learning curve to this new combat style. Unlike the first Witcher, which has Geralt acquire each of his Witcher signs throughout the game, the Witcher 2 throws all of the signs at you at once, along with a load of projectiles and potions which aren't explained very well at all. I totally failed the tutorial, which suggested for me to play on easy. I was still able to complete the game on hard, but it was far from easy. Aside from the main gameplay, you can also participate in dice poker, arm wrestling, and brawls (QTE simulator). They weren't that fun, but hey, they're not nothing.Graphically, the game is beautifully designed. The forest outside Flotsam was densely packed with greenery and looked totally sinister at night time. It was dissapointing that there were no major cities to explore, but each settlement Geralt visits has a unique rugged atmosphere. I do think that the world is a bit oversaturated, though. Colors tend to be very sharp. Characters also have great face textures, and unique characters have great memorable designs. Unfortunately, a lot of models are reused throughout the game for minor characters. The music, although my least favorite of the three Witcher games, still isn't bad at all. There was a wide array of scores that fit both emotional and intense scenes from the game. To me, the soundtrack just sounded more like stereotypical fantasy music as opposed to The Witcher or The WItcher 3 (hands down my favorite!). Still, try listening to the song Sorceresses. It's quite enchanting.In the end despite some flaws, The Witcher 2 was a true fantasy RPG mixed with exceedingly challenging yet rewarding combat. I highly recommend playing the original Witcher to get a better sense of the massive story/world and a basic handling for Geralts abilities. It is defintely an exciting experience to learn about the world of the WItcher. Pros:-Great interactive story filled with morality-based decisions-Challenging but rewarding combat-Interesting and well designed recurring characters-Beautiful level design-Solid soundtrackCons: -Combat can seem a bit unrefined-Newbies to the Witcher may have a hard time finding their footing-Fork in the road can cause you to miss some story elementsTL;DR: Play as Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf, as you choose the lesser evil, mess around with spells, roll all over the place during fights, and die a lot.

												The lame action-based fight system is a disappointment. I mean Witcher 1 didn't have a good fight system, but who cares? It was a RPG with great story, atmosphere and original alchemy system, and these aspects weren't improved In W2. Otherwise, they tried a new fight system that really didn't work well. I still recommend it for the story and atmosphere, but it's certainly a worst game than W1, which is better in all aspects, except graphics and art.			"

												I played this on XBOX 360 when it came to console.  This game has an amazing story, amazing gameplay and is overall one of my favorite RPGs ever. It's story has multiple paths, and neither of the choices are clearly black or white which I like.  It is directed toward a very mature audience which is a nice change of pace.  It's combat system is very extensive and unique, it certainly has a learning curve, but it works very, very well.  Now to play it on the PC and try a different path before The Witcher 3 comes out. Main story took me 25-30 hours.Update--September 2014: Replayed it on PC and it still holds up as an amazing game.  Graphics on PC are amazing too, looks like a next-gen game which is impressive as it originally was relesed in 2011.  Second playthrough is much faster (~20 hours), and taking a different path kept the game fresh.			"

												I really wish they would quit advertising this game for linux on the front page of steam.. Keep selling it for linux if they must, but its advertisement as being available for steamos/linux has been on the front page for far too long. This is not what we want linux noobs to try and play and think this is what linux gaming is about.. they have heard enough crap about gaming on linux and this only adds fuel to the negative press linux gets as a gaming platform. Yes it starts up.. and yes you can technically ""play"" it. Though I cannot suggest anybody play this title in linux. I had picked it up on sale and never really played it until the linux version came out and I finally got excited for it only to be really let down. It is NOT a native linux title by any stretch of the imagination as it uses a ""wine type"" wrapper to make it run on linux. So just deal with it and play this game on windows if you are going to play it. I will not ""not"" recomend this game as it's gorgeous if you have the hardware for it and from what I have played is a great game. I am just adding to the growing list of warnings about this title for linux so the linux noobs don't get the wrong idea.EDIT* Forgot I wrote this, I should note that they made great strides in getting the performance of the EON wrapper to a much more acceptable level and I can actually recommend it to be played in Linux now. Don't expect it to run as well as in windows but it is certainly acceptable IMO.			"

												Well... What can i say im not done with the game but god. The story is so good and just i hate haveing to leave it for just going pee or poo. now thats just one thing im not dont with i love this game so much and i need the ending soon. Now for the gameplay. On easy fun and still not boreing like most games some thigns are still hard you still need to learn how to fight diffrent badies mostly monsters. and you hunt them you a witcher its what you do. There is really no bad thing about the fighting gameplay i think i do keep it on the lower levels just for the story and fun. So if you kinda stupit (like me) the game tells you how to kill monsters after you kill alot of them also some cool lore about them. Like with the Harpers (spelling is BAD) the first time you unlock the lore for them you find out they steal dreams while you sleep, also you dont get them back and they feed more off nightmares so thats good for some people. Now for the story stright up without spoilers. ITS FREAKING ASWOME! Now this is just the best story in a game ive seen in a long time just so good i never wanna stop playing jsut to see what happens next and theres HUGE choices to make and they can change everything. Also first time you see you girlfriend shes nude so BEWBS :).  Now for the bad things....  theres gliches for sure its almsot like skyrim kinda with them. Theres less but there wierd and some of them almost break the game for me and theres one bit in chapter 2 where the game dosent really tell you what to do so i kind adident die but got really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it kept restarting me at teh same stupit place. but all in all its good. i give it a 9/10.

The ConsipracyCD Project RED have sold their souls in exchange for creating perfect digital art.The Original ClassicI remember back then, when the first Witcher came out it was something refreshing, captivating, even good, but still it wasn’t spectacular, despite some people calling it a new best RPG. Among its great strengths in story, quests, art and music it definitely had glaring issues: most notably, some annoying (to the point of being silly) combat moves and the fact that a good two thirds of it is spent in some sort of swamps, sewers and similar-looking dungeons.There was no hint of something huge coming ahead.Enter the Mighty SequelBut suddenly and unexpectedly, The Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings is upon us. And here I am, trying to review it with my jaw dropped and dangling somewhere around my knees.You are Geralt, a witcher — a professional monster slayer caught in a midst of political conflict, intrigue and soon after that, on a long quest to clear your good name and discover more pieces in attempt to solve a puzzle of Wild Hunt and your dark past.Now this is something like ubelievable upgrade over previous installement, unmatched by anything in recent history. Everything you can possibly think of have been drastically improved, expanded and taken to breathtaking levels of visuals, music and sound. All environments are unique and are extremely rich in details: there’s no copy-paste ever.The characters, even NPCs, are alive, deep and interesting. There’s no other RPG where you would stop just to listen to NPC talk and smile at some story they tell each other. Every place, every spot, be it in town or outside, has an event connected to it and some amazing quest you can take on: escape from prison (be a master of stealth, or you can make it a little rough), participate in an assault on rebellious town alongisde king and teach his stupid son some good lesson, prevent military abuse of innocent civillians by beating an officer in a one-on-one swordfight, and get away with it because your king favors you so much; visit abandoned and haunted asylum to calm down the spirits of its victims and learn about its grim past, uncover treason and crime, take a taste of dirty medieval town life by participating in brawls, dice poker and arm wrestling games — and earn some additional coin with that!But There’s Much More!Meet mages, trolls (friendly and not so much), fight a giant Cthulhu with a sorceress by your side, join elves in their guerilla struggle against humans, assist dwarves and visit their mysterious town hidden somewhere deep in the mountains or, if you rather prefer that, stay in a dirty human military camp and become a new star of its colloseum-like fighting arena. The choice is always yours: so be prepared to take it and face the consequences (or enjoy them :-).CombatAnd did I even mention how great fights can be? Devise your tactics, approach and hunt monsters: all different, inhabiting their own areas and requiring unique means to successfully kill; pursue finest gear upgrades to assist yourself in your dirty job. Harvest for ingredients during your trips outside to brew and drink awesome poisions (of a witcher sort) and acquire inhuman powers for a short amount time. Buy materials, schematics and construct deadly traps, bombs and daggers to leave your enemies no chance. Approach several knights that dared to threaten you and perform a powerful finisher move, killing them all at once. Redirect arrows back at your enemies, use powerful witcher magic tricks to trap or stun your foes: block, riposte, perform a quick roll away, then jump and cut your unfortunate foe through while he recovers from a good blast of your yrden (not a typo). You have to fight dirty: you have to fight like a witcher.And all that above is just barely one third of what is in store for you.ConclusionI have no idea how CDPR were able to pull that all off.(Disregard my hours, I own it from elsewhere.)* * *[A blast of fire from dragon’s breath]— Witcher, how do you fight something like THIS?!— You don’t, you run.— Some professional you are!Outstanding.

												The Witcher 2 continues the epic story of professional monster slayer for hire; Geralt of Rivia. If you have played the first game you will probably already have an idea of what you can expect. The Witcher 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game. If you haven't played the first you may be a bit at a loss with regards to some elements in the story.Without spoiling the story you proceed through the game searching for the 'kingslayer' and the choices you make will ultimately decide the ending of the story you get. (This ending can then be transferred to Witcher 3.) You follow one of two main story paths. You either can side with blue stripes commander Vernon Roche or with Scoitatel renegade and guerilla fighter Lor'veth. The combat in Witcher 2 has been refined considerably from the first game. whereas the first game relied on a timing mechanic; The Witcher 2 adds in things like parry's to the mix. I strongly recommend playing the first game prior as it will give greater context to the events that occur in this follow up. I also strongly recommend playing this game prior to Witcher 3 for the same reason. However the Witcher 3 does a decent job of providing additional information about the world and characters. You can find these in in-game character profiles as well as books you can find during your playthrough.As you can see it took me about 40 or so hours to play through the game. But this is a game where your investment will pay off with a satisfying conclusion that you can then build on in the Witcher 3. If you are looking for a deep story driven RPG where there is no 'right' choice; and for those choices to matter? Witcher 2 is a fantastic choice.			"

												Alright, I'm here! I'm very late to the party, but finally I'm here. It only took close to five years. What took me so long, you ask? Well, part of the answer is that I'm not that into RPGs, but I've heard so much good about The Witcher 3 so I had to play the second to be able to import the save file to the third game. ""But why didn't you play the first game?"", good question. I did play the first game for some hours, but as many others I stopped due to it's fighting mechanics being really bad. Storywise, it was just fine.So, what did I think about this game? It's a great looker, even though it has been five years since its first release (Enhanced Edition was released a year later). The voice acting is as solid as expected - especially Geralt's voice. The background music is really fitting and ups the mood for the player, really bombastic and energetic music when there's a huge battle against a dragon or something like that. The story was great and can't wait to see how they continue it in the third game.But most of all - if you're a fan of RPGs and you haven't play this one yet, I do recommend you do that. When there's a sale, you can get this game for less than €5, that's NOTHING.			"

												Amazing game! Can't have enough of it. Despite the incredibly high learning curve that the combat system has, and despite hating the fact that in order to survive, in more than one occasion, it is required to just run a couple of minutes in circle, probably, because the game offers a different combat system in comparison with The Witcher, it is possible that I've forgotten all about preparations for a battle, but in my defense, many times, you just get ambush into fight, with no preparation at all, and (one last despite) despite being the world's slowest Witcher to draw your sword after a cutscene, having a clear handicap against some incredibly mighty foes, this game just knows how to balance it all makes all of those despites disappear, and just focusing on how much you have acquired by the end.The story is incredibly rich and powerful. The decisions will not only torn you apart, but will also make you want to play it again, just to see what you have missed or to experience that other decision, which let me tell you, it does not dissapoint.It clearly makes you think about what kind of Witcher you would like to be, since the abilities are so many, but the amount you get to acquired are limited.Overall, a great game that lets you know how great Geralt of Rivia is before heading over to The Witcher 3, which is the next one on my list!

												What can I say about this game, it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. A while back I played through the first Witcher game. While the graphics were alright and the combat system was at times dreadful, I still enjoyed that game very much. Its setting and story made up for whatever shortcomings it had. After quite some time, I decided to jump onto The Witcher 2, now that The Witcher 3 is cheap enough for me to eventually buy. Enough of my rambling, onto the review itself.The Witcher 2 feels like a much better version of The Witcher 1. The graphics are improved, the combat system is simple, but intricate at times, and the story once again delivers. While playing this game, I read that the chapter lengths and overall length of the game was a bit disappointing. On average, it took many gamers around 30 hours to beat the game. I'm sure if you are a sidequest freak, it would take much longer. The first Witcher game took me around 60 hours to beat and that felt good. Not too long, but not too short. Initially, I was frustrated at the game's length, but the more I played, the more I felt that the game was concise and it managed to perform well within its time constraints. Any longer than that and the game's quality would've suffered. Towards the end, I kept thinking that if The Witcher 2 is this awesome, The Witcher 3 must be one of the best games of all time. I know I'm late when it comes to The Witcher franchise, but these are games that I will most likely be playing on a regular basis for years to come. I give this game a 4/5 and I definitely recommend it.  "

												*Disclaimer A: This is an ongoing review, I'll update it once I progress further into the game**Disclaimer B: This review was originally a negative one, it now has been edited*Thank you, killJoy12345! My initial review was very negative. It was based on me trying the game with a controller. Here is recommendation no.1: Do not try to play this with a controller. Who knows, I am sure some will succeed playing the game with one... I didn't. At all. The tutorial alone, attempted with an Xbox-controller, frustrated me so much that I had to quit right in the middle of the arena. It just felt so incredibly imprecise, confusing, clunky and weird. I compared it to being drunk out of your mind while trying to control an overloaded 40 ton-truck with a wobbly old joystick from the early 80s or something. I quit and uninstalled, not bothering to try again as I had bought this for like 3 bucks during a sale. I have changed my mind very much, and am falling more in love with the game the longer I play it, and I think I start to understand just why the game is so revered. I am now playing this with a mouse and a keyboard. The mouse to look around and using my attacks, the keyboard for moving. I use a Razer Naga, and with the number keys on its side, it's quite easy to control using the standard/default key settingsWith these numbers (with the Naga or keyboard), WASD, Q and R plus the Alt key to target-lock, the controls get much better. I'd also recommend to adjust the mouse settings, and lower the sensitivity. With the naga, it's set to the lowest possible value. This works well for looking around without being too slow, plus it is precise enough to handle the arm-wrestling minigame (which you need for a quest, where you do that instead of paying with money). Said arm-wrestling takes a tiny bit of practice, but I was then able to beat most opponents. Now for the game itself. Graphics/Setting/storyI said that the graphics are merely ok. I kinda stick to that, even considering the game isn't brand-new. They're quite pretty, but they're not exactly total state of the art even for the time it came out IMO. They ARE quite atmospheric though, and help to suck you into the game. And gee, there is a lot to be sucked into, as the game REALLY is quite addictive and enticing IMO. The story is quite interesting... a bit of cliché sometimes, but mainly a well-written and multi-layered story. Depending on how you want to play Geralt, you can be either a nice goodie-two-shoes, sticking to a moral high-road, or you can be a rather intimidating, threatening and sinister figure, doing whatever it takes to achieve his goal. The dialogues are nice, sometimes you have to pick your answers quickly. I am not that far into the game yet... I mentioned this will be an ongoing review, I will add updates once I progress more. So far, I am VERY into it, want to see how the story plays out, want to learn more about the world it is set in. Handling/Controls/FightingI mentioned above that the combination of KB plus Naga works quite well. I still need to practice a bit, as some of the controls are a bit...wobbly. It sometimes takes a tiny bit longer to target a lootbag, ladder, climbing/point. Fighting feels pretty dynamic, and you can succeed even if you don't target-lock enemies. So far, it was pretty much up to me how I wanted to fight mobs... using mostly swords, signs or quickslots (traps/bombs/daggers). I am sure that later on, you need to decide on some of these for specific mobs, acting with a bit more tactic, while right now, I am slashing my way through the mobs rather easily while throwing in an occasional Aard or Ignis for tougher mobs or those that shield themselves. Regarding controls and handling, this game gets a 7 or 8 out of 10 so far. I wish it'd feel a bit more precise especially out of combat, when you pick up stuff or loot. Not as good as some AC or Arkham-titles in my opinion.Update: Just did the first boss fight, and it was tough. I did have to do some research on YT. An NPC gives you SOME hints during the fight, but Im not sure how much they'd help to figure out the correct tactic without help. However, I eventually beat it, and it was quite satisfying. Soundtrack/Voice actingVery very nicely done. The music isn't annoying you, it rather adds to the atmosphere, and even with quite a few repetitions, it doesnt get boring. Pros:- Graphics are decent to very nice. Not mind-blowing, but pretty dang good.- Music and voice-acting are very well done and work nicely for the vibe.- FIghting feels dynamic... even if sometimes it's buggy (fighting my way out of a prison often had me light or extinguish torches on the wall while trying to actually slash away at a guard. Didn't die, but the combination of ""use torch with left-click, slash at opponent with... left click"" wasnt helpful.I hear Witcher III will be even better when it comes to controls.- Interesting and deep story, very nice to follow and read, even though there are a LOT of plotlines and chars, so maybe some extra research at a wiki would be helpful to understand it better. Cons- Controls often are a bit too wobbly, not quite precise enough. If they weren't, the game would be close to absolutely perfect. This doesn't apply much to the fight, but more to everything in between.- 2 crashes so far, hope this doesn't happen more often. The game does autosave, but I recommend to manually save from time to time. 2nd crash was on exiting an instance, and not even CTL AlT DEL would help to close the crashed game (funny: the ""loading icon"" was still moving, but the game had crashed)- One big immersion-killer: You can't jump. Yes, you can jumproll in certain directions while fighting to dodge attacks (direction key plus space, took me a bit of practice). So this powerful demon hunter walks through the area, and there is a 10 inch rise in the landscape... you can't raise a foot or jump up, you have to walk all around it. This kinda kills the immersion and feels weird. I guess they wanted to do this to guide you with paths in between rises, but that adds a ""on rails"" feeling while also feeling very unnatural. - Some of the QTEs are very fast and you might fail a few times, especially since the first ones happen quite surprisingly. DOn't worry, they won't kill you quickly, you just need to adjust quickly in order to succeed. YMMV:- Your questlog fills up rather quickly. A lot of the quests have a tracker to help you find the right spot and person, but some require you to think or search a bit. Also, read the questlog (which is well-written!). If you are used to WOW-type questing, with handholding to the extreme, TLDR-summaries at the bottom and trackers for every single quest, you might have to readjust. - Some might dislike the minigames like the wrestling. It does take practice for sure.- The menus can be quite overwhelming at first. Alchemy, talent trees, meditation etc... take your time.And that leads me to one big piece of advice: I think (at least so far) this game is MUCH more enjoyable if you take your time and savor each step. Watch the cutscenes. Read the questlogs and information provided. Enjoy the quests and solving them instead of trying to rush through them as much as possible. Try some different approaches to fights, don't ignore the quickslot items or potions or signs. If you prefer swordplay, then go ahead, but I recommend to try different styles, or mix them up a bit. I haven't fought a boss-yet... so far, the game hints that it will be a bit of work to kill the first one, and requires tactics. I hope it does, and I hope I will figure it out.So, for now: A solid 9/10, very fascinating and immersive, with a cool story, cool main-character, a very nice and sinister vibe to it (the 18-rating is pretty appropriate as far as I can tell), and it's obvious that a LOT of work went into this. WILL UPDATE!			"

												Where The Witcher was a great game itself, this one tops it easily.The characters are fewer, less confusing and all still have their own background which you get to know. Most of the old characters from witcher 1 are back in the game, right by your side. The fact that the main part of the story is entirely different, depending on you descisions, is just one of the things that make this game replayable. It even goes so far that you don't even see the entire area the game would take place in if your choices would be different. And that is an area large enough to cover about 10 - 15 hours of gameplay!The combat system is particularly harder than in Witcher 1, quite challengíng, while some of the bosses seem to be nearly impossible, even on normal. Some minor things got me still... Why am I not able to walk through doors on myself? There is always a half-second animation doing that for me... come on I can fight around 10 enemies at once... I can manage an unarmed door...Sometimes it is not so easy to tell what Geralt is about so say. The answer is always just short for what he will say, but I went all ""Women can't neither fight, nor rule a country!"" when I just tried to asked ""Could you explain that further?""And so on... Recommended to play before the witcher 3 to get the background story and insert a safegame.Total play time around 30 hours, 20 hours less than witcher I due to large improvements of the GUI and the overall handling.

												Rating: 8/10Budget: Worth it. Replayability: I recommend spoiling the game for yourself, and reading ahead with a walkthrough to make the right choices. The game is simply too heavy for a casual gamer like myself to go through more than once. But what a journey! Lenght: I'm ashamed to admit how long it took me to beat this game...The Witcher II allows you to import your save from Witcher I, which is exactly as great as it sounds. Remember Mass Effect 2? Trying to start the game without importing a save from ME 1 always kinda sucked, because so many quests would be different - or gone. The problems already start here. The best gear in Witcher 1 is basically junk equipment in Witcher 2. This is a bit ridiculous. Your powers and your level from witcher 1 seems to have no impact on how great you start out in Witcher 2. Balancer, you say? I say no. Frankly, a few powers and some good gear doesn't make enough of a difference in the Witcher 2 for it to have mattered. What matters is practice, tactics and difficulty level. I don't really care much for the gameplay of the Witcher 1 or 2. They're not even that similar. It's sort of a strange ""dodge&strike"" combat system, reminisce of console hack&slash games. Probably why it's popular with a larger crowd. I don't care for this. I'm more into fps/third person direct control like Skyrim, Jedi Knight 2 or the up-coming Kingdom Come: Deliverance. The style of gameplay in the Witcher is very popular though - just not with me. The story is very rich, but I sometimes feel like the screenplay could use a bit more depht. Don't get me wrong, the story is masterfully written, the characters are intense and interesting and the graphics are very good for a game that is now a aged title, but the actual screen play, the over-used voice actors and character models... I have unpleasant flashbacks to TES IV Oblivion. Sometimes it also seems like the lines chosen by the people in the game are a bit... Artificial. I'm obviously over-criticising the game at this point - It really is a great roleplaying game. But be warned, the only character custimization you can do is a hair-style and clothes beyond skills. The reason I'm giving it 8/10 isn't because of my personal dislike of the combat system - I realize that the combat system is very good, and exactly what the company aimed for. No, my issue is with the items that scale ridiculously in the game, in effeciency, and with the broken econimics of the game. I HONESTLY recommend cheating in this game. You will have a much more enjoyable experience. You're playing as a supernatural monster slayer who is a mutant with magic powers who works for several kings and the king's special forces. Your lover is a sorcerer who wields powerful magic, and you know pretty much everyone who is worth knowing, plus you already ♥♥♥♥ing saved the world once in the Witcher 1. Why are you not rich? Why do you not have good stuff? Why are you not powerful when the game starts? These questions boggle me, and frankly I found the game much more enjoyable with a few cheats. I even bothered to raise the difficulty a bit again, before I decided ""Easiest"" was the way to go when I found no enjoyment in the combat system at all. Play the Witcher 1 first though!			"

												Great game with some of the best storylines i have ever seen, and the ammount of choices presented to you will put Bioware and Bethesda games to shame. The lore is great, and the universe is very immersive. The Witcher 2 does not treats you like a child and does not presents to you all that massive political correctness you get to see in Dragon Age for example (which IMO also has quite a bad and one of the most uninspired stories, and im supposed to be a Bioware fan, considering i love KOTOR, ME1/2 and  NWN) Getting depressed cause my gts 250 wont run The Witcher 3 :(Gonna buy 'em books to fulfill my The Witcher needs! :D			"

												They took everything great in the Witcher 1 (the story, the dialogues, the immersion...) and made it better by upgrading the graphics, the gameplay and the character design. I really recommend this game, and if you plan on playing the 3rd, don't hesitate to play this one too (or even the first one if you are not afraid of the difference in gameplay).I have only sided with the Scoia'tael yet (same as in the Witcher 1 as it seemed to be the only reasonable choice to me) but I already know that I'll replay it siding with the other faction as both groups are ambiguous.I would just recommend to take a few mods to make it more enjoyable (nexus account is free) :http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/276/? : automatically hides the UI out of combat.http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/697/? : Geralt is supposed to use pirouettes, not rolling on the ground, this mod just changes the animation for dodges to make it more book friendly.http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/115/? : this one is maybe the most important as the most annoying thing in this game is that all items are way too heavy (including all ingredients for potions/bombs)A few advices for beginners : I see people complaining about the tutorial at the beginning... it's actually because there isn't really one ; I would then recommend anyone to just check the different controls online, recommend you to use potions (always use the regenerative one), oils on your blade (they increase dramatically the damages you deal to enemies) and runes on your weapons and armors. The steel sword is for the humans and the silver one is for all kind of monsters, and if you have a doubt wether it's a monster or a human, use the silver one.			"

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Short Review: Still in progress. :P  Graphic: Superb Simply one of the best looking game at the time of its release and still is in my opinion. You probably need at least a GTX660 to run this one in 60 fps.  Gameplay: Good I rate this as good because while the overall gameplay is Excellent, however, the combat is kinda a let-down. It's difficult and it takes a while to get used to it. Dark Souls may be hard, but the combat isn't that bad. It's fun and altogether very enjoyable. It's a very different case with The Witcher 2, I'm afraid.  "

												I own both, the first and second part of The Witcher. I was not able to finish the first game, didn't like it that much, seemed quite boring for me, although it introduces you to lots of things that will make The Witcher 2 much more enjoyable. The Witcher 2 is Stunning. The graphics are very nice, the sounds make you feel like if you were in a real medieval town. The gameplay is much better than the one of the first game. Storywise i've liked it so far, to such point that I am already considering to replay it just to know what would happen if I had chosen a different path (just for your knowledge I never replay games). Some people say that the first game is better than the second one. When I started the first one I ""Meeh I just want to finish this one just to be able to play the second one"". I only have 15 hours of gameplay of the second one and I can't wait to keep playing, the plot is unbelievable.BUY THIS GAME... it's worth the money and it will be a good way to pass this winter holidays.For my taste it is best played with a controller. A 360 controller will do the trick.			"

												This is definitely a must have game for anyone who likes Witcher and his stories. I strongly recommend reading the books before playing the Witcher games. You can play without it, but the knowledge of the lore, and especially the characters will make your experience much much better. I really enjoyed it although there are few very frustrating moments. The game in general is pretty difficult (I played on the ""hard"" setting) and challenging, but the overall experience makes it just. And you can always lower the difficulty in case you really want to progress with the story and you can't get past some fight. most importantly - this is a great story driven game which IS NOT a hack'n'slash! you really have to think in the combat parts, or you're getting nowhere. Loved it, 9/10 I'd say.			"

												Very difficult game to get ""into"". Requires you to sit down on a nice day when you have a lot of free time. Please do not try to play this game on and off, as you will quickly put the game down and leave it to gather dust all because ""hurr the story wasnt goood"". I know because I did exactly this, and regret judging it so quickly. The graphics are jaw dropping, and the story is beautiful. A huge variety of choices and replayability. Combat is ""meh"" in terms of the weight behind attacks, but the actual gameplay mechanics (meditating, alchemy, spells etc) are incredibly in depth and allow for a huge variety of gameplay styles catering to all players.*sidenote* much more enjoyable if you have a controller, and have the ability to enable super sampling (would recommend a 780ti or 970 to do supersampling at a stable fps).

So Crisp! Looks so damn good! It tells such an epic story and a which you can change it and manipulate it. A lot of people compared this to Dragon Age Origins or Dragon Age itself. I'd say it's almost two completely different types of games. I mean yeah you have choice and yeah you cut things up. But it just feels incredibly different and I don't know how to really explain that. It just feels very correct. It flows correctly and it's a very very very awesome game. "

												The Witcher 2 isn't a perfect game. The inventory system is pretty terrible compared to Witcher 1's, blade oils and potions have been downgraded significantly  (and  the timers for them, now reduced to a few minutes at most, don't seem to pause during dialogue, meaning if you don't skip through dialogue after reading the subtitles you might spent several potions and oils preparing for a fight only get into a pre-fight dialogue and have them all unwittingly wasted away), and the magical signs in turn have been buffed to the point of almost being broken, with Yrden in particular rendering most bosses trivial. The dice poker is now a single-round exercise in trying to move your mouse as microscopically as you can in order to not cause every dice to go canonballing off of the board, and the fistfighting diversion is now just a bunch of QTEs.But when you look past all that, The Witcher 2 is by far one of the better RPGs of its generation. The dialogue and general writing are great, and the politics and general lore are more fleshed out and interesting than in the first game. The quest design in general has been greatly improved, and even though there are less monster hunting quests than in the first game they're generally deeper, involving you researching the monsters and doing specific goals to fully eradicate the threat instead of just lobbing off a few heads and turning them in. The game is overall shorter than the first game, but only because it branches off after the first chapter and essentially becomes two different stories which then further branch out, leading to plenty of replayability. You'll have forgotten all of the flaws I listed up above within the first chapter of the game, and it's overall definitely worth a purchase if you're into RPGs.  "

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Short Review: Still in progress. :P  Graphic: Superb Simply one of the best looking game at the time of its release and still is in my opinion. You probably need at least a GTX660 to run this one in 60 fps.  Gameplay: Good I rate this as good because while the overall gameplay is Excellent, however, the combat is kinda a let-down. It's difficult and it takes a while to get used to it. Dark Souls may be hard, but the combat isn't that bad. It's fun and altogether very enjoyable. It's a very different case with The Witcher 2, I'm afraid.  "

												I own both, the first and second part of The Witcher. I was not able to finish the first game, didn't like it that much, seemed quite boring for me, although it introduces you to lots of things that will make The Witcher 2 much more enjoyable. The Witcher 2 is Stunning. The graphics are very nice, the sounds make you feel like if you were in a real medieval town. The gameplay is much better than the one of the first game. Storywise i've liked it so far, to such point that I am already considering to replay it just to know what would happen if I had chosen a different path (just for your knowledge I never replay games). Some people say that the first game is better than the second one. When I started the first one I ""Meeh I just want to finish this one just to be able to play the second one"". I only have 15 hours of gameplay of the second one and I can't wait to keep playing, the plot is unbelievable.BUY THIS GAME... it's worth the money and it will be a good way to pass this winter holidays.For my taste it is best played with a controller. A 360 controller will do the trick.			"

												I believe this to be one of the greatest RPG's of our time.  The story in The Witcher series absolutely trumps any modern RPG.  The combat is subjective based on who's playing, but I really enjoyed it and felt the difficulty was higher than most RPG games.This game is all about story, decision making, characters as memorable to any fantasy novel, and the cinematics.

												Performance:Really impressed with how well-made the new engine is. Loads faster(which is kind of surprising because the first game's load times weren't even long), stutters less, and, of course, looks prettier. And I mean much prettier. You don't expect games that look this much better than their prequels to actually perform better than them.The only things about it that I don't like are the differed rendering(alternate form of rendering that only supports [and works] [with] a form of anti-aliasing that has been specifically coded into the game, cancelling out any kind of AA forced on from your graphics control panel. Use SweetFX for AA.), sharpness filter(you'll wanna turn it off in your user config, but make sure to force Anisotrophic Filtering on), and the bloom. The bloom.. I usually am ok with bloom in my games, but I had to turn this game's off. There is just too much of it. For my eyes, anyway.Graphics settings:Many graphics settings available for tweaking. There's a lot you can make changes to that will help the game run better on your rig, if it needs itControls:Controls are greatly improved. Dodging actually works consistently, unlike in the last game. Same with parrying. Same with attacking. I remember instances in the first Witcher where the system sometimes wouldn't let me attack opponents if they were close to me or surrounded me or just didn't let me attack them(while not stunned, etc). When attacking, you use either the left or right mouse button. Either are for heavy or light attacks. Is not like the first Witcher where you select an attack style and click on a foe. The buttons are the styles, so they have to be used/pressed after each attack. Can be combined.They took out the feature that let's you press/hold a button/key to highlight/display whatever in view can be interacted with, as well as the the feature that's you select what you want to interact with the cursor, while you hold/press a button. It's not that big of a deal not having it, but you now have to just run up to something you see, and click on it to do whatever with it.Gameplay:Am a few hours into the game, but can say it's very much like the first. Only, better.Combat is same, but more engaging. Also kinda harder(but I was playing on Dark/Insane difficulty.). You can meditate anywhere(no fireplaces/characters needed) that wouldn't be considered dangerous(out of battle, not in the presence of enemies). Inside or outside.So far, the choice system is still here. I've been in situations in the game where I could, as an example, stop a crime or let it follow through. There are also sub-choices, which can sometimes be made after main choices have been made. Good/bad/etc ones are available.EDIT:Overall:Have since spent more hours playing the game and am enjoying it. The story is very much still that of The Witcher's, and the gameplay is very fun. Good combat, and there more options for interacting with characters you encounter than there were in last Witcher game.The game feels like it was made on PC, which is awesome. Same as the last game. Same level of detail in the enviornments, great graphics, and doesn't feel like some technically-constrained console port.""coughs"" Skyrim ""coughs"" Fallout			"

												The Witcher is a dark, gritty, and mature RPG. It is probably one of the most grounded, and interesting RPG I've ever played. The Witcher itself is based on its famous novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. Geralt of Rivia, The White Wolf, is a monster hunter for pay. Throughout Geralt's journey through Temeria for work, he is conflicted with political issues that arise after the events at Vizimia; this takes place during the Witcher 1. Geralt is now faced with treason, and is set out on a journey to clear his name. The Witcher 2 has a though provoking story that requires your attention. Books you pick up, as well as notes should be read. The books you find will tell you the history of the Witcher universe, and give you tips when fighting difficult opponents. You will also be making choices that actually do make a difference within the universe. The combat in the Witcher 2 is probably its weakest aspect. It is, however, much better than the combat system introduced in the Witcher 1. In the Witcher 2, you are required to roll around during almost any combat situation. This effectively makes signs, or any other defensive abilties obselete. The Witcher 2 requries a necessary playthrough as its story, characters, and universe are provoking. Even if the Witcher's combat system is medicore at best, it won't stop you from enjoying the numerous other aspects that the Witcher does correctly. Summary: Positive:+Story+High graphical fidelity+Unforgettable charactersNegative: -Combat			"

												I started this game right after finishing The Witcher and the biggest improvement between the two is definitely the gameplay, namely combat.  I have very little bad to say about it other than that some of the strategies you can abuse (namely always have Quen up when fighting) make some of the fights a little dumb, but really any monster can kill you if you aren't paying attention and I really like that.  It makes the world feel very real that all monsters pose at least some threat throughout the entire game.I suppose the only other gripe I have is how poorly optimized the game is.  I should be able to run this maxed out with no frame drops at all, but there are times when I get pretty poor FPS and it has nothing to do with my system and everything to do with the game itself.  That said, there are some pretty fantastic sights to be seen in all the different locations the game takes you.  For a game that's about 5 years old, it has aged surprisingly well graphically.All the small negatives aside, this series is seriously one of my favorite of all time now.  The story telling is top notch.  The way the world and Geralt evolve as the story progresses is superbly done.  All progression feels extremely organic, especially from one game to another (where you can import saves that will keep your decisions intact ala Mass Effect so you can have YOUR Geralt through the entire series if you so wish). In addition to feeling organic...it just makes sense.  The way the politics change with your decisions or the decisions of other characters in the game...nothing feels contrived or silly because t's all justified by the world that has been crafted here.I can't recommend this game enough.  At times it gets frustrating because there are definitely some fights that will take a few tries to beat, but it is also rewarding in the sense of accomplishment, but also in the sense of story telling.  Any fan of RPGs where your decisions actual matter worth a damn should already be playing this, and if you have the stomach for it make sure to pick up the first game as well.  Both games took me just around 30 hours to beat (all quests for the given paths I had chosen completed) with a fair amount of exploration (which you should always take advantage of because you never know what cool weapons you'll find)...the ability to transfer saves from one game to the next (and even into The Witcher 3), really sells me on the idea that it's the right way to go if you're going to really get into the series.

												Absolutely amazing... I've been a big RPG fan my whole life, and I feel robed for never have playing the witcher series. This is the first i've played of it, and it is fantastic. I will without a doubt be purchasing The Witcher 3, and future witcher games. This game is a must for any RPG fan... The story, decisions, the gameplay, lore... It's all superb, well crafted, and mature. My only complaint is the difficulty. Playing on hard was dumbfoundingly easy. I was able to defeat the end boss with less than 10 hits. By the end of the game, I was just too powerful. Hopefully The Witcher 3 will be more difficult.edit: MODS! My complaints about difficulty can be solved with modding! Thank the gods that CD Projekt RED allows for modding, the modding community is actually quite amazing (with all witcher games). Another great reason to pick this game up!			"

About the game:You are Geralt of Rivia, a trained professional who hunts down monsters, a witcher. In Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, Geralt, by the kings choice, becomes deeply involved in the politics of the North, and pays a price for it. Blamed for things he did not do, Geralt is forced to clear his name. He's sent on a riveting tale of lies, schemes, and betrayal. Only Geralt can make it all right, for if he doesn't, who will?Pros:+Compelling story that really captures your attention+Vast world to explore+Combat is SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN WITCHER 1!+Lots of quest+Interesting characters+Awesome visually and has great sound effects+BoobsCons:-Hardest difficulty can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ for some of the major fights-Money (Orens) are hard to obtain and everything is expensive-To craft some weapons and armors, you need materials you can only get from earlier in the game. You need to know  what you need before you can even craft the armorOverall:Just completed this game today. 50 hours of gameplay doing just about everything on only one of the paths. In Witcher 2, you have 2 paths. So if you played the game fully twice, you would have 100 hours. For the money spent, it is well worth. I give it a bloody 10/10.			"

The cutscenes and cenimatics are rendered and choreographed beautifully and convincingly, also the best I've seen to date. The story is engrossing and the gameplay is seriously fun for me. Lots of different paths for tons of encounters and story lines. And the fact that a DRM free version is given to you as well by GOG when you purchase The Witcher 2, just because that's what CD Projekt Red felt was what the gamer deserves is amazing. That is, without a doubt, commendable and I will most definitely support these developers.			"

												The game is awesome RPG, but might be hard for some players or bit heavy for some PC's. But trust me, if you got a good computer to run the game, and you are a decent player, the game is totally worth your money. Some things might be little confusing, but you can resolve your problems by using google or youtube. If you are into RPG's, you should REALLY consider buying this game. For what I have played, I would give the game 4.5/5.			"

												Fanastic game, graphics are beautiful and the environments stunning, characters are very detailed and each one feels unique (unlike the identikit ones on Skyrim that are all voiced by the same 3 people) It's linear, yes, but thats because it has a story to tell and wants you to fully immerse yourself in the experience. Some big decisions to make throughout the game that will change how the story pans out, and I will definately be playing through it again to get the other endings.This one will be tough on your graphics card, even some of the newer ones at max settings may struggle a little, but as you can see from the screens it is a gorgeous looking game.My only dislike was the whole potions and meditating thing, wasn't a fan of that really, but other than that this game is a must play for any RPG or fantasy fan and I cannot wait for the finale, Witcher 3			"

												This is a good RPG with some really impressive graphical and visual effects. Especially the lighting effects looks astonishing. The story is mature and rather complex, but I couldn't really appreciate it as much as others have done. Maybe it was because I haven't played the first game and therefore missed out on some parts of the overall story and the lore. Either way I thought it was a little bit too confusing at times, especially when the facial expressions and character animations wasn't very good.I also thought that the menus could've been better - they often felt slow, unresponsive and very irritating.But the thing that kept me playing was the superb combat! The feeling when you fought against a large number of enemies at the same time and you had to think tactical to survive was really rewarding!Overall, I enjoyed the game but was a little disappointed with the story, mostly because I've heard a lot good things about it. I do recommend the game though, especially if you want to test what your computer is capable of.			"

												The game is awesome! It has got it all: graphics, thick branching story, serviceable combat mechanics, and occasional nudity. The story is so rich that it actually bogs down the experience in the prologue. Tons of characters with their own public or hidden agendas drop in and out. After a while they become familiar enough, making the tons of plot twists impacting. The combat also has a rough start, in learning curve and outright weakness of the protagonist. Once you learn the basics the combat can make you feel like a skilled video game swordsman. Although, the hardest battles are a matter of long-winded tedium of exploiting the same combat techniques used in any other battle.All these elements compile to make an RPG that may not have the drowning, yet shallow, expanse of Bethesda games, but does dive deep in the few acts it contains.

												An improvement over its predecessor in many ways, including gameplay and graphics, but I think it's a step down in terms of story. Just one things start to get interesting, the game is done.

												Although I've owned this since it came out, unfortunately my old PC wasn't able to run it... so when the Enhanced Edition came out the same week I got a new PC, I took it as a sign to finally make this backlog sin right. And it was worth the wait. If you played and liked the first game, you will love this. And if not, you will probably like it anyways, assuming action/RPGs interest you. Witcher 2 improves on every aspect of the first game - graphics (which are gorgeous), combat, story, and UI (inventory management, while better, still isn't quite perfect though). I can't really think of much bad to say about this game. It's really well made, the story/characters are interesting, and it's well-written and voiced. Witcher 2 also features a major branching story path at the end of chapter 1 that totally changes the rest of the game, which in turn adds a ton of replay value if you really want to see everything. All in all, this is an awesome game - highly recommended. Can't wait for #3!			"

												The second installment of Witcher series is beautiful in its own unique way compared to its prequel and sequel. In 2016, the graphics are still pretty although animations may seem a bit clunky. Lack of jumping over obstacles etc. may also annoy some. But in the end, based on visuals, it is still a game that can be played for quite some time into the future.As for context of the game:*spoiler*Using a branching storyline and presenting two scenarios is the most striking selling point of this game. Replayability is pretty high thanks to it which is something lovely if you are highly into the atmosphere of the series. Although atmosphere and immersion is a bit weaker compared to the game's prequel and sequel, the game still presents witcher series' signature atmosphere of morally gray occasions.*spoiler* "

Do yourself a favour and play this before The Witcher 3...... Not because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt wouldn't work as a standalone game. Actually it does, and it does it very well.I got this game on sale for 2,99€ a few days back. My only problem with this game is that I have already finished The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt before starting this game. Truth be told, these games look much alike. So for a 2011 game The Witcher 2 looks great and feels great. If I had never played The Witcher 3 I would probably consider this one of thegreatest games I have ever played. The story, dialogue, acting, combat - all of it is there and it's good.But here is the problem; none of it is quite as good as with The Witcher 3. If you have never played The Witcher 3 you wouldn't know all the tiny things you're missing when you're playing The Witcher 2. But if you already have, you got to admit that in comparison The Witcher 2 feels rather small, clunky, limiting and occasionally claustrophobically one dimensional. This is not exactly fault of the game itself, but because the sequel happens to be probably the best game ever made.So do yourself a favour and don't do like I did. Don't go straight to The Witcher 3, but play this one (and even the first one if you can stomach the outdated experience) first or it will be very hard to come back. Personally I've found the story itself intriguing and craving more for the world of The Witcher. Right now, being used to the best coming back to something almost as good isn't quite cutting it anymore.I will finish this game eventually, but I wish I had started from here, just because I would've enjoyed it more.Regardless, this game is easily worth the money.

												I have seen a lot of praise for this game especially for the PC platform on forums everywhere on the internet. And I have also seen a lot of this: ""CDProjeKt Red is the only AAA game industry that cares about the PC platform""Well after playing the game this is what I have to say: The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a console game.Likes:- Great Cinematics and visuals. Clever use of post-process effects. Makes the graphics look great. Character models are very detailed.- Deep StoryDislikes:- Console style gameplay, all of it, the whole game- Keyboard and mouse controls are irritating. Tried the gamepad, the K+M issues were gone, but the gamepad has its own set of issues, the same issues for which i hate the gamepad in general. Finished the game with the keyboard and mouse except used the gamepad for arm wrestling(lol double meaning there).- You have to use a thing called as medallion to highlight pickup objects. Because it is very hard to see pickup objects manually. And that medallion thingy has got a cooldown. It's also hard to focus on pickup objects because of the player's 'running' to 'idle' state animation.- The minimap and the map wasn't exactly helpful. There will be some objective up a hill but you will end up in a cave directly below it. And the lack of fast travel just made it more irritating. It looks like the game wants me to memorize the directions to each place.- There will be some objectives that are right in front of you but you will have to circle around the entire town to reach that place since the player cannot jump over a fence or jump down to the floor below. This wouldn't have been a problem if it was only needed to be done once but you need to reach that same place again and again multiple times. The lack of fast travel again adds to the frustration.- The 'charm' option in dialogues always succeeds. No point in choosing other options.- Music is average at best. Not great use of sound either.- I hate memorizing stuff that isn't important to me. And the magic powers that the player has are in sign language, just made it more difficult to memorize. If it was English it would have been a bit easier. There were also some sign language puzzles. Who in the world knows sign language? There was a learning curve for me in this game. I don't usually expect a learning curve in a single-player game(after playing lots of games).- Some side missions get FAILED if you leave the area or progress the main story. I thought it was an open world RPG. Can't even finish objectives at my leisure. The game is linear for the most part.- The game wasn't technically impressive for me. There were a lot of loading zones/streaming levels(DOORS). Everything in the distance is either mist/fogged/depth of field blurred out. Basically everything you see in the far distance is of very low quality. And AFAIK there is no zoom functionality. And the third person camera helps hiding a lot of things. And I prefer realistic looking graphics than fantasy graphics even in a fantasy world.- Too many cutscenes. I wanted a game not a movie.- Show off.- Story can be overwhelming. Too many characters to keep track of, and characters are referred to in dialogues very directly some of which you haven't even seen or heard about yet. Poor presentation of story to the player. Ideally this should not be a reason for playing the game again.- Porny stuff doesn't add value to the game. This must have been a 'like' point for most people. People need to understand that this does not add value to the game. It might be needed for storytelling, but Witcher 2's scenes were deliberately inserted to increase player appreciation. If you are interested in such things go watch porn that is available for free on the internet. But don't praise a game because it has porny stuff in it.- On the other hand, the gameplay is completely childish and a kid cannot play this game because it has mature content.- The skill tree isn't very interesting. And you have to meditate to drink potions. Oh! Come onDoubtful:- I must be the only person who found the concept of a 'silver' sword ridiculous.Some useful Statistics:It's been more than 2 years since the release of Witcher 2. So some valid statistics are available. According to Steam achievements atleast 57.1% of players have started playing the game. And 13.8% of players have finished the game. That means only 24.17% players who have started playing the game have actually completed it. Ideally for a good single player game this percentage should be above 33. This probably means that most of the players either quit playing the game or got stuck somewhere indefinitely or they had better games to play or bought it just to watch the porny stuff in it and not to play the game. I hope this gives you enough reason for why this game is not recommended.Verdict : 78/100The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition is a console game.			"

												This game is a 10/10. The graphical details for the female bosom in this game are absolutely exquisite and it encapsulates the minute detail of real breasts. The passionate scenes inflict many emotions upon the player and it seems as if they are in the action, as the pole stiffens or the sponge gets soaked. This could be attributed to the curves that have been added to each female in this game and for females the masculine body of Geralt. It was disappointing that my character couldn't share such a passionate connection with every single female character, and it detracted from the reality of the game as it could be possible to be with many females outside of the game. I think the name, the Assassins of Kings is well done, but I think it should have a name change to the Assassin of Queens as Geralt silently and lustfully assassinates his prey leaving them in a sedated and satisfied state post-conflict.

												Pros:+ Solid Storyline.+ Choice in game affects sequel.+ Actually gets you thinking when making decisions.+ Awesome Graphics.+ Cinematic Experience.Cons:- Cannot drink potion while in battle. (They brought this back on Witcher 3)- No more Witcher styles so you can no longer fight multiple enemies at once but your sword    sometimes hits multiple enemies when they're sticking with each other.- Map is practically useless.- Glitches and Bugs.- Is Geralt that dumb that you have to spend an upgrade point just so he can start throwing       daggers?- Combat system sucks (This was improved in Witcher 3)- Your vigor doesn't replenish while Quen is active- Witcher 1 Main Quest took 30-40 hours this one only take 15-20 hours (Witcher 3 takes 50 hours)- Witcher 1 UI is more intuitive.- You can't sort your items.- CRASHESRIG:Asus Z97 Pro Gamer MOBOi7-4790K @4.5 GHzNoctua NH-D15 CPU Cooler16GB (8x2) 1866 mhz RAMAsus Strix GTX 960 4GBCougar SL600Windows 10 Pro			"

												I love The Witcher and thoroughly enjoyed the original game for its depth, quality narative and pretty much everything else(Besides the combat which was still better than its successors). The Witcher 2 sad to say feels like a mere shadow of what it should have been. Where the first game felt immersive and fun to explore Assassins of Kings felt rigid and tedious. I actually had to force myself to finish it just because it felt so... Well... Not fun. I hate to say that but it's honestly how the game made me feel. Even during parts of the game where big stuff was happening it just felt straight up boring, and it just got worse as the game went on. Another thing I found strange is that pretty much nothing happens in this game. Sure you travel to different places in the world but for the most part nothing big happens at all, and even when stuff does happen it leaves a feeling of wanting more. Wanting more from a game isn't what one should feel while playing and engaging with a ""Story rich RPG"" you should feel like the story is big and mysterious leaving you guessing and wondering what could be next for the character. One last thing that I want to add is that The Witcher 2 is ludacrously short and ended abruptly seemingly out of no-where. I thought I was half way through when the credits started to roll leaving even more to be desired.All in all I realize that I'm being pretty critical but I mean if they were going to screw up the combat they could have at least given us a half way decent story. Oh well, hopefully The Witcher 3 will be better.			"

												Can't really recommed this one. The graphics are ok, but nothing to write home about considering it is supposedly an 'enhanced edition'. Story and lore seem to be dense from what I can tell after roughly two hours.Unfortunately, combat and interaction are breaking this game for me. Combat is extremely clumsy, it basically boils down to button-mashing, where at no point you have real control over your character, but rather mash buttons as fast as humanly possible and see what the game decides to do.Combat animations are basic, very basic, you'll sometimes stun an enemy wielding a shield, and when you strike him see a cut-scene like animation where your character delivers a killing blow to an enemy that does not have a shield.I started the game on 'hard' difficulty, and it took me about 10 minutes to discover how to exploit weaknesses in the AI to a point where I basically go through the fights either with no health loss, the other possible outcome being dying a rather cheesy death due to the no-control combat system.If I had to describe the combat system with one word, I'm sorry to say that word would be 'garbage', it pretty much ruins an otherwise decent game.Interaction is similary painful, there is one interaction key (left mouse), which is also one of your main fighting keys, leading to all sorts of unintentional interactions during combat, especially since the 'hot zones' for interactions are placed badly. This also inhibits game flow, you'll sometimes run towards a ledge, and then have to move around trying to find the interaction zone to actually climb it, there is no fluid 'run up to the ledge and climb it' like you'd expect.Got this very cheap on sale, if I had bought it for full price I'd say it was wasted money.

												Although it has quite nice graphic, interesting story and various side missions, the combat system and mainly save system totally suck. The handling of fight is unnutural and slow, so you often end up rolling all over the place just to avoid your foes and autosaves are never done when you expect or need them. Also the poor (I mean none...) animations in dialogues are pretty akward... So much wasted potential in something what could be otherwise a fine game.			"

												My knees are bending when I see The Witcher 2. I can't stop being impressed. Graphics are wonderfull, the plot is captivating, system of fight is sophisticated and not so easy to use, which is good. Why? You've got signs, two swords and many extra weapons. Additionaly, you can add oils to your swords or upgrade/craft weapons with special runes. Every monster/human is sensitive to something different (which you can read in your book), after studying the book, you prepare yourself certain weapons and signs. If you play with simple difficulty level - you probably won't need that, but if you like challanges - that's certainly a good one. I really apreaciate this improvement. In most of RPG's the only thing you have to do is clicking left and right mouse button. Sometimes one of the keys to block. Dialogues are hilarious and so are some characters. What makes this game really special are the possibilities. There are 3 ways to finish the game. Depending on which desisions you make and who are you helping. Moreover, additional quests are lovely, monsters are really... creative. I recommend this game for everybody. Great story, well built world, hazard mini games, a lot of choice avaiable. What else simple human needs?			"

												Pros:* Great Graphics (6 year old game, but still looks great in 4k resolution)* Combat significantly better than Witcher 1 (couldn't stand that combat system)* Very Detailed story which I really enjoyed* Love that it's basically a game for adults with not only the obvious fighting and blood, but adult situations, with full blown sex, love, etc. Bigtime commendation for the developer on that.Cons:* None. Other:* Can't believe I waited as long as I did to get into this series. I didn't fully play Witcher 1 as I just couldn't stand the combat system, so I watched some summary videos on it to catch me up before starting the second one. Witcher 2 is fantastic and has marked improvement, particularly in the combat system and story flow compared to Witcher 1. I am now ""all-in"" on the series. Looking forward to playing Witcher 3 which I will probably start over the next couple of days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												A good game with bad momentsFor a game of its budget, there are some good cinematics, the characters are interesting, and its enough to keep you engaged, particularly now that the title is much cheaper.Now for the bad news. There are a few issues with the capacity to enrage you either into perservering or throwing your keyboard or controller across the room. I list them in no particular order below. It will sound like a negative review below. Actually it's not true, I just want people to be forewarned.Irritating mini-gamesThere a series of sort of mini-games where you need to mash buttons in a particular way or get punished for it repeatedly until through a sort of classical conditioning (like Pavlovs dogs) you get your food pellet of progress at the end. Examples of this are the bare knuckle boxing where a button will flash on the screen suddenly. The arm wrestle is another one of these where you have to struggle to keep your icon inside a bar using the mouse (in my case).A predilection for ♥♥♥♥ and bums.Okay I'm a guy and don't mind my hit of fantasy soft porn, but even I had to roll my eyes after practically every chick has gravity defying boobs and is either an angel or a ♥♥♥♥♥ (often literally).Alchemy - a pointless skill tree.I focused on swordfighting, why would you create slightly better potions that time out when you can consistently do more damage? Many games have these game balance issues but I found Witcher 2 didn't handle it as well. Crafting doesn't keep up with stuff that you simply find or get rewarded, a problem I've found in other titles also.An annoying badly lit maze.At one point of the game is a dwarven mine that is a type of basic maze. However its badly lit and you need to use Cat which gives you cat vision. The cat wears out. I thought about it and the main issue with getting lost was simple HUI (Human user interaction issues) like having sunlight sneak through under the bottom of the exit door, so the player takes a hint that that is the exit.More Classical Conditioning type puzzles.There are two in chapter 2 - completing a witch ritual to break a curse, you need to keep clicking things in a certain order, or you get forced to restart. It gets old quickly.The 2nd is seeing through the eyes of a dead assassin, you have to walk behind the other assassin step by step, I would do this and the sequence would restart and I would have to redo it. Now I wasn't doing anything blatantly dim, I would literally be behind the other guy and the sequence would restart. This is very frustrating and I'm now stuck.Overall, my 5 cents is that it has an inside group feel to the design, where the development team didn't bother to test some of their ideas, and realise 'hey' this part of the game is actually kind of crap. It's polished, but with dollops of developer bird poo on the dash 3.5/5. "

												I want to like this game, I really do. But here's my issue with it. It's just to damn cheap. On medium, you get two shotted, and on easy, you can get three shotted. And if you play the game on easy, you go along with the game, and you hardly get any good items. I'm at the last chapter, and I only got +7 armor, and I've done all the side quests, looked everywhere on easy, and I still get bloody three shotted. They give you better items on the more difficult levels, but if you intend to play, just remember that the save is a very quick thing so save often.Other than that the humor in this game is better than most comedy movies. Hell, it made me laugh for minutes straight and the story itself is a sight for sore eyes. Great game, just very difficult.			"

												I might've just fallen in love with the Witcher 2, and soon the whole series. This game is fantastic! The graphics are superb, it is a great PC port and it is incredibly enjoyable. It is a very well-made RPG that improves on pretty much everything the original did wrong/well. The combat here is satisfying as hell, the music is SUPERB, the characters are pretty damn good and there's just so much to love. However, it has very few problems. The targeting isn't particularly amazing, and the menus aren't too good either. However, you can get past these problems easily, and the game just becomes a whole other beast. Also, you would forget what buttons things are assigned to, but thankfully you can check and even change particular keys. You could find problems, such as not really knowing what every magic power does, but after experimenting you will know, Anyway, other than that, this is one of my favourite games and I love it so much. There's a lot to love and it is just a great game.Note: This game isn't openworld like Witcher 3.			"

												I was not yet convinced of pre-ordering the witcher 3, I thought purchasing the second installment first might convince me. And, my god, did it! Wether or not it is of because of the amazing storyline, fun combat system, diverse specialisation possibilities, the numerous possible outcomes based on player decisions, or simply the challenging difficulty. The game is just exceptional. I am doing my very best to learn everything about the franchise, and explore everything this game has to offer. I suspect I might spend countless hours on both this installment, as the to-come 3rd part.			"

												My experience with this game was just fantastic.It has a dark fantasy world with a realistic portrayal of characters and society. It borrows heavily from common themes found in universes like Lord of the Rings (e.g. races and creatures) but puts its own and dark spin on it. Being an adult rated does the whole game good as the story doesn’t hold back.The game sacrifices some character customization and range of combat abilities compared to other games - like Skyrim, for example, where there are now shields and bows in Witcher 2 - in favour of a deeper character of the protagonist which does the story a lot of good in my opinion.Technically it is very good to see a game go back to some “old school” principles of RPGs. There are no floating quest markers, no damage numbers, hardly any telegraphing no quest compass or combat log.Questing, combat and lore just feels very organic and the flow of the story comes natural and the narration of the story is unique as it is done by a sidekick of the protagonist.The game still looks very good, the only weak points being some aspects of character and facial animation. I do recommend the official combat rebalance mod from CD Project RED tough to improve combat and the “Enhanced camera” mod from nexusmods.com. After 65h of gameplay and having finished the game I still have withdrawal symptoms and wish there would be more to do, more quests, more fights and more exploring. The game does have replayability value because the whole middle part of the story completely branches out and changes how you get to the ending. Additionally, the combat style of Geralt can be customized quite a bit despite the aforementioned limitations. With that in mind however I now look forward to the open-world Witcher 3 a lot!			"

												Pros:* Great Graphics (6 year old game, but still looks great in 4k resolution)* Combat significantly better than Witcher 1 (couldn't stand that combat system)* Very Detailed story which I really enjoyed* Love that it's basically a game for adults with not only the obvious fighting and blood, but adult situations, with full blown sex, love, etc. Bigtime commendation for the developer on that.Cons:* None. Other:* Can't believe I waited as long as I did to get into this series. I didn't fully play Witcher 1 as I just couldn't stand the combat system, so I watched some summary videos on it to catch me up before starting the second one. Witcher 2 is fantastic and has marked improvement, particularly in the combat system and story flow compared to Witcher 1. I am now ""all-in"" on the series. Looking forward to playing Witcher 3 which I will probably start over the next couple of days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.			"

												A good game with bad momentsFor a game of its budget, there are some good cinematics, the characters are interesting, and its enough to keep you engaged, particularly now that the title is much cheaper.Now for the bad news. There are a few issues with the capacity to enrage you either into perservering or throwing your keyboard or controller across the room. I list them in no particular order below. It will sound like a negative review below. Actually it's not true, I just want people to be forewarned.Irritating mini-gamesThere a series of sort of mini-games where you need to mash buttons in a particular way or get punished for it repeatedly until through a sort of classical conditioning (like Pavlovs dogs) you get your food pellet of progress at the end. Examples of this are the bare knuckle boxing where a button will flash on the screen suddenly. The arm wrestle is another one of these where you have to struggle to keep your icon inside a bar using the mouse (in my case).A predilection for ♥♥♥♥ and bums.Okay I'm a guy and don't mind my hit of fantasy soft porn, but even I had to roll my eyes after practically every chick has gravity defying boobs and is either an angel or a ♥♥♥♥♥ (often literally).Alchemy - a pointless skill tree.I focused on swordfighting, why would you create slightly better potions that time out when you can consistently do more damage? Many games have these game balance issues but I found Witcher 2 didn't handle it as well. Crafting doesn't keep up with stuff that you simply find or get rewarded, a problem I've found in other titles also.An annoying badly lit maze.At one point of the game is a dwarven mine that is a type of basic maze. However its badly lit and you need to use Cat which gives you cat vision. The cat wears out. I thought about it and the main issue with getting lost was simple HUI (Human user interaction issues) like having sunlight sneak through under the bottom of the exit door, so the player takes a hint that that is the exit.More Classical Conditioning type puzzles.There are two in chapter 2 - completing a witch ritual to break a curse, you need to keep clicking things in a certain order, or you get forced to restart. It gets old quickly.The 2nd is seeing through the eyes of a dead assassin, you have to walk behind the other assassin step by step, I would do this and the sequence would restart and I would have to redo it. Now I wasn't doing anything blatantly dim, I would literally be behind the other guy and the sequence would restart. This is very frustrating and I'm now stuck.Overall, my 5 cents is that it has an inside group feel to the design, where the development team didn't bother to test some of their ideas, and realise 'hey' this part of the game is actually kind of crap. It's polished, but with dollops of developer bird poo on the dash 3.5/5. "

												The 85% discount was so worth it, but the little down side is the game is still quite a GPU hungry monster (and also... unoptimized...) My 940M laptop only gets about 30-45 fps on decent settings @ 768p BUT ANYWAYS, the game is just beautiful and still holds it well at today's standard. <3 <3			"

												English (im not a native speaker so forgive me if i wrote something hard to undestand)Finished by not much and just started to have a base for The Witcher III Well what about is not just a basic but really a good game, I was very surprised and I appreciated the work of CDProject, well articulated plot and plot twist in this major and secondary are always nice in an RPG, the game lets you play it without any problems, the presence of side quests with various possibility of approach are certainly appricied, such as the presence of decisions to make,with time and not  (I understand that it would have decstroyed rolplay but i didnt like it) notes that made me incredibly pleased, about the secondary, it is that you can fail, would seem a stupid thing to say, however, that warns you ""you are not taken by hand if you fail or you are not careful failed "". in addition to the body of the title it will not be uncommon for make a smile like an idiot while reading the descriptions of Dandelion(seriously do it, otherwise you'll miss some pearls) and be prepared for when you go to some forest, you will die with laughter and you will understand what they are made developers.Depending on the players that you could finish it in about 10 hours or quintuple these hours in case you want to end evrything well. I've played with the mouse and keyboard even though it was recommended play with the controller experience was not ruined.the title is not without flaws, however you distinugue once woodiness with our Geralt, some animations are too long and of inventory management becomes a serious affair, to pressing of mod use which eliminates the weight of the items depositing chest will be your best friend and you will use it very often, far more than Triss (I know shabby joke but forgive me, i had to write at least one shabby joke) last negative is the optimization, unfortunately this game if not played on very powerful machines will have problems , just is not optimized perfectly.For those who think that might be interested to this genre, the environment or just to play games with plot this is absolutely a good candidate to make you spend good hours on your pc.a suggestion I can give is to play right away to already difficult, will be difficult initially but then just got a decent equipment you will go forward without a problem.Italiano (sono madrelingua ma questo non vuoldire che non possa sbagliare, anzi, avrò fatto un macello)Finito da non molto e semplicemente iniziato per avere una base per The Witcher III beh che dire non è semplicemente una base ma veramente un bel gioco, sono rimasto ben sorpreso e ho apprezzato il lavoro di CDProject, trama ben articolata e plot twist in quest principali e secondarie fanno sempre piacere in un gdr, il gioco si lascia giocare senza nessun problema, la presenza di quest secondarie con varie possiblità di approccio sono certamente aprezzate, come la presenza di decisioni da prendere, a tempo e non (capisco che minerebbe l immedesimazione ma il prendere decisioni a in pochi secondi non mi è piaciuto moltissimo) nota che mi ha fatto incredibilmente piacere, a proposito delle secondarie, è che è possibile fallirle, sembrerebbe una cosa stupida da dire però questo vi mette in guardia ""qui non site presi per mano se sbagliate o non siete attenti fallite"". oltre alla corposità del titolo non sarà raro che facciate un sorriso da idiota mentre leggerete le descrizioni di ""Dandelion"" o Ranuncolo in Italiano (seriamente fatelo, altrimenti vi perderete delle perle) e preparatevi per quando andrete in una certa foresta, li morirete dalle risate e capirete di che pasta sono fatti gli sviluppatori.A seconda dei giocatori che siete potreste finirlo in circa 10 ore o quintuplicare le suddette ore nel caso in  cui vogliate spolparlo per bene io l ho giocato con mouse e tastiera anche se era consigliato un controller l' esperienza non è stata assolutamente minata.il titolo non è esente da difetti comunque si distinugue ancora una legnosità con il nostro Geralt, alcune animazioni sono troppo lunghe e la gestione dell inventario diventa un affare serio, a mendo di utilizzo di mod che elimina il peso degli oggetti la cassa per il deposito sara la vostra migliore amica e la userete molto spesso, altro che Triss (lo so battuta squallida ma perdonatemi, almeno una battuta squallida era giusto farla)ultima nota negativa è l ottimizzazione, purtroppo questo gioco se non giocato su macchine davvero potenti da molti problemi, semplicemente è ottimizzato non in maniera eccelsa detto questo chi pensa che potrebbe interessare il genere, l ambientazione o solamente giochi con trama assolutamente da giocare.un suggerimento che posso dare è di giocare gia da subito a difficile, inizialmente sarà ostico ma poi appena ottenuto un equipaggiamento decente andrete avanti imperterriti			"

												The story is awesome with a lot of choices you can make. Soundtrack is good but not as good as of witcher 3. I played witcher 3 4x but wanted more so I played this game. Coming back from Witcher 3 was a bit odd at first but you will get used to the differences. If you haven't played witcher at all, then this would be a great start to the series. Have fun playing as much as I did. Enjoyed every bit of the amazing story!			"

												Pros:- Stunning Graphic- Addicting Story- Awesome Gameplay- Alot of Side Quests (If you enjoy the game very much, try finishing all the side quests.)- Much more easier to cast a Witcher sign- Everything is better than Witcher 1Cons:- The game is hard to play (you die alot)- Need to almost mastered all skills in order to be able to slay your enemy- The game lags at some point- Alot of Side Quests (If you're just playing for the plot, ignore all the side quests.)Conclusion:Do you need to finish this to play Witcher 3: Wild Hunt? the answer is No, but i would recommend you to do so. The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings plays a very important role towards Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The main reason on what will be happening in Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will be explain in this episode. Its okay if you didnt play the previous game, cause in this game it will have a flash back on what happened in Witcher 1.I will definitely recommend you to play this, cause for me it's very addicting, the story's good, the gameplay is awesome, a lot of extra and useful features compare to the Witcher 1. If you felt witcher 1 sucks, dont worry, this is nothing like witcher 1, try this out, and you'll get addicted to very soon.Its okay if you wanna just go ahead and start Witcher 3, you'll still enjoy it very much. But if you really desire to be a part of the whole trilogy, might as well give it a shot. Witcher 2 is definitely not dissapointing. Summary of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings : The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is about Geralt of Rivia been framed with the death of King Foltest, with the help of his friends, Geralt will find out who's responsible for the murder and clear his name.

												Im going to start by saying that i played the witcher 3 before any of the others. I had never heard of the witcher until the third one came out and i decided i would try it after reading the reviews on it...many hours later the witcher 3 became my favorite game.

It's a hard game but it is so rewarding and satisifying in more ways than one. 11/10 - Needs more t!ts			"

												This game is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It has a really strong and compelling narrative and offers you plenty of chances to make choices that feel like they have some weight to them, though, perhaps not as much as the first game. The characters are mostly interesting, and the character development is definitely there. One of my favorite things about the story and characters is the moral ambiguity of it all. There is no clear distinction of good and evil between any of the sides. Simply two perspectives of what's right. The combat feels pretty fluid and I greatly enjoyed it. I liked how alchemy worked in the game, too. It's unnecessary in the first two difficulties, but in the higher ones, you'll find yourself greatly crippled if not using it. You cannot use potions in combat, so that adds some strategy to it. The game is absolutely beautiful on ultra settings, and it still looks pretty great even on lowers ones. The environment does at least. Nothing seems out of place in the world, the enemies are well designed and plenty creepy at times. They did a great job crafting the world.That doesn't mean it's without its issues, though. The combat does seem pretty fluid, but in higher difficulties you'll find yourself rolling endlessly across the ground with your foes in hot pursuit. Blocking is often times useless, and there is very noticeable input lag on occasion. There's also a noticeable disparity between easy and normal difficulties. Easy being ridiculously so, and normal for new players likely quite challenging in the beginning. Also, though I enjoyed how alchemy works, it also leads to an obvious issue that can break the fluidity/immersion of the game. Since you can't use potions outside of battle, this leads most people to entering a fight to see which potion they should use for which resistances or buffs, loading a quicksave, and then using the potion. I love the idea and how it fits into the Witcher lore, but it needs some work. Also, either a pro or a con depending on your preferences, but it's not really an open world, and there's very few side-quests. You go from hub to hub, each having a few explorable zones mainly comprised of small passages. As far as the side-quests go, there's around 8 or so for the first 2 acts, I believe. Not really all that many. It leads to it being a fairly short game as far as RPGs go. Mentioning the choices again, I loved how they were worked into the game and they did ""feel"" weighty, though they didn't really mean much. You still end up in more or less the same situations with the same people doing the same things. And then there's the much touted ""Maturity"" of the game. Yes, it may be much more so than many other RPGs, and it's definitely a dark game. The moral ambiguity definitely plays into this as well. With that said a lot of said ""maturity"" seems to stem from the idea that sex jokes are funny and adult. The characters way to often bring up ""ploughing"", at times it seems like every other sentence, though it's not really. It comes across as juvenile and cheap. There's mature themes throughout the game, though a lot of the perception of that seems attributed to the sexed up atmosphere. At least they removed the sex cards from the first game. I probably missed quite a few things, this is just some stuff that came to mind. Might edit it on occasion.I still recommend this game overall. It is quite enjoyable and the Witcher 3 is looking like a great game, so jumping into the series before that would probably be a good idea. It's on sale quite often, and even if not, it is easily worth $20 when it's not.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played.  First of all, it's freaking gorgeous.  The visual aspect alone makes it amazing, and I often find myself just looking around at all the little details.  As if the eye candy wasn't enough, the story is incredible.  It's quite involved, and all of your decisions carry weight, weather it be possitive or negative.  And the soundtrack. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the soundtrack. What a masterpiece. Filled with emotion and beauty, forboding and danger. Compliments the game perfectly and makes for an experience that most games can only hope to accomplish. Very few games have been able to grab a hold of my moral compass and really force me to think about potential outcomes like this one.  And the well executed combination of beautiful visuals, sound and story keep me coming back time and time again.  Highly recommended.			"

												Awesome continuation of The Witcher series that is a large improvement from its predecessor by a long-shot with better graphics, combat system, animation, and acting. It only makes me more excited for The Witcher 3 to be released. My criticisms for the game include the inability to increase inventory size, zero warning as to when side-quests will expire, limited animation during dialogue, and controls that are not very keyboard friendly. THIS GAME WILL NOT HOLD YOUR HAND FOR YOU. You are responsible for upgrading your armor/weapons, building your traits, and timing your potion intake in order to avoid having a overly hard-time with the game.  Didn't spend enough points on your signs? Good luck. Have only 30 seconds of potion when the boss battle starts? Oops. Didn't craft the sword that's twice as powerful as your current one? Tough. Also, THANK GOD the Romance cards are no longer a thing. That was a major problem I had with the first Witcher game, in that the cards had no value and served only as fan-service for horny male gamers. It kind of made me feel dirty as a male. In The Witcher 2, there is one sex scene with Triss. I hear you can sleep with the ♥♥♥♥♥s too, but I didn't mess around with that (too busy killing Drowners).			"

												Although it was short there is no other RPG that I have played (including dragon age) that has a more original storyline or more lifelike character. All the main characters and even some of the secondary characters are fully developed. The combat system is good, but there are better systems that exist. You have to save often so that you can plan ahead for when you'll need a little extra help from the potions and it's not a click to fight game. In combat you have to constantly change your tactics in order to beat the tough opponents. Overall definitely a 9/10. amazing graphics, Excellent storyline, full-bodied character, and decent combat system.			"

												BIG RECOMMENDATION!If you like real time action RPG fantasy games that is. One of the few non open-world games I've truly enjoyed from start to finish.Piecewise linear world, fairly big levels though, and a linear storyline you have to follow, but you can follow at your own pace, and it has enough side quests to keep from being monotonous. It is not open world, but it almost feels openworld. At the current pricepoint it is a steal, and easily shames most $59.99 new releases focused on the console market. This was a PC game first, and a console game second, meaning us PC gamers got an intelligent game with excellent keyboard mouse controls.There are two divergent and exclusive middle-game quest lines, so you have to replay pretty much the whole game at least once to see it all and do it all. I am going to take the time to go back and complete the second line.The quickplay arena mode is fun for practice and when you want some quick hack and slash, which you can abandon and walk away from when dinner is ready to come out of the oven.Personal quirk: one thing kept breaking the immersion for me: the voice actor for your character (Geralt) is the same voice actor who played Cal in Independence War 2, a game I have replayed at least six times; so everytime he speaks I think I am in space blasting spaceships, not in a forest hunting evil creatures and gathering herbs...I dearly hope they develop a sequel someday...

												I loved playing this game. The medieval setting is great, the imagery is colourful and immersive, and the plot is extremely well done, complex and multi-lateral. The game has no shame in throwing you right into the thick of the lore and plot line, demanding that the player be not only interested in progressing through the missions but also be actively involved in the political situations and racial tensions, forcing you to make decisions that dramatically change the plot and entire world constitution. If you don't like plot-driven stories, especially ones that demand a lot of understanding from the player, then this probbly isn't for you and you'll get a lot less out of it. The controls are a step up from the previous game, making them a lot more like typical ‘point-and-attack’ (or in this case swing and slash) video games, although strangely enough the interface took me a lot longer to get to grips with that the first game. The graphics are great too, though even the lowest settings make my computer want to melt into a puddle of molten goo. The voice acting is also decent in general, though if I hear some Scottish speaking dwarf yell at me “go plough your woeemaaannn!!” one more time….. All I would have to say in general is that the game would really benefit from a jump button. Having to click everytime you want to go up or down something can get quite tedious at times.			"

Combat is fun, and vastly improved from the first game's more traditional ""stances.""  The game is difficult if you do not prepare yourself for fights, and the graphics are still lovely.  Some of the newest high end GPU's still can't run this game at max settings.  Also, the game is semi open world, with different hub worlds in each chapter but not one continuous open world.10/10			"

												Although it was short there is no other RPG that I have played (including dragon age) that has a more original storyline or more lifelike character. All the main characters and even some of the secondary characters are fully developed. The combat system is good, but there are better systems that exist. You have to save often so that you can plan ahead for when you'll need a little extra help from the potions and it's not a click to fight game. In combat you have to constantly change your tactics in order to beat the tough opponents. Overall definitely a 9/10. amazing graphics, Excellent storyline, full-bodied character, and decent combat system.			"

												BIG RECOMMENDATION!If you like real time action RPG fantasy games that is. One of the few non open-world games I've truly enjoyed from start to finish.Piecewise linear world, fairly big levels though, and a linear storyline you have to follow, but you can follow at your own pace, and it has enough side quests to keep from being monotonous. It is not open world, but it almost feels openworld. At the current pricepoint it is a steal, and easily shames most $59.99 new releases focused on the console market. This was a PC game first, and a console game second, meaning us PC gamers got an intelligent game with excellent keyboard mouse controls.There are two divergent and exclusive middle-game quest lines, so you have to replay pretty much the whole game at least once to see it all and do it all. I am going to take the time to go back and complete the second line.The quickplay arena mode is fun for practice and when you want some quick hack and slash, which you can abandon and walk away from when dinner is ready to come out of the oven.Personal quirk: one thing kept breaking the immersion for me: the voice actor for your character (Geralt) is the same voice actor who played Cal in Independence War 2, a game I have replayed at least six times; so everytime he speaks I think I am in space blasting spaceships, not in a forest hunting evil creatures and gathering herbs...I dearly hope they develop a sequel someday... HOLY CRAP, just went to duckduckgo.com and there is a Witcher 3 coming Spring 2015, and open world too  YEA!!!!			"

												 Take the role of Geralt, professional animal control expert and pleaser of ladies neither regions as he travels to distant lands in search of more ♥♥♥♥ to tame! Join the fight of an oppressed people struggling for their freedom... Or do the fruity elf story line, even though they all look like malformed skin heads and are just so damned annoying! Clear your name as the killer of kings by finding and killing every damned king who accuses you of the crime until the only ones left are the ones smart enough to keep their mouths shut... That'll show everyone you're innocent! Don't forget to pork every woman who holds still long enough, but not in the Australian version, because it's fine for an adult to rip open another adult with a sword and calmly wipe the blood away from his eyes as he searches for his next victim, but God forbid two people should have sex! What will our children grow up thinking!? Now here, son, take this chainsaw and go play with your friends. A good story, great characters that stick with you through all three games, graphics good enough to have killed my old video card when it first came out and game play that some people complained about but, like everything, once you get used to it, it's fairly easy to understand. If you like story and character development more than shooting a Nazi or Russian or... Whoever it's okay to hate this week... Go for it!			"

												The epic scale of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is remarkable, but it's the power of choice in an unrelentingly ugly world that makes it unforgettable. Moral ambiguity has never been so powerfully presented: the decisions you make actually matter, and the outcomes are often unforeseeable and rarely as good as you'd hope.Geralt's quest is entirely personal, driven forward by a colorful, occasionally bizarre and surprisingly believable cast of characters that really brings the game alive. It's a fantastic and well-told tale, layered over very solid mechanical underpinnings: A flexible character development system, glorious eye candy, intense combat and more than enough secondary content to camouflage its very linear nature. It's dark, it's dirty, it's sometimes flat-out depressing and it's brilliant. Big improvement to the first game			"

												There is simply no singleplayer RPG experience that comes close to this. If you have a machine that can do it justice, buy this game. Playing the Witcher 1 is not neccessary (and honestly not recommended - it's very dated).It's gorgeous, the combat is active, fun, and difficult, and there's a lot of content here.You cannot experience everything the game has to offer on a single playthrough - the entire game plays out differently based on the many choices you make throughout. My only criticism was that the ending was a little abrupt - I imagined I was 3/4 of the way through when it told me I'd reached the epilogue.5/5, would reccommend to everyone - not just RPG fans, but EVERYONE.

												Since it's free and on sale this weekend, I'll go ahead and put my two cents in, which is to say that I highly recommend this title to anyone at all interested in RPGs.  Ok, I'll admit it - fatansy games aren't my favorite genre, and I tend to skip over most titles where magic is the primary component. To be honest it was the ""adult content"" that first caught my interest in the game - not that the sex and nudity isn't far tamer than what you can see on any given web site, I just wanted to see how far a video game would push the envelope on this kind of stuff.  Well, it didn't take long to figure out that while this game does have more adult stuff in it than any other game I've played, that content is by far the least compelling part of it.  The game looks amazing, with some of the best graphics out there - a little too good, if you turn on ubersampling, which very few systems can handle well.  The story is rich, complex and engaging, and well-told throughout, with incredible music and excellent voice-acting.  You would do well to play through the first Witcher game if you want the full backstory, but it's not strictly necessary.  Finally the magic system is well thought-out and easy to learn, which is great for someone like me who doesn't play a lot of fantasy games.  All in all, if you're a hardcore RPG or fantasy fan, this is definitely a game for you.  If you're on the fence about either, this game is a great introduction to the genre.  For this price you simply can't go wrong.			"

												First time I've met witcher Geralt of Rivia was back in 1993 when first three Andrzej Sapkowski's books of witcher stories were published. Then novels followed and entire witcher saga has quickly become one of my most favorite fantasy worlds. I really love the dark atmosphere of entire world where every decision and deed have always two sides, many times both bad.After many years a PC game from witcher world has been announced. Oh boy I was sceptical about that, especially because it was being developed by small studio from Poland. Even though Poland is country of origin of the witcher books, it has also produced the Witcher TV series which was simply atrocious. Due to that I could not imagine that the depth of the novels could ever be successfully transferred to a computer game when even TV series failed so badly. However since I love RPG games and based on pretty positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot when final The Witcher Enhanced Edition was released, but I was rather expecting the worst. I couldn't have been more wrong. Don't remember if it was a week or two, but I've just played and played the game, days and nights until the grand finale.When The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings has been announced and first teasers started to emerge, I had no doubts it's going to be another must play for me. And as I wanted to enjoy the game to the maximum, I've armored myself with patience and waited. Didn't play when game was released, didn't even play when Enhanced Edition was released. I've waited just until recently when I got new gaming rig, I've installed it, set details to maximum, imported my final save from Witcher 1 and finally got into the game. It was worth of all the waiting for sure.The prologue itself was just spectacular in story telling, character's depth and even acting of completely virtual characters could put many real actors to shame. Unfortunately controls and combat expose their console origin, however I got used to it fast enough before it frustrated me. And once you get familiar with it, you can just focus on amazing mature and adult story which very few games could compare with. I've played both Roche's and Iorveth's paths and both were just awesome. There are also many indirect or hidden references to events from previous game or the novels, which gives the game another dimension for aware people. After almost 100 hours in game, I would still play more (if only there would be more content).The game has some negative sides as well, both in game concept and technical, I definitely do not want to deny that. However some ""negatives"" for some people are actualy ""positives"" for others.  For example many people were complaining that potions cannot be used during combat, but this exactly follows the concept from original books - so it is positive for me. On technical side there is a problem with excessive glow of some scenes and grainy shadows. How significant are other downsides for you depends on what you're looking for. So let's summarize:Positives: Amazing mature story Stunning visuals (with some exceptions - see Negatives section) Character's depth and acting Two different story lines The more you know the Witcher world, the more you enjoy the gameNegatives: Console port - negative impact on controls,combat, inventory etc. Exaggerative bloom and glow Grainy shadows The less you know the Witcher world, the less you enjoy the gameFrom the position of big fan of the books, the first game and entire Witcher universe, I positively recommend the game. As I have mentioned above, your knowledge of the witcher world and your enjoyment from the game are directly proportional.			"

												I would happily call this game a 9/10.The voice acting is greatly improved over some of the zany terribleness in the first one.The combat, while not absolutely perfect, is streamlined from the previous entry, and fits the game and its environment very well.  You are forced to utilize your potions and upgrades if you want to be successful, and some of the extraneous things are removed from the last one.As with the Witcher 1, the game's story is mature and steeped in the politics of the world's nations.  For some, that might be a little heavy, bit in the day and age of Game of Thrones, I think most people will be able to enjoy it for its intrigue and depth.  It speaks volumes that I didn't skip through any of the story, even though I knew on several occasions that an NPC was about to talk for at least 15 minutes.The graphics and sound in this game are both great, no real drawbacks to be found there.The only thing that I would have liked to see improved on is the fact that the levels, while large, are disconnected from each other, which makes the game feel a little more linear than I would like.  This is something they've addressed by creating a fully open world for Witcher 3.I would strongly recommend playing through this now, in preparation for Witcher 3 when it hits.			"

Side Quest SpoilerI was walking through a camp, there was this group of soldiers. It seemed like they were grouping up to bully on one of their comrades. They were telling him that he was unworthy of being a soldier because he crapped himself (wut!?). They punched him in the guts and walked away. I walked upto him, asked him if he was okay. He told me to leave unless I wanted to mock him. Having him as a companion would only make me look bad, he said. I asked him what the soldiers were talking about. He told me that he saw a ghost by the shoreline and pooped in his pants. He has been to battles, he was never that scared. He said that humans and ghosts are not the same. The other soldiers found out, and he became the crapper of the camp.I get a quest, to investigate the shore and the cliff on it. I talked to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to find out more about a hut on that cliff. She told me a sad story about how there was this guy who healed others. One time, while he was busy on the job, someone killed all his children. He could not cope and killed himself by jumping off the cliff. I went to the hut on the cliff, searched the area around it. I found four graves behind the house. After reading the four names on the graves, I went through a secret tunnel beside the house and found... well a new quest. Then I went over to the shore and meditated until dawn. I walked towards the beach and saw the ghost. I told her that she ruined the life of an innocent man. The ghost told me that Mavrick, the crapper, was not innocent. She claimed that he was the one who murdered her and her two sisters and her father committed suicide. I told her that I was going to check whether she is telling the truth. I went back to the camp.I found Mavrick and CHOSE to tell him what the ghost had told me. He lashed out and told me that all monsters are the same, and I was a monster no different than his haunting specter. He said that he would take care of it himself and left. I went back to the beach at night. I found half of the crapper's blood stained body on the beach. The ghost then appeared. She laughed at me for trusting a ""ghost born of suffering"". She said that she got stronger by consuming the crapper's crapping half. I was surprised. I asked her who she was, and who murdered the sisters. She told me that their father did, because some soldiers defiled them and he couldn't abide the shame. Apparently, she devoured the crapper because the crapper's father made a deal with the specter and gave up his children, and she cnosumed the father too and felt stronger than she had ever before. She consumed Mavrick because she believed that ""families should stick together"". She thought that I would notice that there are only two sisters, and not three. I should have noticed that from the two female names on the grave stones.I fought her and defeated her. But I didn't win. An innocent man died because I made a wrong choice. I felt guilty. This was just a small side quest. The other ones also have their own rich detailed twists. And throughout the game, you make your own choices, you decide how you want to play it out. I'll leave it up to you to decide where the main story would then stand. The game play, the graphics, the environment, the characters: CD Projekt really outdid themselves when making this game. The combat mechanics are a bit hard to get used to, but it's seamless nonetheless. This is easily the best game that I have ever played.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. I've completed the game four times now, and still have another play through to complete all of the possible outcomes for this game. The combat system takes a little bit of time to adjust to (mostly because you use one weapon for humans and a different weapon for monsters). However, after you get the hang of it, the game's true potential really comes to light. Amazingly developed characters, with a story told in Bardic fashion (by an actual Bard no less -- you meet him in the game). In short, I enjoyed this game so much, that I decided pre-ordering the third installment of this series would be worthwhile. *P.S. If you want to play the whole series, I strongly recommend playing the series in order.			"

												First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going in. This an adult, mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books, in particular The Last Wish, Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.

												the witcher was a global phenom that apparently the US wasnt ready for during its original debut in 2007.  having read 5.5 of the original 7 novels i have a better understanding of the story to date, especially having played the first game.  but none of that matters as, introduced in the first game, our hero geralt, has no memory of his past, ie the novels.  either way, the witcher series is about the story of geralt of rivia, a witcher or professional monster hunter, who is dragged into a twisting and turning story of political bull.sh.it that he wants nothing to do with, but unfortunitly cant escape.Unlike the first game of the series, the graphics are far more refined, the story is much more cohesive, complex and inline with what original stories would lead to, and is exactly what CDProjekt were hoping to create with the first game.  not only does choice matter, it is essential to the very core of the game.  every decision has a consequence, whether you see it now or at the end of your journey.  this is the type of game that bioware has wet dreams about but instead sells you a half ♥♥♥ copy of.  litteraly the 2nd half of the game takes completely different paths depending on a not so simple choice in the 1st chapter.one of my personal favorite features is ""survivor mode""...dont be fooled, combat can be extremely difficult in this game, but entering the arena is a nice change of pace that will give you some, albiet, over exaggerated practice, but it is a great time killer that will keep you going in the hopes taht you can get your name of the leader board.  highly addictive and extremely punishing to the say the least, especially at higher difficulty levels.sure theres flaws, very few games are without but this is a game, that even if you didnt play the first, will have you from beginning to end leaving you begging for more, and unlike most games that claim to be of the same ilk....*cough* mass effect, there actually is more to do that you can not do because of the decisions that you made the first time around.Buy this game now, especially being 5$ as it will give you some back info to Witcher 3.  p.s. if you can get your hands on teh novels, they are fantastic and really give a detailed backstory on most characters, especially geralt and his close companions.  trust me you wont regret this purchase <3			"

												10/10 Loved this game I am writing this review while waiting fo the release of witcher 3 even though I didnt play witcher 1 because i didn't have the time yet, but this game is worth every second i have spent on it. Looking at my short 20 something hours on this game you may think I just bsing here, but I will tell you upfront I am not the person to replay the game. Since now the next gen graphics are all out it might not seem visually beautiful, but i can assure you that it will not interfere with the game play. I love both the combat system and the hard choices you had to make within the game like to kill of a character or not. This game was also very engaging every moment I spent I was completely immersed within the game(except for sometimes the traveling). Some of you gore lovers out there you will not be dissapointed as well the feeling of getting to slashing and hacking is just awesome. After I finished the game I was left breathless wanting for more. I can't wait for witcher 3.P.S BOOBIES			"

												Easily one of the best RPGs in recent memory. It's difficult, very well written, and what makes it truly unique in my eyes is that it's believable. It's fantasy, sure, but there isn't and overabundance of things happening that are TOO fantasy. RPGs these days aren't that believeable and are more a playground, which is great. But this game is some fresh air for those looking for a spectacular story and gameplay. I originally played the ported version for the 360 which isn't nearly as good as PC obviously but still played the balls out of it. 100% recommend. Also, Triss is one of the FINEST female game characters ever. 10/10.			"

												Granted I haven't played the original Witcher due to the combat system in it, Witcher 2 is a lot better than its predecessor. The continuation of ""multiple"" paths in the story line to effect the overall outcome continues and with the well expected conclusion of the trilogy coming out soon, it's even funner now to replay through it again and relive the adventure.The storyline is intriguing and while some actions are locked in place, the overall feeling that you can change the environment is there. Most of the characters have advanced back storys that help add to them to make them feel more than just a single random person throwing quests at you and you don't have to kill the trolls!The combat style supports a miriad of different techniques such as support caster builds, ranged assassin builds, stealth attacks, straight out melee sluggers, and of course the balanced approach for all skill sets. The only thing really missing is the fact you still cannot use a dedicated ranged weapon such as a crossbow or longbow. While I am a fan of swordsmanship, there have been times when having a crossbow would of been a godsend.The gameplay mechanics are smooth and 99% of the time, balanced and fair. It's rare that I find a glitched area or a zone that results in a reset as in some games such as Fallout where you can get stuck on a cliff or stuck in mid-air while jumping. Visual appearances are, even on lower settings very eye-catching and the developers did a very good job in making sure that the game looks as good as it plays.Overall score: 8/10+ Good storyline and solid character builds+ Balanced combat styles that are both unique and worth using+ You can actually for the most part, stealth through the game if you really want a challenge+ Both routes can be set to a good or bad ending instead of fixed- Combat can be unforgiving when barrel rollingDefinetly would recommend this game to anyone who has played and enjoyed Skyrim, Assassins Creed, previous Witcher title, Tomb Raider, Fallout. Worth the time it takes to play and definetly worth playing through four times (both good endings, and both bad endings)			"

												Im already 20 hours into the game and havnt even beaten my first playthrough. Unlike many game the side quest also determine your outcome and future experiences in mainquests and they actually mean something. Skyrim came out about 5-8 months after Witcher 2 and although they look similar, Witcher 2 is a bit more linear. I have a kick-♥♥♥ computer that is overclocked and I still cant run everything at maxed settings even though this is a early 2011 game. Im very impressed with the game so far, Im always wanting more and loving the storyline. The only thing I think they could have done better was some of the voice acting. But, there are hardly any loading screens, the game runs smoothly and beautifully, and the combat is always fun. Im, sure Ill play through the game multiple times and explore more as I go. If I was reviewing this game in 2011, I would give a 10/10. But, because games have become much more complex and Witcher 2 is somewhat Linear, Im going to have to give this game a 9/10. Im dying to play Witcher 3 because I know that  Project Red will improve every single aspect of its previous games. I highly recommend this game as long as you have a strong PC that can run most games with fairly high graphics			"

												I'm not sure why the game's rating is 88. I honestly believe that this game deserves a full 100.Why? The story itself is great! A mix of fantasy and political feud accompanied by a mature plot / narrative will suck you in. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is to die for and the main character is someone who you can empathized with. That's Geralt of Rivia for you.Many say that the gameplay is hard but I beg to differ. This game is NOT like Dark Souls difficulty. It is however, realistic in the sense that you probably would have a hard time beating 3 people instead of 1. The game promotes you to use ALL of your abilities properly and smartly. It may sound difficulty but it isn't. Once you know how you maneuver your character, then you would know exactly what to do.I can't emphasize how much I love this game. Probably one of my top 3 RPGs of all time. PLAY THIS GAME.			"

												One of the finest RPGs I've played in years, The Witcher 2 is full of memorable moments filled with quirky characters, beautifully crafted cut-scenes and epic battles. Your story is driven by your choice, allowing for dramatic consequences and diverging game paths.This is the game where the visuals alone can win you over. There are times in the game where you'd just have to stop; take in the splendid vistas, and immerse yourself in the organic world of The Witcher. Aside from the awkward combat, and other minor annoyances; one can't be bothered when busy slaying giant kraken, ploughing Triss, brawling, or rescuing elven ♥♥♥♥♥s from burning buildings on maximum graphical settings.

The potion crafting system is easy to execute, but it has a slight learning curve in order to understand what you're making and how many of each type. I ran into a few glitches in a quest that allowed me dialogue options, which led to a quest that couldn't be completed.

												There is simply no singleplayer RPG experience that comes close to this. If you have a machine that can do it justice, buy this game. Playing the Witcher 1 is not neccessary (and honestly not recommended - it's very dated).It's gorgeous, the combat is active, fun, and difficult, and there's a lot of content here.You cannot experience everything the game has to offer on a single playthrough - the entire game plays out differently based on the many choices you make throughout. My only criticism was that the ending was a little abrupt - I imagined I was 3/4 of the way through when it told me I'd reached the epilogue.5/5, would reccommend to everyone - not just RPG fans, but EVERYONE.

												The Witcher is one of my favourite game series of all time and CD Projekt Red somehow managed to make an even better game than the first, keeping true to the books the game is based on the games takes you through a very mature, unique, fun and challenging experience that IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. However most of the difficulty in Witcher 2 comes from the very steep learning curve similar to the first game. The many branching storylines that unfold based on the players choice also give a huge amount of replayablity to the game, the branches aren't minor choices they are major and greatly affect how the rest of the game plays out.If you were a fan of the first game I would defiantly get this by the way. This game gets a 10/10 from me it was amazing.			"

												A masterpiece of modern medieval fantasy themed rpgs. This game has it all: a game of thrones, a tale of two lovers, kings and their quarrels and most importantly an amazing underlying lore that pulls you in from the start and does not let go until the ride ends with a bang at the end. Every character can be as fleshed out as you want them to be, and some may become more friendly than others depending on your choices. Your decisions will come to haunt you or to help you as the game progresses, because what choices you make have an impact on the game world and npcs will treat you differently. You get the sense that the world changes around you and that there is an urgency to all your actions. In this game you are never safe, be it from hostile foes to swindlers and thieves to deceptive traps set in the world. And the  game does all of this with a masterful score of music and amazing visuals to boot. The only reason for the nine is the fact that it is not quite an open world adventure like that of GTA or Skyrim, but just wait until the Witcher 3!			"

												The Witcher 2 is one of the best RPGs ever made. It will bring hours of enjoyment if you enjoy deep story telling and a less romantic image of the Medieveal Fantasy. Where instead of saving the damsel in distress and riding home on a road of rose pedals, everyone hates you and wants you dead unless theres a f***ing monster to kill for them, then you're all right. I loved the game's story, as it offers more than just ""You are thy chosen one and henceforth must slay'th the great evil {insert villianous name/monster) in accordance with the great prophecy."" It allowed for story telling where there were consequences for your actions and not everything is a simple good or bad choice. Its a RPG that lets you breath the reality of the situation and immerse yourself in the role of the White Wolf, the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia. If you haven't purchased this game you are honestly missing out on one the greatest representations of gaming that the world has seen - Yes I know Witcher 3 is out and that it is equally amazing but I'm not writing a review for that game. In closure, if you have doubts, wait for a steam sale and pick it up on the cheap. Either way its worth having and I find myself recommending this game again and again for people who have never heard of Geralt of Rivia, the Witcher.			"

												First off, know that The Witcher 2 is not a game that will hold your hand. If you're thinking about purchasing this, know that to get the most out of this game you need to be prepared to fully immerse yourself in the experience and pay attention to what is going in. This an adult, mature and complex game supported by rich lore and stunning visuals. The writing and storytelling is exceptional throughout and the moral ambiguity and choices are second to none. The gameplay, in particular the combat, is an acquired taste but offers a refreshing level of depth and potential for improvisation when compared to games in a similar genre. Sound design and voice acting is also of high quality, with the environments coming to life through impressive visual and audio support and characters each sporting distinct personalities and prejudices.It is also worth mentioning that if you have played the first Witcher game, your choices and gear will be reflected via an imported save in The Witcher 2, however the choices have limited effect and it is not necessary to play the first game to enjoy the second (however you will be at a slight disadvantage in some situations).In my honest opinion the experience as a whole is unparalleled, and The Witcher 2 is easily the most enjoyable and immersive RPG I have played in recent memory. I would also advise reading the books, in particular The Last Wish, Blood of Elves and Time of Contempt as these offer an interesting insight into the protagonist's past. But back to the game, overall I would highly recommend The Witcher 2 to anyone with at least a passing interest in the RPG genre, it is the definition of a complete gaming package with spectacular production values and a lasting impression.

												the witcher was a global phenom that apparently the US wasnt ready for during its original debut in 2007.  having read 5.5 of the original 7 novels i have a better understanding of the story to date, especially having played the first game.  but none of that matters as, introduced in the first game, our hero geralt, has no memory of his past, ie the novels.  either way, the witcher series is about the story of geralt of rivia, a witcher or professional monster hunter, who is dragged into a twisting and turning story of political bull.sh.it that he wants nothing to do with, but unfortunitly cant escape.Unlike the first game of the series, the graphics are far more refined, the story is much more cohesive, complex and inline with what original stories would lead to, and is exactly what CDProjekt were hoping to create with the first game.  not only does choice matter, it is essential to the very core of the game.  every decision has a consequence, whether you see it now or at the end of your journey.  this is the type of game that bioware has wet dreams about but instead sells you a half ♥♥♥ copy of.  litteraly the 2nd half of the game takes completely different paths depending on a not so simple choice in the 1st chapter.one of my personal favorite features is ""survivor mode""...dont be fooled, combat can be extremely difficult in this game, but entering the arena is a nice change of pace that will give you some, albiet, over exaggerated practice, but it is a great time killer that will keep you going in the hopes taht you can get your name of the leader board.  highly addictive and extremely punishing to the say the least, especially at higher difficulty levels.sure theres flaws, very few games are without but this is a game, that even if you didnt play the first, will have you from beginning to end leaving you begging for more, and unlike most games that claim to be of the same ilk....*cough* mass effect, there actually is more to do that you can not do because of the decisions that you made the first time around.Buy this game now, especially being 5$ as it will give you some back info to Witcher 3.  p.s. if you can get your hands on teh novels, they are fantastic and really give a detailed backstory on most characters, especially geralt and his close companions.  trust me you wont regret this purchase <3			"

												My initial review of this didn't sit right, so I'm changing my verdict. Seemed I had more positive things to say about this game than I did negative.The Witcher 2 has great graphics and production values, interesting and unique combat, and the best intro cinematic I've ever seen. I gave it 35 hours, about six of which were spent replaying the opening sequence because I liked it so much.Unfortunately I wasn't able to see it through to the endgame. The dialogue became increasingly vulgar as it went on, and I couldn't relate to the characters. The quests became fairly tedious MMO-style fetch quests.The first few hours of the game are recommended and worth playing, especially if you like goofy but sincere royal/political intrigue. If you can get this on a sale, I'd say pick it up and play the first three or four hours. You'll get a good idea if it's worth continuing through.			"

												I'm not typically compelled to review games I purchase on Steam, but the Witcher 2 so thoroughly surprised me I had to say something.I had long avoided the Witcher series out of dislike for the apparently cliche main character, but as there was an absence of good RPGs to play this summer I picked them up during the sale on a lark. The first game I played a couple chapters of, but ultimately couldn't get into it; I had played Neverwinter Nights to death earlier in my life, and the similarities of the Aurora engine were just so strong that I found myself burnt out.So I booted up the Witcher 2. I was instantaenously amazed by the graphics, despite the game's age. The visual fidelity worked to support what felt like a living, breathing world, and within the first hour I was already hooked on the story. The characters, while suffering from stiff facial animations, are backed up by well-written dialogue and quality voice-acting. There is a moment early in the game where Geralt re-unites with his companions in an inn and, while the ""party meeting around a table"" is a genre staple, the presentation was so well done I felt like I was in a Lord of the Rings scene.The game's mechanics aren't quite as engrossing as its narrative. The combat is servicable, and feels smooth and well-animated for the most part; targeting hitches, stiff dodging, and difficulty landing magic attacks do weigh down the experience. Likewise, the inventory management and map menus are frustratingly clumsy given their importance to the game. The combat, movement, and interface were all clearly designed for a gamepad, but I found the radial quick-menu lacking in precision; often, I had to resort to the d-pad to navigate, rather than just flicking a stick in the required direction. These quibbles can be just enough to pull you out of the game for a little longer than you'd like, but the environments and the story will always pull you back in. It's not open-world in the sense that Skyrim is; areas have defined (though branching) paths through them. Thankfully they are laid out naturally enough to stop you from feeling like you're on a theme-park ride dictated by arbitrary invisible fences and, while your mileage may vary, I found that the relatively rigid environment was offset by the narrative freedom. You may not be able to go everywhere you can see, but nowhere you go feels empty or lifeless.Lastly, just to address the issue that initially put me off this series; no, there is no character creation. Geralt is Geralt: You can't make him an elf or dwarf, or change his class or gender, or give him a haircut. You can allocate points to swordsmanship, magic, or alchemy, but you'll still always be a Witcher. But as the decisions you make start to shape the world around you, he will very much start to feel like your character, and in ways much more significant than a different name or appearance could provide.To sum it all up: This is a well-polished and engrossing game with a strong narrative, visuals that are both technically and artistically beautiful, and a world so well-realized that even accidentally unequipping your pants for the 20th time can't take away from it. If you think you might have even the slightest interest in trying this game, buy it. You will fall in love. "

												An awsome game. Was a little bit sceptical at first but the game is really worth the money. An excellenct story and good (hard :)) combat system. The RPG part is not on the level with TES5: Skyrim, but Witcher does not try (or want) to be a Skyrim-like game. It is different. If you like RPG games and love to play games with good story the Witcher 2 is a good choice.			"

												So with the release of the Witcher 3 i decided it was time to play at least one of the Witcher games sitting unplayed in my library and i decided to jump into the Witcher 2. I ended up really enjoying this game and it's one of the better RPG's i've played i a while. The quests are brilliant some nice depth and detail to them instead of endless fetch quests like a lot of other RPG's.The games morality system is a lot superior is well with a lot of decisions not always being morally clear and with consequences or benefits not being evident till later. A decision you make early in the game greatly effects the story later giving you good reason to replay the game. It's not all good though. I didn't really enjoy the combat system which feels a bit clunky and takes getting used to though it does promote taking a more tactical approach to combat utilizing different spells and potions.The Good:- great story of political intrigue with a really likeable protaganist in Geralt who seems one-dimensional at first but is actually a complex character- brilliant quests that have more depth and substance compared to the usual RPG quests- excellent morality system where the right (or wrong) choice is not always clear and keeps you guessingThe Bad:-terrible tutorial that doesn't really help a whole lot -clunky awkward combat that can at times be too easy or too hard when you get swarmed by enemies. Though it does encourage you to approach combat more tactically using spells and potions but the fact you can only drink potions outside combat can leave you ♥♥♥♥ed with a surprise encounter-the save system is awful. You cant choose save slots to save in or to overwrite, instead each time you save the game creates a new save file leaving your save folder completely overloadedOverall this is a really enjoyable RPG despite the few flaws and is still worth playing even though it'll be now overshadowed by it's sequel.

												The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings is an excellent RPG that shows just how far Polish developers can stretch 10 million dollars. The game is gorgeous, challenging, and engaging. There is a lot to like about the Witcher 2 but I’m most pleased with how it doesn’t treat you like an idiot. Puzzles and quests can require a lot of in game research to solve and the game never holds your hand. When everything comes together you really feel accomplished.There is a whole lot to love about this highly replayable game. Get it.While you don’t need to have played the original game to understand Witcher 2 you can import saved games from the original game (which affects your starting equipment as well as a few other things). You can download some saved games below.http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher2/mods/180/?  "

												Really enjoyed the storyline and the atmosphere created.Too bad it wasn't fully ""open world"", and just limited to a couple of zones where you could freeroam, yet again in a limited way.Got loads of unfinished quests that I couldn't pick back up, which was a shame. Once you finished a zone, you can't go back :(			"

												Buena continuación de la historia. Nuevamente existen puntos de decisión que afectan a la misma.No le tuve mucho apego al sistema de crear armas ni al sistema de peso de los ítems. Los libros que has leído deberían de ser marcados como tal.A pesar de estos detalles un excelente rpg.			"

												Good storyline, great graphics. Characters are good. 2.99 is a great price. I had a hard time with the controls and gave up on it, but it certainly is worth the price. And if you have a good game controller(which i dont) the control issues i had would probably be a lot better. Def worth a try.			"

												This game takes you on a journey of never ending fun and excitement. It's not just the usual ""go to the dungeon and clear it out"" sort of game it's more of an ""Go to the dungeon, get materials to defeat and epic monster that you will battle soon... and oh! While you're at it defeat the boss"" kind of game. I'm sure you will never get bored. The story and gameplay of this game is great, especially how they can make the antagonists really hateful and protagonists loveable, also decions somewhat matter you do not get any rewards though your choices will have its consequences. Once you think that you are over with the game you're probably wrong because you haven't explored ""everything"" yet. This is game is great that's all I can say 10/10			"

												A must play for any RPG fan.The Witcher game series is what you get when fans of a great novel series come together and create a game based on the novels.  The game worlds have so much lore and detail.More games should be created from top notch novels.CD Projekt Red always does a great job at adding all kinds of improvements to the game after release as well.Pros: Drastically enhanced combat system from the previous installment of The Witcher. Causality: Different choices you make at points in the game can have a major impact on your immediate and future experience playing through the story. Able to create your own Witcher fighting style by selecting different abilities from 4 categories (Swordman, Magic, Training, and Alchemy). Tons of things for the player to do/explore that stray from the main quest line. Improves on just about every aspect of the game series.Cons: Sometimes preparing the right potion / oil for a specific monster can be tricky as you can no longer meditate in combat. "

												The amount of detail and effort put into this game is amazing, if you like lord of the rings you'll love this kind of setting, every aspect of the game is rich and breath-takingall but that freaking battle system that feels like hell until you buy the rolling upgrade and then it's smooth and tactical until you bump into the worst designed and overpowered bosses in games (it's not that the bosses are hard, it's the fact that the bosses are about an 8 in difficulty while the regular enemies are a 3... that spike it's horrible because you're not even warned)Overall it's a great game with 2 branches on the story so a replay is necessary to check the other path of the story.
