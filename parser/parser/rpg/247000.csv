												TL;DR:  Ignore the meta-critic score; ignorant reviewers shouldn't be allowed to review games.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Talisman: Digital Edition is an amazing adaptation of the original boardgame. I could write several pages about why this game is enjoyable to play, but there are a million reviews that can give you that.  Instead, let me explain why all of the negative reveiwers are wrong:1 - Most of the negative reviewers can't read.  I don't know how to put this politely, but it seems that 9/10 of the negative reviews I see about this game come down to the fact that the reviewer didn't understand how a certain card or area worked.  For example, they'll say things like, ""I couldn't use my Psionic Blast card in the middle of combat????"""" ... when the card clearly states when you can use it.  I'm sorry, but if you can't even read, you shouldn't be reviewing games.2 - Many of the negative reviewers are 'hung up' on the game's randomness; in their minds, this means that the game does not ""require any skill"".  Several reviews talk about the random nature of the dice rolls and card draws--you even have YouTube personalities getting uptight over the randomness--and they all try to make the same, idiotic argument:  that the game isnt' as ""good"" as, say, Dota 2, or League of Legends (where skill is required).  Of course, what they are trying to say is that, in their estimation,  the game lacks strategic depth.  This is, of course, entirely false.  While the game may be easy to play (not requiring much skill), Talisman has layers upon layers of strategic depth, in that the entire game is built around choice-based risk management and knowledge of the game.  You see, these YouTubers who have NO FAMILIARITY WHATSOEVER with the game--and thus no strategic understanding of what they should be doing--and are just throwing dice and drawing cards, at random, and then simply pronouncing the game ""dumb"", ""dull"", or ""without merit""--they're all just talking out of their asses.  They're like chimpanzees poking at a keyboard, as they make one bad decision after another.  And because the game isn't, say, League of Legends, they simply pass it off as crap.  Meanwhile, they raise up games like Hearthstone, etc.,  even though they are equally abstract and are driven by a similar kind of randomness.  3 - Talisman is difficult for many reviewers to even classify, much less actually review well, and for a very specific reason.  On the surface, the game is ""abstract"", much in the same way that other boardgames, like Monopoly, are abstract.  The game board is an abstract ""construct"" that you move around by random dice rolls.  At the same time, you are playing a discreet character, in an almost RPG fashion, with spells, abilities, statistics, inventory, followers, etc.  These two aspects of the game, when combined, seem to confuse many reviewers who are simply incapable of appreciating the game as a whole.  They tend to focus on one of the game's aspects, while ignoring the other (or getting confused by it), and then lay all kinds of criticisms without looking at the whole game.  These are reviewers who simply cannot ""pair"" the RPG aspect with the abstract, boardgame aspect, so they simply trash the game without a second thought.  I'm sorry, but if you're too stupid to understand a game's overall design, you shouldn't be allowed to review it.Don't even get me started on the negative reviewers/monkeys who can't figure out the UI.  I mean ... really?  The game can be played on an iPad, but you can't figure out how to use the UI?  If nothing else, that tells you what kind of reviewer you're dealing with.4 - The base game has its flaws, but with DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a really great game.  Some reviewers complain about the game's standard ending--and, I would have to admit, the standard ending, in its own way, is rather lacking, and it can certainly take a while for the game to conclude.  There are options to make the game end faster, but of course the negative reviewers again fail to mention (or even see) this.  More than anything, though, it's worth noting that, the game's ample amount of DLC provides a metric ton of content, from 20+ new characters to play, additional game boards/regions, NPC's, hundreds of new cards, items, etc.--as well as dozens of new endings, both revealed and unrevealed.  And more are coming, as Nomad works to ""finish"" and/or round out the rest of the game, so that it matches the full boardgame (with all expansions) developed by Fantasy Flight Games.To judge Talisman WITHOUT the DLC--which EVERYONE knew was coming--is just a huge disservice to the game.  I understand that reviewers are tasked with reviewing the base game on its own merit, but really anyone who is familiar with the board game will tell you that to review the base game alone is just a waste of a review.  With DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a great, very enjoyable, game, and any reviwer who ""trashed"" the base game--knowing that it was basically ""unfinished"", in a sense--is just ignorant, in my opinion.  They could at least mention the fact that DLC changes the base game completely.  Of course, none of these negative reviewers ever come back to re-review the game, with all of the DLC.  Like every good tabloid ""writer"", they're simply happy to skewer an easy target, and just move on.  It's shameful, really.  Anyway ....If you are a boardgame fan and are thinking about getting Talisman, and are ""on the fence"" because of all of the negative reviews:  Don't worrry.  Don't listen to them.  Just get the game.  And get the DLC as well.  It's well worth it.  The negative reviews are largely written by people who can't read, who only played the base game, and are so used to playing FPS games, MOBA's, etc., that they don't even know what to make of Talisman.  Their reviews are crap.			"

												Good old Talisman.. a board game, which could go on over days and in my childhood rarely found a real winner, ´cause we mostly killed each other, before anyone could reach the crown over and over again ;)So you need some time and patience if you wanted to play a session and this is in some ways is also true for the pc game.For once the game is still under constand improvement/development, as new characters and add-ons are released on a steady base, so the devs are also constantly working on bugs as well as gameplay improvements.The conversion from boardgame to pc is actually quite good and at the current state (including the Reaper, Frostmarch, Dungeon expansions) there is enough diversity to do several games, without always having the same characters/events.While especially with the AI, there are still quite a few bugs (no wonder, due to the wide possibility of actions one can take) it is working well enough, as is the multiplayer part which offers quite some possibilities, which rules the host will allow (and hopefully will soon get a save game function, as these games can have quite some duration, just like the board game).The graphics are well done, the sound is ok.So in the end i´m looking forward to the things still to come and enjoy the one or other session of Talisman (but would strongly suggest to wait on a sale for the Season pass, which brings some much needed variety).

												This game is the proof that Artificial Intelligence will never thrive on the human mind. We are resilient, we are focused, we keep on playing the objective instead of mindlessly hoarding items for the rest of our days. But Talisman isn't meant to be played against the AI.It's an incredibly fun game if you have at least two friends to play with. Please buy this game so I can pretend I have friends. It has huge replay value, a wide variety of characters and game modes, and even more if you buy the DLC, which isn't necessary, but I've done it anyways, because who gives a damn, it's my money, bro, don't tell me what to do.It's a lot like Game of Thrones, not in the sense that you can have sex with your siblings, but more like you can furtively ruin the game for other players out of nowhere, like it's Wedding day. You can also do that thing Bran does, but instead of becoming a cool dire wolf, you become a frog. You can still beat the game as a frog. God, I love this game.			"

												Another Dice and Board game that bring me back many years....When I first moved from china to canada 20 years ago.. 4 Games catched my attension instantly.1. Dungeon and Dragons. 2. Vampire the Masquerade3.  Magic the Garthering4. Talisman...Those games didn't need you sit infront of a Console or Computer.. Just grab a bunch of friends and start playing. They can go on for hours and hours without tiring and great test of your interlect and luck.I learned a lot of english from those games and without them.. I would have much bigger trouble blend in to english speaking society in school and in community.Sadly years has past.. The only game I still play out of the 4 is Magic the garthering and I can only do it with a few friends whenever I go back to canada.Today my passion is in computer games. And I been collecting and playing more games then ever before...Imaging my surprise that I see Talisman for sell on steam! The day i brought this game.. is the same day that i brought season pass. This game plays exactly like how it was 20 years ago and suck up an insane amount of time each game...6 player.. 1 board.. May the Dice God Smile upon you!9/10 for perfect adeptation, wonderful music and even OP characters and cards!			"

Do you love:   *board games?   *fantasy settings?   *roleplaying Games?If you answered ""yes"" to more than one of the above, go ahead and buy this game while it's on sale. You'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. To everyone else, I must say...Talisman is a hard game to recommend. My partner and I enjoy playing and we laugh hard at the antics which play out over the board, but there are still way too many things not working as intended, too many bugs, too many instances where the user interface doesn't do what you may want it to do.They're charging a lot of money for content that isn't even created yet, and the stuff that is already there often does not work as advertised. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but as yet it still acts way too much like a beta version for Nomad to be charging full price.I can recommend this game only to hardcore fans of the genre like myself. For everyone else, I'd have to say... wait for them to finish the game and maybe get it on sale at a deep discount.			"

												I grew up playing Talisman the boardgame, so it is a real piece of family nostalgia. I'd heard about the digital edition quite a while ago, when it first entered the Steam greenlight process (originally as Prologue, the single player edition). I've followed the progress up to the point where it was released though Steam Early Access and then jumped at the chance to get it. I've had a real blast playing both the Digital Edition (just against AI opponents at the moment) and playing the Prologue (single player variant game). My wife also expressed interest in playing it again (either Board version or Digital edition) so we gave local multiplayer a try using Steam Big Picture on her laptop, hooked up to our TV, and passing a mouse between us. It was a lot of funIf you've ever played the boardgame, then I highly recommend the digital version. The game is faithful to the original in virtually every respect, with the addition of the Prologue single player edition which makes for a very enjoyable single player experience. There's no online multiplayer in the early access version yet, but it is coming in time for the full release of the game.If you've never played the boardgame, but are interested in fantasy themed adventure boardgames, then track down the Demo of Talisman Prologue (http://www.talisman-game.com/prologuedemo/) and give it a try.

												I have only played the Video game version, I never even heard of Talisman as a kid probably because we were all into Dungeons and Dragons original paper and dice game. I have played extensively on This Digital Deluxe version of Talisman now and can render the following Analysis:Keeping in mind that it IS still in Pre-release stage overall it is an enjoyable gaming experience one can play with the whole family (Up to 4 players). Pros: 1.) Simple to learn and play2.) Ease of use - the game is entirely mouse driven. One can play with the keyboard sitting on the desk, feet kicked up ... using only the mouse as you relax in your favorite chair.3.) In-game voice chat which can be muted by individual player4.) Fantasy based ... always a plus :)5.) Family Friendly - as long as you are not overly religious (Devils, demons, angels, undead etc are contained within) 6.) A Mandatory Random setting!!! The host can set the game to Classic mode where no perks (Runes) can be used and all class choices are random, this is an option missing from other games (DoTP needs this badly) Cons:1.) Glitches up terribly in Multi-player if someone leaves the game normally locking it up. (SP w/Bots works fine)2.) Game glitches if you alt/tab out to do something else3.) Re-playability isn't that good. It takes a couple of games to see all the spells and Adventure cards but once you have run through them once or twice, things tend to get repetative. They definitely need a wider range of spells and adventure cards.4.) Class balance isn't that good. Some classes are very noticeably more powerful than other classes and have abilities that give much greater advantages over other players (Prophetess and assassin come to mind)5.) Using AI's in Multi-player runs the risk of hanging the game up. Bots usually get hung up in the City at the alchemist and they go into an infinite loop and the game cannot progress from there but as of 1-7-2014 using all humans in MP games hasn't botched up unless someone rages quits .... which is common if the game is not going their way.Overall I would recommend this game as I expect all these problems to be worked out before its final release version.

												The short and sweet:  If you like Talisman, you'll very likely enjoy the Digital Edition.This game is exceptional when it comes to reviews - it's not actually a video game as such, but a digitalized board game.  So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman.  Well duh.  That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant.  You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews.  The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.So, are you new to Talisman?  New to board games in general?  No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it.  Youtube.  Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version.  If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you.  If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere.  Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers.  People who like the board game but hate the digital version.  But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.I think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game.  And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix.  Happy gaming!			"

												Digital edition of classic fantasy RPG board game, Talisman. If you know the board game and like it, think no more, you need this...what if you don't know Talisman? I still recommend it! Heed this, though: old school board games tend to have different sensibilities than modern digital games and it may be bit too random for your taste. If you can't stomach being on top of the world only for your game to be turned into ashes in your mouth because of no fault of your own or genius of your opponents, but rather pure chance of bad dice rolls... This may not be for you.That being said, people tend to look overly superficially and claim the game requires no skill. It's not true. Knowing what you're doing is half the battle. Yes the base rules are relatively straightforward, but there are many intricate synergies between your character and what's happening on the board, and seizing opportunities for such synergies is crucial to survival. More experienced or intelligent players *will* have enormous advantage over others.But yeah, the other half of the battle is pure random rolls and there's always a small chance your next card will be something like a basilisk that rolls a double and you just simply die there and then, on the spot, game over. Or if someone makes grim reaper pay you a visit and you roll 1, pay fate to reroll, and still roll 1... Amygdala deeply rustled and cortisol city, you can get enraged and it is not pretty.Anyway...It is quite a boon that there exist multiplayer scene for this game. Maybe not 24/7, but in reasonable European or American hours, it's not that hard to find a game. If you love the board game but have nobody to play with, digital version comes to the rescue and helps you to relive all those painful childhood memories ;) And all you need is base game; if any of the players who join your game have expansions, the host can turn them on, which is very nice. If your connection drops, AI plays for you until you rejoin but yes, you can rejoin, which is nice, too (though AI is only as smart as it has been programmed to be, if you know what I mean - live players can easily outsmart it but also make some stupid mistakes)The bad things? Very occasionally the game crashes unrecoverably for some reason (even if you rejoin it will crash again), but I guess it's no better than rolling a double on a basilisk or double 1s on grim reaper so I wouldn't worry too much about it and there's always hope it will be fixed. If you're a salty person, the game is generally not for you, as mentioned earlier.UI sometimes is not intuitive e.g. you can be quite puzzled when and how to cast a spell like Weaken or Freeze, or get confused and reroll a die when you actually wanted to pick one of the two outcomes in some situations.. only experience can help you here and hopefully fellow players if you ask nicelySee you on the Crown of Command, adventurer			"

												I've been playing Talisman since the original came out in the early 1980's. While my preference - out of comfortable familiarity - is the original, the modern streamlined version is just as good and certainly removes the hours of rules conflicts that inevitably arise.The computer version does this one better by enforcing a standardized ruleset, making games last (usually) less than an hour and a half. The computer's turns can be sped up, too, improving game speed even more. Purists will enjoy the classic rules while people who find the basic rules too hard can improve their characters through progressive upgrades. Numerous achievements also offer arbitrary if fun goals along the way.			"

												Genre - Games Workshop Boardgame conversionThe aim is simple be the first of four characters to get to the centre so you can slowly drain your opponents life, whilst trying to stop the other players doing the same. You can play against AI, local humans or online covering all bases. Items need to be found and kept hold of to get past certain points adding strategy. Battle is based on a strength or craft stat with a roll of the dice, winning battles can earn you stat increases. Character abilities are varied enough to tip situations to your advantage meaning you will want try different classes out. It is fun to go up against the AI and they offer a reasonable challenge without being perfect players! I have played two full games losing the first against three random(?) thieves but winning the second against a more varied group as the warrior (as always a recommended starter class!). You will gain runestones to give you a small advantage in later games (you can buy these but I would suggest earning them instead). I have now invested in the first expansion as the prices and playability seem fair even without a sale. Basically if you like Board Games with a Fantasy setting then get it!			"

												If you enjoy the boardgame this will appeal to you, but:I can not recommend to buy it.At the moment (Oct. 2014):- Gamebreaking bugs (Targeting of spells, followers who refuse to use their skill correctly, game Mechanics/activated abilities repeating endlessly instead of working only one time)- AI slow to move- UI that hinders more than it is helping- online quits destabilize the gameIf they fix this, it might become close to the real boardgame.But so far the developers seem more interested in producing DLC even while the main game is riddled with bugs.Read a little in the bugforum!Might give you a broader view of the game.

												Talisman: Digital Edition is an interesting game, utilizing a combination of gaming boards and cards, similar to hearthstone. It can be played as a single player with up to 3 opponents, or as a multiplayer game of up to 4 players. Having not played the actual boardgame I am unfamiliar with any differences in rules; However, as a digital board game, Talisman feels very much like a board game I would have grown up playing. I'm actually feeling nostalgic while I play it, perhaps I'll go break out my old magick deck and have a go later. Visually, Talisman: Digital Edition looks as one would expect a digital board game to look, but the detail is nice. I had fun playing this and for someone who enjoys board games, even digital ones I recommend trying this one out. I should point out you can play as one of many different classes, some of which you need to purchase to unlock, just fyi.			"

												I feel compelled to write this review after reading a bunch of negative reviews on here. This game is fantastic! Simply put. 10/10 for a recreation of the board game. With many expansions, characters to choose, rules that can be turned on/off, and  many, many different endings/conditions for winning, Talisman is a new game each time you play. Some of the reviews are "" just roll a die and decide to go left or right..durrrr""... I wouldn't expect that traveller to ever reach the crown. There is heavy strategy that you can implement to put you atop the crown, or in the best position to do so. You can also not care about strategy at all and just have fun playing the game and the RnG of it all. However, if you are playing with seasoned players, be sure to try to make good decisions, calculate carefully, and take your opponents tendencies into consideration as well in order to succeed. Overall, this is a wonderful game of skill, luck, and fantasy all mixed into one. I hope you find this review helpful and I hope to see you in the quest for the Crown!			"

												One of the best boardgame-to-PC adaptations I've seen in years! I would happily recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether one was a fan of the original tabletop Talisman.Talisman: Digital Edition has HUGE replay value, owing to the random nature and variety of card draws, and the large assortment of character classes available. Each class allows (and often requires) you to approach the game in a different way. You can also customize various game rules before starting up a new game, which adds to the variety and replayability.The DLC is also strongly recommended. Each expansion adds a massive number of new enemies, events, items, classes, and additional rules. The DLC in this game is very definitely worth every penny! "

												To  buy or not to buy. If you have ever played Talisman the board game before you already know the answer. However if you havn't and you like fairly long games that have a progressive character turn base style, then you will like this game. I have played the board game for going on 20 years now and have all the boards and expansions from the version 2 line and love them. Many a roleplayer has played this game and in my opinion is one of the best and detailed board games out there.			"

												If you like Talisman, this is a great adaption of the board game!  The appeal of this game as a digital copy of the board game is twofold:  The computer manages all the fidely cards and components (plus no clean up or set up), and this digital edition is WAY cheaper than than the physical game.  Playing games with AI can be great too if you have no friends.If you have no idea what Talisman is but are intrested in this game, let me lay it out for you:  Talisman is a RPG in a box.  You pick one of a million characters with unique abilites and attributes and race against other characters to reach the 'crown of command', a game space that slowly kills all the other players.  If you kill everyone else, you win.  The thing about the crown is that its locked away in an inhosptable wasteland that your weak character will not be able to reach right away.  As a result, you gotta level up, fighting monsters, encountering events, and PVPing other players.  Awesome stuff.This game is not without its faults though.  This game is extremely RNG based.  Everything is based on dice rolls.  There is strategy in the game, sure, but alot of the time so many random things you can't control are happpening that you kind of have to just roll with it.  This is essentially the heart and soul of the game, so if this is unappealing to you, this game might not be for you.  Now personally, normally I hate games that are overly based on luck, but Talisman is great because it never pigeon holes you into situations.  Every turn you have a choice on which direction to go, where on the board(s) to travel, who to interact with, etc and these choices give you an illusion of freedom and often a way to blame yourself for your bad luck.  Went into a cave and got ♥♥♥♥ed by a dragon at level one?  Should have gone to town, your opponent would have got the dragon instead.  Now, this game does have a 'fate' system that lets you reroll dice, giving you some control over your luck, but it can be hard sometimes to know when is best to reroll and sometimes you can just reroll bad rolls again(dice rolls are seeded at the begining of the game, so reloading doesnt work).This game does a great job of always giving you something to do and work towards, and the various expansions give lots of variety and alternative scenarios.  If you get this game I highly recommend some of the expansions (get the season pass on sale to get all future expansions cheap), specifically the reaper and the corner boards. Before rounding out this review I just want to provide a shout out to the company that made this digital adaption, nomad games.  Originally I thought this company was just porting this game from the ios and wouldn't care for the quality of the game post release.  How wrong I was.  Not only do they participate on the forums frequently and respond to posters, but they have even developed and distributed free content based on customer critisism.  This is very rare these days and exremely praiseworthy.Objectively Talisman isn't the greatest game ever made, but I seriously love this game regardless.  It may be luck heavy but the experience of travelling around the board, collecting loot and getting stronger before racing to the end against other players is great.  Laugh at your friends as the dice ♥♥♥♥ them, then cry out in amazement as they get the luckiest card draws, but most of all enjoy the ride and the emerging narrative that the game provides.			"

												Pretty good implementation of the board game. If you are a fan of the original and crave some old school RNG-ridden and nostalgia-coloured Talisman action, this game will provide a satisfying experience, especially since you can play solo (with bots). AI is ok, although uneven - sometimes surprisingly competent, sometimes disappointingly dumb. Digital version is obviously only a shadow of the social tabletop experience, but certainly beats the cardboard version when it comes to game setup time. ;)About the only thing I do not like is the reactionary spellcasting system (casting spells as reaction to certain events), which is rather clunky - although I have no idea how it could be done better and not bog the game down.

												This game was a blast and provides a fun way to play the board game without the hassle of trying to get all the equipment together to setup, and then breaking it down again after the game.  Very entertaining versus the AIs, and even more so with devious, thinking individuals at the helm.  I enjoyed the heck out of the game.  I wouldnt be playing 24/7 but its a nice switchup for a bit of fun with some of my other friends that also enjoyed playing this game table top.Updated after purchasing all XPACs.Recently with the additions of all of the expansion packs, I have experienced NUMEROUS errors/glitches/and bugs playing the game. Considering that the game can run upwards of 4 to 5 hours for a group of 4 that are enjoying themselves, to have the game screw up (client/server crashes for one or all players, yes both have happened to me and my friends) and be unrecoverable is inexcusable seeing as you lose all your experience for the game. At times, spells do not function as stated, Objects do not work properly (as stated on the card), etc.  Sadly, I am changing my recommendation to NO until the developers address the issues.  I am hoping a developer will read this and address the bugs.Update the the newest xpac:Warhorse STILL does not function properly although I do enjoy the new content.  Again...until SIMPLE game mechanics are corrected, then I refuse a thumbs up.			"

												I absolutely love this game! I played the original board game for years whenever I could get enough people together to sit down and play, which wasn't often. The Digital Edition compares to the original very well. You can play whenever you have the time, and if friends aren't available, you can always play against the computer. The house rules allow you to add certain elements to the game those of us who have played the board game have been using for years. Although runestones were not a part of the original game, they are fun, and if for some reason you don't like using them, they are completely optional.This game is my favorate download from Steam.

This gamei s a great way to play with friends new and old, perhaps your gaming group can't make it to the table as often as you'd like? Or you're just looking for something small and light hearted to play in a night, this is the game for you. The core game alone is replayable time and time again, but if that's not enough for you then Workshop games has announced they are going to be bringing all of the physical expansions into this digital edition, so you will never run out of new stuff to play with.

												The AI is woefully inadequate to the point of making the game totally irrelevant.  An AI player had 15 strength, 12 Craft and 3 talisma in its inventory and never attempted to even enter the central ring.  This was while I was at the crown of command.  Speaking of which, I spent more than 1.5 hours at the crown of command before finally dropping the final AI player.  This is the same AI troll with 15 strength, 12 craft, 13 followers and 15 items (after robbing the corpses of the other dead players), and all it did was go back and forth to healers.  I've played the original and we've always had trouble finishing a game in under 4 hours, and I've come to decide that it might not be us that is the problem.  Unless you are only going to play this against human opponents, give this one a miss.			"

												I have a really soft spot for Talisman, just like everyone who spent their childhood playing the older edition. The board game part still holds up, it's fun to play with your friends, taking stabs at each other while racing for the crown of command. Unfortunately that fun is hamstrung by poorly designed UI. Everything about it is clunky and irritating to the point where I can't be bothered to play this anymore. Here's a short rundown of the biggest offenders:* Looking around the map is awkward. You can't quickly zoom in on a location, see it's text or quickly browse the cards that are there. Of course you can do all of that, but it's not intuitive or snappy.* Timers are awkward on spells that have to be cast during certain phases. There's a mechanic where you mark a spell to fire when the trigger is available, but it can sometimes work differently than expected making you target the wrong player. Can be avoided by playing more carefully but it's easy to make a mistake.* Planning your turn while your oponnents are playing is nearly impossible. The camera will constantly snap back to the current player showing them move. You will also be presented with the reverses of cards every time they're making a decision effectively blocking your screen because why not. You can't basically do anything useful while it's not your turn. It plays like a online enabled hot seat game. This leads to a lot of downtime and makes the games drag on unnecessarily.* In-game handling of people dropping out of game for whatever reason is ♥♥♥♥. The AI automatically takes over for anyone who loses connection so unless you react quickly enough and save they will lose their turn to AI doing some dumb stuff. Also there is no way for a player to rejoin without reloading the whole game. To top it all off the game handles reloading a saved multiplayer game automatically without you ever seing any menus (like say 'chose a saved game to load'). It usually works fine but can (and has) lead to losing your savegame. It makes me really sad to recommend meeting for the board game version or playing on tabletop simulator over this version. "

												Excellent game, a perfect port for it's tabletop version where you end up forgetting to move the Reaper! Nomad games is atm still stuggling to fix all the bugs, but as they stand they are somewhat tolerable. Cons: -Very frustrating game. Make plans for when your plans fail out of pure misfortune. Not to the faint of heart.-Spell system is clunky-Requires DLCs to be playable (The standard ""crown of command"" victory condition is UTTERLY HORRIBLE. Notice how many negative reviews complain about it, while not having played any DLC?)Pros:-Will teach you to grow a pair of balls and deal with your frustration. Stop being whiny and keep trying. Builds character.-Vengeance is sweet (Game actually has an achievement for when you take revenge). Just be mindful that your own plans of revenge may grow too time-consuming! Would you rather eliminate a player or win the game?-EXCELLENT DLCs. Really, they are worth every penny atm, as long as nomad doesn't screw up in a future update.-You can be a jester.All in all, a thumbs up!Edit: Grammar.			"

												This game isnt bad for a little casual game. Though I heavily recommend playing it with friends otherwise it could be boring with just AI. But dont get me wrong! It can still be fun alone, but more fun with friends.I like the network ability to play with friends, however you can also do local multiplayer which is nice (Same computer). My favorite is how nicely this works on my Windows 8.1 tablet. Works flawlessly with touch controls (I think the game was designed with touch in mind it works that well).If you're not a fan of what basically is a turn-based fantasy boardgame / cardgame, this game isnt for you. If you like that stuff, I recommend checking this out.			"

												First off I hate Games Workshop and their unscrupulous buisness practices over the past few years. However not knowing they aquired Talisman IP when I purchased it, I do not regret that purchase. They know how to make excellent functioning video games. Dawn of war was great, blood bowl as well, and now Talisman. A faithful conversion from Board game to Video Game, its better in many ways to the board game in that turns fly by without needing to restack the deck you all knocked over or losing cards to the floor. It streamlines everything that needed streamlining and was faithful to everything needing to be faithful. They did good.			"

												I've played the boardgame once before. I've played this version once or twice now. Here's the pros and cons for PC. Personally, I love and I'd recommend it. I actually made a game sort of like this when I was in school, before I knew this existed. Pros -> No lost pieces.> No questionable owner / source of rules if pieces or books are missing. Even comes with a ""house rules"" setting if demanded or the sake of extra fun or defense of some paradigm.> No potential mess, lack of space, or damaged cards and pieces.> Easy tracking of statistics and view.> Easy access to other players.Cons -> Cost: Now you and your friends need to each own a copy, both the game and the DLC. HOWEVER, there is a local multiplayer so this could be ignored if everyone treats it like a ""party game"".> No Freedom: If you wanted to make your own game mode or something of that nature, this isn't a table top simulator; this is actually the game so you would actually be playing the standard iteration.

												If you like the boardgame this is a very good implementation of the board game.  Do be sure to snag all of hte expansions if you have a chance; they're worth what they charge for them.  If you don't like the board game or don't like board games (or board games with a fair amount of luck in them) then you won't enjoy this game.  A few minor rule changes had to be made for this version, and there are a few cards that are different from the base expansions.  IMO the character packs aren't worth the money if you buy the expansions, since the new characters aren't well-balanced and the expansions have plenty of other charactrs to play.  The AI is weak, although it has improved since launch.  I win nearly all of the time against 3 AI players (you can have up to six players total), but collectively they usually give me a run for my money.  Of course, if you have someone to play this with, that's even better because setting up the board game and its expansions is a chore that the digital edition let's you ignore.  Some interesting house rules are included as options.  Overall, if I wasn't into Talisman: The Board Game I probably wouldn't buy this unless it's offered at a really steep discount.  If you're into the board game, then it's well worth the money, especially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												A terrific game plagued with negative reviews because of the shakey multiplayer connections. As a single player game, Talisman: Digital Edition is a wonderful and addictive experience. The combination of RPG + board game + card game sounds like a lot of convoluted chaos, but instead, you are presented with a *very* easy to learn masterpiece of a game. The art style of the cards is very professional, every interface is beautifully polished and simplistic so you don't get overwhelmed with information. When you first begin a game, you are presented with an assortment of helpful tutorial tips which explain basically all you need to know, while being able to grasp the rest yourself. There are so many characters to choose from, each with differing and very intriguing special abilities. As far as multiplayer goes, I haven't had any issues playing online with my fiance in the same room, but playing with someone in a different part of the world, that's when I began to have problems. If your main concern is playing online with real people, then perhaps you want to keep your money, unless it's local (hot seat type play) LAN type network. For singleplayer, I 100% recommend this game, it is beautiful with only minor glitches, and you will really wonder where the time went. I'm not normally someone who can sit and play the same game for more than 30 - 60 mins at a time, and I've already sunk over 8 hours into this game in the last three days. I certainly look forward to playing more!			"

												Wow. At first i was just browsing around steam for some board games because i've always wanted a digital board game, then saw talisman on sale and caught my attention. At first when i played it i noticed it was very simple and easy to get into, doesnt take much learning for you to get started. The basic principal is just to walk around the board and get stronger until youre powerful enough to get into the middle and win, and along the way you fight monsters and also other a.i/players, its not as complicated as it looks. I managed to get my best friend to buy the game and bamm just like that we were addicted to it and stayed up playing till 3-4am. Bare in mind that a single game from start to finish can take a whiiiiiiilllle. Our average game lasted about 3-4 hours, but u can always save and come back to it later.So far on my end(windows 8.1) i have not encountered any problems whatsoever. But my friend on his Mac kept having crashing issues, such as crashing when i would invite him to play, and also he would he ALWAYS crashes when the game is over, stopping him from getting any experience points.I highly recommend this game if you're slightly interested. Just buy the base game, and if youre wanting for more you can always buy an expansion pack here and there. But if your sure youre gonna like this after watching a few lets plays, then i recomend just getting Season pass, you'll save money in the long run as there are a few more expansion that have not been released yet.and btw, if you end up getting addicted like me, get the app on  your phone. so u can talisman while taking a sh*t!

												This game is fun to play, but in my oppinion - and for me personally - I bought the digital version to play when I'm alone. For playing with others, I got the board game, irl-edition.But the AI is messed up. In general tactics, they are great, but it seems the AI is entirely unaware of their ultimate goal in this game. The AI-players don't even try to win, they get around and buff up until they are invincible, but what then they do with their talisman is using the alchemy spell to turn it into one piece of gold. So that's why I do not recommend it. It's hard to enjoy a game of competition when there is none.			"

												I remember begging my older brothers to play Talisman with me back in the '80ies. They rarely did (jerks). If only I could have had AI players back then!A very well done video game version of a classic fantasy board game. In fact, I prefer this version over the actual board game for three reasons:1) No set up or take down (which was very time consuming with the board game).2) You don't need to beg people to play with you.3) You can save it, so you don't have to play for six hour straight (if you don't want to).The only bug I can see, (and maybe it is just me) is that it seems that if you fate a roll you have a 95% chance to get equal or less-than your previous die roll. I once got seven 1's in a row using fate to reroll. (I charged back up at the graveyard.) It didn't matter if it was for movement or combat.Other than that, it has a TON of DLC which makes for a huge amount of replay value. The expansions always follow the same expansion with the board game so if you are familiar with the rules there there is no learning curve.Online multiplayer is a little buggy sometimes if someone has a poor connection, but that is probably universal. And the Steam achievements are pretty hard/fun to accomplish!I have no idea why Metacritic has this game at 51/100, it deserved a much high rating.			"

												After a decent amount of playtime on this I can say that this is a fairly good adaption of an excellent board game.Talisman is an original luck based adventure game that is immensely fun to play with friends. Even though it is very luck based, there is skill involved. Mainly in the choices you make and the risks you take. But even with the amount of skill you may have in this game you can always still lose from a bad dice roll. While this might seem unfair, you should know that you cannot take this game seriously. It's meant to be fun and it really, really is.However, if you don't like dice in board games, this isn't for you.The amount of online players is slim but it's still possible to get a game as there are many long time players. That said, it's always best to pick a fourpack of this game and play with friends for the best experience.The two current expansions, The Reaper and Frostmarch are worth the extra £8, though I wouldn't pick up the character packs for £1.50 which only give you one bonus character unless they're on sale. [EDIT: Most of the large expansions, such as the Highland and the Dungeon are also completely worth the full price, though I'd still wait as this game goes on sale all the time.]			"

												This game is so... so long. It never ends folks. Imagine it like this. Imagine you are going to see the lord of the rings trilogy, extended edition, for the first time ever. You are so hyped. You pay real money for it. You sit through hours and hours and hours, and you are getting antsy and you need to get up but you really want to hang in there. So you come to the end, and frodo is walking into the volcano with the ring, only to find Toad there, who says ""Sorry Frodo, your princess is in another castle!"". This game is best played later at night, with friends, high, or drunk, so you can mystery science theatre it. Otherwise don't purchase.			"

												This game is SO ADDICTING! I have never played a table-top game (yes i know commence the eye-rolling or jaw dropping)....anyways this game is really fun to play with friends, it's still fun to play with just you and AI but honestly this game was made for 4 player co-op and not single player.This works exaclty like what you would see in a table top game. This game also features the ability to not only play as the various classes each one akind to their own set of playstyles  but also having your own set of rules and regulations for the game. Depending upon how well you set up your game a whole game can go on for hours without end.If you like table top games, having fun with friends, and having time pass by. Get. This. Game. Or at least wishlist it till the game pads out some of it's issues But i still recommend it! "

												I didn't realise I would like this board game, this much. The Talisman series sure is engaging, with its replayability and large amount of achievements. The developers have added a number of scenario and character expansions which add to the game's longevity. It can be pricey once everything adds up, so it'd be best to get the Season Pass or shop during sales.			"

												Great conversion of a great board game. Some of the characters are broken (I am looking at YOU, Dark Cultist!), and some optional mechnanics are a bit hard to follow, but it's faithful to the origninal. Gameplay is just the right mix of complex and fast, with a lot of variety available once you add in the expansions with their new ending cards, extra mechanics and map zones.The DLC is both completely optional, and very reasonably priced. If you are just now buying it looks intimidating to get them all, but if you wait for a sale they can be had for 50-75% off which makes it more bearable. It's worthwhile getting all of them, especially the expansions. While the individual characters might seem like something you will never play, playing against them as NPCs still adds replay value to the game as a whole.			"

												First let me say i wasnt aware of talisman till a few days ago and i have to be completely honest.This is a must buy. im loving ever minute, and yes i too read all the mixed reviews and in part i agree.but heres my way to decide if talismans for you.1. buy the multi player version first (at writing this review it was on sale £1.67).full price around £5.2. ( watch a few youtube vids on the game, & get a feel for the rules etc)3. if you feel that this is your sort of game, then purchase the prologue.id call  this the talisman tutorial , dont worry to much about counting moves, just enjoy the ride that is talismanThere are more than 50 quests, and the pros of this are you will get to really understand about how to build your chosen characters , get a taste of what possible rewards and pitfalls await you within the adventure card deck,which must be turned after every move and finally which squares of the board not to go to.This is why its a must buy for anyone thats new to talisman.(at time of review it was not on sale ) .so at this point weve spent less than the price of a costa coffee & muffin (£7)im old skool and this feels like your playing a adventure story novel, the dice will make or break you.but im enjoying every minute playing and as i select every adventure card or spell card you will be like a kid opening a present. for the price you get a lot of fun for your bucks.i give prologue  a beast slaying, spell casting  8/10(The best way to find your gaming legs , which will only add to you enjoying the multiplayer game even more.)DLC review.now i wouldnt advice you to dig deep and buy all the dlcs, unless  you know the game inside and out.but i would say to maybe look at (The Reaper or The Blood Moon first )these add a little extra fun to your game and  beginner must haves.will i end up getting all the dlc, 100% yes. The more you play Talisman ,the more you want to play, win, lose or draw its more fun that a sack full of kittens.(just a saying , animals should always be loved and looked after lol).At the time of this review i also purchased the ps4 version which came with all dlc apart from 1 or 2 that are on steam.(£23). this game is a amazing ride, and the Buy now button is your ticket.i give Talisman Digital Edition a sword swinging,strength building, giant  slaying 10/10.

												I just love Talisman played 2 ed when I was young, when FFG got the rights I was hooked again. Got all the expansions and I am a keen gamer and poster on FFG Talisman forum with all the other Talisman nutters. The DE is great for playing against other free minded gamers. My only gripe is the rules are a little different to the boardgame itself - like the Limited Resoures Rule. But with custom game options and a good lot of gaming friends the multi-player rocks. Got to hand it to Nomad to take the leap and create this fantastic boardgame into a digital format. Bring on the expansions I say and let the Talisman flow. But remember I bags the Leprechaun.			"

												Bought this on Android and was very happy to see a Steam version as well. For some dumb reason though the mobile version expansions are cheaper than the Steam versions... Cross platform play has not yet been finished and I am looking forward to the ability to combine the two player bases. Prices on Steam should also be lowered to match Mobile version as they both are the same core game along with all the same expansion packs. The only con to most people would be that this is a ""Build a game"" with all of their expansions, the base game is good but not that engrossing. One major redeaming fact is that if the host has the expansions then all players will be able to play the expansions that are enabled by the host.			"

I have spent several hours playing this hotseat style with friends. I think that everyone should have a chance to enjoy this game.However, I cannot with good conscience recommend it with the online multiplayer in its current state. I have played with several different groups of people and without exception experienced massive issues in every game. Slowdowns, random bugs such as cards not being played or abilities not triggering, people being dropped from the game, the game freezing entirely, and more.The bottom line: Should you buy this game?NO - Unless you're planning on playing exclusively off-line multiplayer or by yourself, in which case it's the best digital tabletop game you can acquire on Steam.

												Monopoly-labelled-RPG.You don't have to think in this game, you just roll some dice and roll some more dice. You fight monsters and gain stats along the way(Just like Monopoly, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO BUY THE PROPERTY- a.k.a fight the monster). This was one of the worst boardgames I've played, as it is linear, without any tactical sense or strategy required, and being 95% luck based clearly does not help.This is coming from a huge boardgame fan - having played quite a huge number of them (Descent, Arkham Horror, War of the Ring, Cosmic Encounter- to name a few). My Gameplay Session - Played a warrior, not knowing the rules, rolls some dice. Rolls more dice, arrives at the center early because it seems to be the goal- doesn't have to spend a brainwave to think. Realized that I can't get to the middle without an item, attacked an AI and got the Talisman. Arrived middle, then a 30 minute snooze-fest of rolling dice while the enemies heal up and die so very very slowly. I'm not saying that a good game needs to have some degree of complexity. I've enjoyed simple games like Ticket to Ride or Cleopatra, that at least its not a boring snooze fest. There is no immersion, I don't feel like a warrior, its just a label and gimmick, at the end of the days, Classes are just player modification that does very little to differentiate you from one another- you don't have to be smart about it, you just need to have half a brain and huge amounts of luck to do well in this game.I don't understand why this game has the ""Strategy"" or the ""RPG"" tag with it. It should instead be replaced with the ""Casual"" Tag. This game reminds me with many of the App games and certainly does not belong in these categories.3/10 "

												I love big, complex board games. Until I don’t. I’ve played a lot of board games where I start out with a big group of friends and a lot of excitement to play. Four hours later, I wonder – will this game ever end? Talisman: Digital Edition is a very faithful port of the classic board game and allows you to play either online with friends or against AI opponents.I’ve played a lot of this since I bought it, partially because it doesn’t require that much attention. It’s turn-based so I can play while watching an episode of some tv show, or I can tab out to do other things. I really like when board games are digitized. Not having to keep track of a tabletop full of life tokens and counters and spells, or put them away at the end, is a big plus for me.If you like the Talisman boardgame, you’ll probably like this. It's well done and very faithful to the original.			"

												Firstly, this game stays true to the letter to its paper counterpart while adding several newly created characters into the mix. The game allows for several optional house-rules to modify the game, like you would do yourself, if you had the paper game.Secondly, the connoisseurs who dabbled in Talisman before will be pampered by the exquisite taste of this digital remake. The board game enthusiasts will surely find this cultic game to their liking before getting hooked for life.The nay-sayers who keep looking for patterns in dice rolls will build a tall strawman in front of them and get a migraine.And lastly, some will complain about the UI, some won't like the balance this game brings (or doesn't), some will go as far as to say the game is rigged against them, their loved ones and the Gods themselves when playing against AI who apparently cheats 5 times out of 4. But at the end of day you just laugh at those people and steal their Flail/Spellbook before casting a Misfortune on their Reaper roll.This game saves a great deal of physical space, many bags of gold and is still terrific.P.S. Wait for a 50% off sale and get the Season Pass. Money well spent.			"

												My journey in Talisman.Start game as Elf, and begin traveling. My Elf soon discovers that he has a nack for lifting, so he begins to Lift all across the land. He soon becomes the strongest Elf, to the point that Dragons immediately burn up and die by simply being in his presence. The Elf soon becomes known as Bicelf, master the bicep and all things body building. The Elf then notices that a stream of protein powder has appeared in a forest, along with a stream of life in a another forest. Enraptured by its beauty he rushes to the first stream with great passion ,and proceeds to travel back and fourth between the streams, mixing them into the ultimate protein shake, till there was not a drop left.However, while Bicelf the great was busy mixing his poretin shake, a Dwarf born of a noble lineage, decends into a pit of dispair in the tavern as he drinks his life away. Soon contracting every dicease, virus or cancer, from STD's to the common cold, as he performs many questionable acts within the tavern.However, as time passed he came across a ball, the ball of which whispers to him of darkness. This strange combination of ball and disease soon beings to manifest as a being of pure death, with anything the Dwarf touches dying soon after. However, the Dwarfs toxic powers cannot be contained with his small body, and begisn to leak out, poisoning the entire land, slowly draining the life from anything it touches, with nothing able to stop this cloud of death, and when I say nothing I mean nothing no healer, no magican not even a angel could heal him.Bicelf hearing of this taint on the land travels to meet it, and hope to end it. But the STD riddled Dwarf is a slippery one, eluding him at every turn, constantly keeping just out of reach. Unable to catch the Dwarf, the Dwarf proceeds to devour all who live, with the elf in hot pursuit. The Dwraf of whom chases after a strange ninja who, having lost all his honor has decended into killing innocent animals in the forest. Even becoming so desperate at one point, that he tried to turn his sword into gold. However, it failed him, leaving himself a sword that was one part sword and one part of what remained, but no one was interested in buying. My Elf in pursuit of the Dwarf of death, continues to turn dragons to dust under his gaze, and vanquishing all evil he finds. But, is still unable to catch the Dwarf despite his efforts. Seeing how much of the land is now currupted, and no other option Bicelf turns to the crown of power, deciding the only option is to wipe the world clean, cleansing the world of the Dwarfs curruption, who has now widely called, The Destoryer of Worlds.Bicelf begins his journey entering the inner region, melting the sentinal with a simple flex of his sweet pecks. Now, with his vast quantitys of mule's, a unicorn, the ring of power, the legendary crown of soloman, a battle axe, a mecernary who has follows Bicelf in the hopes of avenging his family, a alchemist (The same one who turned the ninjas sword to gold), some provisions, armour and most importantly the fabled talisman.Ready to go, Bicelf begins his journey into the wasteland. Back in the outer region, the Dwarfs power grows, gaining strength from the lives he consumes. He finally catches the ninja, devouring his strength and stealing everything the ninja had left. Taking a fancy to the ninjas armor. After a short journey my Elf reaches the doors to the great desert and begins his journey, in its harsh and unforgiving wastland. Soon after entering the wasteland, he runs into the Reaper, former lord of death (Second to the Dwarf). Death who, despite becoming second to the Dwarf still thinks himself the strongest. Hearing this, Bicelf is overcome with a masculine rage, declaring that nothing is stronger than he, and begins to beat the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of death. The battle lasts for a few minutes, before Bicelf gains the upper hand, body slamming death into the ground, and crushing him between his sweet solid biceps. Having beaten Death to death, and having done a exceedingly good job at it, our hero continues his journey to the crown. However, he is soon met along the journey a pack of wolves, which with a simple flex of his masculine and perfect gluteus maximus, he turns into smears by the shear shockwave of raw power his gluts create. Now, with the crown in sight, and with a end to his journey in sight, he stands before the crown taking a moment to savor this achivement, thinking about the moment he'll purge the destroyer of worlds, and finally free the world. But, for a second he wonders if this is the right thing, since after all this will kill everyone not just the Dwarf. But, if he doesn't do it, the Dwarf destroy the world anyway. After a moment, and a quick workout (He does his best thinking while he bulks), he realises he has to do this, grasping the crow and placing it atop his head, so beginning the purge of the Dwarf era. The Dwarf however, whose power has grown beyond comprehension at this point, begins to feel the purge take hold, draining his life force. So, without a moments hestitation, he rushes to enter the inner region. However, as he comes upon the sentinal, he is struck down as the crowns affects have begun to weaken him. The ninja having been begging for money on a dirt path nearby, and seeing this opportunity, runs out and uses a magic spell he learnt back in his old dojo, destroying all the items the Dwarf had.As the items begin to fade into the infinite void, the ninja began to hear a faint whisper, telling him of the power of the dark ball the Dwarf possessed. But, despite the ninja's situation, his mind, though devoid of all honor still retains its strength, and he is able to resist the orb as it is finally over come by the void, and banished to its deapths. The Dwarf unable to reconsitute himself, thanks to the loss of his orb of power, and the purge draining his life force, begins to slip into the void with the orb, pulling his corruption with it. The Elf still wearing the crown, finishes the purge, cleansing the world of all life, including the ninja who was able to die with a shred of honor. Bicelf however, now being to the sole being in existance, begins to perform a righteous workout, bulking up to a godly level, and from his sweat life was born anew. Bicelf, no longer able to live among the world of mortals, writes down the events that have transpired, so that the future generations of this world could read of their creation. However, Bicelf could not stay for long as his muscles were so perfect and well toned, that he can no longer reside with the likes of mortals, since all who gaze on his perfect body would be overwelhemed by their shear power. Ascending to the relm of the gods instead, where he could become the god of lifting, inspiring a new generations of body builders.Good game 10/10, would purge the world of life to stop a insideous STD riddled Dwarf again.Play with friends if you want a good time.

												Despite the antics of that fiendish troll and the feuding of the foppish wizard and foolish druid I quickly ascended the ladder of chaos to become the undisputed superpower... for a time.

												After a handful of plays, I've decided not to recommend this game. While it's vaguely interesting, it's massively dominated by luck rather than strategy, and plays at a snail's pace once you know what's going on.The default Crown of Command victory mechanic harshly punishes any player trying to win, effectively removing them from the game and having them roll a die every turn to see if they get closer to winning. During this time, other players can interrupt the lead player or heal themselves, build up their strength, reset the lead player's advantage, and then walk in and win an hour later. Luckily there are houserules that deal with this (instantly winning or disabling healing when someone reaches the Crown).They try to keep it interesting with the runes, which you earn by playing a lot. All the runes do is give you a minor, but unfair, advantage. Additionally, custom classes and cards which were easy to incorporate in physical editions are sold in relatively expensive DLC packs, leaving the core game feeling sparse.It could be fun as a lighthearted game with friends every once in a while.

												I've never played Talisman before and would probably never get a chance in my country, so digital versions do come in handy. I've played a few matches and although game is complex (great), rich and detailed (excellent) and full of amazing details and additional content (nice, nice, supernice), I've always had a feeling I am being cheated out of dice rolls. Even compared to Chainsaw Warrior, card game that really snuffs out the players 9 out of 10 times, this game always felt way too artificial under the colorful hood.Well now... I've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it today when I saw there's a Humble Bundle package with some additional content available for a low price. I was just about to buy and indulge in playing muted Talisman and listening to audiobook again when a buddy of mine made me read a shocking post by a developer himself. That post is available at Steam's community hub for Talisman: Digital Edition and it explains in detail the horrid decision of game devs that I really don't understand at all.The most important part is this one and no, it's not taken out of context:""At the start of a new game, a huge list of random numbers between 1 and 6 is generated. That list of numbers is used for the whole game, in the order that they are determined at this point.""I understand it this way - in the game based on factor of random dice rolls, you get a predetermined row of numbers which influence your moves. There are no true random dice rolls, no luck. Only a rigging generator.This decision truly crushes my enthusiasm to play this game any longer and to buy any new content. I am sorry, but I don't see any point of dice rolling when my game is (almost completely) predetermined. When I buy a game that relies on dice rolls, I want random dice rolls. There's no excuse for this sad state of affairs and although I never do this, I urge you all to vote this review up so people prove to the devs changes have to be made to make a great game - great.

												If I could tell you only one thing about Talisman, it's this: the first two hours or so were spent exploring the board, tussling with the other players, defeating monsters, stockpiling resources. The last two hours consisted of me rolling a die, hoping for a 50-50 chance result to come up a number of times. Every turn. Flip a coin. Next. It took me more than EIGHTY turns to finally grind everyone's HP down to zero. Max HP any one opponent held at any time? Seven. EIGHTY turns. I'd like a word with the playtester who signed off on that.This is a digital adaptation of a boardgame and as I understand it, it's quite a faithful one. I've never played the tabletop version, so I can't make any statements to that effect, but I'm happy to believe that it is. It certainly feels like a board game. Specifically, it feels like a board game from the eighties, and that's not much of an endorsement.Don't get me wrong, I want to like this game. I appreciate the idea of turning an RPG into a boardgame, but this is a very flawed attempt. The first part, where you're stocking up on resources (items, health, combat stats), the GOOD part, is still a tedious grind, due to the extreme randomness. Roll the die, move exactly that many squares, hope for a decent encounter, hope you'll pass that encounter, eventually advance a little bit, then hope the others don't gang up on you once you get ahead a little. Rinse, repeat.""But it's a dice game, of course there's randomness!"" Quite right. But that's not a get out of jail free card. Go have a look at Elder Sign to see dice randomness done right. The board is a significant component of the game experience, but in essence it's no more sophisticated than the board in Trivial Pursuit. The difference is that TP isn't about exploring the board, so it can get away with it. If you want to make the game about exploring the board, have a look at Legends of Andor and learn how to get a much more satifying experience in a lot less time.As someone who has played a lot of board (and card, and dice) games and a lot of role playing games, I can see the potential and the appeal of the concept, but I really can't recommend the actual product. I see reviews stating that it gets a lot better with this-or-that DLC, but my experiece with the base game doesn't make me want to spend more money on something that was thoroughly unenjoyable.Eighty bloody coin flips...

												Talisman is a fantastic card based board game with almost unlimited replayablity. You can chose either the standard ending or if you have any of the expansion packs you can select an alternate ending. You can even chose a pool of endings for the game to randomnly draw from if there is a particular ending you don't like, then you can exclude it. There is online multiplayer enabled but I don't tend to play in the public games so I can't really comment about that. The developers work tirelessly to correct any bugs and to improve the AI to provide more a challenge. The season pass that gives you access to all current expansions and characters also includes all future content so it's well worth the money. I love this game and cannot wait to see what further updates can offer.			"

												This is a review from a person who has collected and played the Talisman board game since its 2nd edition (Steam uses 4th ed).Talisman, the board game, is a game of funstration.  It is enjoyable enough to play, but you cannot take it too seriously.  It will delight you as many times as it will break you.  Talisman:  Digital Edition emulates this experience precisely.  I know some people have an issue with the RNG of this game, but when it comes to simulating the physical board game, I can say that it is spot on.  You will rarely roll the number you need to survive and you will often draw the worst possible card at any given time - just like the real board game!My advice to anyone playing this game is to play without the expectation of winning.  Play it as if it's a rogue-like, choose-your-own-adventure fantasy story represented by a board, some cards, and miniatures.  I guarantee that once you lighten your expectations, your playing experience will be much more enjoyable.  It is the very same mindset that my friends and I discovered when playing the physical board game.			"

And with all the DLC, this game is just fantastic!!!.. I'm a hradcore gamer so i have a huge collection of physical boardgames, and i always wanted the REAL version of this game, but the cost for ithe game and all the expansions would be in the hundreds of dollars as opposed to the small cost of this, and the experience is the same and so much fun... again, highly recommended!!!

												So I wrote a review of this game yesterday and did not reccomend it. My ultimate gripe was how tedious the ending could be. Flash forward less than 24 hours and the developer showed me that there is a setting that greatly fixes that aspect and also there are some other neat functions to switch up the experience. This is FANTASTIC. If you are playing the game on your own there is no limit to how you change the experience but when playing a video game you can only really do what you are allowed to short of modding it yourself. Letting players switch up the play to what they like is so fantastic.Super fun game and I really reccomend it, just be sure you check out the house rules!!			"

												I find it hard to either recommend or not recommend this game, because:Pros:1. Brilliant conversion of a board game to digital form. Very polished.2. The first 30 mins of the game are enjoyable.3. Excellent if you have a group of friends to play with.  Not only is it always more fun to play with people you know, but it avoids the problem of players disconnecting (a group of friends will rarely abandon the game they start, whereas the opposite cannot be said).Cons:1. After the first 30 minutes approximately, I always get bored. Every single time. I just feel like quitting and going and doing something else. Exception is where my real-life friends are in the game.2. Rolling one die each turn for movement can be very annoying.  Often you are very eager to land on a particular square, and you need to go through a painful, painful, grind to roll the number you need. To be fair, you can choose to move in either direction, but still it is a slow and painful grind to arrive where you want to. Very frustrating.			"

												I like Cardboards and I like Fantasy Settings. This game seems like a pretty good choice.But it has its flaws. Much unnecessary clicking, many delays. Games turn out to be very slow.Some people like to click for rolling the dice, but personally if no choices are left other than roll the dice.Roll dice -> choose destination (necessary) -> Survey the field (take cards) -> Fight the monster -> roll the dice for fight the monster. If only one step in this chain is necessary why not skip the other to speed up the game. I have no other choice to fight this monster so why do I have to tell the game I want to fight it and after that actually fight it with rolling the dice?There are many Animations (e.g. dice rolling, moving, game effects, battle) and no way to skip them. Try to play a game with AI enemies and after half an hour you get frustrated. You don't want to see them roll the dice. You wait so long for your turn and most of what the AI actions will not even concern you.But what drives me off most is the game mechanic. Chances for positive Events are not very high, its hard for your character to accumulate progress. And when you finally found items, compagnions you can have bad luck and loose everything by turning into a frog when rolling a bad number in the city. Or an enemy just casts a spell on you to reset your strength to the starting value so you cannot fight most of the monsters anymore.Of course every game has to have some negativ value to emphasize the positiv values. Its ok to loose an item, healthpoint or to wait one turn. But taking away so much from a player will make you rage. You can be at the very top and in the next moment you loose everything.This game is far from balanced and although I really like the setting this game is so unforgiving for any awful roles.I would not recommend it, though the real life version would be possible playable because of its faster pace.This game annoyed me like no other.

												You need to roll a 2 to win, you'll roll a 1You need a 3 to win, you'll roll a 2, you reroll then you'll get a 1 or a 2 again.Meanwhile the AI continues stomping.It's just me being a sore loser? Nope my flatmate experienced the same when he was casting the command spell. Every other AI player was magically finding heals & protection spells left, right & centre. Once the wizard made it to battle his pirate in the centre, the wizard was working magic on the shield. The pirate was way above the wizard, but the wizard kept rolling 5's & 6's on shield protection for several turns in a row making him invincible. Buying enough time for that pesky Ghoul to turn up at the foot of the stairs.The execution of the board game to digital is great but the Die in this game is worthy of an online Casino. It really isn't random.Please fix. I've never rolled so many 1's & 2's in my entire life.			"

												This game has a lot of flaws. The AI is poor but that is forgivable in a game this complex. The UI is clunky. The save game system is terrible. And the online play would benefit from having a separate chat window. But the game is functional and all of my issues with it have been design flaws rather than bugs. I recommend this game solely because the gameplay itself is so entertaining. This digital version has sold me on the physical version which is superior in all ways but one. The AI, despite it's flaws, is decent enough to offer an enjoyable pickup game of talisman whereas the physical board game would require a lot of setup and planning just to get everyone in one room. So if you want to play a bit of Talisman but don't have the ability to get a physical game going this digital version should be good enough.Note: The developer did a UI overhaul with the recent City expansion. The UI is still clunky but it is better than it was previously. I mention this here because I have hope that with future expansions they may further improve the UI.			"

												A great digital port of a board game of epic proportions.The gameplay is Talisman as you know it, just on a PC. You can play the game whenever you want with a decent AI that does make weird mistakes or unnecessary decisions at times, or you can play online with strangers or friends. The UI does take a bit of getting used to, but it's pretty intuitive. There are bugs, but the team accepts feedback through the discussions page and they're fairly diligent in working them out. I actually reccomend getting the season pass with this, by the way. It comes with all the expansions and DLC characters (except the charity Shaman).I have a lot of fun achievement hunting in this game too (I am a proud owner of the Immortal achievement), although admittedly some of the achievements are really specific and weird.

												Good game but it has a few issues that it could resolve to become great.The first: Allow players to examine the board. It's annoying having to wait until your turn to be able to do this. It becomes worse when there are adventure cards on the tile and you can't see what they do to plan ahead. It makes turns slower, which is unfortunately a bad thing in a game that already takes hours to finish.The second: Allow saving of games in multiplayer mode. Not being able to continue a game from where you left off is a huge minus when compared to the Tabletop Simulator version, especially considering how long these games can last.The third: maybe lower the price of the expansions/season pass a bit. I know it's cheaper if you buy it from the official site, instead of on Steam, but most probably won't check there.The fourth: Reduce the overall clunkiness/unfriendliness of the UI. Having to click a portrait to reveal the silhouette with a ?, then right click that, followed by another click on the portait in this context menu just to read a player's character sheet is annoying. The unbought DLC being similarly displayed as the purchased DLC isn't a huge deal, but it could certainly benefit from being made clearer. The same applies to spell casting. Making it more obvious that a spell is queued, or that double clicking the spell casts it without confirming it, would all go to improving the UI.Still a good game though. Pretty cheap if you only go for one or two expansions and the base game. Around £5 for the base game and an expansion or two is amazing value.			"

												Fantastic streamlined adaptation of the boardgame without all the fiddly physical set-up. Very addictive and lends itself to some pretty hilarious RNG comedy.Half the fun is working out all the neat little combos and map interaction between the different characters. The other half is praying to the dice gods for good rolls while wishing ill luck upon your hapless opponents. Play with a light-hearted non-serious mindset for the best experience!			"

It's nice not having to set up all the boards and the game play is just as fun as the board game version. I look forward to more addons and playing this game with friends!! I highly recomend this game if you like a simplified role playing style game.			"

												I am a huge fan of the real world version of this game, but it is often difficult to get a large group of people together that are wanting to play.  This digital version is a great replacement.  It not only makes it easier to get groups together via the online play options, but even when no one else wants to play, the single player version is fun and challenging.  I bought a Season Pass for both myself and my wife, We were a little concerned about the issue with the Shaman character, but after emailing Nomad, they provided a perfectly reasonable explanation of both the limitations that Steam places on how they could do what they were trying to do with the charity drive, and why they had to do things as they had.  After speaking with them, we will not only be continuing to support this product, but also buying the Shaman character as well.			"

												Talisman is mostly luck based, there isn't really any deep strategy involved but there is a reason why it's still remembered as a classic after 30 years. It's just fun (at least for a while).Unfortunately, there are some issues with this ""digital version"". It's glitchy and you have to fight the user interface more often than not: managing to cast spells at the right time so that they'll do what they are supposed to requires trial and error. Also the AI mostly runs around randomly looking for ways to commit suicide.Overall I give it a very cautious recommendation. If like me you're nostalgic of this game and probably won't get the chance to play the actual board game again, then it's worth it if you can be forgiving of the many little annoyances. "

												Like I said in my review of Talisman - Prologue: ""the game is like Game of Life, only you kill ogres and get cast spells instead of knocking up your crazy girlfriend from college and have a loveless marriage."" It isn't the most deep and well designed board game, it's a bit too based on luck and while it's easy and can take more time to learn than most modern euro board games. That said, Talisman is a fun game to play with friends and socialize. This adaptation in particular is really good and faithful to the original, with a lot of controls to create and enforce house rules, and there are many expansions packs for you to pick and them to release. Bots play well but they don't play to win and so single player can be a bit frustrating, so get your friends together or make new ones online.			"

												I am a big fan of the boardgame ever since I was a kid. I wanted this video game for a long time.I like the game but it has flaws. Here are some of them-It is way more stable then when it was early accsess, but there are still plenty of glitches to around especsially with spells and new characters. -There are alot of characters that I recognize and there are alot of overpowered munchkin characters that brake the game. It is good that you have the option to only allow core characters, but I would like if there would be an option to disallow certain characters like the Martyr, Black Witch etc.-I would like a workshop, so people could make custom boards, cards, characters etc. Even tough there is alot of content released, I would enjoy for example a mod where you can replace the art with the original oldschol art.-Even tough the game is a skill based game, there is alot of luck involved. At times it feels like you are playing the odds at poker. I like it but some might not.At the end tough this is a solid boardgame adaptions, with some flaws, but its fun overall. If you are a fan of Fantasy themed board games like Hero Quest or Descent give this one a go.			"

												OK so first with the positive. Let me explain why, the game itself is fun and good. It is more monopoly and chance related than your choices but it is fun to play with four people. It is the board game, so if you enjoyed the board game it you'll enjoy this. Only buy it on sale though, because... the board game is around $40 and you can just split that four ways with friends if you want.Now to the negative.My problem is the game needs to be fixed. The spell casting is wonky, two DIFFERENT people with me accidently casted Immobilize on themselves because there is no Confirmation in some instances. When you play you'll get it, it is quite difficult to explain. There is also no Cancel button to take back and attacks or spells you use. This to me, is part of the fun with the game to scare/intimidate your opponent. Also, sometimes people misclick!Alright so I'll try to explain the spell casting. I have a spell called Psychic blast and it adds my craft to my strength for the fight. Except you for some reason can't activate it during combat? Unless it was qued up before? When it's qued any thing that triggers a fight will cast it, and sometimes you don't remember that it was qued and it goes off on something you didn't want. This is the same issue with Coutner Spell which is extremely frustrating. I counter spelled myself ) :If this element is fixed the game will be much more enjoyable.			"

												Despite quite enjoying playing this game with friends if you're against the AI or random people online this game is the most frustrating thing on the planet... To win the game your character must stand at the Crown of Command where you get a chance to roll a dice, if you get 4, 5 or 6 every other player losses 1 life. I've just been stuck in a game for hours upon hours while a character with 8 life and a runeblade (Lets him heal 1 life whenever he kills something) stumbled around the board killing hoards of wolves, bears, bandits and anything else that he came across. Inevitably healing him up higher than the ""game ending"" spell could ever damage him. Utterly ridiculous, boring and frustrating.			"

A Tough Talisman to SellAs AAA games come out left and right, there are times when a simple board game with friends can bring just as much enjoyment as any multi-million dollar project.  Talisman: Digital Edition brings to the plate the concept of sitting down with three friends and experiencing the thrill of telling a character’s story through each roll of the die.  Though Talisman does bring a lot to the plate in terms of accessibility and content, frustrating mechanics and game-breaking bugs riddle what could be an above-average title.Talisman pits a chosen character against three players, human or A.I., in a quest to retrieve the Crown of Command.  To do so, one must obtain the coveted Talisman to cross the Valley of Fire.  Getting to the Valley of Fire is no simple feat, as one has to train their characters to withstand the demons, monsters, spirits, and other characters out to end their journey.  Each character comes with five stats: Strength, Craft, Lives, Fate, and Gold.  Strength determines how much damage you can do against strength monsters.  Craft shows how much damage you can deal to craft-based monsters, as well as your stat to how many magic spells you can hold.  Lives are your total life counter, when you hit zero, you drop all your items and go back to base stats.  Fate is your re-roll counter, use a Fate counter to re-roll for a better number.  Gold allows you to buy certain items from vendors, as well as bargain with certain monsters.The goal in Talisman is to beef up a character, retrieve a Talisman through either completing a quest or through prayer, and reaching the Crown of Command.  Doing so is no easy or short task, with most games taking easily over an hour to complete, depending on dice rolls and which cards appear.  Though the allotted time spent on one game may put off players, getting three friends in the mix most certainly makes the time much more enjoyable.  The accomplishment of getting a character to ludicrous levels and auto-killing dragons makes the long journey well worth it, especially when a character can auto-kill a friend’s character; the fear one can put onto people is wicked fun.But where Talisman shines with its cooperative play, there are many design decisions that can frequently darken the experience, mainly how luck-based Talisman proves to be.  Almost every move one does in Talisman is based off the luck of the die: movement, combat, everything on the path to victory relies on something completely out of control.  Items and objects can help the strain of progressing through the map, but there are spots on the board where one unfortunate roll can wipe away almost an hour’s worth of progress.  It’s almost as if Talisman does not want the player to win, opting more to continue progressing characters to no discernable end, something a game should never do.The most disappointing factor in Talisman is its abundance of game-breaking bugs and issues that plague aspects of the game.  Through the 11 hours I played, at least once every two games would freeze or lock into a game-breaking screen.  Whether it was being stuck in an item screen, the “roll dice” button refusing to work, or being stuck perpetually casting a spell, it’s a hard pill to swallow letting a game go one to two hours only to have to exit the game with no accomplishment or satisfaction for the time spent.  Talisman also has one unbelievably laughable issue with its Warlock Quests; Warlock Quests are specific quests, like visiting an NPC on the board, or acquiring armor, that fulfilling the quest will grant you a Talisman and get you on the path to victory.  If a player happens to acquire a Talisman and not finish their Warlock Quest, the path to get to the final section of the board will be blocked off until the quest is complete, regardless of if the character already has the prize at hand.  What’s even more baffling is there’s no way to remove a Warlock Quest unless the character dies completely, this is almost game breaking when a Warlock Quest like “Slay a Dragon” is in possession, leaving one to hope that they can find one to two specific cards in a 100+ card deck amongst three other players.  Situations like this become more common than they should be, and it’s a really sad ordeal to see a game come to an abrupt end after one can get so enveloped into their game.Talisman has every right to be a popular, fun, and engaging game to experience with friends and players online.  Each character plays a different role and each game plays out different than the last.  It’s just a shame to see such a bright experience be crippled by frequent crashes, freezes, bugs, and some laughable design choices that do nothing but encumber the experience.  As much as I want to recommend Talisman, I just can’t in the state it’s in and with the decisions it’s made.			"

												There are constant problems.  Timing of spells is the biggest one offhand.  You often need to play a spell at the start of the affected character's turn but, at least when playing against the computer there is often no delay between after one character has moved (signifying the end of the start of it's turn) and the turn ending meaning.  The queue system is very clunky and it is very easy to cast a spell/use an item too early, too late, or even at the completely wrong time due to it being playable at the wrong place in combat.Also you cannot look at the board outside of your turn causing you to waste time doing it on your own turn if you missed something.  In singleplayer you can look at the board outside of your turn but it pauses the game.  There is no sort of event log or even way to view the discard piles (that I am aware of) so often things will flip by and you'll have no idea what transpired and no way to look.  As mentioned in the comments there is an event log and it seems to have some good options for filtering.In multiplayer there are often problems where one or more person will be disconnected and you get to rewatch the computer play the same turn(s) over.  This seems to happen more often later in the game and w/ the city expansion but that's just my experience from 2-3 games.  Frequent crashes and glitches can cause players to miss the end of game meaning they get no in game credit or achievements for anything they would have earned there for potentially several hours of effort.There was a recent patch addressing many outstanding issues with the game.  End of game crashes most notably were addressed and I haven't seen that happen in the few games I've played since.  I haven't seen any midgame crashes either, but I have not tried playing with the city expansion again.One upside is the Season Pass actually comes with all the dlc with the exception of one which contributes to charity.If most of these problems were addressed I would absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the physical game.

												This game is a good representation of board game, but unless you're playing locally with friends, it's just not worth it.  I have a perpetual game going with one other AI player.  I'm sitting at the crown of command, where you need to roll a 4,5, or 6 to deal 1 point of damage to all other players.  The goal is to finish off the other players either before they reach the crown or just to finish the game.  The problem is that even when you happen to roll high enough to deal damage, the AI runs around the outside of the board and finds ways to heal themselves.  The AI has no interest in progressing to the crown and unless the ""random"" number generator allows me to roll high enough times in a row, this game will NEVER end.			"

												I had this misfortune of playing a short game of this with my friends who got it on the Steam sale. I have played a lot of Talisman and it already isn't a game I'm very fond of. Almost the entire game is luck. What you roll to move, what cards you draw, whether you complete combat, it's all a coin flip. The main test of skill is knowing when you've acquired enough random loot to try the inner layers of the board. It's a very light game mechanically. It's rare that other players' turns have effects on you, so there's a lot of downtime. It's a social game.The port is kind of a mess. Not only is the interface generally clunky requiring what feel like unnecessary taps to get to the information you want, but it's ported from the mobile version and clearly optimized for a touch screen, not a computer. For example, all of the controls are on the left and right edges of the screen where your thumbs would be on a tablet. It's a clunky version of an okay, very random board game.			"

 Pro vs Contra Updated 7.8.16Just a few lines, the day one version (Bloodmooon) was buggy and many people including me encountered a broken game that just crashed the mp game after hours, then we where forced to upload a 600+MB crash dumb file.Its just a joke a company that isnt even able to select the right file to upload and need more space on your device then the game itself. The hompage is broken since days and not providing a link to Bloodmoon, not a single link to the new rules and the bugs, people seems to be happy, but Nomad isnt able to deliver a bug free game.Ifi wouldnt love the table top game, i would remove this game from my account. Pro*Digital version of the classic GW board game.*You can now play with up to 6 players in one game.* Cross plattform gaming.*Added 3 free copies to give away for every Gold buyer*If you play online with friends/familiy you can/will get your fun (if your game will not disconnected or crash).*Nice artwork*If you are a Talisman fan, then this is your way to buy it and i suggest you just ignore the contra points. Contra*Slow development (3-5 months for a new DLC is a long time, i paid the full season price more then 2 years ago and i only can say that the development is slowing down with every new DLC, there is no ETA when the final game will be released)*Massiv bugs, dont get me wrong bugs get fixed (from time to time), but this often ends in new bugs, before i released my last review i was a long time beta tester (and naming the issues of support and constant fails with updates was the reason why .i was removed from Nomoad) that helped for free to lure the bugs. Well iam sure that i have to point out that  9/10 of all my latest games shows bugs (some game breaking some minors ones).*MP (public games) is most of the time a place for leavers and quitters.*The ai is improved compared with the one years ago, but still not worth to buy this game for a single player. You only can cheat the game (you add runestones to the ai and give them a big advantage)*They changed there Season Pass conduct, and released one DLC (The Shaman) without giving it for free to the former buyers.* A constant dropping number of people playing online on Steam Finally i have to note that ca 400 of my hours where used for beta gaming,  and as a long time supported and as a former member of most of the groups and even the founder of the german group. Iam disappointed of Nomads behavior, they deliver game breaking bug after game breaking issue, to many to name them, and when you get upset and rage about it, they blame you and say you cost them money.....

												Unfortuantely this reminds me why I never liked the table top version of the game. Any game is near endless and far too time consuming just to make it to the second layer. In real life you had companionship and beer to offset the downside of the game mechanics. You don't have that with this one. I thought they might streamline it, but they kept the cumbersome system. Unless you're real nostalgic for the old card game, skip this.			"

												+: Talisman is a recreation of the famous board game Talisman on PC with online multiplayer for up to 4 players. If you don't know what Talisman is I'll sum it up real quick: turn based brain dead easy to play fantasy RPG inspired board game that revolves around basically 99% luck. Skill does matter to a degree, but you can and will get completely destroyed by unlucky dice rolls again, and again, and again, and again. This is not a competitive skill based game and it is highly recommended you play it when you are drunk/high/give no ♥♥♥♥s otherwise your friends will get mad at you when all their dice rolls are going great and then you proceed to steal all their stuff and win while doing absolutely nothing other than steal all their stuff.+: The game is mostly stable after several updates and performs great although it'd be impressive if it didn't considering it's a simplistic game.+: The DLC works similar to PAYDAY 2 where if one person has it everyone in the same game as that person also has it except for the character classes.-: If you buy this game even though you hate luck based game you're gonna have a bad time.-: Games do take a long amount of time, upwards of 4+ hours at times. Especially with the expansions on.-: The expansion DLCs come out so slow. :(			"

												UPDATE June 1, 2015: Pretty much all of my complaints below have been addressed. Very worthy version of the game, and well-supported.Perfect for getting the ""fix"" for a good deep board game. Currently (Dec 2013), there are still some bugs, but re-loading the game is quick and easy enough. Turn speeds with AI can be annoyingly long; animations cannot be sped up at all, etc. But, I cannot wait for further refinement and addition of the expansions. Good fun here.My only real complaint is around the core ruleset (rather than this presentation of it); I always felt Talisman had balance/refinement issues (i.e. too dependent on luck in general), but I suppose that's part of the charm. Some ""House Rules"" setting options would be amazing. Moreso would be opening this up to Steam Workshop... THAT would be truly incredible.			"

We purchased it for a second laptop and now play online opposite each other on the dinning room table and must say we have never enjoyed a game so much.Very simplistic in its style and a lot of chance with dice rolls in the game, but with so many charactors to choose from this is great fun. My 13 y.o. has a laptop as well which unfortunately is being repaired at the moment but as soon as its back I am sure he will join so its great fun for all ages.Just a word of warning that games can go on to late in the evening, so if your looking for an easy to get into game that never plays the same way twice then this is a must have.

												I never played the original board game, but this certainly captures and enhances the experience of playing the RPG-styled board game.Certain characters feel underpowered, where others overpowered, but they all have their own attributes and balance fairly well.The AI plays well, and even ruthless at times. The game is a little buggy at times, but this is a beta game, and the devs work very hard at bug-squishing!I would like AI players in muliplayer games just to fill spots, but that currently isn't a possiblity.At the current stage in development, I give it a 7.5/10. Once the bugs and crashes are ironed out, I could see 8.5 to 9.			"

												As a longtime fan of the Talisman franchise, I will recommend the Digital Edition.  But not without qualification.  While an ably faithful translation of the boardgame experience, the AI is simply not challenging enough for veteran players of the game.  It's not that the AI will never win against a seasoned player.  It can.  But things have to go extremely right for the AI, and extremely wrong for the player, for this to happen.   Even with the wonky AI, I still find myself enjying the game.  And I believe most folks familiar with the game will, as well.If you've never played Talisman, the AI is actually a benefit, as it keeps the game from being too punishing to neophyte players.  It's not that Talisman is an overly complex game.  But there is a lot of information to absorb.  The starter set alone boasts over a dozen playable characters, all of whom have multiple special abilities and differing alignments; there are five attributes for each character; there are nearly one hundred event cards, spells, etc.  So you get the idea.  There's a bit to learn and the AI allows games to extend the learning curve.If reviews were given on a scoring basis as opposed to a simple recommend/not recommend, I would score Talisman: Digital Edition a solid 8.  In spite of the AI, the overall gameplay experience is fun for those who like board games or fantasy settings and there is a lot of replayability to be had. "

												Well, after playing this game both online and off, I can honestly say we have a classic here folks, well two actually(Prologue version being the other one) in this you get more characters then in the prologue, more spells, and  runes,(If you buy them), along with a Grim reaper expansion, all of which make this version a little more interesting, course it also does not hurt that it is online/offline multiplayer either with other people, or the computer, and this game has a save feature, (Though to save a online game, you have to be friends with the other players via steam, one thing I will knock this version about, and I do give Prologue something of the advantage on, is there are no other quests really other then getting the crown(Well okay there is the alchemist quest, but I mean more like a side quest type deal like Prologue version, it would have been interesting if you could have done such quests for boosts to your stats, of course it would have made the game longer, perhaps, but more interesting in my opnion.) But this game is still fantastic, and the expansions and huge number of characters and special abilities make up for it. Especially if you get all the expansions. (There is the reaper expansion which adds 4 characters, various spells, and enemies, new events, and places, and all new treasures, The Runestone expansion deck, which is a deck of cards used to power up your characters quickly, and apparently can be carried over from game to game, and 5 new character packs, that juat add new characters in the game, such as the Genie, etc.) and the ability to make houserules, as well as possibly choose  the character you play, all adds new quirks to the game as well as the much feared Reaper, who at the whim of a player could out right kill you, with a bad roll of the die. The quest for the crown of control has never been more wrought with danger, and intrigue. If you are a fan of the classic board game, or a fan of the adventure board game in general you'll want it all, and the prologue version of this too. Oh and this version, has steam achievements. (Unlike Prologue)Overall Numbers:Graphics: The game board looks good, and the cards and characters look spectacular, a definate step up from the prologue edition of this game. 10/10Controls: Easy Peasy , fast and responsive, easy to master. 10/10Achievements: This game has got them, and they are fun to get too. No score for this but well worth mentioning if you like that stuff.Fun Factor: Get the whole package and it is awesome, you'll love this game, it's not perfect, but it is really good. 8/10Notes:Use the Zoom In button on the side of the screen to look and see who is at what space, as well as what card is on that space.Make sure to become friends with who you play with, you never know when you might get an extended game and need to save.

												I originally got this game because I watch D&D Stories- the youtube channel of TtheWriter- and he reviewed Talisman the physical board game. If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!There's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!The goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.That last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.Did I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.In short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!You can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.I'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.Anyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest.

												Great start to a great classic game. I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.Other than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.One feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)			"

												I've been playing the 2nd-edition board game for many years. This is a faithful adaptation with actually some of the rules improved (though maybe these were also fixed in later editions of the board game, which I haven't played). While I still love tabletop board games, this is perfect for starting in the late evening, since there's no setup, you can save the game, and you always know whose turn it is and what you need to do next!

												Great fun, if you like boardgames in general or just the Talisman boardgame you can't go wrong. It's obviously not the same as sitting with your dudes around a table and fooling around and looking and touching analogue things, but the digital version is way less time consuming and way cheaper of course, since the boardversion basegame is already 3 times more expensive than the digital version and the season pass is going to bring you all the expansions for actually a little price compared to the summed up costs of all the board-expansions. Not too bad, isn't it? And yes, you can play over the Internet with your friends, if they got the baseversion of the digital edition. If one player got the DLC expansions (or the season pass) and is hosting a game, all the other players are able to play with the expansions. So, you only need to buy the DLCs additionally to the host, if you are going to play Singleplayer or wanna play with the new characters provided by the DLCs.The downside of the game for me is, they could've made the digital version more attractive by adding some detail animations to the board and character figures with sound effects and maybe more music. At the moment it's really just a boardgame made digital with little advancement (sounds, music and handling maybe, since the boardgame can be very complex if you play it with its expansions), however this still keeps being a very good port of a boardgame classic. ;-)			"

												I've had this for a while, but since it is now a daily deal, I thought I should write my thoughts on it.  When it was first released under early access, I was very disapointed in the AI, but I decided to give it another try now that it is officialy released, and I was impressed enough to pick up the expansions (Reaper, Frostmarch, and a couple of the character packs), and those make it an even better game.  If you enjoy the board game version, it is worth getting, but do so knowing that it may be quite a while til all the expansions are out and that the digital version is limited to 4 players max.  A few of the specific character AI's such as a the elf sometimes still do strange stuff, but overall the AI is at least competant enough for a single player vs AI game to be satisfying to me.If you have not played the board game and are on the fence, but you do like board games that involve a bit of luck, then I still recomend giving it a try, but probably best to not pay full price if you are on the fence. (I paid full when it came out and still consider it worth it, but this is a game with a lot of childhood nostalgia for me, so I'm highly biased)If you do get it, getting at least one of the expansions (Reader or Frostmarch) is highly recomended, because they basically double the size of the adventure deck and give you a few more characters to play with which adds a lot to the replayability.

												This is an excellent board game that's easy to learn. The main goal of the game is to build up your character by travelling around the board, gaining Strength and Craft by events, killing monsters, and sometimes, luck. There are three ""sections"" of the realm, and once you get to the inner most area with a Talisman, you attempt to kill the other players off by casting the ""command spell"", which has a 50% chance of all players losing one life. This is the only way to win the game, as killing the players before someone is at the center just results in that player gaining a new character.I recommend getting the Gold Pack, as the expansions make the game that much more fun to play, and the benefit of more character choices makes the strategy more varied.

												This is an excellent board game that's easy to learn. The main goal of the game is to build up your character by travelling around the board, gaining Strength and Craft by events, killing monsters, and sometimes, luck. There are three ""sections"" of the realm, and once you get to the inner most area with a Talisman, you attempt to kill the other players off by casting the ""command spell"", which has a 50% chance of all players losing one life. This is the only way to win the game, as killing the players before someone is at the center just results in that player gaining a new character.I recommend getting the Gold Pack, as the expansions make the game that much more fun to play, and the benefit of more character choices makes the strategy more varied.

												I originally got this game because I watch D&D Stories- the youtube channel of TtheWriter- and he reviewed Talisman the physical board game. If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!There's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!The goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.That last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.Did I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.In short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!You can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.I'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.Anyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest.

												Well, after playing this game both online and off, I can honestly say we have a classic here folks, well two actually(Prologue version being the other one) in this you get more characters then in the prologue, more spells, and  runes,(If you buy them), along with a Grim reaper expansion, all of which make this version a little more interesting, course it also does not hurt that it is online/offline multiplayer either with other people, or the computer, and this game has a save feature, (Though to save a online game, you have to be friends with the other players via steam, one thing I will knock this version about, and I do give Prologue something of the advantage on, is there are no other quests really other then getting the crown(Well okay there is the alchemist quest, but I mean more like a side quest type deal like Prologue version, it would have been interesting if you could have done such quests for boosts to your stats, of course it would have made the game longer, perhaps, but more interesting in my opnion.) But this game is still fantastic, and the expansions and huge number of characters and special abilities make up for it. Especially if you get all the expansions. (There is the reaper expansion which adds 4 characters, various spells, and enemies, new events, and places, and all new treasures, The Runestone expansion deck, which is a deck of cards used to power up your characters quickly, and apparently can be carried over from game to game, and 5 new character packs, that juat add new characters in the game, such as the Genie, etc.) and the ability to make houserules, as well as possibly choose  the character you play, all adds new quirks to the game as well as the much feared Reaper, who at the whim of a player could out right kill you, with a bad roll of the die. The quest for the crown of control has never been more wrought with danger, and intrigue. If you are a fan of the classic board game, or a fan of the adventure board game in general you'll want it all, and the prologue version of this too. Oh and this version, has steam achievements. (Unlike Prologue)Overall Numbers:Graphics: The game board looks good, and the cards and characters look spectacular, a definate step up from the prologue edition of this game. 10/10Controls: Easy Peasy , fast and responsive, easy to master. 10/10Achievements: This game has got them, and they are fun to get too. No score for this but well worth mentioning if you like that stuff.Fun Factor: Get the whole package and it is awesome, you'll love this game, it's not perfect, but it is really good. 8/10Notes:Use the Zoom In button on the side of the screen to look and see who is at what space, as well as what card is on that space.Make sure to become friends with who you play with, you never know when you might get an extended game and need to save.

												This is an excellent gateway game - the 4 pack is a solid investment considering a copy will run you $50 and there's no set / clean up. If you like adventure games, and random instances, characters who weild unique abilities (theres a lot to pick from and more to come) - screwing over your friends in a blood bath, this game is for you. 10/10			"

												Finally, a digital version of this game!  Lots of fun, the additional playable characters and the expansions really add to the experience as well.  The UI is simple and intuitive, and I have yet to run into a card that is bugged.  The AI is a bit stupid, and will very rarely make a play for the crown.  There is no difficulty slider to make them better.However, if you buy this you should realize you are buying it baiscally for vs. AI play or hotseat play at home.  The online servers are absolutely rubbish.  95% of the time online games will crash at launch.  On the rare 5% occasion an online game actually starts, it will crash or lag out in the first couple turns (if not during character selection!) 95% of /those/ times.  Should you actually manage to get off the ground with an online game, odds are good that something unfortunate will happen to someone and that person will ragequit, which invariably crashes the game as well.I say, without exaggerating, that I have actually managed to complete 3 online games out of about 200 attempted.  It baffles me that the game can be so very good and the online technical bits can be so unbearably useless.Conclusion - If you are a longtime talisman fan, and you have real-life friends to play with, hook this up to your tele and get a wireless mouse to pass for a fun evening.  Or, if you don't mind playing against AIs slightly less intelligent than your average cocker spaniel, pick this up.  If, however, you are looking to use primarily or exclusively the online play function, SAVE YOUR MONEY, this is worthless to you.			"

												Great start to a great classic game. I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.Other than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.One feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)			"

It's another very bad port of a board game, where you have real interaction with your friends. So far, the only good port I've seen is ""Ticket to Ride"".Being aware that the E-Version of this game is still cheaper than the board game version, I'd say, if you're interested, rather spring for the ""real"" version of the game.

They kept saying an object was missing and kicking me from the game. The host had to let the AI have its turn, exit the game, srat it up again and invite me. This happened 8 times.

												I didn't really have any fun with this game. It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.The overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.The physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.The game is a ""traditional American"" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.There is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky. The overall UI in fact is a bit wonky, in that it takes 5 clicks to complete every action or view any piece of information.I think I picked this game up while on sale for 99 cents, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it. If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it.

												I love the Talisman boardgame but the digital edition is a pure stinker! The spell casting mechanic is truly busted. I understand the devs wanted to make sure the game was fast paced when spell casting and that it would not cause people to start guessing when someone wished to cast a spell but the whole mechanic is awful. Here's why:The only way to cast spells as a reaction is to queue them at which point they will automatically go off regardless if the spell is needed or not. For instance if you have a spell that would give you an edge before a combat roll and you've queued it up, it will automatically be cast at the next combat instance you're in which is a terrible mechanic. And as far as I know you can only queue 1 spell so any other spells you have are worthless if you would normally be able to cast them in a situation that would be helpful.My recommendation: Stay away from the digital version and buy the actual boardgame.

												This game is a great idea, but they have several rather serious issues, any one of which makes the game stupid.  As I said, the idea is great, so I'm saddened by the glaring flaws.First, and probably most importantly, this game is very nearly entirely luck.  Yes, you get to make 2 choices about where you land each turn.  2 choices.  If you use spells, you can decide who to cast them on.  But you don't get to decide what spells you have, or when you get them.  This game would be a bazillion times more fun if they added a speed stat that let you move any number of spaces less than or equal to your speed, instead of rolling the die.  One of my favorite cards is a follower that ""curses"" you by making you only move 1 space each turn.  It gives me a unique sense of control in the game that I consider a major advantage.Secondly, there are a lot of ways to (randomly and unexpectedly) lose that don't make any sense.  For example, if you ever, ever get turned into a toad, you've basically lost.  ""But you haven't lost, yet.""  Sure, sure, I can continue playing for the hour or so the game might continue in hopes of some shocking recovery... but honestly, why make a player randomly turn into a toad?  To my knowledge, there is no option to turn toads off.  Third, the game can last quite a while, and if you die early, the AI will slowly (even at max AI speed) complete each phase of each turn, dragging the game on far longer than any reasonably sane person would care to sit and watch the AI play.I have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong.  But most of the time, I'm having fun thinking about what the game COULD be, rather than what it really is.  It pains me to have to say this, but I cannot recommend the game.			"

												The Game works well enough, but casting spells when you want to is a complete and utter fail. Half the time when I 'queue' a spell it ends up casting on the wrong target because you can't stop it casting once it goes (which isn't at all how the real game plays, it is a pure limitation of the design of the game)I think I'll try and find a version on table top simulator instead, It won't be automatic, but at least I can actually do what I want to.

												I want to like this game, and I'm trying. I had the boardgame version of Talisman and several of its expansions years ago, and played it a lot. The biggest problem I've encountered with this version is the usability. Spell casting, for example, is kind of dreadful. Several times I have tried to cast spells--even after learning the system of queueing spells--and had them not cast; I have accidentally cast spells when I simply wanted to read the text to see what they do, wasting them; and I have tried casting spells at the times that are indicated in the text, only to find out, nope, that was not the right time to cast it.Important information text from the game is ill placed at the top of the screen in a box that is not prominent and doesn't stand out. There are an awful lot of confirmation clicks as well--too many in some cases. Also, sometimes the confirmation text is not the best. For example, when you're learning the game and you view your followers, the ""Dismiss"" option can leave you wondering, Wait, will that dismiss my follower? Dismiss is a term in gaming that, in my experience, has always been used to get rid of followers. A better term for getting rid of message windows is simply ""Close."" I hope there are improvements to the game design. I find myself more often frustrated than having fun when I play it currently.			"

												I love the Talisman boardgame but the digital edition is a pure stinker! The spell casting mechanic is truly busted. I understand the devs wanted to make sure the game was fast paced when spell casting and that it would not cause people to start guessing when someone wished to cast a spell but the whole mechanic is awful. Here's why:The only way to cast spells as a reaction is to queue them at which point they will automatically go off regardless if the spell is needed or not. For instance if you have a spell that would give you an edge before a combat roll and you've queued it up, it will automatically be cast at the next combat instance you're in which is a terrible mechanic. And as far as I know you can only queue 1 spell so any other spells you have are worthless if you would normally be able to cast them in a situation that would be helpful.My recommendation: Stay away from the digital version and buy the actual boardgame.

												I didn't really have any fun with this game. It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.The overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.The physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.The game is a ""traditional American"" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.There is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky. The overall UI in fact is a bit wonky, in that it takes 5 clicks to complete every action or view any piece of information.I think I picked this game up while on sale for 99 cents, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it. If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it.

												If you desire a single- or local-player experience with a faithful and loyal recreation of one of the most treasured board games Games Workshop ever created, are interested in digital versions of board games for their ease of accessibility and how versatile they can be when playing with others/with yourself and some AI's, or even if you just want a good time-killer that you can come back to at any time when you wish to resume a game (a feature not currently available for the actual board game, I might add, without manual note-taking!) then I cannot recommend this enough.I expect a lot are asking ""Then why are you not recommending this game?"" It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.Why can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.Having played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.So to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money.

												EDIT: The online multiplayer is much better now. At least you can continue a game after getting disconnected.I can't recommend this game yet, unless you want to buy it for offline play. The online multiplayer is buggy. Connection issues and game crashes are common enough to avoid you from finishing a game. Even though a host can still resume the game after crashing, he or she can't invite friends to join again. The ""resume game"" feature is pretty much useless for online play. I doubt the fix will come soon since the devs seem to want to release DLCs first before fixing the game.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Card Board game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to change the Sound volume by 10 everytime.You are able to change the Music Volume by 10 everytime.There are some Different languages available.You can play fullscreen, You have to press that ""Expand button in the options""You can play Local or against he AI. There is online mode. (with a small group of people playing.) (You can make private or online lobbies and no port forward required).Able to make different save and you can rename this.About the game.There are different characters. Each character has their own powers. You are able to choose Random too. There is a tutorial ingame. The object of the game is that you have to reach the middle of the board and kick other players out of this. Each character has their own set of Health/fighting power/Gold/Fate/craft and abilities. Some even could have an alignment to be Neutral/Evil and good. You have to fight enemies and get followers.There are cards to make things better or worse for you. You have to make your character powerful in order to defeat the bridge boss (unless you have found another way to enter inside the middle area).  Winning from an enemy character gives you the option to steal 1 item, take gold or let them lose one life point.MANY CHARACTERS,Killing enemies gives you their card and may be used to make yourself powerful if having enough of these cards.You are able to speed up turns from the AI in the ADVANCED OPTIONS menu.Game is sort of addictive.Music soundtrack is good.Calming game.There is a pause button.Other things.This game gives me the ""jumanji"" Feelings from the movie.The game at the bottom will glow yellow whenever it is your turn.Random AI like to choose the same characters in a game.Game feel sometimes rigged and could give you a nice disadvantage.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

I was on the final space with one health but no one else was even on the 2nd area.  took way too many turns to win as I needed to continue to roll with 50% odds to deal 1 damage to everyone else... even though they can heal or counterspell me.  so about 20 turns later I win.

												I'll admit - I had actually never heard of the board game before seeing this digital re-creation of it and I bought it simply because it was on sale and the thought of a fantasy setting/character building board game intrigued me.HOWEVER, it has been exceptionally fun to play. I cannot compare to the board game itself, but I have honestly spent more hours playing just against the AI than I thought I would, and despite what some of the other reviews say about it being full of bugs, I've only had it ""freeze"" during mid-turn on me once through the whole time I've played it. That being said, it is a literal re-creation of a board game, so if you're not into that, don't get it.For me though, it was fun enough that I actually sought out the real life board game and bought it so that my friends and I have another fun option during our game nights!

												  Talisman is the great board game from the 80's.  I grew up with it, I played it forever, and I missed it until now.  The digital edition is brilliant.  It has all that the board game had without all the mess and setup.    Tali DE has full online multiplayer capability, so you are able to play with up to 3 other players or NPCs.  You gain experience that unlocks special runes to enhance your starting abilities as well.  The DEVs are working constantly on improvements and additions.  All the original expansions and characters are being added piece by piece.    The game is part luck of the dice, and part RPG.  Your character has certain abilities depending on what class it is, and you can pick up tons of items, magic items, followers, and spells throughout the game.  You will do battle with enemies, ghosts, and other player characters as you journey to the crown of command... then use it to kill everyone else in game!  The game has also recently added some alternate endings, so you now have a choice of what wins the game.  Highly recommend if you like casual games with a hint of chess..  Fun but tacticle.			"

												This game is amazing. I had never played the boardgame and went blind into this one, together with 3 other people. We imidiately spent 9-10 hours into this game. The first game we played just vanila to get to know how the game works. It was quite fun already. After that we added the expansions and the game just got even better! The game can drag on quite a bit due to it's RNG... but it's the fun type of RNG, so that's totally okay!The goal of the game is simple. You must be the first one to reach the middle. In the vanila version, you have the crown of command there, which will do damage to each other character 50% of the times (based on a d6 roll). Characters normaly respawn/get rerolled when they die, but not when someone is in the middle. If one player is left on the board, they win.The game features quite a lot of characters to choose from. They all have their own set of stats, aswell as a set of special abilities of which some are shared, while others are unique. The most fun way to play, though, is that everyone starts with a random character and upon death they get a new, random character! During the game you will encounter many different kinds of events, monsters and items. The more expansions you have, the more random and sometimes deadly the game becomes.I would say, if you aren't sure about buying this one. First buy the vanila version only. Once you know if you'll like it, feel free to buy the rest of the DLC, they're all worth it. Though you do not need the Runestone Deck DLC, you can unlock these ingame as far as I know.Edit: The runestones basicly give you boosts to your character: you can start with more in a stat or you can more easily upgrade your character and so forth. They seem to be designed for those who want a game that'll end more swiftly. Personally I'd suggest to play without these, unless everyone has them and you want your game to end sooner.			"

The game is being ever improved and i think its unfair to have these lingering reviews about its early phase just laying around stinking up the place.

												I love the physical boardgame and the digital edition is just as nice. It's a good solution if people can't come to your place to play and people don't fight over the rulebook or tell you ""you can't do that"". It's not completely finished and there are bugs here and there but it's still alot of fun and worth the money. The bots will sometimes do less smart things and it's possible for more than 1 player to play the same character but that can easily be overlooked.			"

												Was very nearly put off by some of the comments, but I have to say, I've spent a really good few hours playing this with my son online.  we laughed as he was turned into a toad near the begining and then moments from wining teleported back to the start. The graphics are good (not brilliant but do the job), however the artwork on the cards is outstanding. The soundtrack is nothing out of the ordinary but good enough.  The sound effects are ie rolling die are nice and well done.  We have had no problems with crashes, we,ve been able to save and resume.  I recomend it! Its gentle fun, relaxing and highly entertaining with a friend/son!			"

												Not sure how anyone could be so bitter about this game. It's one of the best online board games you can play with your friends, you can save and play over multiple sittings and despite what a lot of vocal people say; there really aren't game breaking bugs.I never pictured myself even playing a board game, and I was hooked from the minute I picked it up. I'm used to playing highly competitive shooters and the like, so if I can enjoy it, almost anyone can. Also a big fan of DND/Battletech games so it's not as if it's so dumbed down you can't enjoy it, it's good fun to have with some friends without being overly complicated.			"

												  Talisman is the great board game from the 80's.  I grew up with it, I played it forever, and I missed it until now.  The digital edition is brilliant.  It has all that the board game had without all the mess and setup.    Tali DE has full online multiplayer capability, so you are able to play with up to 3 other players or NPCs.  You gain experience that unlocks special runes to enhance your starting abilities as well.  The DEVs are working constantly on improvements and additions.  All the original expansions and characters are being added piece by piece.    The game is part luck of the dice, and part RPG.  Your character has certain abilities depending on what class it is, and you can pick up tons of items, magic items, followers, and spells throughout the game.  You will do battle with enemies, ghosts, and other player characters as you journey to the crown of command... then use it to kill everyone else in game!  The game has also recently added some alternate endings, so you now have a choice of what wins the game.  Highly recommend if you like casual games with a hint of chess..  Fun but tacticle.			"

While so far only playing the offline mode against A.I. opponents I find them to be passible players. Examples I have seen of A.I.

												Ok. I have played Talisman the boardgame since 1st edition and all the further editions (3th was the worse). I have the new version and I can asure that the digital edition is exactly as the board game (some small changes but nothing that afect the overall game).the first impresion I have of the digial version of the game was spot on as what I wanted, as close as posible to the board game, no issues with rules or mistakes made by other players. I like the dinamic of the game, sure the graphics could be better or at least some efect when making combat or magic but that is like superfluos to the game (that is what imagination is used).the AI could be better or if you could select the level will be better (novice, normal, hard, insane). maybe for more options of players, but is ok with 4 as it can be a little bothersome or tedius to wait for other players to make their move.To any boardgame player I highly recomend it, with just one exeption, there is a lot of bugs and there is no rulebook, so sometimes you get a card to make you do someting (I had an orbe to let me change the action card if the first I get was not so good, I could not figure out how to activate it, so I did not use it). and the bigest complain I have right now is that the AI is freezed ""thinking"" and could not continue the game, and were are all in the crown area fighting for it... and I am  the strongest, better armed abd with more lives that the others AI !!!!! so is an almost win esenario but cant finish it, or began another game w/o losing this one. So I recomend to buy it, with discount, and I really hope the developers correct all the bugs soon.P.S. sorry the mispellings (english not my first lenguaje) and the long rant but belive me this game (and hero quest) were the first board games I played and I am really happy with the digital version, but disapointed that is not well defined and buged.

No really - if you hang up on TeamSpeak and play it the experience is very simillar as actual board game.Overall there isn't much I could say against this game.

												What a fantastic surprise! I've never heard of our played Talisman tabletop, but this turned out to be a BLAST for my wife and I. I got it with a bundle and gave it a try, and got sucked in quite terribly. For those of you who are as unfamiliar with Talisman as I was, It's essentially a ye old RPG in tabletop format. You pick your class, which offers different advantages per which class you choose, roll dice, move about the board, and do as the spaces require.  You collect gold, items, spells, armor, weapons and other items along the way. The ONE gripe I have with this game is that the dice mechanics are not completely random. They're favored for the AI and against you. They will often roll exactly what they need, and you'll roll exactly what you didn't want. This gets aggravating. I don't understand why the dice couldn't have been completely random? Otherwise, the game is a blast, especially with others. "

												I Find it fantastic to believe that I lost out on this game till now.Dont think twice if you enjoy fantasy boardgames!The base game is good to teach you the basics,but I reccomend you get an expansion as soon as possible.Multiplayer is glorious,with an average crowd of helpfull and mostly decent players.The glorious part is,and this is what makes Talisman a win,when you play multiplayer,your opponent(s) expansion(s) are available to you as well in the game.This gives you ample oppertunity to decide which expansions you want to get for offline mode.Every expansion is worth every cent,as it adds a multitute of depth to the already established game.HIGHLY recommended.

												Having never played the original board game, I actually just purchased this on a whim.  SOOOOOO glad I did.  My friends and I have a blast playing (I got a four pack) and I absolutely love the myriad of characters/classes.  Playing on random character choice is fun, though the AI has a thing for picking the Exorcist and excelling at it.  I once played a game where I eventually dispatched his Exorcist, forcing him to choose from 3 new classes, but he pratically gave up on his next choice (lasting a total of 3 turns) and the one after that!  His third set of classes included... yep, you guessed it: another Exorcist.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had snatched up all the Talismans, he might have won, garnering a large amount of strength, but after busting through and snatching a talisman from me, he lost his last two lives in the Vampire's lair.  Positioned strongly with a Marter with a massive amount of strength, I destroyed the Ice Queen and finally finished the game.The computer AI in this game is great, but it seems a little cheap sometimes.  I'd like the ability to tweek the AI (unless I'm missing a portion in the options where you can) and a more stable online multiplayer (I've only had it mess up once for me, but I hear others complaining) but this game was worth every penny, and then some.  I got the Season Pass; all the extra content is great.  I highly recommend this for board game entusiasts or anyone looking for a great game to play, online or against AI.  Don't miss out on getting the season pass, either.  There are a TON of extras included, and it's not even halfway finished with it's ""season"" (you get every DLC that comes past, present, and future).  With the Highlands coming out (a new region, making a total of two additional regions (dungeon and highlands) on top of the basic board, you won't want to miss out on the extra adventure and danger!  Also, any DLC the host presents in their game, you'll be able to access (this includes characters and extra regions/cards) in their game.  If you plan on hosting games with your friends, DLC is a must have!  Trust me, the game is worth your money, and it's gotten me interested in getting the physical version for pure collection reasons!EDITS: Grammer (I'm sure there's still some mistakes) and reviews on DLC info.

												Not sure how anyone could be so bitter about this game. It's one of the best online board games you can play with your friends, you can save and play over multiple sittings and despite what a lot of vocal people say; there really aren't game breaking bugs.I never pictured myself even playing a board game, and I was hooked from the minute I picked it up. I'm used to playing highly competitive shooters and the like, so if I can enjoy it, almost anyone can. Also a big fan of DND/Battletech games so it's not as if it's so dumbed down you can't enjoy it, it's good fun to have with some friends without being overly complicated.			"

												  Talisman is the great board game from the 80's.  I grew up with it, I played it forever, and I missed it until now.  The digital edition is brilliant.  It has all that the board game had without all the mess and setup.    Tali DE has full online multiplayer capability, so you are able to play with up to 3 other players or NPCs.  You gain experience that unlocks special runes to enhance your starting abilities as well.  The DEVs are working constantly on improvements and additions.  All the original expansions and characters are being added piece by piece.    The game is part luck of the dice, and part RPG.  Your character has certain abilities depending on what class it is, and you can pick up tons of items, magic items, followers, and spells throughout the game.  You will do battle with enemies, ghosts, and other player characters as you journey to the crown of command... then use it to kill everyone else in game!  The game has also recently added some alternate endings, so you now have a choice of what wins the game.  Highly recommend if you like casual games with a hint of chess..  Fun but tacticle.			"

												Talisman is a classic fantasy-themed board game that's been around since before most people had computers.  It has something of a cult-like status among fans but tends to polarise opinion in board game circles, with the main critisism being that it's overly dependent on luck at the expense of strategy.  I like to refer to it as fantasy Monopoly, where instead of property you go around collecting objects and followers (and battle enemy monsters and players) until you're powerful enough to win the game.Despite its detractors, Talisman maintains a passionate, loyal and extremely devoted following.  Like Monopoly, its appeal lies in its simple, light-hearted and accessible nature.  It isn't too complicated, difficult or overly strategic.  That's not to say there aren't strategic elements however and new players wiil struggle when playing against seasoned pros.  But it's still a game you can wistfullly play while the hours pass by (and I do mean hours) without having to think too hard.Talisman benefits enormously from the digital transition, which has been implemented quite well.  The main critisism is that AI players are fairly weak and never pose much of a threat.  It used to be that the AI would often make incredibly stupid decisions, however this has improved somewhat.  If you prefer a challenge, there's a robust online community of players who provide far greater competition.  I was pleasently surprised by the friendliness in the Talisman community.It should be noted that the base game is a little bare and Talisman benefits when played with some, if not all the currently available expansions.  The season pass is a little pricey, but well worth it if you can get it on sale.  Given the number of characters and expansions I can't recommend buying them separetely, you really have to go all in and get the season pass if you want the extra content.In summary, if you appreciate light-hearted and fun games that anyone can pick up, or enjoy board games with great artwork on the board and cards then I can highly recommend Talisman.  I have over 200 hours logged so far as evidence that it's a fun and addictive distraction and great to take your mind off things.			"

												10 plus stars on a scale of 1 - 10 ---- And I dont post reviews for many games just if they are a ripoff are a super hit.This game and Rogue Legacy are my two fav games now on steam and I have right at 100.This game is simply awesome - I wish more classic board games would come to Steam- Like D@D Board Games.Keeps you thinking, massive rules which I like, I wanna think when I play and Tailsman has that strategy game aspect perfected, also easy to find multiplayer so far. But keep in mind Tailsman is a long game so a multi[player game could take 2 hours but rules can be adjusted to speed game up -- I am having plenty of fun just playing AI and gaining experience to get runestones. Also AI games can be saved and started right back up if you don't wanna play through all at once.Get the season pass I would of in retrospect gives you access to all DLC and with new characters  and expansions and more planned for soon release I would of saved more. Also unlike a lot of Steam games I encounter the creators of this game actually update and expand.I hate new games you play once and developers take theri money and run with no concern for customers----Tailsman Does not do this--- my guess is because the physical board game Tailsman has a huge following like Axis and Allies and that they truly care.The only downside is I think the graphics could be a little crisper or HD like  I guess but I understand need to stay true to game.10 out of 10 for me. Thanks Talisman Digital Team and please keep up updates and expansions and you will get my thx and dollars.			"

												I love boardgames. I really do. I've never played Talisman, though. And this might be one of the reasons I absolutely hated playing this game.  Being a rulesmonger, I usually read all rules before playing a game. Twice. Maybe even 3 times. And this might very well be the 2nd reason I hated playing this game.The game does an extremely poor job of telling you the rules and give you any sort of insight as to what might happen on the different tiles on the board. I was left with playing blind and ended up just walking away, since the computer controlled characters decided they all wanted to bash on me, so I kept loosing turn after turn, effectively turning the ""game"" into a slideshow.I trust the game will work out to be a lot more fun if you already know what it's all about, but I have no way to tell. My recommendation is therefor this: If you don't know the game, stay away from it. I just doesn't work as a stand-alone product.			"

												It's astonishing how boring and badly designed Talisman is. I've played the tabletop version of Talisman before and always thought it was an awful game. I love board games, have dozens of them, but Talisman... It takes the features of games like Monopoly and other trail games and try to entice you with a mildly interesting (though generic) fantasy setting, but the truth is it remains as boring, flawed and outdated as Monopoly itself. The game may drag for hours and hours without an ending in sight and everything is about randomness. There's no skill involved playing in Talisman, all you can do push your luck in a general direction and hope for the best. I understand why a game like this would be popular 20 or 30 years ago, but today we have plenty of better board (and digital) games to play. Maybe *huge* fans of Mario Party would enjoy playing digital Talisman, but I just can't recommend it to anyone else. You want to play ""digital board games"" on Steam? Grab ""Small World 2"", ""Ticket to Ride"" or anything else, but stay away from Talisman.			"

												Fans of the boardgame cannot go wrong here! While there are a few places where the game interface can improve, the ""feel"" of the game is true to the original (4th edition). I look forward to continued improvement as the game continues to evolve.WARNING: This is probably not a great game for people who are not familiar with the board game. It DOES NOT meet the typical requirements that modern computer / console gamers look for in a game. But that is not what the game is trying to do. It maintains a trueness to the board game... and it feels like a computerized version of the boardgame. It does not have animations for combat... or cool 3D rendering of graphics. If that is the kind of thing you are looking for... keep on looking. If you are looking for a good boardgame experience... stop on by!			"

Even in encounters when there are plenty of players. It feels like their RNG is artificially weighted to just RUIN the human players. In several games, I've felt the overwhelming desire to ragequit simply because the game forces me into losing STUPID, nearly impossible to lose fights, even after spending points of Fate to reroll once. For the amount they're asking, not really worth it. I got it a Humble Bundle for like...15 cents. But yeah, not really that great of a board game title. Get Ticket to Ride instead.			"

												Talisman's first edition, with many of its expansions, ate up a lot of my time as a regular board game. This digital edition includes both classic rules and new edition rules, plus many more expansions are coming out. They're ironing out details of the main game now, the Reaper expansion is out, and many characters are available to play. This game can be played single player against one or several computer opponents, or it can be played online. I haven't tried the online play because I'm too chicken and get interrupted a lot, but it looks like a lot of time and effort is being put in by the developers to polish it up. The game itself is pretty, simple to control, and all the fun I remember, except for smack talk when dealing with AI opponents.			"

												I'm so confused on how this game has ""Mostly Positive"". This game doesn't even work MOST the time. I""ve tried to play this game with friends close to 10 times. In those 10 games maybe 2 of them made it to conclusion without kicking someone out. I am not exaggerating. And yes now they have made it to where you can rejoin, but apparently that only works sometimes. I want to love this game. I love the board game and it has done it justice in gameplay, but how are people putting 1000+ hours into a game they can't keep all their friends in for a full round? If the game gets fixed we would love to play it, but I'm tired of investing hours into a single game and then not even being able to finish.			"

												Talisman is originally a board game developed by Games Workshop.  They are a prominent maker of board game, card, and miniature style games.  The first edition of this title was released in 1983.  Talisman Digital Edition is actually based on the revised fourth edition rules which were released Dec. 17th, 2008.  This revised edition was released with 9 core expansion packs for the board game.  The maker of this game, Nomad Games, does plan on converting all of those expansion packs to the PC version of the game.30 Second Review+ 14 Unique playable models to choose from.  They took great care in the level of detail Nomad Games brought to each model, which is very important considering this is a Games Workshop product.+ Easy to understand interface.+ Excellent hints and tutorial pop ups.- An extreme amount of DLC is planned.  May be too much for some people.- Easy AI.Click this link to read more!http://everydaygamers.com/2014/03/10/review-talisman-digital-edition/#more-29260 "

												Nice game. The only thing that freaks me out its when you get to the castle and can only press ""cast command spell"" and wait for an hour when all other players will die. I played one game in which one troll was so tenacious, at some point i was even afraid that i wouldn't be able to kill him and he would get to the castle and would beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of me while i will just be pressing ""command spell"" :DAlso you can play for a Courtesan or Thief :D Feel how great it is to be a badass.8.5/10			"

												I'm on the fence about recommending this, I like it, I think it's fun, but 9 times out of 13 I have no idea what the AI players are doing (they'll keep casting spells on the crappy merchant with no items despite two players being incredibly strong or they'll find a good follower and just leave it for some reason), and probably about half my online games had random desyncs or disconnects (likely a player's fault, but still, it's not like drop-in drop-out).It's a board game where you try to get stats and items to be the best and win the game.I like it.

												A great game with great bugs. We play with friends through Steam, hit the break, then we try to continue after two days, and we either can't connect or have other issues, like after joining game, players can't control their heroes or get disconnected.And I waited patiently for like 5 months, thinking, ""hey, a lot of people bought this game to play online with friends, I am sure someone will fix this"". 5 months passed, the issue persists, devs just don't care. I don't care anymore, I only whish I had not bought DLCs and filled their pockets, as I got nothing in return. If someone was manufacturing cars that don't run properly, they'd be sued and had to recompensate. Looks like we, gamers are second-grade customers. That's sad.EDIT: December 2015, still random crashes, bugs, but they launch another add-on. Whitout fixingactual game. Money-grabbers.			"

												This is a digital version of Talisman. If you've played the board game, you more or less know what to expect.  It even supports 4 local players and some common house rules.Advantages of the digital version:-Cheaper: even without a Steam sale, you can buy the Gold Pack which is basically the same as buying the board game and EVERY expansion, for closer to the price of the board game and a single expansion.-Portability: It's easier to carry around a laptop than several boxes.-Easy to setup and cleanup-Solo play: if you can't get a game night going, you can play with up to three AI players.-Online play: Play with your friends online.  Or play with strangers.  Whatever floats your boat.-New characters that I don't recall being in the board gameDisadvantages of the Digital Edition-New characters are DLC-4 player only (my gaming group is 5)-Sometimes it's harder to see what's on the board or your inventory when it's not laid out in front of you.On the whole, if you're  a fan of the board game, I highly recommend the Digital Edition.

												Awesome! A faithful reproduction of a classic board game. The community is kind of small though, that would be the onlydownside, it can be hard to find a table. The AI is good enough to play a good match. Fate is unfortunatly not always on your side. But with a group of friends this is one of the best board games ever!If you don't own this digital or the IRL board game get it for your next game night and try and keep from buying all the expansions.

												Adventure board game relying strongly on luck. Clunky UI makes playing a harsh experience. Others mentioned that this was a mobile port and it shows. Settings are limited and it will reset some of the options every time you restart the game. Some features, like speeding up or skipping animations are not available, which tends to drag games even longer than required.Has some technical issues. With nearly 10 hours gametime, there has been couple crashes. Also, one friend kept having connection issues for unknown reason. Luckily, the session can be restored but it still requires extra time. Cashing on too many DLCs and extra junk that could have been easily bundled in bigger packages. Luckily, only the server has to buy them so that others can play with additional content. Some of the characters are much stronger than others which brings balancing issues.Core game mechanic relies too heavily on dice, especially in the early game. As most of the actions are ruled by the dice, one can find hero facing only dragons, giants and ogres with their two point strength weakling. This results in frustration as the player cannot really do anything except pray for better luck. Situation becomes ever worse with the DLCs as they bring even more monsters which makes encounters even more random. Core game could use separate decks for outer and middle regions. This way outer region could give more certain, but slow, early progress and middle region faster but more risky way.Usually some of the players get lucky in the early game and snowball out of control. When hero gets enough resources, they start to win battles automatically which makes them even stronger. Single game can easily last two hours as the early winning players makes certain that they are unbeatable until finishing the game.Summary: technically shoddy and somewhat lacking playing experience. Can be fun with friends. Recommended only for Talisman fanatics. Others should avoid or enjoy the life as a toad.			"

												I've been playing the table top version of this game for about 24 years and it has always been one of my favorites.  The Digital Edition is an exceptional recreation of the board game.  Great graphics and sound.  The board and art on the cards is excellent.  The miniatures are painted beautifully.  The interface is nice and very easy to work with.  There is nothing I don't love about this game and now with multiplayer, you can play with those friends that no longer live close enough to start up a game with.  One reason I have always liked this game is that it is very approachable.  No complicated rules or in depth manuals etc.  Anyone can play this for the first time and enjoy every minute of it with little to no learning curve.  REAPER EXPANSION:  20+ years ago they had different expansions than today and I was originally disappointed that they were gone and new ones had been made.  My disappointment was for nothing.  The Reaper Expansion is an excellent addition to the original game that you can toggle on and off as you like.  It adds new characters, events, spells, etc. to the game not to mention the Grim Reaper that can make or break your day if you encounter him.  I played the expansion for the first time today and I didn't think it possible to make Talisman better but this expansion most definitely does.  Table top gamers are notoriously picky about their beloved games and don't want them butchered or poorly recreated.  I have been hopeful that this would be a faithful recreation of the board game and Nomad Games has not let me down.  Out of the massive amount of money I have spent on Steam, this stands out as one of my favorite and most fun games in my library.  Young or old, new to Talisman or an old pro I can not recommend this game high enough.  To me, this is an absolute must have for anyone's Steam library.Game Play: 10/10Sound: 9/10Mechanics and Interface: 8/10Art and Graphics: 10/10Overall Experience: 10/10			"

												Talisman.  A staple board game of most RPG players.  This digital adaption is fun to play and seems to be as faithful to the board game as you can be.  However, my group of friends and I have never been able to complete a game.  30-60 minutes in some bug rears its head and forces us to exit.  Sometimes, you cannot roll the dice, end the turn, or activate an ability/card.  Other times, someone just falls out of the game and the AI pickes up the spot.  If the devs could solve this problem, I see a great game becoming better.			"

												The digital edition is pretty buggy and requires some serious patching. I recently played a game with my partner against 2 bots (a Minstrel & Druid) and we clearly dispatched one of the bots (Read: 0 life) . It was very disturbing to see the ""undead"" Minstrel ""respawn"" with full life on it's next turn and continue to roam the board to wreak havoc. We also noticed that the bots have an uncanny preference of keeping talismans in their stash (Read: 3 numbers) and ignoring the other better gears like the Solomon's crown, Belt of Strength, etc upon winning a player encounter. Please fix the AI of the bots to make this a better game.			"

												I bought this game as a fan of both warhammer and GW products.Sadly, it really sucks. I know its a faithful recreation of a timeless board game, and it hits that spot on. As a huge board gamer myself though... the game is really imbalanced, the systems are poorly explained and convoluted, and its kind of stupid to have to get to the middle of the board which then kills everyone else (only on a roll of 4+) which turns the game SUPER boring at the end... I think I sat there for about 30 minutes hoping to roll a 4+ and kill everyone, while all the AI's kept healing and leveling up. I cannot recommend this game at all to anyone who values their time or avid board game enthusiasts. The game is unfair, boring, and a huge waste of time. No offense to the company who made this, they did a great job of recreating the board game how its played! But to me rolling dice and hoping I win does not make a game fun.Multiple users have commented on my review so I'll add a caveat: supposedly some of the xpacs fix the misgivings of the base game. But to me, I shouldn't have to buy xpacs to fix a game being unfun. If you play this, I would recommend making your mind up about it within the first 2 hours!			"

In single player, you have to wait really a lot for the AI while it checks if wants to cast a spell.  Soo many wasted seconds of my life...So far I'm still playing my first game, but it seems to be locked since 45 minutes: I'm standing in the center, casting the command spell every turn (reduces life for the opponents if I roll 4-5-6), while the only AI player left is hanging around and healing himself time to time by visiting the corresponding tiles. I think like 5-6 times I was already one life away from winning, but I'm tending exit and forget about this unpolished beauty.The positive side: nice idea, good graphics, fine music.

Whilst playing online multiplayer, the destruction card causes the game to become unresponsive. PLEASE FIX*EDIT*Now during my second day of messing around on the game there seems to be an issue with stealing whilst on the crown of command. The game seemed to force me to steal everything from the enemy (which shouldn't be possible) and then forced me to drop everything except 2 items (which I shoudn't have to do) causing me to lose the game when in a commanding position just 2 minutes ago.

												It does replicate the boardgame, it does have AI - but it's very prone to crashes and lockups. I have only tried playing it twice, first one crashed out before a turn had passed, second one locked up during a battle close to the endgame. Feels like it's not really worth the time to try again.			"

												Learning to play is easy, but you quickly want to master it.  The AI does not pull any punches as it ups the challenges just enough, that you really feel like you are playing against people (people who know you well enough to really fight you in board games to win).			"

												Love this board game.  Very reasonably priced DLC to get even more out of the game, with expansions that add multiple endings and 1000's of new cards.  Fun single screen multiplayer if that is your thing.  If you like RPG board games, give this one a chance.  You will not regret it.			"

												Talisman is a faithful digital re-creation of the board game I played and loved as a teen. However, as with most board game conversions, it really loses somthing when playing on a computer. It's just not much fun without a crowd of friends huddled around the table.Recommended for fans of the original who want to relive the past, but not for new players. If you've never played Talisman, I recommend the board game, but not the computer version.			"

												This is a very good way to test Talisman out and see if you like it before purchasing it as a board game. The physical game is more expensive, especially if you end up buying all the other characters and expansions, so I would definitely suggest buying everything on steam and testing it all out to see what you like and don't like. It is also makes the rules very clear opposed to the physical copy, which makes you guess at some rules because of wording. All in all, I would suggest getting this game if you are at all interested in buying the physcal version. You may even like this version more, as you can always join tables online if you want to play but your friends are unavailable. It is sometimes buggy and won't load characters the first time you start it up and friends join, but that problem goes away the second time you start the game. I own both the physcial and PC version of this game, and though I prefer the physcial board game, I do enjoy this thoroughly.			"

												Short review: Yeah... No. Don't get this.Long review: I tried playing it on a free weekend with friends, and it became so ♥♥♥♥ing tedious we wanted to kill ourselves. The game drags on and on and on with no foreseen end to it, and the fact that almost everything is a huge gamble that can ruin your day with just a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rolls does not help it. The fact that it is so random ruins the potential for strategy, and it dragging so long makes the randomness frustrating. Not to mention, the UI is very unpolished and the expansions are very expensive.Buy it during a very high sale, and only if you can cope with very long games in which your worst enemy won't be the other players, but the Random Number God.

												After putting +100 hours in this game, i decided to write my first review, to hopefully raise awareness to this amazing tabletop. Talisman is great for fantasy lovers and offers lots of diferent heros with different abilities to play as, which is one of my favourite features in a game. All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential. Although there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times. Another thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise! Expansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!Pros: -Lots of fun with friends -Wide variety of heros -Playable on a toaster -Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn) -Unpredictable -Amazing when you have access to expansions -You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!Cons: -Very luck driven -Games are super long -Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions -AI can be really dumb			"

												This game is the perfect example of emergent gameplay done right. In one game, that forest might be the home of a friendly fairy that grants wishes to the forces of light, while in another, it might be the lair of a terrifying dragon. Using multiple decks of cards with different effects and uses, you can craft the story of an evil leprachaun, who loses all his money and ends up in jail after a night of drunken revelry, or the tale of a lone bounty hunter with an enchanted flail, on the trail of a powerful sorcereress who stole his magic shield and destroyed the academy that trained his superhuman fighting skills, finally clashing at the highest peaks of the world. In another of my games, my Bard character managed to ensnare a fire breathing dragon with his music. In another, my alchemist discovered a bag that always had an extra gold piece inside whenever you ran out of money, with his abilities, I managed to turn this unlimited supply of gold into unlimited magical power. If you immerse yourself into the experience and roleplay it, stories build themselves right in front of your eyes. Every game is different, and with every expansion adding new locations, decks, characters and everything else, It can only get better.The AI isn't too bad either, I've seen characters doing crazy stuff like casting the offensive wind blast spell on themselves to fling across the map so that they're closer to where they need to be.If I could change one thing, it'd be the introduction of a way to turn off the victory conditions of the game, sometimes you want these random storied worlds of yours to live on longer.

												After having played the physical board game with friends, this version is swell for getting my Talisman fix. Originally playing with AI characters was kind of a nightmare, but the updates have improved their ""decision"" making skills, gameplay is still best with friends though. If you're not already a fan of table tops then this could become boring for anyone, since it takes a while for someone to win. However, having the expansions, thanks to a season pass, makes it most enjoyable. When I had the basic version it was limiting and I lost interest, fortunately sales come around often providing a great time to grab it. The pass is a good deal; the artwork and variety of characters definitely improve with each new package. I also like the idea of being able to play anytime, anywhere without worrying about finding space and set up.			"

												A good port of the Games Workshop classic, Talisman: Digital Edition is an adapted board game that is pretty simple and fun to play. It is definately best to play with friends, preferably with a total of 3 or more players, as this makes for far more interesting dynamics than the fairly linear two-player game. Although it may not be the most tactically deep board game of all time, this does not detract from the experience; it merely makes it accessible. There are also some definite strategies involved. Whilst I don't play this a lot, it is refreshing and very fun to play once in while with some friends, and marvellously captures the feel of a questing adventurer striving to out-competent his/her rivals.

												Talisman is a game of adventure, excitement, and challenge; a game where you the player are the ones who build the cross the AI nails you to. Dying from a gut seeping wound might be more enjoyable. If you reach the crown before the AI, you better expect to choke hard and roll absolutely abysmal. If you think the AI is doing something stupid? It's because the AI has decided to give you this illusion before three turns later it's suddenly twice as strong wielding magic faster than a video game player can blame a computer for his failings. This game is not your friend. This game hates you. This game lives off of your suffering. Any achievement is to lull you into a false sense of security. All hail your new dark gods, the AI.10/10 Would forsake my first born child to actually roll what I need when I need it.P.S. SHODAN is more merciful than this game.			"

												Talisman is a game of adventure, excitement, and challenge; a game where you the player are the ones who build the cross the AI nails you to. Dying from a gut seeping wound might be more enjoyable. If you reach the crown before the AI, you better expect to choke hard and roll absolutely abysmal. If you think the AI is doing something stupid? It's because the AI has decided to give you this illusion before three turns later it's suddenly twice as strong wielding magic faster than a video game player can blame a computer for his failings. This game is not your friend. This game hates you. This game lives off of your suffering. Any achievement is to lull you into a false sense of security. All hail your new dark gods, the AI.10/10 Would forsake my first born child to actually roll what I need when I need it.P.S. SHODAN is more merciful than this game.			"

												The online multiplayer is poorly implemented and this issue is not being adequately addressed by the developers. After the Dungeon DLC was added, I have routinely experienced turn 1 disconnects. Furthermore, the AI is terrible and is actually unable to complete the game.An interesting idea, but Games Workshop products rarely fail to disappoint and this title is no exception.			"

The servers sometimes don't show up and buttons like private game and resume game don't work. When they do work and you're ingame, sometimes you won't be able to end your turn or do an action which renders the entire match unplayable.When it does work, then yes its fun.

												I haven't played the original Talisman. This game takes hours to complete. The online games take even longer. Those three  reasons are what stopped me from trying this out earlier but I did try it out and I was NOT disappointed. Despite the length, most people who you play with online are super friendly and super fun to play with, which basically ends up making the length an advantage (more time = more fun). And the game itself is amazing! It's like playing a full scale MMORPG (an RPG if you don't like online play xD)! It's a game, a board game, that truly does require a huge amount of strategy. It's not just ""roll you dice, move on, get to the end first"", it's about thinking of where to go, what to do, how to get what you want and so on. And it's not very straightforward either, it's quite complex and utterly wonderful in all aspects. To sweeten the pot, it even has several modes and expansions to make sure you never get bored of playing! A 5/5 game if I ever played one.EDIT: I must admit that after a while, the game does get quite boring and repetitive. If you can find a group of players and form a group (relatively speaking) to play, then sure, it'll give you hours of enjoyment without fail! Besides, considering how long a game takes, you'll probably end up playing it once or twice a week, in which case it'll provide you with years of fun! One thing I have noticed, however, is that the community has died down quite a bit. Ever since the ""free weekend"" ended, the number of games in the lobby is three in the maximum and that's in the European server (which, ironically, is the busiest). Once again, if you've got a group of friends to play with every once in a while, I'd recommend this game without a single moment of hesistation!			"

												Do not pay full purchase for this game.I havn't played Talisman before, so take that in mind.The interface is slow and clumsy. It takes 3 seconds for anything you click to work. Looking at an inventory can be a challenge in itself.You can't look at the spaces outside of your turns, and when you do, it takes ages again. You can't just scroll over it, you have to right-click it, wait, right-click it again, wait and then right-click a card you might want to check on it.The timing of spell cards and everything is thrown out the window, because the clicking responses are very, very slow.And that isn't getting to the bugs.Out for the 4 games I have played so far, each single one has been wrecked because of the terrible interface and bugs.Game one, I choose an apprentice wizard. Get to one life, and look at one of my spells waiting for my turn.Turn comes up, the spell casts itself. And I die to a miscast.Game two, I get a courtesan. I go to flirt with an orc, and take his useful follower, giving me a massive lead. Instead, after looking at his inventory, as I back out, it decided to take me backing out of his inventory as a challenge to combat. Instead of taking something, I then enter physical combat, whith my 2 against his 5 bonus. I lose. He then takes my magical bag of holding, a bag that says on the card 'This card can not be taken in combat', which contained every single bit of my loot.I'm just happy I got this with Humble Bundle, but I won't get my 5 hours back.That said, I now want to play the physical board game. Since that is more social, faster (yes, this game is faster to play physically) and has no bugs.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It is definitely best played with a group of friends which you can converse with. To be entirely honest, it is not that great if you play against the AI. The AI has this ability to screw themselves in ways that are entirely possible to avoid with a little bit of thought. For instance, the AI will use an axe to get across the river only to cross back to the outer area the next turn.I would highly recommend this to people which enjoy tabletop games which contain both an element of strategy and an element of luck. There is a lot in this game which requires luck, but once you have played a few games, you can get a feel of what the better spaces and strategies are. Playing with random characters also forces you to get used to new ways of playing the game, making each game much different from the last.Keep in mind, a single string of bad luck can pretty much end your run in the game or force you to play catch up for the remainder of the game if everyone else is doing well.

												I like board games. Talisman is a decent board game. And while this game models the board game fairly well, there is one critical issue and several other annoyances.The critical issue is that the dice roll is not randomised. To demonstrate, perform a turn to see how the die rolls, exit, reload, and then re-do your turn to see the dice roll the exact same way. I've performed different actions and even seen the AI players get the dice rolls I would have got. It's ridiculous. The whole point of rolling a dice is to be random. Not random = not a dice roll.The annoyances are as previously alerted to in prior reviews, mostly to do with poor AI, but I could have lived with that had the dice rolls actually been pseudo-random, you know, ceiling(math.rand()*6) or something.

												Talisman the board game in digital version.Theres no point reviewing the talisman itself,its a dice board game.you toss the die,move and stuff happens.However reviewing the digital content of this board game.Pros:-You dont need friends to play and you dont need to play all the characters alone if you wanna play-AI seems allright-Easy to change rules-If you like talisman the board game you like thisCons-Bugs bugs and bugs. i played more than hour in 4 player game online,so far we were all at outer and one player casted spell. it crashed the game completely. there was noway going back anymore. that shouldnt happen,if that happens you simply dont release the game. there is no price on good game and that lost hour. after you get over that the game was lost you simply think,should i start new game what if it crashes again after hours of playing? these things should not happen in game like this,never. And this isnt first and last game breaking bug sometimes game forces you to do something because it jams every other option.-Sometimes gameplay is super slow,like when you cast spells it takes far too longIf they fix the bugs ill give this port 9/10 (9 cause it could look more pretty) and recommend it but until then 4/10 cause of the bugs in this game.

												I got a copy of the boardgame back in the 80s and I loved it.  Now this is a true representation of the game complete with identical adventure cards (etc) - although Fate's a new one on me.  I also picked up the Dungeon expansion to make my nostalgia complete.  So why the bad review?  It's clunky mess with the interface not being all that intuitive.  Forever clicking the mouse button to speed up some animation only to pause the game.  It just doesn't gel which is a real shame. If you're a fan of the boardgame and can sit through a clunky UI then it's a non-brainer; if you've never played the boardgame don't go near this unless you know you're going to be online with friends.

												I'm actually old enough to own the original board game, which, I absolutely love! I spent many, many hours as a kid beating... I mean, ""questing"" with my friends. We'd all be sitting on the carpet in the living room, game pieces scattered thither, huddled around the game board as if we were spying into one our dads' Playboy magazines trying not to get caught. Tensions ran high as we traversed the outer ring of the board (or Outer Earth as we called it) in search of glorious adventure and immense wealth. Eventually, one friend would amusingly decide to try to kill off another; starting a great fued betwixt families, and a furious battle would ensue. With every roll of the dice, the once trusting and playful comrades, would try to land on each others spaces to chip off yet another foe's life. All in the hopes of being the last warrior standing... until of coarse... the final blow was struck... the fallen combatant, silent in his shame, with head hung low, would sit and let the anger of defeat fester like a boil. As the heckling and laughter of his friends grew louder, ringing in his ears, becoming too much to bear, the conquered warrior would growl in rage! Leaping up from the game and running away like the wind. Totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥! He'd jump upon his iron steed, and peddle off into the night, cursing us. Claiming he would never play with us... ever... again.But... we knew he'd be back. Now that I'm a grown-up (or at least supposed to be), this digital version still lets me enjoy beating... I mean ""questing"" with my friends, even though we're scattered across the globe. It's awesome. And. it's a perfect game for hanging out with the guys online, having a few beers, and sharing a few laughs.It's a great port of the board game. It's challenging, and the DLC is great. Totally worth the money!			"

												Well I wasn't expecting something awesome, but after half hour my interest changed into bitterness. A lots of classes is what I really liked about this game. A different options of game style can keep you even in most boring games for a long period of time. But after I discovered how the dice works the fate of this game was forever sealed for me. You will mostly get 1 to 3 on normal rolls and when you roll 1 next roll will be 4. When you roll 2 next roll wil be 5 and same with 3 and 6. The problem is that mostly your opponent gets those good rolls and until you use fate you are screwed. Besides of the evil dice you get a lot of bugs like getting stuck after spell failure because you press some key on the keyboard and there is nothing you can do except for quiting the game. Your raft won't work, your items and so on ... and I experienced this in about 2 hours ... so you can make a picture.			"

												First off, let me say that the actual gameplay is pretty fun, especially when playing with friends online. The game can get very cut-throat and you will enjoy lots of laughs at the expese of other player's misfortune. The expansions make the game even more enjoyable and there are different game rules available that can make the game more exciting. If I was recommending this on the gameplay alone, I would definitely give it a great review.That being said, this game is TERRIBLE when it comes to programming. It is full of game-stopping glitches that should have been weeded out during development. Nothing is more frustrating than to be two hours into a highly competitive and exciting game, only to have it RUINED by a glitch that will not allow the game to contine. The matchmaking is shotty at best, and the lack of a save feature to save and resume multiple games outside of the single automatic game save really gets on your nerves. This game is not worth buying unless GW fixes the bugs that are killing this game.			"

Requires more than 1 play through for you to really appreciate the game, and while the game is heavily luck dependant, there is strategy in managing your resources and coming up with plans to try and succeed from almost all points of the game.  You could be 2 turns from being the winner and then fnd yourself turned toad if youve wasted all your resources getting to where you are.  Two good bonuses to the already good game are that1) The bots are very well made and provide an excellent alternative for when you dont have friends to play with or cant find an open game online2) With the exception of the specific character DLC, as long as the host of a game owns a content DLC, players without the DLC can still join and play with the content (they still wont be able to use the DLC characters however)			"

												My hours in the digital version are small, but don't let that waver your opinion of my opinion of this unforgiving mistress of a game.I went out and bought the physical edition, and have accumulated several expansions because of how much I absolutely adore the abuse this game deals out (aka: I've dropped over $200 on this series alone).The gamestyle is a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of Dungeons&Dragons, and Munchkin.  You each have your own character with their own special attributes and abilities... and often try to screw each other over as much as possible to try and reach the Crown of Command.Expansion packs will add different endings to the game.

												Incredibly fun and infuriating at the same time.  Requires more than 1 play through for you to really appreciate the game, and while the game is heavily luck dependant, there is strategy in managing your resources and coming up with plans to try and succeed from almost all points of the game.  You could be 2 turns from being the winner and then fnd yourself turned toad if youve wasted all your resources getting to where you are.  Two good bonuses to the already good game are that1) The bots are very well made and provide an excellent alternative for when you dont have friends to play with or cant find an open game online2) With the exception of the specific character DLC, as long as the host of a game owns a content DLC, players without the DLC can still join and play with the content (they still wont be able to use the DLC characters however)			"

												My hours in the digital version are small, but don't let that waver your opinion of my opinion of this unforgiving mistress of a game.I went out and bought the physical edition, and have accumulated several expansions because of how much I absolutely adore the abuse this game deals out (aka: I've dropped over $200 on this series alone).The gamestyle is a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of Dungeons&Dragons, and Munchkin.  You each have your own character with their own special attributes and abilities... and often try to screw each other over as much as possible to try and reach the Crown of Command.Expansion packs will add different endings to the game.

												A great board game without the hassle! Who has the time or wants to spend time setting up, cleaning up, and fighting over the rules of a traditional board game? Talisman does all that for you. No lost pieces, no penny markers, and no fuss! Great roleplaying elements and charachter diversity will no doubt lead to endless replayability, especially with the huge amount of updates promised. I only wish it could be played more players, but i have not read up at all, such may be planned. Definately great family fun for years to come!			"

												DO NOT BUY.I just lost my first game of this because the spell Healing didn't have any effect on me when it should've right at the end of the game. I also noticed other spells not actually having their effect trigger occasionally when they should. The spell Random was particularly bad for this, with AI opponents it was used on not even rolling for the effect sometimes (seems to be a problem particularly when someone is on the Crown of Command).The interface in this game needs work (sometimes you don't know what spell you're currently casting, or what type of card it wants you to select from where).It's generally pretty fun, but I simply can't play it while it doesn't abide by its own rules.

												Upon first impression, I -like- Talisman.  It feels unique and like a 1980s fantasy story/movie as a Roguelike board game.  My Steam recommendation comes with a big HOWEVER:  Ahem.  However, there are two main sets of deterrents from this digitized Talisman game, mechanical and technical.Note that this was my first time EVER playing Talisman in any form!Mechanics-wise, the digital version seems to be an accurate port of the tabletop game. This means, for good and for ill, whatever the tabletop game is, the digital game is too. I enjoyed the ability for each person to have a personal adventure on the same game board while competing for resources and, ultimately, victory. I liked how it was, effectively, a board game version of Dokapon Kingdom (Wii), similar to the card game Munchkin for its randomness and occasional hilarity, and that it was a board game Rogue-lite. Also, props for having a cadre of possible followers, and spells that were rare and powerful!What did I dislike about the mechanics? There is simply TOO MUCH ROLLING! Want to move somewhere? You must roll and get the exact number you need to proceed! Rolling at locations (board spaces), such as to determine whether at a bar you gain or lose money while gambling, or if you start a bar fight, is more sensical and generally should be kept. Rolling was much less of an issue early game and for me as a newbie since I didn't know what I was doing and was not a stickler on trying to win my first game - at least at this phase. I understood ""Be an Assassin, go around killing stuff, level up, and try to win,"" and I wound up close to winning.A simple fix would be to allow movement of any number of spaces no more than the rolled number. Did you roll a 3? You can move 1, 2, or 3 spaces instead of just 3.A second major issue is the need to farm.  Yes, you need to farm in a tabletop game originally released in the 1980s - before the release of video games like Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior that made farming in RPGs popular.  Why?  Because you simply -need- higher stats, more money, and more treasure to survive random encounters and other players in this game!  As a warning to Talisman newbies:  You may reach the center area of the board (and achieving this feels quite random), but you NEED a Talisman to complete the game (found at the top left of the inner rectangle) AND enough Strength or Craft to get through the Mines or Crypt respectively.  This means boosting these stats via fights (randomly generated) or finding the right items to boost your stats (randomly placed).Perhaps it was because we used the Grim Reaper expansion, but the victory condition of, ""All other players must be dead for you to win, even if you're at the Crown of Command,"" made the game take -entirely- too long! Since even dying once is effectively enough to eliminate one person forever, saying, ""Death is permanent,"" would have been enough to expedite the game tremendously! (Currently, a dead player character respawns on at the start of his next turn at his starting space with no gear, no level up bonuses, no followers, and possibly no spells. If this happens at the late game, this dead PC may as well be out of the game.)  My workaround?  A player at the Crown of Command needs to remain in this space for 3 consecutive turns.  If another player reaches the Crown of Command, this timer resets.  This way, the game does not take 60+ minutes to declare a victor with someone already at the Crown of Command, but allows people to get close and perhaps win.We had some technical problems, too. The game, in general, worked. However, one of our players was repeatedly removed from the game due to connection problems, and we had to restart Talisman about 4 times within 20 minutes to get the game running with all of us again. (To do so, the host should go to Online Game >> Private Game while the others should go to Online Game >> Resume Game once the game is up. This will resume a game from the last auto-saved spot.)In addition, the UI is confusing to new players. In the tabletop version of this game, playing a spell card is as easy as declaring you're playing it, then playing it. In the digital version, each player needs to queue spells to go off at the right time. (I accidentally cast Sleep on myself because I assumed it would go off on the next person's turn.) I also felt unsure of what things did until I did them - like gaining followers or fighting things or trying to use the Portal. Sometimes, this was no big deal (like fighting), but sometimes (like using the Portal), I wish I would have known and understood the important bits before I went through with my actions.Is Talisman worth playing?  That depends.  I liked it because I also liked Munchkin and Dokapon Kingdom and feel they capture the essence of this game better.  Munchkin bypasses the board entirely and go straight for the random danger/delight/treasure in a similar fashion to Talisman, with less die rolling. (As an aside, there is a Munchkin Quest board game which I've not played.)  Dokapon Kingdom's interface is generally better than Talisman's, but it suffers from ""too long to play this game casually in a group setting"" syndrome.  Dokapon can be enjoyed in short bursts among friends, but is not at all meant to be completed in a single sitting.  (According to GameFAQs, Dokapon Kingdom's full game length, from start to finish, is around 60 hours!)  Talisman seemingly -is- meant to be completed in a single session, but around 4 hours for a digital version of a board game made me want to add the aforementioned house rules just to change that to 30-60 minutes.  If you can deal with the tremendous randomness, and have supportive friends who enjoy playing Talisman with you, Talisman is a worthwhile game.Talisman, in its current form, is somewhere between a tabletop board game and a tabletop RPG.  It's more complicated than Monopoly, but less complicated than D&D 3.5.  A full game of Talimsan (an estimated 3.5 to 5.5 hours) is around the estimated session time of a tabletop RPG, like D&D.Talisman is something to experience once or on occasion, but it requires a dedicated group to enjoy it perpetually.IN SUMMARY:+Competitive fantasy RPG-lite and Rogue-lite adventuring.+Fun to play, unique in its design, and created and maintained as a passion project.+Assassin, Ghoul, and Dark Cultist classes are likely to get you a win.+Less setup and hassle than many tabletop RPG campaigns.-Way too long.-Way too random.-Way too confusing without someone first telling you a lot of the game (how to win, what classes to play, what stats do, the good and bad options).

												Do you love boardgames? Do you own boardgames? Do you play them with your friends (hopefully!)? Than this game CAN definatly be for you. But it also depends on how much nostalgia you feel for Talisman. Us boardgamers in general probably wont like this game, it takes a lot of time (can take up to 3 hours), your actions are ALMOST completley random thanks to dicerolling. And you also lose the feeling of moving components around on a board which is a huge part of the enjoyment for this game. If you're a not a boardgamer I would recomend that you stay away from this game. It probably wont meet up with any (if any) of your expectations. This game can be fun with a few friends but you will probably end up only playing a single game of it before moving on to some other game or you know... any other REAL boardgame. Talisman in general is sadly not a great boardgame nomatter how much nostalgia you feel for it. It's basicly a more nerdy version of Monopoly which is the worst... boardgame... ever. Instead of getting this get the game for your pads so that you can play it on long trips on a buss, train, car (unless you're driving) and plane. But make sure you have some people to play with even then./ Nurgleprobe "

												This is a good game, and it seems entirely faithful to the original (although I only played the original once with my uncle long ago, so I could be wrong on that).$15 dollars might be a bit pricy for what it offers.  I waited for a sale to bring it down to about $5.The only issue I take with the game is the AI's reticence to go towards the center of the map, even when they've become very powerful and could easily beat the game (you have to reach the center of the map to win, if you didn't know).  Otherwise, the AI is generally fairly competent.The game is interesting and pretty replayable.  It doesn't offer too much RPing, but it does offer some strategy (even if most of it takes the form of managing various risks).  It makes for a great way to kill some time, and is very easy to pick up and get into.			"

												I really want to like this game, because board games rule, but wow the game this is based on is absolutely garbage.  This plays like monopoly with an RPG element.  It's ridiculously random - a ton of the locations give huge awards for rolling 4-6 and huge penalties for rolling 1-3.  Movement itself is largely based on rolls (unless you, again, are lucky and find a teleport spell/event) so you can't even move around with strategy.  You just go where it tells you, deal with whatever good/bad thing that happens, then wait for your next turn.Not only is the gameplay horrendous, but it's littered with reminders to purchase tons of overpriced DLC.  Base game for $1, DLC for $30?  No thanks.  Don't buy this.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It is definitely best played with a group of friends which you can converse with. To be entirely honest, it is not that great if you play against the AI. The AI has this ability to screw themselves in ways that are entirely possible to avoid with a little bit of thought. For instance, the AI will use an axe to get across the river only to cross back to the outer area the next turn.I would highly recommend this to people which enjoy tabletop games which contain both an element of strategy and an element of luck. There is a lot in this game which requires luck, but once you have played a few games, you can get a feel of what the better spaces and strategies are. Playing with random characters also forces you to get used to new ways of playing the game, making each game much different from the last.Keep in mind, a single string of bad luck can pretty much end your run in the game or force you to play catch up for the remainder of the game if everyone else is doing well.

												I like board games. Talisman is a decent board game. And while this game models the board game fairly well, there is one critical issue and several other annoyances.The critical issue is that the dice roll is not randomised. To demonstrate, perform a turn to see how the die rolls, exit, reload, and then re-do your turn to see the dice roll the exact same way. I've performed different actions and even seen the AI players get the dice rolls I would have got. It's ridiculous. The whole point of rolling a dice is to be random. Not random = not a dice roll.The annoyances are as previously alerted to in prior reviews, mostly to do with poor AI, but I could have lived with that had the dice rolls actually been pseudo-random, you know, ceiling(math.rand()*6) or something.

												Do not pay full purchase for this game.I havn't played Talisman before, so take that in mind.The interface is slow and clumsy. It takes 3 seconds for anything you click to work. Looking at an inventory can be a challenge in itself.You can't look at the spaces outside of your turns, and when you do, it takes ages again. You can't just scroll over it, you have to right-click it, wait, right-click it again, wait and then right-click a card you might want to check on it.The timing of spell cards and everything is thrown out the window, because the clicking responses are very, very slow.And that isn't getting to the bugs.Out for the 4 games I have played so far, each single one has been wrecked because of the terrible interface and bugs.Game one, I choose an apprentice wizard. Get to one life, and look at one of my spells waiting for my turn.Turn comes up, the spell casts itself. And I die to a miscast.Game two, I get a courtesan. I go to flirt with an orc, and take his useful follower, giving me a massive lead. Instead, after looking at his inventory, as I back out, it decided to take me backing out of his inventory as a challenge to combat. Instead of taking something, I then enter physical combat, whith my 2 against his 5 bonus. I lose. He then takes my magical bag of holding, a bag that says on the card 'This card can not be taken in combat', which contained every single bit of my loot.I'm just happy I got this with Humble Bundle, but I won't get my 5 hours back.That said, I now want to play the physical board game. Since that is more social, faster (yes, this game is faster to play physically) and has no bugs.			"

												I've never played the original board game (I know, I know...don't judge) and it took me a little while to understand how the game worked....but once I did it really turned out to be a brilliant and very fun game.  Also the Steam Community were so helpful in explaining some of the things I didn't understand.

												The sheer number of cards and board spaces in this game make every ""run"" a fun and unique experience.  I use the word run because I have loads more fun when I play this game as a solo dungeon/adventure experience.By setting myself and my opponents to be randomly selected and then setting instant death to 30 turns, I'm guaranteed a harrowing and unpredictable experience every time, without the hassle of a long drawn-out game.While the AI will sometimes bumble a move, it is challenging to win in this way.  When I do outfox the board (and my dimwitted albeit cutthroat opponents), its an incredibly rewarding experience.  The multiplayer game is very fun as well, but I've spent far more time playing alone.I highly recommend getting the expansions; I haven't invested in all the character DLC but I'm sure those will add more flavor to the opponent pool.

												After other players managed to convince me the constant crashes are due to a recent expansion and the Devs are usually on top of it with fixes, I realised that it was the hand of fate that made me start this game in the middle of utter chaos.Thus, on the basis of the game alone, I give it my thumbs up(changed from negative).Yes, the game itself, when not crashing, is fun. Well, for people with stamina and patience and time for a bit of commitment it is fun,for people that like the intimacy of boardgames it is fun, I do not recommend it for impatient kids that can't sit still for 15 minutes, because fun will not be had.Is it worth the money the expansion sets cost? That is something everyone needs to decide for themselves, in comparison I'd say it's not too steep (although I'm tight enough to have weighed these words before typing them).All in all, (and I'm liking it more every time I play a game without crashing), I give the game a careful 6.7 out of 10.Please take my playing time into account, which isn't very long, check the reviews of those who have been playing it for longer, or you know, take the plunge!Greetings fellow travellores and connaisseurs of Trollplaying games (TPG's) "

												I have been playing this game for about 6 months now, and I've finally had it with this game. This game is FULL of bugs. The game will routinely change the rules on you and outright cheat to help the AI and screw over players. That isn't even the part that bothers me though. The game has had a problem with crashing and lost connections since I started playing, but it is now to a point where I can't go more than 2 minutes without getting kicked from a game. Even if I rejoin the game each time, the program will eventually crash and I am forced to close the game. This is not just my experience - all of my friends experience the same thing, and a quick search online shows that many people are fed up with these same problems. Do not even waste your time buying this game, the devs don't care about fixing the MASSIVE issues that make this game wholly unplayable. For how long this game has been on the market, there is no excuse for this. The devs should be ashamed and either FIX THE PROBLEMS or get this game off the market.			"

As of the writing of this review multiplayer still has a few bugs to work out and can be quite frustrating at times, but is still very playable and enjoyable with your friends and family.

I waited for a sale to bring it down to about $5.The only issue I take with the game is the AI's reticence to go towards the center of the map, even when they've become very powerful and could easily beat the game (you have to reach the center of the map to win, if you didn't know).  Otherwise, the AI is generally fairly competent.The game is interesting and pretty replayable.  It doesn't offer too much RPing, but it does offer some strategy (even if most of it takes the form of managing various risks).

												Talisman the board game is a great game. Talisman: Digital Edition is a fairly honest representation of the board game, so the fact that it is digital and online really opens up opportunities for multiplayer, and guarantees you'll never lose the game to something ridiculous like a water leak in your home. That being said, there's major UX issues that hinder and confuse gameplay, some rules don't seem to work 100% correctly, and obviously there's no room to play home-made classes that are agreed upon by the other players. Additionally there's a huge lack of explanation with some things, like what the Reaper actually does - all we get is the box description from the physical product and zero readout on the rules. Some things entirely lack labels and direction, like the instructor lets you choose Strength (with no label) then Craft (with no label) so it is really easy to get Strength when you meant Craft or be confused by the whole unlabeled situation.I'd love to give the team feedback on sticking points and things that needs adjustment, but I want to hear from them first before doing so. Don't let these issues dissuade you from purchasing the game, its still a great game and carries the same fun of the board game, plus the added benefit of sometimes helping remind you when you have something else cool to play in a given situation.

I LOVE the digital version of this game, playing locally and online is a lot of fun, and when no one is around to play, the AI always make things interesting. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys adventure rpg games with cards and dice.			"

												This is a good game, and it seems entirely faithful to the original (although I only played the original once with my uncle long ago, so I could be wrong on that).$15 dollars might be a bit pricy for what it offers.  I waited for a sale to bring it down to about $5.The only issue I take with the game is the AI's reticence to go towards the center of the map, even when they've become very powerful and could easily beat the game (you have to reach the center of the map to win, if you didn't know).  Otherwise, the AI is generally fairly competent.The game is interesting and pretty replayable.  It doesn't offer too much RPing, but it does offer some strategy (even if most of it takes the form of managing various risks).  It makes for a great way to kill some time, and is very easy to pick up and get into.			"

												I really want to like this game, because board games rule, but wow the game this is based on is absolutely garbage.  This plays like monopoly with an RPG element.  It's ridiculously random - a ton of the locations give huge awards for rolling 4-6 and huge penalties for rolling 1-3.  Movement itself is largely based on rolls (unless you, again, are lucky and find a teleport spell/event) so you can't even move around with strategy.  You just go where it tells you, deal with whatever good/bad thing that happens, then wait for your next turn.Not only is the gameplay horrendous, but it's littered with reminders to purchase tons of overpriced DLC.  Base game for $1, DLC for $30?  No thanks.  Don't buy this.			"

												7/10 - Lovers of fantasy board games, buy. Others pass...Pros- Lots of Characters- Lots of Cards, Spells, & Events- Easy to play while multi-tasking (TV, other games, ect.)- Online multiplayer content.Cons- Too much DLC- I swear dice are rigged vs AI- Graphics could be better.- Repetative music.- Many mechanics to learn & employ.So, I'm not big on board games. I got this in a Humble Bundle & decided to try it out. For a board game, it's pretty entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7/10 & a thumbs up. If it weren't a board game, I'd give it a 4/10. The game flow is pretty boring & the DLC is somewhat frustrating.It's great that they want to keep the game up-to-date, & I don't expect them to work for free. However there's a bit of a pay-to-win feel, when you're looking at some of the newer content. It's not just new event cards, or ""Alternative Ending Cards"". It's new characters with OP abilities, or OP ""Runes"" (upgrades to base stats).I also wish there was more flash & awe while playing the game. I mean, you pick up a ""blizzard"" card; you expect to see the board covered in a wash of hail! You have tons of spells, but nothing beyond the card's artwork to help you imagine the effect! The game falls a bit flat when it comes to graphic possibilites.The same goes for the music. It's not bad, but it rarely changes. It's so monotonous. With so many events & the dynamic of ""who's winning"", alignments, what board section your in, ect. you'd think there'd me more variety.I complained about the game's loaded dice vs AI. I rolled a ""1"" 5 times in a row on the same square. This happened twice in one game, then once again in the following game. While it's not impossible to do, it's highly improbable. If the dice aren't loaded, maybe I should play the lottery...There's some strategy, but for the most part the strategy is overriden by the RNG of the dice rolls. Personally, I'd be more entertained with a game of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. You have a greater feeling of control, knowing what's in your hand & in your deck. In Talisman: Digital Edition, nothing is guarenteed. You can have 8 godly items one moment; nothing the next. There's nothing you can do about it, & it just makes you feel like the game is a big waste of time.Lastly, there are a lot of quirks with regard to when & how you do things. I had a ""Siphon Strength"" card that I tried using for 10 turns. Suddenly it worked on an opponent that I never selected nor was he near me; just a random event. You need to learn which items are consumed on use, and which arn't. Or maybe you got turned into a toad. Is it worth it for you to land on that spot that gives you +1 Strength? Apparently not.If you like board games, then perhaps you'd be willing to learn all the quirks of this game. Personally, I'd rather play something more intuitve & gratifying. I may play this on occation if I'm stuck watching TV with the kids, but there are many other games that can fill the time with a better sense of achievement.			"

												Great to play with friends.There are some things that annoy me:Casting spells feels wierd.Turn switching is sometimes unclear (only in local game).You cant enable specific cards from some expansion, you need to enable all cards (and map) from particular expansion (it bothers me becouse it is simulation of board game where I can just put these cards off session).One game takes 2+ hours but you can save it to continue the other day.Every session is different, it's totaly randomized, sometimes you are on a roll and sometimes you lose all your stuff.

												I used to play this game often with my old roomates twenty years ago. This is an amazing adaptation. The graphics are awesome and faithfully reproduce the board. It would really be nice if other board games could make the digital transition like this one. My only real complaint is that the AI seemed like it was cheating since it would regularily get the rolls it needed to win some unlikely battles or land on a coveted card. I found myself using an exploit to get around the questionable rolls but recently it was updated and the exploit no longer works. The new update seems to generate a dice table the same way many other digital dice games do. I got the season pass for this one also and have been loving all the DLC. The Dungeon is pretty cool. If you liked the original board game then this one is a must. Its easy to loose many hours here.			"

												this game was a whole lot of fun right up until i ran into a game feature that i consider a bug. it involved a character having an item that only allowed them to move one space at a time with a healer one space away from her. in short it meant that even though i had reached the end and should have been able to experience victory, due to the enemy AI's consistent choice to heal itself, i was stuck in a loop of taking some of her life only to watch her heal it back again....this was the most irritating ""feature"" i have seen in a long time. esspecially since it robbed me of the opportunity to experience victory. but this is just my opinion, feel free to try for yourselves since it is free this weekend.

												Cannot recommend at this time due to numerous bugs. Quite frustrating to play almost 1.5 hours into a game and have it crash due to a card error. Multiplayer is also buggy with frequent drops. Other bugs: At times players are unable to target or deselect target, incorrect sums with dice rolls and modifiers, some card/game mechanics just not working as they should 100 percent of the time. I am loving this game and wish there were not so many game breaking bugs. If these issues were fixed I would recommend this game.			"

												Talisman the board game is a great game. Talisman: Digital Edition is a fairly honest representation of the board game, so the fact that it is digital and online really opens up opportunities for multiplayer, and guarantees you'll never lose the game to something ridiculous like a water leak in your home. That being said, there's major UX issues that hinder and confuse gameplay, some rules don't seem to work 100% correctly, and obviously there's no room to play home-made classes that are agreed upon by the other players. Additionally there's a huge lack of explanation with some things, like what the Reaper actually does - all we get is the box description from the physical product and zero readout on the rules. Some things entirely lack labels and direction, like the instructor lets you choose Strength (with no label) then Craft (with no label) so it is really easy to get Strength when you meant Craft or be confused by the whole unlabeled situation.I'd love to give the team feedback on sticking points and things that needs adjustment, but I want to hear from them first before doing so. Don't let these issues dissuade you from purchasing the game, its still a great game and carries the same fun of the board game, plus the added benefit of sometimes helping remind you when you have something else cool to play in a given situation.

												Incredibly fun and infuriating at the same time.  Requires more than 1 play through for you to really appreciate the game, and while the game is heavily luck dependant, there is strategy in managing your resources and coming up with plans to try and succeed from almost all points of the game.  You could be 2 turns from being the winner and then fnd yourself turned toad if youve wasted all your resources getting to where you are.  Two good bonuses to the already good game are that1) The bots are very well made and provide an excellent alternative for when you dont have friends to play with or cant find an open game online2) With the exception of the specific character DLC, as long as the host of a game owns a content DLC, players without the DLC can still join and play with the content (they still wont be able to use the DLC characters however)			"

												My hours in the digital version are small, but don't let that waver your opinion of my opinion of this unforgiving mistress of a game.I went out and bought the physical edition, and have accumulated several expansions because of how much I absolutely adore the abuse this game deals out (aka: I've dropped over $200 on this series alone).The gamestyle is a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of Dungeons&Dragons, and Munchkin.  You each have your own character with their own special attributes and abilities... and often try to screw each other over as much as possible to try and reach the Crown of Command.Expansion packs will add different endings to the game.  One being a Black Hole type card, where if you reveal it, you disappear into the void and the game ends for you.  She's a ♥♥♥♥♥, and I love her.Other endings can reward players depending on if you have the most gold by the end, a certain amount of trophies, etc.  Other endings are revealed at the beginning of the game; one expansion has a setting where all of the characters are by default good, and you're working towards a similiar cause.Expansions also bring different playstyles to the game.  Grim Reaper has already been introduced, who you can send after other players if you happen to roll a 1.""Blood Moon"" will introduce a werewolf, who moves when a 6 is rolled, and is a mirror of old Grimmy.City, Highlands, Dungeon, and Wildlands are all corner expansions which adds to the map itself.The digital version isn't without error.  There are occasional cards, that when played, will crash the game.  This is usually per them being a target card being played when there was nothing to target.  I wish there was a verify system before setting something into play.The Gold Pack is definitely worth it if you're looking into playing the game for a long time, as it includes every expansion available - and they will be released as they're finished by Nomad.  This also includes side character DLC!The way it works (since I couldn't find an answer to this when I bought the game), is that the person with the gold bundle should be hosting.  That way all of the people who join will have access to the content.  BUT, they will not be able to select any of the DLC characters.  They can, however, select random, and have a chance of drawing one (or three depending on house rules).An average game lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours from our experience.			"

Product received for free
												Do you love watching paint dry? Enjoy the frenzied excitement of watching a snail move? Leave your life to the whims of the fickle winds of fate? Then this is the game for you! If not, read on.If you do buy this game or have received it for free, then by all means enjoy it with the friend/enemy who gave it to you and never ever play with the AI. This game mimics the classic board game well but it\'s a vastly different experience when you play with a physical board, miniatures and a jolly group of friends in front of you. With the digital game, it just feels hollow without the expressions and emotions involved when a plan comes together or falls apart. The game itself is quite easy to pick up but expect to spend at least 2 hours per playthrough depending on how many players in a match. There\'s a lot of downtime as to be expected with most board games while waiting for your turn to roll around and the mechanics are pretty rudimentary and very RNG dependent. Imagine your delight as you reach the very anticlimatic finale which is the Crown of Command. While there, expect to spend the remainder of your turns and probably 45 mins of your life just constantly failing a 50-50 chance a zillion times just to ATTEMPT to end the game while other players counterspell you, heal back up or just try to reach you. Aside from destroying my mouse on multiple clicks to try to speed things up in frustration, the worst came when another player finally reached the Crown too then promptly died and left all his junk on the same tile which prompts an encounter at the start of each turn asking if you\'d like to pick up their stuff even when your own inventory is full thus adding more time to the excruciating endeavour.If you must play the game, then I whole heartedly suggest playing the physical tabletop version with some good friends instead of the digital one.

Game wont let us connect to eachother's private servers, won't let us join eachother's games, wont let me stay connected, frequently encounters game-breaking glitches that stop any player from progressing.Do not buy this game until it has had a fair share of updates.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. I enjoy fantasy themes, and this game has done that very well. Visually, the game is very nice.However, the game just feels too slow, and too reliant on luck. Other reviewers suggest that I am simply not playing it properly. This may be so, but if I cannot enjoy a game before I master it, I will have little incentive to master it.			"

												About 2 years ago (mid-2013), Talisman Prologue introduced me to Talisman on Android, and i thoroughly enjoyed it. When Talisman came out, i did not hesitate to get it and have not stopped playing it since. i only got Steam Talisman working in a Windows VM today, so Steam still rates me as a Noobite, but i've got well over 200 Talisman sessions behind me on Android. It is a near-perfect rendition of the board game (which i have also bought since becoming a fan). Many consider it to be too random, but the fact is that it holds a lot of strategy (part of which is dealing with the randomness). Talisman is _easily_ my most-played Android game, and now that Steam works on my desktop machine (via a Windows VM), it will certainly become my most-played non-Android/non-Linux game as well.If any notable degree of randomness just makes you angry, don't try Talisman, but if you're looking for a lighthearted beer-and-pretzels style fantasy romp, Talisman might just fit the bill in epic form.Tip for new players: PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEARN THE GAME IN SOLO MODE BEFORE PLAYING ONLINE!!!! Few things are more frustrating in online play than having to wait for new players to read every single card and every single square every single turn. So please, for the love of your fellow players, play it solo _AT LEAST 50 TIMES_ before playing online. Learn 90%+ of the cards and board spaces by heart. Your fellow players will appreciate it and will stop dropping out of games which you cause to drag on for 2 hours longer than necessary because you didn't do your homework before playing. Please. Thank you.			"

												One of the best board games of a long past era, Talisman evokes the core of 1980s RNG heavy dice rolling board games. For those of us who lived in that time, before Germany came along and showed the world how great board games can be, this is a well realized throwback nostalgia title. That's not to say Talisman is a great board game. It's really not. It's exceptionally RNG heavy and can be frustrating at times. But, it's also pretty fun. Particularly when playing with a group of friends over Skype, Mumble, etc. The game itself is very easy to learn. Roll a die. Move. Do what's on the board. Try to improve your character enough to get to the center, defeat the challenge, and win the game.The software implementation of Talisman by Nomad is pretty good. The animations and sounds are good, the graphics are pretty, and it plays the way you would expect. We've only run into a few bugs, one game-breaking, over a bunch of sessions. One of the really nice things Nomad did was allow the host's version of Talisman to be played. I have the full season pack, and a bunch of my friends have the core game only. I host, and we can play with all of the expansions.There are 3 expansions out so far. The best one at the moment is The Dungeon, which adds a large board segment to one of the corners. I'm very much looking forward to when all of the expansions are out and you can play a big mega game.Game time can run a bit long. While this is faster than the tabletop version, budget about one hour per player per game. I recommend, but this definitely isn't for everyone. I sunk about 100 hours into Talisman Prologue (which was their single-player ""Beta"" version of this and about a dozen hours so far for the full release. This is a fun one to pull out once in a while with friends, like any good board game.			"

												Talisman as a board game is basically the definition of an Ameritrash game.  It's the game of life with a fantasy theme: roll dice, and see what happens.  There is very little strategy, the vast majority of choices are a coin flip or else a no brainer.  It can be fun with friends in person or over voice because you can mess with other players, but it is garbage as a solo game or against strangers online.  This computer version is curiously unresponsive to mouse clicks and there is a weird delay whenever you try to get more context information on a space or character.  Animations take a moment to come up and can't be skipped, everything feels heavy.  It seems like every time you do anything there is a tiny confirmation button to hit, even in situations where you have no choices and you see the same information on the next screen.    The interface doesn't take any advantage of being on a computer. For example the basic choice in the game choosing between moving between two spaces after rolling a dice.  It plays it just like the board game, ""helping"" by highlighting the squares you can move to.  You can right click (with the previously mentioned delay) to see what those spaces actually are.  Why doesn't the game keep the board in the background and bring up popups with information about your move choices?  I can't think of many people who wouldn't be happier sticking to the board game if they're a fan, or if not playing a different game entirely.			"

												This is a nice digital rendition of the original boardgame. It is however somewhat limited in how you play cards, and there should really be an option when you cue a card to be played where you get a question if you want to play it or not when a situation triggers where the card can be played. Currently you have to time certain cards very precisely and you'll end up targeting yourself with bad spells and throw away other cards simply because the game is programmed so that if you cue a card you mindlessly play it on whatever is a legal target. Ruins a lot of the fun unfortunately. If they patch this the game will be close to perfect in it's resemblance of the original boardgame.			"

												Having played this game a few times now, I've so far encountered: an idiotic AI that doesn't attempt to reach the crown of command, required to win the game, despite having near-max stats.  An AI that will move a single space every turn due to a poltergeist, healing each turn and therefore causing a stalemate, causing me to lose out on XP and achievement progress.  And most recently, an AI that on the brink of a loss decides to constantly check his inventory on an infinite loop, disallowing me my final turn like the worst of poor losers.  Having experienced all this with just 4.7 hours on record shows what a terrible game this is, in terms of AI, bugs, and problems with the game system in general.May still try the online mode as friends have bought the game, but if playing against the AI just give up now.  Either you won't be allowed to win, or it will be a hollow victory.			"

												This is a game that plays you. It's a dated digital boardgame. I could see how a lot of people like it, especially if they grew up playing it - that whole nostalgia factor, but it is incredibly long between turns and there is no reason to pay attention to what other players are doing. Due to the completely random nature of the game there is no skill needed to play it or become good. After 30 or 40 rounds I was easily the most powerful player and well on my way to winning, but I found myself extremely bored. I even tried to get myself killed, and succeeded, hoping that the game would be over. That just wasn't the case, and I found myself reset at the same point in the game - grinding to get more powerful to further advance inward. I increasingly found myself stepping away from the computer between turns after a couple of rounds. This just isn't for me. It might be more fun with other people, chatting over mics while doing something else more brain intensive. I'd honestly rather just play a better game with friends.			"

You can choose to follow the previous path (and get the exact same outcome, suggesting that draws and rolls are predetermined), or a new path, in case the old one didn't end up being very lucrative....

												The game premise is pretty good and I think I would enjoy the actual board game, but as it stands the digital version of the game is somewhat poorly made. I've had numerous glitches occur, and some aspects of the interface are rather annoying. My biggest complaint so far is having played a game as a Ninja the victory condition made it impossible to win. I was required to obtain 2 followers and then discard them in order to complete a Warlock Quest. Ninjas can not have followers. Therefore  I couldn't win. I got a cursed item that made me lose all of my quests, which I used to get rid of that quest and go take a different Warlock quest, to which the game made me take the same quest again, with no roll or anything even though the spot said to roll for it. I did have some irratations with the interface, but those could be avoided once a player becomes familiar with the game. The games been out long enough that really big glitches like this should probably have been patched out. Theres also very squirly things with the NPC players where they will often drag on their turns for a while picking up every single item on a square, and then put every item back down because they lack inventory space, even though they won't take any of the actual items. I could go on, but I got the game for a steal so I can't complain too much. Thinking im going to go buy the board game now though. I rather like the actual game.			"

We played for a while and then one of us couldn't do anything and it just sat there, so we reloaded and now only I could see the network games and had to invite everyone else. Also the method of resuming an online game is... an afterthought.Buggy, we ran into many crashes , cards would not cast at the end of your turn like they said even though they were qued, amoung many other incorrect spell castings.Dissapointing end game, just standing on the crown rolling 1 die every round with no option of leaving or backtracking, not sure who thought that up but it was bad. Players could just sit there and pelt you with spells build up there stats  and then kill you.Total dissapointment.The Music was uninspired.The price, $79.99 for the complete version, I won't ever play this again even if its free.

												This is a faithful recreation of a board game which involves running in circles and cursing dice rolls. Its enjoyable but there are several aspects which may result in depression or rage.Game summery:- Choose a fantasy class (with stats and powers).- Move randomly around the board and deal with events and other players.- Increase your strength and/or craft skills.- Fight your way to the center of the board.- Patiently wait until everyone else dies. This can be reduced by changing the game options.Be warned, this game contains:- My average game length is 1-2 hours, but it can be much longer.- Devastating random events. A single die roll MAY (and will) destroy you.- Horribly broken AI (which gives you a fighting chance of victory).- Waiting on AI turns (sometimes their turns are longer than your own).- Predetermined dice rolls (no restarting to cheat against the AI).- Lots of ""Confirm"" buttons when several could be replaced by having an ""undo"" button instead. - No ""auto play"" option for times when there is no choice involved.- Massive amounts of pay DLC.I recommend it, but its certainly not for everyone!

												For those who can't get to an actual table often (or at all) this is a great alternative to play Talisman.  Don't know what it is?  Think Fantasy Monopoly and you sort of have the idea, only instead of buying properties and gathering cash and boning your friends, you're fighting monsters, gathering treasure, gambling money, and... well, boning your friends.  It's an all-time classic board game.Only downside is they charge about the same amount for the DLC as they do for the real game's expansions, so if you actually can get a good regular gaming group together, getting the actual game is probably a much better course of action for you.Note: as of this writing, the DLC list has shrunk down to three, so the above comment may no longer be valid, but during the Early Access, you could see listed all the expansions for the physical game at the same price.  This may turn up later.EDIT: Don't know why my play counter is 0.  I've definitely played this a helluvalot more than that.			"

												I just spent $70 on the gold pack. That gives you the ""season pass"" (all current and future DLC + 5 licenses to give away as gifts).I thought it would be a great holiday present for my brother and 2 nephews.First off, it seems that only the purchaser (me) gets all the expansions. Everyone else gets the base game. This was not even close to clear in the listing on Steam.Secondly, the game is wildly unstable. It crashes nearly every time I launch it. Once you've crashed in a multiplayer game, Resume Game options simply don't work.I am on a MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM, so I have more than enough horsepower for this game.This is not even close to production quality. I love the board game, but this is a big disappointment. As far as I can tell, there is no way on Steam to submit a support request, so I can't even tell if the people I've gifted to have what they are supposed to have. Terrible, terrible support.I can't in good conscience recommend this game.			"

												There are alot of things done good in this game: They didn't change the rules or the cards, the graphics is good, the AI's play reasonably good. This is a good didgital rendering of a fantastic board-game.The problem is the pace.In Real-life board game your opponents are human. You have fun sitting around the table passing time and gaming. But when playing against AIs waiting isn't fun. It's annoying and tiresome.And the AI in this game thinks SLOWLY. VERY VERY SLOWLY. Even on maximum speed.And the graphics. Oh the graphics. It's good. Really. But SLOW. SO SO SLOW. The well intended animation of everything from rolling a die to the turn shifting to the next player makes the turns unbearably long. So long infact I got up made popcorn, and came back to find it's still isn't my turn.So slow I find myself incapable of playing the game without doing atleast one more thing.This game would have been a 9/10 if you had a ""No animation"" option. Without it the pace of the game is so slow I'm compeled to give it a 3/10 - Nice try.			"

												I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game. Whilst I have many fond memories of Talisman from my childhood, this is a terrible implementation of a game that has long past exceeded its best-by date.Talisman itself is sadly lacking in the current era of boardgames, with little to no strategy or choice left to the player. It is dictated far more by the random roll of the die, than any particular desire of the player. Even Monopoly provides more strategy, and choice of action. This is a faithful implementation of the original, for what little that is worth.The main issue is the interface, which is an abomination. Trying to play with friends rapidly becomes an excercise in extreme frustration, wherein you battle the shoddy controls - instead of battling your friends. Laggy, unresponsive and unintuitive are the nicest words I have to say about it. I wish I could refund it, and I feel terrible for gifting it to several of my friends who now all have a much poorer opinion of me.If you have any fondness for Talisman, any decent memories of the game - leave them as that, memories. Playing this game will leave only a bitter taste in your mouth of ashes and defeat. Nomad Games has my money - please dont give them yours.			"

												This game is awful. It is extremely tedious, as the board game experience doesn't translate well to the greater capabilities of computers - you spend most of your time waiting for other people to have their turns. This would be OK if you had anything to think about while waiting, but the fact is that this game is complete luck. This could be forgiven if the game only lasted 2 minutes, but the fact is that some complete game will take 2 hours.This game is frustrating to play, takes too long, and has no strategy to it. Do not buy.			"

												For the $15 dollar asking price of the base game I find the content to be severly lacking. The games length and nature can cause random grueling sections (I once spent 30 turns fighting a player on the end game tile, where he kept hitting my armor and my attack was too low to kill him), It could be possible that with all the DLC the game would have enough content to be fun, however i'm not willing to put in $60 bucks for a truck load of DLC that may or may not create a satisfying experience, not to mention that $75 for a digital board game feels, and is a fairly crazy asking price.

												I tried, I really tried. I love the board game, I thought for sure this would be a great addition to my Steam library. But I've tried to play a dozen online games with friends, and every single one had to be abandoned when the game glitched. Either it would just lock up and refuse to go to the next turn, or someone would suddenly be dropped from the game and when they tried to rejoin the game would freeze up in some in-between-turns state. I tried, Talisman, but now you're getting uninstalled.What a sad waste of potential.			"

												You'll have already read what the game is: a faithful recreation of a board-game classic with high fidelity to the original, a somewhat sketchy interface, a few bugs, and the same glacial pacing as if you were playing around a table, minus the board setup.AI is one of the keys to transition between in-person and computer-based play. The programmers haven't solved that problem well at all. Computer opponents don't have much strategy besides accumulating stats and items. They perform like mediocre bots in the single-player training missions of an online FPS. A human player would wipe the table with them every time, except the AI appears to get a boost via favorable die rolls and card draws, likely to disguise its lack of real strategy. The first few games this doesn't matter much, but after dozens of games it sucks the enjoyment out of it.If you have 3 friends willing to play the game with you, I'd buy this game in a heartbeat. If you're going to fill in with computer players--and especially if you just want to play single-player--this is probably a pass. For that reason--plus constant problems connecting with servers resulting in interrupted games--I have to give this game a no vote even though I generally like it. It's not a horrible purchase, just know what you're getting into.			"

												I would love to give this game a recommendation to purchase as it should be a fantastic game.  However, if you are thinking of buying this game, do not waste your money until the game bugs are all fixed.  The fun in this game should be the online gameplay. I've started well over ten games now and have not been able to finish one - every game has crashed! The game always crashes, and this really should have been sorted out before releasing the game.  Quite frankly, steam should refund all purchases as the game is completely unplayable and unfit for purpose (if it were any other product it would be breaching trading laws).  How the company can contine to sell expansion packs is beyond me - the original game needs massive improvement first.  You will waste your money if you purchase this as it will lead to no end of frustration in the online mode and  will be no enjoyment at all.			"

												I picked this game up for $5.  At that price, you really can't go that wrong.  That being said, this game really walks the line between whether or not to give it a positive or a negative review overall.The design flaws of the Talisman game really manifest itself when you play with a rigid, impassionate interpreter of the game.   This doesn't seem like a bad thing, but Talisman has evolved over the years with very little consistency: there's a huge variety of nuances in the language used.  Phrases such as ""...at any time..."" implies a different expectation than what is actually practiced in the game.  The honest truth is, people zone out when they play Talisman.  You miss a few turns in jail, or wait for four other players to battle dragons, abuse spells, and ponder over quests; just so you can roll a 3 and scoop up a bag of gold.  There's a whole layer missing from the electronic version of the game that you get when you are playing on the tabletop with your friends that really is the only thing that makes Talisman an acceptable use of an afterrnoon.The game would also benefit from an ability to remove specific cards from out of the deck; because there are some really grossly imbalanced combinations as well as cards you just get sick of seeing- like the one that takes all the face up city cards and put them on top of the adventure deck.  The electronic version of the game also takes longer to play, as every step of the game is iterated out individually.  The dice roller seems very suspect as well.  I've had back to back snake eyes when dicing with death as well as +3 Craft from the Reaper in three stops.The game does give you something to do while your waiting in a que or auto-running to your next mission, but it's hard to recommend solely on the experience it offers.  To be honest, considering how horribly overpriced the Fantasy Flight version of the game is, I would still recommend this version of the game over the table top version.  I'm sticking with my 2nd Edition Games Workshop version.			"

												I own the boardgame in its original form for at least 20 years now and I absolutely love it.When this software version of the game was announced I was really intrigued about how well it would turn out.Here is my advice vor players of the original boardgame:AVOID AND DONT BUY THIS F*CKING BAD CONVERSION OF A ONCE GREAT GAME AS YOU WOULD ALSO NATURALLY AVOID THE GAMES WORKSHOP VERSION OF THE GAME !!!And here is why:- Not all characters are included, you will have to buy them seperately like in the games workshop version- Fullscreen doesn't work properly on all setups. You will have to minimize the steam window else the game will always turn to windowed mode at startup- the boardgames original graphics on the board itself are way (and I mean WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY) more detailed than the blurry ♥♥♥♥ they serve you in this conversion here (though I have to admit I don't own the games the Games Workshop version of the boardgame, so it may be they are poorly done and do suck nowadays too.)- Some rules can be changed (what is good) but why can't i for eg say let's have ""N"" numbers of randomly chosen characters to select from in the beginning?- The descriptions on the single fields on the board don't include the inscriptions (and they wouldn't have been able to be read either if impelemented in the same blurry way like the background graphics), you have to click on them first to see it, and it must be your turn to be able to do so. WHY THE HECK? Include a tooltip you d*mb*ss programmers ... how old are you?- ...You know what? I don't have the time and / or the mood to write more about this as it turns out to be more and more to be a list of easyliy implementable ideas others get paid for. So if you wanna know how to do this game ""pixelperfect"" to it's true original form than contact me if you are one of the devs.One more thing:You wanna know the moment I rage quited the game?Here it is all about it:I played an elv. I found a wizards staff and got myself a spell. I wanted to use the spell the next round because I disliked the one I got and wanted to get a new one (by using the staff again). The spell was the one that blocks another player or enemy for one turn. As I should select one character to cast the spell on I selected a figure of another player on the board. This didn't work. Then I thought, ok click on the charakters Icon and I clicked on myself to test if it works and you know what? It did work. It showed my card AND another button where I could choose to do cast the spell. BUT NO ""GO BACK"" BUTTON?WTF?!?!?!?As I said, contact me if you want to overdo this game to a GOOD game that is worth the big name it's released under, but don't expect to get more infos or ideas for free ... Or is it free to get all the characters THAT FOR ALL TIME WHERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BOARDGAME in this software version?...And now everyone please hate me for this review and vote me down ...*lol*@ngel			"

												DnD the board game. Really fun board game that is entirely based on dice rolls, no skill involved what-so-ever. Cannot recommend this game without the dlc, the additions to the board and extra characters are a must have, the base game will not keep you entertained for more than a few hours but with all the trimmings its endless fun. I cannot recommend this game sadly because it crashes very frequently and has no saving or drop-in/drop-out feature for multiplayer which means you can play for HOURS AND HOURS and then all progress is lost.

												I had 5/5 lives and a 17 strength, and I just had to sit on the death square in the inner kingdom and die because I rolled badly. I was lightyears ahead of the AI and it didn't matter. Only dice rolls did.  I can't fathom how this is good game design. I just died. This game is too luck based to be any fun.Also, everything just feels sluggish. It takes hours to play a seemingly simple game. Maybe it's better as a real board game.			"

												There is a lot to be said about the charm of nostelgia... but not enough to deflect the idea that time can be cruel and that some things, like Talisman, do not age well.This game is quite a nice digital version of a boardgame from long ago, but as such it does not have the benefits granted from all the game development that would come after it.That is not meant to be a cruel jab, if anything is is an apology for why I can't find much positive to say.All you really need to know is that this game is an excercise in being given a very small set (usually 2) of options each turn based on the roll of a die. those options are then resolved throught the roll of another die... and then that loop is repeated for about an hour or more with plenty of long pauses taken at random intervals.Your input into this game is so small, and the luck so great that it is hard to truely feel that this game needs you to be present, or that any sucess or failure is yours to claim.The translation from cardboard to digital is well done and smooth in most places, but does have a few flaws, (there is no option to hide all of the A.I.'s desicion making if you are playing with bots, and it can only be sped up so much in the options... meaning that your already drawn out experiance is now stretched further and thinner.)It can be applauded for being such a faithful replication of a board game, but as to wether that excersice is, itself, worthwhile, my feelings lead towards: No.If you are an old board gamer who maybe missed out on this little bit of gaming history and wanted to experiance it, this is a good way to do so, but if you are anyone else, there are better digital board games, much better non-digital board games, and infinitely better digital adventure simulators.Try any of them before this.

Do not buy unless it is on sale for $1.Talisman is one of the best board games that have ever come out. However, I am talking about the original board game, not the digital edition. I am not going to describe the single player feature as it is very poor and AI does not demand any thinking from the player, making the single player game easy, boring and discouraging. Therefore, I will concetrate on the multiplayer feature since it is the only feature worth looking at.The rules are very simple: roll a dice, move that many spaces, draw a card or cards, read them and d what the instruction tells you to do. Simple isn't it? Well, for developers it is not simple. The game is full of bugs and developers insist on working on new addons instead of correcting existing bugs. In other words - the game is not finished and really rushed and I need to point out it was released a long time ago. Too long for such issues to happen. The game can freeze or crash just after loading it. I experienced game freeze on the main menu several times - solution, do not leave the game on the title screen or it will stop responding. You will be forced to start the game again and/or start Steam again, and/or reboot your system.The game was not properly tested before release and it is more than obvious.  A lot of cards do not work as they are supposed to. Many card effects lead to a dead end as you will not be able to do anything (I see that problem with many spells while casted on other players). Example: after casting for example, Misfortune spell on the opponent, the game stopped responding and did not give any player any opportunity to make their moves, the game stops, the timeout counter freezes and you or any other player is forced to leave the game in order to make it move on. Connection issues occur every game. Some players are kicked out of the server for no reason. Sometimes you cannot go back to the game you were playing.  After joining the server and starting or looking for a game, your game can stop responding, forcing you to reboot your game and ocassionally your Steam and/or your system. Who put Quit button in the Settings? Standing ovation for the analysts/architects/developers and anyone responsible for this sensible chuckle design. I laughed, my friends laughed. Good comedy. There is no way to speed up the game play. It goes very long and I played some games for such a long time that I do not recall any actual board games to last that long (and I played with 7 people at a time!). You have to wait for every action even if no action is available at the moment. For example: even though you have only one choice, the system does not automatically go with the only choice but waits for you to select it. Bad idea. There is a number cards that do not work properly or do not work at all and when it comes tot he interaction betwen some cards, majority of such situations lead to a glitch, mostly forcing you to rejoin the game or restarting it. Each new addon comes with a new set of bugs. Beware. Random Number Generator is really poor and developers should think before they do something rigged as this. There is a chance that you will throw ""1"" for about 5-10 times in a row which is impossible if you were really rolling dice. This NEEDS to be fixed. I remember rolling the same set of numbers several times in a row. Bad development. There is no explanation for such bad execution of dice roll simulation. You can be kicked out of the game without any chance (yes!) for coming back. The game tends to bug out and nothing can be done to go back to it. Progress is lost. The most disappointing. Inviting your Steam friends is very buggy. I have never successfully invited anyone without a crash, so I do not use that feature.TL;DR - If you want to play the great game which is Talisman - go and buy the original board game, you will never have to reboot anything, wait for anything to happen, look at bugs, being surprised that nothing what the card described happened. Digital edition is faw away from being a good product. It is fair for now, but it is closer and closer to being bad if noone takes care of basics like card working. Less development on new addons, more at bug fixing, please.I paid $1 for the game and that's how much it is worth Pros:- Classic Talisman game!- Many addons and characters that make games more interesting- You do not need addons to actually play them, only one person in the game needs them- Very good music- The cards are taken straight from the board game version!Cons:- The game is not finished- Bugs ruin the game experience- Connection issues that seem to go worse with time- No way to join the game that is currently in progress - in the board version that's what makes this game so attractive, no matter how many people are currently playing, you can always join- Bad mutliplayer and overall game issues force players to leave the game early (ruining the game)- Less and less players (20 average) playing the game online (which is very sad)Do not get me wrong = the game is fun but the way it was developed forces you to abandon the idea of playing. Board games are not supposed to be that frustrating when it comes to gameplay. This game would be better if not rushed so much. If developers concetrated on the Basis of the game instead of looking for easy cash selling characters or addons - I would recommend it 100%. Sadly, I cannot do that and reasons for it are mentioned above.These issues are serious as I see less and less players online. "

												Fun game, but online play is too failure prone to enjoy.I'm a big fan of the board game, and single player mode works fine.

												2 Words: DLC marketplace. Its one thing when you have dlc in your game, its another when the minute I try to create a game I'm slammed in the face for not having 90% of the content available. This is most evident in the player selection where it shows you the 6 heroes you own and the 50+ that you do not in a hodgepodge of little icons with no labels.Look, I can understand having DLC as a part of the game, but DLC constitutes almost 4 times what the base game has to offer. And if you really want to enjoy this game, its basically mandatory. Avoid this marketing strategy and avoid this company. A 14.99 game should not feel like an incomplete experience and have dlc content that is pushed this heavily on its players. Expansions are fair, but DLC should not be required to enjoy the game nor be pushed as heavy handedly.			"

												Unless you're a huge fan of the original board game you might want to give this a pass.On the surface it's fine. There's a board. There are cards, characters and a die. Great. Unfortunately once you actually start to play you realize pretty quickly that you're dealing with a tablet port that's had oodles of time put into it on the dlc-front, but not so much on  the optimizing-for-pc front. There's the base game, then several expansions, then I don't even know how many characters for a buck or three apiece, and there ain't a thing wrong with any of that assuming the game plays well and stable on the average pc.That's where things begin to break down. There's a very long-standing and unresolved bug affecting a lot of people wherein if you afk from the game for anything more than about 60 seconds or so you'll return to a frozen screen, which you can only ""fix"" by force-closing the game in Task Manager and restarting. There's thread after thread after report after report on the Discussions page, and each says the same thing: ""File a bug report and email it to us w/a log"" and that's about it. There's been no solution to date, one year on, but boy oh boy have there been dlc galore in that time.The game interface itself is, to be charitable, minimal. There's very little in the way of options in the settings menu, in the main game UI you'll be left to pretty much figure things out on your own since there's no tutorial of any kind, and no game manual that I've ever been able to find that outlines basic rules, etc. I played the game for months before realizing that I could click on the bar at the top of the screen that shows the current turn, and that that would show me details about turn events like card text, who rolled what, and so on.In the same vein there are very, very few input options. You may use your mouse, and... that's almost it. Again, I played for months before discovering that clicking the spacebar = selecting whatever option is at the top right on your screen, be it ""encounter space"" or ""move here"" or whatever. There are no keys that do anything else whatsoever that I've seen. Again this is something that's been requested for a year on the forums, the ability to map some keys to common actions, and from what I can see the response has been the same every time: ""Because it would take a lot of time to code for different OS's, the game is kept basically in a tablet state to make it simpler on us devs"". Again, that constraint hasn't stopped them pumping out character and expansion dlc. That's the gist of it, anyway, so ask yourself if you want to pay 15 bucks for a tablet game on your pc.Game bugs: no shortage of 'em. Spell queueing is hit and miss, at best. Sometimes they work as you expect, other times they don't fire off at all or they do but not where you intended. There are cards that don't work at all in certain situations and cards that work in unexpected ways in others. Multiplayer games freeze and/or disconnect a random person, in addition to the aforementioned single player freeze. There is little to no hovertext, which in a game where you're forced to play with your mouse almost exclusively leads to a LOT of clicking. If you want to remind yourself what stipulations exist on a certain game square, for instance, you must click that square. This is fine unless you accidentally double-click, which is easy enough to do, at which point your character *moves* to that square whether you're finished reading its text or not. The same goes for many cards like spells or potions. Be careful clicking on them if you're simply trying to read them. One extra click and poof! there goes that spell you totally didn't intend to cast yet.I could go on but there's not much point. It *is* a game, and it *is* playable, but it isn't all that enjoyable to me to the point I'd recommend it to anyone, and the reason I go so far as to give it a thumbs down is simple: after months of waiting, pleading, begging the devs to show a little love to the pc community (whose money they seem to love enough, alright) their response was to post a new thread announcing an upcoming new Talisman game they're working on. Presumably we were all meant to shout ""Yay! Take my money!"", but to me it felt like someone who'd just mugged me asking if I'd like to buy my wallet back.Again, if you're a hardcore fan of the original, this will probably fulfill your digital desire to play, but it ain't gonna be a bug-free or hassle-free experience. If you're new to the gamel I'd recommend giving it a pass, unless the devs decide to pay it the attention they should've been paying from the start.			"

												This game is full of bugs. The worst one even doesn't let you start the multiplayer match in 4 out of 5 tries, when the option ""Character selection"" (out of 3 Chars) is enabled, which usually is enabed for fair play. When this happens, the first player doesn't get a hero to choose from and so the room needs to be rehosted. More than that, the game crashes randomly or you just disconnect from the server, with sometimes beeing unable to rejoin the game. I've made a 4 player match where one player left the game at the beginning. Not a big deal, it happens often and the KI took over and the remaining three players continued to play for three hours. Then the player who left returned, which caused a crash to the other three players, while one was already at the crown and the game would have ended 10 minutes later. Great, three hours played for noting than frustration. The commentary of the returning player: ""Oh, I made it back right in time"". D o u c h e b a g -.-Singleplayer works fine, KI is ok, but since you normally want to play against other humans and not against the KI, this game sucks more often than it makes fun.			"

												A little bit too complex for its own good.   A game took me a good two hours with myself and three AI's, and you couldn't speed the AI turns up enough for my liking.  The second game was broken by an elf who spent the entire game teleporting between two forests, increasing their stats endlessley.  I would like to try the board game though.I played two more games to completion with 2 AI's, and the game is just way too random.  The frog mechanic can move a character from first to last place instantly, and sometimes there's nothing you can do to prevent it.  Getting the rolls you need to win is incredibly difficult, and once someone gets to the Crown of Power they almost always win.			"

												Talisman is the classic adventure board game of powerful magic and ferocious creatures. Play as one of many classic fantasy archetypes such as an elf, wizard, monk, thief (and many more!) as you gain experience, powerful items/weapons, followers, spells and so on. Adventure around the board until you're ready to tackle the dreaded inner region, reach the Crown of Command, and claim victory! If you like gameplay that is all about playing the odds, you'll probably enjoy yourself in Talisman. At first glance it seems like a simple roll-and-move game where the player has little control over what happens to them during any given turn, but it's actually very involved as winning requires understanding how to create good odds for yourself. It's also a game where you need to understand that bad things WILL happen and there's nothing you could've done about it; or even if you lost a fight you shoulda won - it's ok because 80% odds in your favor means you'll still lose 20% of the time. Talisman is a very interesting mix of a laid back casual game (because of how simple any given turn is) and also a very cutthroat game. Players will clash in many PvP battles over the course of a game and powerful items will switch hands as players take them from each other through force or other means. You'll need to always take into account the other players, knowing which ones you should target and which ones will target you.So if you like fantasy adventure and gameplay that's all about navigating the wims of random luck, I highly recommend Talisman. It's a light game that manages to capture that feeling of going on an epic quest and overcoming great challenges. There's a reason this game is still around despite many bigger and more involved adventure board games being released since the 80s, so play this digital adaptation and find out what makes Talisman so special.

												This is a faithful re-creation of Talisman the boardgame, and that's its problem.  Talisman is a dreadfully prolonged lesson on the fate of die rolls, which will see you endlessly sliding back and forth until you luck out and roll whatever number you needed, which will push you toward the end game, until, of course, a single unlucky die roll sends you spinning back to square one and adds 90 more minutes onto the play time of this terrible, outdated game.  I suppose if you like the original treadmill of futility that is Talisman, you'll like this game, too.			"

												I love the board game.  However, the board game is, frankly, a bit flawed.  Talisman, in a nutshell, is: roll a die, 1,2,3 bad, 4,5,6 good.  Repeat. and repeat... and repeat... and... well, keep going for two hours.  If you like Talisman, then get this bit of nostagia (yes, there are new versions of Talisman out, but really, the first edition was the best fun).  I don't like all the add on packs for such a primitive game.  I also do not recomend multi player for this game (it deserves to be played on a table).  Not for anyone who does not have experience with the board game.			"

												This is a faithful electronic adaptation of the board game, but it's not a very good game. It's sort of a Candyland with violence. You get to make very few decisions during the game except when to roll again and when you use you spells. Since almost everything is random, it feels almost as if the game is playing itself. Even if you enjoy this sort of thing, the game lasts way too long, especially the endgame, which can drag on forever even though it is pretty clear who is going to win.			"

												This game is a joke, I've never seen a game with so many bugs. It's just unplayable in multiplayer. The game ALWAYS crashes for some reason, when it's not network connection being lost. I played it when it came out, bugs. It stopped playing for 4 months and gave it another chance, as buggy as ever. You play for one or two hours, and then bang! game freezes. The only reason why people are still playing it is that it's a cult game, and actually a great game and fun to play when you're a fan. It's sad because this game had so much potential.			"

												Love it. I first played this board game when it came out in the 80's and loved it. I have played it several times since with various expansions and seeing it come to life digitally brought back so many memories.It is practically identical to the original board game, and does have a few annoying bugs (mostly around spells not quite activating the way they should) but outside of that this is a really well done port of the original.It is just as unbalanced as the original board game but the runestones go a small way to helping that out, bringing the weaker characters into the mix nicely.Recommended and looking forward to all the future expansions. Bring on the dungeon!			"

												If you like the boardgame, you'll enjoy this license.  I don't know why you would like the boardgame, after playing this for almost 60 hours clearly the boardgame is ♥♥♥♥.  Everything is random after character selection and the decisions you make beyond avoiding obvious ♥♥♥♥ups are mostly arbatrary.  Priestess = OP  same with the other classes that cycle spells.  Quick note about the AI, if you let them get to the vampire's Tower get ready for the AI to get stuck in a loop for hours.  They can't decide which follower is worth getting rid of.  Best fix I've found is restart the game until the AI decides to go away from the Tower.Collecting Runes does provide some replayability.			"

												The game seems really fun to play and I would love to try the board game some time.HOWEVER the execution of putting it into software was just an epic fail. Bugs all over the place, Really hard to use UI (user interface) as in your own cards are not shown to you when you want to use them,The tutorial to teach a new player lags behind the actual game play (a few times the tutorial messages would pop up and i ended up thinking ""wow, that would have really helped x turns ago!"")DLC WARNINGThis game offers you tons of add-ons to customize the game IF you buy the DLC's! It might be worth it if they were only a dollar or so but 6 dollars per DLC!?!?And all you get is a few more chars and some cards for a game that is already so buggy its almost unplayable?!?!just another example of a greedy company that employs a broken DLC system!!!

												I'm a lifelong board game fan, and bought Talisman: Digital Edition to see if I would like it well enough to purchase a tabletop copy for my collection.  Unfortunately, this digital edition has bugs and glitches that have kept me from finishing a game, primarily with AI getting stuck - unable to make a decision, and unable to force the AI to continue.  What I learned is that Talisman relies almost entirely on luck - rolling dice and drawing cards for everything.  Not enough strategy for my tastes.  And this digital edition still seems to have serious issues that make me not want to play, despite decent art and music.  If you like the fantasy theme, stick to the tabletop version, or try Descent: Journeys in the Dark instead.			"

												First off, unless I'm mistaken, this is my first Steam review. I hate that it's negative, but I am way too ticked off at this game NOT to give it a negative review. Second, this game makes me wish I had bought it AFTER the Stean refund policy change. I would refund this pile in a heartbeat. Now let me get into the things I hated about the game. Also, for the most part, you are not going to read anything here that are not in the other reviews. If you like the board game, you might like this if you don't crash. If not my gripes are similair to othersSo, I bought this game a few months ago, but never got around to playing it. I left Neverwinter Nights, and get a pop-up saying if I buy a character for Talisman the profits with go to charity. Great! I love to help charity. And it is a shaman. Shamans and Druids are some of my favorite characters. So load up the game, and search the main page for a tutorial. There's none, which is troubling, but I figure, 'hey, it's probably a tutorial as you play kind of game'. Which it is. Problem is you ghave to choose your character with stats that you have NO CLUE what they do. So I do what I always do in a fantasy game where I'm not sure about the mechanics. I pick the Warrior, because it is almost aways the easiest class. I also make sure there is only one  opponent, because i wanted the make the game as easy as possiblee.Then I get into the game. My first turn I roll, get a 6 move to the temple. My whole strategy tois to get the two weapons that the fighter can have, then play from there. I roll again, then have to fight an ape. I lose. No prob. It's the beginning of the game, and I can't expect to win every dice roll. Now I don't remember all my opponents turns, (partly because he was taking turns when I was reading text) but basically he didn't have ONE bad thing happen on any of his turns. So, I take my thirds turn and fight a creature with craft, and lose again. Next turn, roll again, got a dragon, lost again. Now mind you, you don't get a choice on whether to fight or not. Some classes give some choice in some situations, but mostly, roll and get blssed or f-d. So, I'm down 3 lives, and have some event where I lose ANOTHER LIFE! My opponent. Again, my opponent has lost no life, and hasn't even had to fight. I am a WARRIOR and I have won no fights. I just want a weapon. So I spend my one gold to get back 1 hp because I am at one HP. THEN I get the second gold that would have allowed me to get a weapon.  Then I roll a demon which I would have to roll a 6 to tie. So back to 1 hp. At this point I say F this game. So I want to see what happens when you die, so I attack the creature with craft (magic) because he should have an advantage. And THEN I win. *Faceplam*Anyway I was done within 5 minutes of that. My opponent was already in the second ring. This game is JUST RANDOM LUCK. I own 600 on Steam, (though I've prob only played a little over 500 of them) and this will likely wind up on the bottom 50 of them.			"

												A great fun game that I have played loads with the bird. I'm giving it a negative review becuase it seems to bundle the updates (which are few and not nearly good enough) with the DLC which means you dont get the vital updates unless you pay for the expansions. I might have that wrong but it is what is seems to suggest in the expansion descriptions. If that's true it is the most disgustingly cynical behavour I have ever se... oh wait it's Games Workshop.

												This is not a computer game. It's a board game on a computer, which is perfectly legitimate.But how does it stack up as a board game? Even there its basic design fails.Don't get me wrong. There are some great things about this board game, especially the replayability and variety of interesting scenarios (for a board game), if you're willing to fork over money for a lot of DLC. However, where the game fundamentally fails in two areas:1) You have very little ability to control where your character goes and what it does, which means you can spend long portions of the game just wondering around, rolling dice and seeing what happens (or doesn't happen, as the case may be). This makes the game very luck based, but worse than that, it becomes pretty tedious, especially when the board becomes filled with cards that effectively don't do anything.2) It's really hard to end the game; partially because the game requires you luck out on a series of dice rolls just to get to the point where the game starts to end; partially because the game doesn't really penalize you at all for trying to power up indefinitely before heading to the end game; and partially because the first character to get to the end of the game gets the dubious honor of being forced to sit there doing nothing but rolling one die to see if maybe they'll do 1 point of damage to the other characters.With some of the above problems fixed, Talisman could become a fun board game/computer game, but as it is, you spend most of your time waiting for your turn in the hope that you'll get to do something interesting.

												This game is well-made, well-designed, but not worth it - even if it's on sale.Along with most board games of this design (such as D&D) the designers only feigned giving their players the ability to develop sound strategies and some sense of control, when in reality, it's a crap shoot - so in that respect - if you don't like actual strategy games this isn't for you.If you like games that crap on you when you're doing well - this is pretty good - the designers did keep the element of ""Life Happens"" that goes along with board games of this type, allowing this much instability without crashing the game is pretty amazing though.In summary, this is NOT a strategy game (as it was listed) - it is a pretty good rogue-like rpg, just not one I'd recommend			"

												Not recommended for single player.Played the demo through several games. Did not play multi-player only played single player.Ran into game breaking problems with the AI in single player:1.) AI is dumb as a rock. All it had to do was move foward to the command square and crush me. It was way overpowered from running around the board collecting loot/kill trophies but instead of attacking it continues to run around like a headless chicken. I sit at the crown square and roll one dice (d6, 1-3 no damage, 4-6 1 damage to all enemy) over and over and over and over....bleh Can't move out and I'm using a melee character so only option was rolling every round. I was actually hoping the AI would crush me to put me out of my missery but quit game and started another. 2.) There was a healer card on the board at the forest during one game. All other AI's dead from attrition by d6 crowning them. The elf can teleport from woods to woods so there I am rolling d6 at the crown square and the elf just keeps warping from woods to woods back and forth healing. That's it. It's a stalemate, unbreakable loop. I can't move, attack, nothing while the elf just teleports from the woods with healer to another woodland square than back again. Well played AI, you have defeated me with boredom.Shut the game off and decided not to purchase after playing demo.			"

												My first gameplay...Picked the Gambler.Rolled low, went to Tavern. Got drunk, lost a turn.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Dragon with 7 strength that rolled a 6. Lost a life.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Craft 5 creature that rolled high. Lost a life.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Pig with 1 strength.OMG.. I'm going to beat it. Pig rolled a 5. Beat me by one point. Lost a life.Lost the game.Beat by bacon. 10/10 Would lose to bacon again.---------------------UPDATE: The game can be fun.. but after finding out that all dice are predetermined at the beginning of the game I will not be recommending this and giving it a thumbs DOWN now. This is a ♥♥♥♥ poor mechanic and development choice for any developer. Why give people the illusion they are rolling a dice for random rolls if they are not truly random when thrown? Those times I'm feeling lucky and end up with those craptastic one's make me feel cheated since I now know they were picked when I started the game. Coding in a SIMPLE RNG routine for each roll is NOT that hard and actually would use less resources than storing up a predetermined roll chart. I know this because I AM a developer. You wanted to prevent people from reloading a game and possibly rolling a better RANDOM roll? **WRONG** The same principle can be used by that same person because they know what the next roll is going to be and they just reload and choose a different course or action. You haven't foiled their attempt to get ahead.			"

												There is a marathon game of talisman with each players having a one of the unquie characters each and I suggest a pull of a barrell draw with first the correct amount of players being enough but no more for each player to have one character of each type. The  method of which each player must outlay the total sum of money to the amount of supposing one dollar per character in total , Roughly 50-60 $ or around abouts , Then each of the 50-60 players approximately the exact amount of the full number of characters that the talisman game and all supplements included for one dollar each , Then the barrell draw for first player who receive no money but first choice of the character selection un-inhibited then the next barell draw is a players that receive a choice of characters , without the previous character chosen by the first player and also receive one dollar back for each number that lessen the characters being chosen by dollar of increment for the players  one after the next until last person to receive the only character left with all but one dollar return so what the last player wagered is the same as every player but they all received the increment according to how they were picked in the cue and their was less choice of character but more initial return for their lessened choice of characters ,So first out of the barrell gets no money back but chooses first from all the characters  where the opposite gets  all money bar one dollar and the last characters left , all leaves a amount that can be from expenditure range from first mentioned to previous mentioned and the in between through the incremental prize pool where once these are ready then a sum of the entire pool minus 10% for handling the the game by administration and the rest of this prize pool going too the winner(s).

												As the Germans would say, ""Na Ja"". Games like this shows the flaws in the Steam review system. I'm going to have to give it a recommendation, simply because it did entertain me for a couple of hours, but however much fun with the family a board game like allows at Christmas, playing on a screen is just boring. For the uninitiated let me explain.For the first couple of hours I was enthralled. Learning all the rules, all the magical cards and their powers, all the items and followers. I thought I found something really deep to get my teeth stuck into. YAY! 4 hours in, I come to the damning and sad realisation. I am playing monopoly, in a D&D setting... but it's still monopoly. Aka, roll a dice over and over until you win or lose. The lack of strategy and the high percentage of luck mean that the hour long games that are needed to complete Talisman feel like little more than flipping a coin over and over to see who gets more tails than the other. So 5/10 from me... but if you see this for a buck and want a few hours novelty, it could be worth it!			"

												A  fun and entertaining game, however the AI is complete and utter, bull. I can not stress this idea enough. I spent half an hour trying to kill the only remaining Swashbuckler in a 1 vs. 5 AI game. He would not simply die. What i mean by this, is that he would honestly get down to 1 life point remaining and then miraculously roll the die into the perfect number to land on a square in which he could heal. It did not also help that he had a card that gave him a minimum of 1 gold at all times. The game finally ended when the AI moved him into the most inner ring where he had no methods of self healing.  Overall it's a great game and lives up to the experiences i've had through the actual irl gameboard. However this game requires a lot of patience. I don't reccommend this game if you don't like waiting forever to end the game. (If the turns are slow, you can fix that in the advaced settings.)			"

												Still far too buggy. AI players can get trapped in descision trees, that loops the game until You quit. And again playing the AI - every turn takes too long - The AI is scripted as a hot-seat player. No need to show all the control options. Still - it IS the good old boardgame, and the conversion is fairly loyal to the original, so. :) "

												The interface is an absolute MESS. It's too easy to cancel a card effect when you think you're just selecting a different target. You can't read the board during other players' turns. You CAN look at their inventory, but when you right-click on someone's card to see its details it doesn't zoom in on that card, but rather opens up a sort of ""card carousel"" that you have to shuffle through to find the card that YOU ALREADY CLICKED ON. Keeping track of everything feels like an unfun version of Papers Please.I get that Talisman is an old board game that is unapologetically ""Ameritrash"", but the fact that the game is so clunky made it that much more important to streamline the digital version.

												Buy the board game, and walk away quickly from this digital debauchery.Each of the cards at least seems to work exactly like the board game, though the interface leaves a ton to be desired. Game may crash after finishing a round, stays in windowed mode at all times, ignores most key presses, no help dialogue, and on and on.The game likes to automate SOME the things that are player choices (like using the Orb of Knowledge) and other times make you click Continue way too many times. The worst part about it is  the inconsistency. There are actually times where your turn is finished for you, even if the timer doesn't run out. Another issue there: there's a mandatory timer! Shortest timer is 30 seconds, longest is 2 min.Overall, this version taught me some things that were a little confusing in the tabletop version, but via teeth-pulling. If you're a hardcore fan, buyer beware.			"

												Talisman: Digital edition is a game I had never heard of before this free weekend.  I immediately liked the game.  This Talisman: DE is a digital Board game, literally.  You play as a variety of classes trying to buff your stats and make it to the center of the board before anyone else gets there.  The game relies heavily on RNG type randomness, Most actions involve dice rolls, and most ""encounters"" rely on the way the deck is ""shuffled"".  Another thing to note, I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but this game is long, I have been in the same game for about 4 hours now. no one has come very close to winning yet. I don't know how long the average game against the ai lasts, but mine are always terribly long.   Overall though I like the gameplay and art a lot. The art reminds me of classic Dungeons and Dragons art, and less grimdark games workshop art. I recommend this to anyone still interested after all that. I dont know  what kind of player will like it most really. If you get it, I hope you have fun!			"

												Spend your time with RNG.Also, crash a lot in multiplayer.A lot.Granted it IS a fairly done rendition of the board game, but lack of added features combined with difficulty of certain things in-game that are easy to do in real life (like just taking a closer look at a particular area) make this less than a stellar pick.  As a recreation of the board game, not the worst.  But as a computer game overall, not good.I don't regret the money I spent on this, but I *really* cannot recommend this unless you're a fan of the board game. If you are a fan of the board game, pick it up; you can typically find a game at least on Europe server (and you can easily see different servers for different areas of the world and switch between them), though you will crash, you *can* rejoin so it's not the end of the world.

												I love a great boardgame but let's face it, these ""cardboard children"" - to borrow a line from RPS - can take a LOT of table real estate to play. Talisman is a massive game in its ""analog form"" and with all of the expansions and four players, the setup is considerable and games can be marathons. But that's all good as boardgamers expect that. That said, Talisman Digital Edition fots nicely on my PC, requires mere minutes at most of setup an most importantly, captures the sheer fun of Talisman, Isn't that why we play games, for fun?A few negative reviews commented on the woeful AI. But, perhaps these folk are playing the prelude titled Talisman: Prologue. I have found the AI to be pretty good. And let's not forget that Talisman is largely a luck based game. All of the so-called tactics I have seen and heard about the game must still bow to the capriciousness of the deity known as RNG; even an AI like Deep Blue cannot predict the vagaries of dice rolls.There are a few issues that linger. One of the most annoying is when an AI opponent draws an event card. Unless you are a speed reader or you know every Talisman card by rote - and with all of the expansions in the physical boardgame there is an insane number of cards, you won't have time to read what the event is. You have to zoom in on the board section where the event is. The same holds true for other non-spell cards. This has been brought up to the devs but as yet there has been no fix for this.The digital version allows you to earn runes which grant advatages in gameplay. [AI also collects these as well]. I like the mechanic as it lends a sort of leveling up feeling.The Dungeon Expansion is next up and I cannot wait for its release! If it is as faithful as the physical version of the game, it's going to be a blast.I think that Talisman Digital Edition is a wonderful introduction to the fun world of tabletop boardgaming and it scratches the itch of tabletop boardgamers who want to play without the crazy setup and rather forced solo variants for the physical game found round the interwebz.This is a STEAL at the price and I would advise buyers to spend a little extra dosh and get The Reaper and Frostmarch expansions as they add considerably to the game.I hope that more boardgames experience a digital conversion. Are you listening Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight?EDIT: 18 November. The Dungeon expansion really ramps this game up considerably. The AI can be quite nasty and that's good as Talisman is a cut throat game. I am hopeful that the devs will release Blood Moon and The Dragon next. These two expansions literally change the game, adding a bit more unpredictability to a game that can punch you in the face already and have you smiling about it.UPDATE January 15: Ya gota love this developer. With the latest update there are two new free characters. These two are not even present in the physical boardgame but were last seen in the 1986(!) version of Talisman. More achievements plus what seems to be a hint that the Highland expansion is next! This is very cool as it is a one of the big corner expansions!!			"

												It’s unfortunate but Talisman is regrettably too feature starved to recommend.And it’s not the expansions being individually sold, as that’s how the tabletop game is presented – it’s the awful connection issues, the inability to save an online game (you can resume the last game played online and those who played may reconnect, but that limits you to one game on the go), the bare minimum of the interface being explained (Counterspell must be queued up – ie; cast before the spell you’d like to prevent – because…because I don’t know) and the like.  Players can’t view the board spaces and the cards on it on another players turn.  And the AI (which can be played with in a multiplayer game to add players to the game) isn’t really competitive.  It doesn’t try to “win” the game.Now, the good is it’s pretty faithful to the boardgame, and when it works and everyone remains connected it’s a pretty good way to scratch that itch. But the constant interruptions just drag the game on. It's a shame. "

												A beautiful, well-designed, well-engineered video game adaptation of an absolutely godawful board game.Talisman is one of those games that people keep playing not on its own merits (it's about as strategic as Crazy Eights and takes HOURS for a game) but because of the nostalgia filter.If you have fond memories of this game from your childhood or early gaming days, then this is an excellent way to play online with added computer opponents. If you don't, then I recommend grabbing a deck of cards and playing War. At least it's over faster.			"

												Its monoply with combat and no free parking.This is a digital version of the board game.  You and your opponets roll a dice pick a direction and move that many spaces then draw an encounter card.  some times its helpful but most of the time it screws you over.  Theres also combat where you roll a dice and what your fighting rolls a dice and you add your strength to the dice.  you lose and you lose a life you win you get to keep them as torphy. get enough trophies and you can up your strenght or craft.  and thats really it. your trying to beef your guy up enough to surive the spaces in the center of the board. its long and boring.  the avrage game runs about an hour per player.  you do get a number of characters to choose from each with there own advantages but some are way better than others.  (the assassin is way OP).  you can unlock runes that give you the option of starting with buffs which can speed future games along but its still the same boring game.on top of that the UI isn't great.  trying to use a card in your inventory is needlessly complicated and spells are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to use.  most of the time you have to queue them a turn ahead of time and then the game auto casts them at the soonest legal moment next turn and there is no way to back out once you've decided to start doing somthing.  there are also things that are suppose to give you the choice of uping  either strength or craft but the game will auto pick which ever stat is highest.  So we have a slow boring game with a dodgey UI.  Pass			"

												Gave up in disgust.  The devs for this game had two jobs:1:  Design a AI for solo play.2:  Design a UI that allows players to play an already existing board game on the PC.The devs failed so spectacularly at #2 that playing a game I loved became an exercise in frustration.  I am not exaggerating when I say that making this game a browser/mobile game would have been an improvement, as the developers would be forced to conform to standard UI conventions.  For example, nstead of Enter to accept prompts, the keybind is Space.. what?  Why can't I exit out of my active window with Escape?  Why does it always send me to the Main Menu?  And of course, I can't change the keybinds!  Borderless Windowed Mode?  Lol.  Run in higher resolution?  HAHAHAHA.When I say that the devs had two jobs, I mean it - all art assets are lifted from the board game in 2D format.  The Help function directs players to their site with a wonky search function.  Nothing like seeing format code while browsing the site with Firefox.  Real quality, that.  All of this makes enduring the awful UI especially galling.  I'm done with this game.			"

												I recommend the digital implementation of this game over the board game, but I do not recommend Talisman over other digital board games.Odds are good that, if you're looking at buying the Digital Edition, you know what Talisman is all about. As a board game, I don't think it is very good. But, I do think that this digital implementation makes it playable. So, if you know you want to play Talisman, this is the way to go. If you're thinking about getting this because it's a much cheaper way to explore the board game, this is the way to go.If you've stumbled across this game and you're hoping for a really enjoyable experience and you don't know what you're getting into, you probably will not enjoy this game.

												People who like Talisman the board game will like this digital recreation. It's spot on. If you've never played talisman, it's a mediocre board game that often drags near the end of the game, with punishing mechanics that can wipe hours of play at the drop of a hat. I'd get the expansions and use the alternate endings to reduce the long end game.That said, I've played this game and the physical version several times and keep coming back. Something about watching your character grow and overcoming challenges is addicting despite the dated board game mechanics.			"

Killing other players is so hard it's almost  a pointless feature to have in the game.Reading some forums I've seen people mention that you can configurate the rules to make the game more playable, but their initial setup/the way they want you to play is worse than any other paid game I've ever tried.The game has also been a bit buggy (crashing and unable to find some friends when making a game.)

I ended up cranking the AI speed to 11 just to get it over with as fast as possible, I ended up not caring or paying attention to what the other players were doing.			"

												Talisman the board game! From what I've seen, this is basically 99.9% of the original boxed board game in digital format. My only gripe with it is the character cards from the baord game are not all included in the purchase, game includes a msall hadfull of characters and then you need to purchase the rest. Otherwise, considering it's less than 1/3 of the price of the board game, it's not a bad deal.			"

												For a digital version of this classic board game, I am really liking its ease and playability. It might still take as long as what I remember for the analog table top.

												My family owns too many explansions to call this game playable in one sitting-but I can say I am very familiar with it. It's a delightful board game to frustrate and encourage slight meadering. This digital version on the other, is awful-the graphics don't even make up for the annoying controls. If you want to play this game and lack the group to do so, save your money here and just travel down to your local comic book shop on a gaming night-playing with total stangers and risking a possible over abundance of B.O. is still better than taking a whack at this piece of garbage.

Granted, it can be a big tricky to get into if you haven't played it before - the game lacks (as far as I know) a tutorial - because you are thrown straight into the action when you first play.Then again, it's not rocket sciense so you will quickly get the hang of it after a few bitter sweet defeats against the super-fast AI or your gloatuing friends. Just follow the options and, ofc, read the cards carefully and you will be takin' that Talisman home soon!twitch.tv/beergrim "

												If you want a games night with a few of your friends this is the game for you. If you are looking for a solo experience this game is probably not for you.To get the most out of it i would recommend changing the game from focusing on the Crown of Command, to killing the Lord of Darkness, which will require some DLC, but it is worth it. When the end game is about the Crown of Command it can get very tedious to sit through an entire game in my opinion.Never trust the mountain goat.			"

												As a little boy I was always curious about the Talisman boardgame. Now it came to Steam and on a sale I took my chances. Pros: + Great art & figures just like the boardgame.+ Long game time (depends how you look at it)+ Various characters to choose from, each with their own special skill(s)+ Some interessing items, followers & spells to get or sites to visitCons:- To much depends on the lucky dice rolls- Because of the dice rolls, the game can drag on and on, even if you have the Staff of Command- Long game time (depends how you look at it)- Imbalances on character front. A thief has 100% chance to Steal from you, even if you are the most powerful character on the board. It would be more interessing and more fair that the victim is able to save and hurt the thief when caught. Same for a sorceress with Beguile.- Did I already say it depends to much on the lucky dice rolls?Personally, I enjoyed it first but later on the myriad of (un)lucky dice rolls, character imbalances & to long game times diminished my enjoyment rapidly. I would rather spend my time on other games where I have much more controle at the games progress - and I have to blame my own stupidity - than on the sheer luck of a dice roll.If they do some tweaking to give your chosen character a fairer chance/saving roll against some odds, I might take another look at it and change my mind about it . . .

												Although I never played the board game, I can easily attest to the fact that this game brings the worst out in yourself and your friends, which in itself leads to hilarious and memorable moments. That, coupled with the random nature of the game, is in my opinion its greatest strength, as it allows everybody to compete on an even level. The randomness might get frustrating in single player though and I clearly recommend that you band together and buy the four pack, so you have somebody to play with, because the social aspect of the game is half the experience.On the downside, the technical aspect of multiplayer matches does have some hiccups. I have experienced sync issues and game crashes a couple of times, which is aggravating when you are about to wrap up a game session, which easily runs in at about two hours. This shouldn’t keep you from buying the game if you have some friends around to play it with though.			"

												Almost identcal to playing the board game with a few major exceptions. the most important being speed. A real life Talisman game can usually take up 6hrs. With the turn speed for the PC ramped up to 10 I finished my first game in 3hrs.  This is not a problem as playing well in games causes you to level up unlocking new stuff. Quite what I'm not yet sure as it will take more than one game to level up. The other major difference is price. A full set of Talisman with the expnasion will srt you back nearly £100 for the physical version.I do love my physichal set and this does lack the atmosphere of having some like minded mates round for a good boardgames session. But as an introduction to the game or as a way of killing the hours over the summer while your mates are on holiday this is highly recomended. Also if you have friends who play but dont live locally it is also possible to set up an online game over the web.			"

												Oh talisman how fickle you can be. Sometimes you roll the dice and everything falls perfectly your way.....til your turned into a toad.....or you roll a one with death....... I won't lie I've rage quite many a times but the importance of this game is its local multiplayer. I love being able to bust this game out with all of my nerd friends and race for the crown. I good board game all and all. But this is game is far from perfect, first off you have to buy some of the charaters individual for about two bucks a piece which I find to be annoying as I want to own the whole game!!! But that aside its a great game with plenty of interesting exspansion packs and a solid starter game. Perfect for company and family a like.			"

												This is a report, more so then a review.I really love this game, but, I think some people cheat on it.For example, I just finished a game that looked like someone had a dice roll hack.Since almost the start of the game All I had to do was land on one character contolled by an internet user.I had a spell that would of immeiatley cost them two lives. Thus I would've won.No matter what I rolled i never landed on them.They never rolled one bad die throughout the game. Not one!In my knowledge of probbability, thats near impossible.Its certanly immprobable.Some people are gonna say I'm a sore loser.Quite the contrary.I lost several games in a row and enjoyed them all. Cuz it seemed random dice rolls werer been made.But this last game seemed like a hack.I was determined to beat the hacker, but of course, thats impossible.Anyway, the game is great if you like board games. And if there is no cheaters.I recommend buy this if you are into fantasy games.I would love if they brought out hero quest the board game. Now that I would definitely buy "

												An enjoyable version of the well-known game, the only real issue with Talisman is how much the game can drag due to the reliance of dice rolls to do anything. House rules really help this problem, but please remember that this is a board game in digital form. If this type of game is not for you, you will not find much to like in Talisman.			"

												This game will make you completely distrust computer dice rolls. Also, change the setting to allow swapping out quests on the Warlock's Cave spot (it is disabled by default), otherwise you can get the quest to damage a character, and all the other characters are on the inner row, or at the Crown of Command, and you get to waste a half hour waiting for the dice rolls to kill you. That being said, it was a fun game (albeit a bit long) but they give you the options to minimize some of the pain, and to at least give yourselves a quicker death than the long death the dice promise you.

												After taking 2 hours to learn the game with a couple playthroughs, we set up for a final game of the night. Rolling Thief, a few drinks in, I decide to fully immerse myself for this playthrough and give it an honest try. The adventure began, and McStickyfingers was unleashed upon the world. Turn one, McStickyfingers immediately heads to town and run into the Black Market. What a perfect way to get a head start, he thought, and jumps at the opportunity to pay 1 gold for a full suit of plate mail. Being the most obnoxious and unsubtle Thief in the land, McSticky is caught and hauled off to Jail to reflect on his life choices. Seven turns in, the world around him is passing by, with another filthy bandit behind bars. A wanted poster for anti-thievery is picked up by a travelling Pirate, passing through town. Ironically, the Pirate ceases his own mischief and pledges to ensure McSticky remains off the streets. ""There is only room for one bandit, here!"" - He thought. McStickyfingers is finally released from Jail on the eighth turn. Has he changed? Did he learn his lesson? You may ask him. In turn he would respond to you with a question, ""Are you kidding?"" Upon release, McStickyfingers immediately runs into the Pirate and steals the wanted poster of himself right out of Pirate's hands. The world is surely doomed, now.Many turns go by, which means many items are stolen from anyone and anything. A collection of swords is made within' McStickyfingers' inventory - one from every player leaving each of them unarmed. It isn't long before Death himself is unanimously tasked to put a stop to the McStickyfinger shenanigans. Fumbling around with his shiny swords, McSticky is caught from behind and beheaded with one stroke of the scythe. Was this the end? No. More like ...are you kidding? At the end of Mr. Grim's action, McStickyfingers is revived and immediately re-gathers his belongings before anyone else can act. It seems not even Death can stop the reign of McStickyfingers' mischief. It isn't long before deals are made from the other adventurers to our beloved Thief to spare their inventory from his sticky fingers. Gold is thrown in his direction from every which way.Having never given up on his quest, wanted poster or not, the Pirate is behind the scenes with an anti-theft bag to stash his belongings. Arming to the teeth, a rivalry is born. To be continued...10/10 would go on epic thieving heists again.			"

												I played the Talisman board game with my old gaming group and we would have hours of fun taking us into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. This game brings all that fun back, but with the option to save and quit when the sun starts peeking through the windows and you need to hide away for a few hours.However, it does feel like there are still some bugs to work out, such as abilities that can be activated 'at will' don't seem to be available to use when the 'at will' need arises. This may be a bug or I am missing the prompts to give me that opportunity. The only other downside I can see is you are not physically sitting at the table with your friends as you play to toss around the smack talk and make deals on the fly to take a problematic character down.All in all, this is a fantastically fun game to play and all of the expansions are more than worth it for the added content and additional characters. You would be amazed to see a Courtesan beating the heck out of a Dread Knight when things go in your favor.Definitely worth your time and money and everything goes on sale with some frequency. The standalone characters are also worth it if you grab them on sale. Otherwise you'll have plenty of others to play with un til they do.			"

												One of the few digital board games that isn't total garbage.  Talisman is loads of fun and I often compare it to an entire campaign of DnD condensed with PvP to those who have not played it.  My only complaint is that games can take a LONG time to complete sometimes, like 6+ hours... and the multiplayer save system doesn't always work as it should.  A game I would happily add to my sizable physical board game collection.			"

												Do you have friends to play table top games with, but you don't have place to game/you live far away from each other? Fear no more! Thanks to digitalizing board games, you can play Talisman online! Want to play with family/friends in home but you hate all of the cards everywhere/you're just to lazy to even think about cleaning it up later? Just start that little beast up and have fun! But putting the fun review away, the game is great, it's the same as the board game, instead on computers screen.Only one thing i have to mention that i DON't like, when you play with friends coach style not online, it's really hard to fast swap the mouse from one another to cast spell mid someones move/turn, the time limit for that is just ridiculous (or I am just blind and I don't know how to change it, then please, tell me how)And the AI, it's dumb as hell, don't even play with AI (even for the first time, just get a friend or sister or someone from the street and play!)I highly recommend it!

We would stockpile gold, objects, and stats to rediculous levels, and then go stomping around the Middle and Inner circles.An Assassin with the Runesword is just as much fun to play here as in the cardboard version. ;)EDIT: Well ... drat. I left this review based on single-player play. As indicated everywhere, online play is a disaster. I lost connection to a client in the same room as my computer; I can only imagine the doom that trying to play this over the PSTN would cause.5/5: Single-player gameplay. 2/5: Online play.

												This is a good and solid game.Lots of replay value, interesting character traits make for well varied characters.There are quit a few items and encounters in the game as well, every game has a unique feel to it.Unfortunately there are also some problems.Some characters seem overpowered while others seem quite weak.The object of the game is to get to the crown of command, cast the command spell, and do 1 damage to each player if you roll a 4 or higher.This works great in theory.In practice however, you will find yourself sitting on the crowd of command, casting the spell over and over, while the rest of the players have plenty of time to heal and keep about their business.Even though you are a lot stronger than all the others this process can take a very long time.Leaving you sitting there turn after turn doing nothing but casting that spell until finally you get lucky and the others can not heal fast enough.This can take a very... very long time.You could kill the players individually, but they seem to respawn after a few turns. So the chances of winning the game that way seem pretty slim.All in all i would say this is a good game and worth buying.But it needs some finetuning to make it a great game.			"

												I like it. I played the board game at a friend's house I loved it. The electronic version is the exact same game, which is great. The expansion packs are not worth buying, in my opinion; however, many people who play online already own the expansion packs so, you get them for that game only, so there isnt an ""advantage"" per say for buying them. The game is VERY slow, if you don't set the AI speed to 10. For online play, make sure you have a youtube video running in the background, or something because people online take a while to make their move. If you set the AI speed to ten, 8/10.			"

												This game WAS good. Then they added round limits. Max round of 100 rounds, really. This isn't a what if, I had a game that went 307 rounds, 5 hours long. That was the best game i've played, and now me and my friends can't do that anymore. Add an option for unlimited rounds, No one wants this weak Sh*t.			"

												I played the Talisman board game with my old gaming group and we would have hours of fun taking us into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. This game brings all that fun back, but with the option to save and quit when the sun starts peeking through the windows and you need to hide away for a few hours.However, it does feel like there are still some bugs to work out, such as abilities that can be activated 'at will' don't seem to be available to use when the 'at will' need arises. This may be a bug or I am missing the prompts to give me that opportunity. The only other downside I can see is you are not physically sitting at the table with your friends as you play to toss around the smack talk and make deals on the fly to take a problematic character down.All in all, this is a fantastically fun game to play and all of the expansions are more than worth it for the added content and additional characters. You would be amazed to see a Courtesan beating the heck out of a Dread Knight when things go in your favor.Definitely worth your time and money and everything goes on sale with some frequency. The standalone characters are also worth it if you grab them on sale. Otherwise you'll have plenty of others to play with un til they do.			"

												One of the few digital board games that isn't total garbage.  Talisman is loads of fun and I often compare it to an entire campaign of DnD condensed with PvP to those who have not played it.  My only complaint is that games can take a LONG time to complete sometimes, like 6+ hours... and the multiplayer save system doesn't always work as it should.  A game I would happily add to my sizable physical board game collection.			"

												If you like the boardgame, then this is pretty much an exact, digital replica of the Talisman experience.-It will do all your book-keeping for you, and list all of the options you have on any given turn, thus expediting the time it takes to go through a turn.-It has local hot-seat co-op so you can still have friends over for boardgame nightIf you don't like the Talsiman boardgame, then this will do nothing to make you like the game.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												Talisman is a great game gone slightly sour in the digital edition by the many technecalities that were wrong, mostly have to do with spells and when they are available to cast. Many of the spells that can be cast on ANY character cannot be cast on yourself, as well as not being to cast path of destiny on a character with the false grail, the spell should be able to be cast but the character simply should not gain the quest. it is also ruined by buggy AI as in AI who will keep 3 talimans while discarding belts of strength and such, and AI that will not put anything in a bag of carrying.

												I used to play the old boardgame in the early 90s, fond memories. I wondered if the digital edition would even be true to the original. I tried it and was not disappointed! We even play it with my son on the living room TV, the excitement passed to the next generation. We can save our game if interrupted for dinner or if it gets too late and continue at another time, which is a bonus compared to the board game.I recommend it to any fans of the board game, you will feel right at home. If this is your first contact with Talisman, you have to see past the average graphics and lack of fancy animations and use your imagination to immerse yourself in the game. If you can do that, you will enjoy hours of solo, hotseat or online fun!			"

												Great game. I did not play the original board game. I recommend the expansions also becuase it is a lot of fun trying out new characters and you can blow through the standard ones pretty quickly.I would wait for this game to be on sale. In the most recent Winter Sale, this game had an insane price, a total steal. I bought the 4 pack and all the expansions for like 10-15 bucks and because of reaching out for the expansions I have enjoyed way more hours than you get with the base game.			"

												Do you have friends to play table top games with, but you don't have place to game/you live far away from each other? Fear no more! Thanks to digitalizing board games, you can play Talisman online! Want to play with family/friends in home but you hate all of the cards everywhere/you're just to lazy to even think about cleaning it up later? Just start that little beast up and have fun! But putting the fun review away, the game is great, it's the same as the board game, instead on computers screen.Only one thing i have to mention that i DON't like, when you play with friends coach style not online, it's really hard to fast swap the mouse from one another to cast spell mid someones move/turn, the time limit for that is just ridiculous (or I am just blind and I don't know how to change it, then please, tell me how)And the AI, it's dumb as hell, don't even play with AI (even for the first time, just get a friend or sister or someone from the street and play!)I highly recommend it!

												What a fantastic translation of the board game!I used to play this over the course of a day with a friend.

												This is a good and solid game.Lots of replay value, interesting character traits make for well varied characters.There are quit a few items and encounters in the game as well, every game has a unique feel to it.Unfortunately there are also some problems.Some characters seem overpowered while others seem quite weak.The object of the game is to get to the crown of command, cast the command spell, and do 1 damage to each player if you roll a 4 or higher.This works great in theory.In practice however, you will find yourself sitting on the crowd of command, casting the spell over and over, while the rest of the players have plenty of time to heal and keep about their business.Even though you are a lot stronger than all the others this process can take a very long time.Leaving you sitting there turn after turn doing nothing but casting that spell until finally you get lucky and the others can not heal fast enough.This can take a very... very long time.You could kill the players individually, but they seem to respawn after a few turns. So the chances of winning the game that way seem pretty slim.All in all i would say this is a good game and worth buying.But it needs some finetuning to make it a great game.			"

												I like it. I played the board game at a friend's house I loved it. The electronic version is the exact same game, which is great. The expansion packs are not worth buying, in my opinion; however, many people who play online already own the expansion packs so, you get them for that game only, so there isnt an ""advantage"" per say for buying them. The game is VERY slow, if you don't set the AI speed to 10. For online play, make sure you have a youtube video running in the background, or something because people online take a while to make their move. If you set the AI speed to ten, 8/10.			"

												Pay no mind to the Metacritic score, those critics reviewed the game when it first came out.  At that time it had a huge number of bugs and other problems, particularly with multiplayer, but those have been entirely rectified.  This is a fantastic adaptation of a great board game.  It takes a long time to play, especially with a lot of players; less time than the actual board game though since you don't have to bother with setting it up or putting it away.  The game itself is quite a lot of fun for any RPG and board game lover.  It's a great value too, especially if you pick it up on sale (and it goes on sale fairly frequently).  The only real downside is that the AI is still terrible, so you're pretty much limited to playing with friends for a worthwhile experience.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a fun time killer if you have nothing to do for a hour or so.  It's convenient if you just want to relax, play a quick single player game and move onto to other things you need to do that afternoon.  There's plemty of expansions and alot of characters to choose from that keeps it interesting.On the downside, however, the game does have its flaws.    Spells not working when casted/que'd. Picking targets for spells sometimes doesn't work properly or is confusing.     Some cards don't work occasionally like, ""Use this card before another players turn"" where you'll try to use it but nothing happens and you just get a ""dismiss"" option only.   And my personal complaint is the computer player almost always rolls a ""6""  and you'll get ten ""1's"" in a row which can be frustrating.Overall, it's still a fun game to play if you look past the flaws.   Catch it on sale.   Highly recommend getting the expansions (Dungeon, Highlands, etc) for it as well as it adds another level to the game.			"

												I'm not a fan of Games Workshop.  In fact, I don't like Games Workshop at all.  But this review is not about the company, but about this game.  I played Talisman when it first came out.  When I found out it was on Steam, I was intrigued.  When I picked it up with the Humble Bundle, I was interested in giving it a shot.I enjoy the game.  I enjoy running around the board, gathering power, and making a push for the crown, leaving everyone in my dust.  Yes, the game begins fairly random, but there is a strategy to the game, and if you know what you're doing, the game becomes less and less random as you shape your character into the champion (or horror) you want it to be.Some simple tactics:  1)  Get to the Warlock and try to get the Clockwork Owl as quickly as you can.  This turns your die rolls for movement into something you can control (since you can move your die roll or less after this).  2)  Get to the warlock and get the bag of holding.  Having 8 concealable slots to carry your most precious gear in is a good thing.  3)  Go to the warlock and get the orb of prophesy (or be lucky and draw the magic item which does similar).  This allows you to control your encounters.  Along the way you should be getting magic items or followers to pad out your abilities.  But once you have those three items (or heck, even just the first), you're able to control your fate fairly well, and can make the push to get to the middle of the board and win.The introduction of runestones is an interesting twist, as is having fate points.  Those both help to deter getting hosed early in the game, and I think they're a workable addition.  I plan on picking up the expansions.I give the Digital Edition of Talisman 4/5.			"

Buying this game was a terrible mistake, because I've had a hard time doing anything else but play it since. Obviously, whether you'll enjoy it depends on how into board games with RPG elements you are (obviousy, they're pretty addictive to me), but as a recreation of the board game it's pretty sweet. The interface could be a little better and the AI could be better, but in the several games I played I didn't notice any noteworthy problems other than I wish the AI were a little more competitive. This is definitely much better played with human players.			"

												Talisman takes its place as my number two favorite board game style video game of all time. The first place spot goes to Dokapon Kingdom but that is another thing in of its self.Talisman's gameplay is solid and, up until the addition of the house rules setting, the end game could get very boring and repetitive. The game allows you to play with many different playstyles and allows unique experiences every time you play. You always need to be aware of what other players are doing or you may just end up finding them on their way to the end while you are still making your way there.I do not care for the idea behind all of the new characters being their own idividual DLC, it seems to be a little over the top for me, especially with how little each new character actually adds to the game. Other than that, the biggest issue I have had with Talisman is the multiplayer and how terrible it can be to play when somebody has a slow connection, or when the game randomly kicks you or when somebody alt tabs and it freezes up the entire match.

												The game does suffer from some minor issues, those being, a clunky UI, clunky and at times counter intuitive controls, some bugs. but i do feel that this is a great digital version of the board game, i love the board game but rarely can get a group together to play it, so this is here to fill the gap! best part i dont need to finish in one sitting it saves my AI game for me. there are some things i wish it had and that was more house rules support, the main one being i like to occasionally add up to 6 players depending on the night, 4 can be restricting, but 6 is fair and doesnt do that much to affect the game, more then that would be too many, 6 players can get pretty cut throat, especially with the reaper and no respawns in effect. i am very happy i waited for the sale to pick this up as there was much more of the DLC packs avaliable to grab whilst cheap then when i first looked at this when in beta. if you like the board game then you will like this.

												Well if you remember the board game being long and predictable nothings changed here. However this is a really good interpretation that cuts out all the fiddly-ness. Theres more DLC's than there are expansions to the board game, and the board game had waay too many expansions. I wouldve liked to see more included in the base game here. Talisman was never my favorite game but this is no doubt one of the better board game interpretations on the market. 6/10			"

												An excellent board game from ancient times.  It requires patience and cunning.  You gain strength or craft to become strong enough to fight your way to the crown of command.  If you like a meaty 2 hour plus length of game, then this is for you.  The game can be sped up with various options.  It is enhanced with several expansions.  The full table top board is huge with many new classes and adventure cards.  A classic with years of cred.  I would recommend this game to my friends as well as total strangers.   I can't wait to try online version!			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a faithful update to the old school Games-Workshop Talisman board game.  The game is actually based on a newer iteration by Fantasy Flight games however much of the original feel is still there.  The digital implementation of the game features an intuitive interface, crisp artwork, and balance improvements that don’t allow a Chaos Warrior to run rampant across your game board and on top of competing players.  The only real downside is that the AI is not very good and doesn’t try to win the game –however the game plays well in multiplayer and is really a blast.  If you want to play an old school early 1990’s board game online, love games workshop, or just want to turn your buddies into a toad and curb stomp them . . . this game is for you!			"

												I personally like this game and I loved the board game version of it and this is a great version of it other than one major problem. The RNG or random number generator, I was just recently playing and this has happened other times but this one stuck out majorly. The AI I was playing with along with nearly every single creature kept rolling 6's every time. I would go and fight something I have equal craft to and roll a 4, it rolled a 6. I also used my lucky charm from the frostmarch expansion pack that I had to get a 6 against a frost drale. It rolled a 6, the AI that I am playing with is the leprechaun and he has gotten now 7 6's in a row. I believe that the rng might need to be fixed slightly as it is hugely unrealistic as that has an insanely low probability of happening, especially as I have not gotten a 6 this entire time.			"

												If you've played the talisman BG before, than you know exactly what you're getting.   Its a very faithful translation, although the AI isn't that bright.  If you don't know anything about Talisman, its basically a cross between D&D and Monopoly.  If you like RPG board games, then give this a shot.

												DISREGARD THE METACRITIC SCORE...IT'S OBSOLETEI got this game, season pass and the Shaman character. After my first full hour, I was hooked. I didn’t know or understand all the nuances or anything, as even at the time of this review, I’m still a novice (only 22.5 hours played and at level 3). But I can’t begin to express to you my enjoyment of this game. I pick a random character and play. No game ever plays the same way twice and no one knows what they’re in for once they reach the pinnacle. The developers have really made a clean and engaging game here and continue to do so. I hate the word ‘fun’, but the fun factor in this game is through the roof. It doesn’t even resemble a ‘card’ game once you get started. Final verdict: 8:10			"

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												Love this game. Love it! I'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG. The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO! Since I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in. So the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.This is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?! Still love the game!!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

												Faithfully recreates the classic board game. Games are dictated by a certain level of rng, like most board games that utilize card draws and dice rolls, but they also contain enough free will choices to have an adequate amount of strategy.The downside is; it is too faithfull to the board game. Matches can take up to an hour or more to complete and are rather boring if no one chats during the game. The game is best played among friends or with people willing to chat and get into the intrigue of attacking each other, forming alliances, and general ♥♥♥♥ talking each others bad luck.There are some bugs but the devs are very responsive to the community and activley work on swatting the annoying crashes or disconnects.

												Ah, Talisman... what a great walk down memory lane.  Picked it up for a free play weekend and I was transported back about twenty years to my big brother's kitchen table: it's 2 am, our group has been playing for hours, only a few of us with a shot at the center card (we played with the extension set that replaced the Crown of Command with one of six options, including the dreaded black void). Finally, someone made a play at the end game...!!!This Edition brought that back, for me. I hope for you, too.			"

												Faithful recreation of a classic board game.  TERRIBLE UI  As much as I love talisman and like having a digital version, something MUST be done about the god awful UI.  Casting spells makes magic users a pita to play, can't look around the boardto inspect thigns unless it's your turn, and unforgiving timelimits make this a hard sell.  I def. enjoy it but can only barely reccomend it.  Saving is a straight up nightmare in multiplayer conditions.  That said updates seem frequent and the devs. do seem to be listening to the torrent of complaints from loyal fans who are putting up with the current conditions.   Great with friends but more of a hassle than a joy to play.  It basically jsut makes me want to break out my physical copy instead.  6/10			"

												I can understand why this game might get rated low. Talisman is sort of fundamentally ""unfun,"" especially when played without face to face or voicechat. The multiplayer is significantly buggy, and the autosave system doesn't always work. There are fewer technical problems every patch, though, and there's still a game to be played here. As an adaptation of Talisman, it's perfect: It does what Talisman wants to do. I wouldn't recommend going into it with anyone you can't comfortably have a loosely-contextualized conversation for hours, but it seems absurd to criticize an adaptation of a board game for being like that board game.

												Really enjoying this game so far. Seems quite faithful to what I remember when I used to play the board game. The usual tutorial steps got me straight back into the swing of things and the AI put up enough of a challenge to hold my attention for a few hours. After an initial play through, I'll be glad to play with a few friends would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a trip down memory lane or something a bit different. There's a depth here that makes the game difficult to master and with the inclusion of multiplayer, each human opponent are going to make this an excellently devious game. "

I was a bit rusty, but still thoroughly enjoyed myself playing single player against the AI.  It also allows you to play multiplayer with friends as a board game was meant to be played.  Needless to say I'll be scheduling a game with some friends soon.  I highly recommend this, especially if you ever played the board game.			"

												Having grown up on Talisman 2nd Edition, I have grown to appreciate and enjoy 4th Edition. It fixes a lot of issues that were present in 2nd. Starting characters with high craft are no longer at such a steep disadvantage to those of high strength. The inclusion of the fate mechanic can help ever so much with catastrophic dice rolls and, for myself, makes being evil desirable.Digital edition is based off 4th Edition rules and faithfully done so. This game is, as of writing this, still a work in progress, so there are bugs to work out. However, the development team is continuously releasing patches to fix problems and content updates, to include new expansions and characters for those who have bought them.For those who enjoy Talisman, I recommend getting the season pass, which unlocks all content for T:DE in perpetuity. As a fan, it's nice to be able to play without the bothersome setup and clean up (or other players, often).			"

												A real fun game for you and three buds!!!  You have characters to choose from and they all have special abilities that effect game play. The base game has plenty to choose from so don't worry. Each player begins at a character specific start square on the outer ring on the board. The board is made of three rings of space each with location names on them, some of these locations also have special abilities that effect your pawn. You have 2 sums that are used in combat, strength and craft, then life, fate and gold all of which can be leveled up or chipped away at to reduce them lower that starting amounts.You roll a random generated die and move to the tile options you come up with, than you draw an adventure card that may be a monster, loot, item or event to challenge youor the other players. The object is to level up collecting items boosting your stats and fighting the other players, It plays just like a board game- one player after another takeing turns but as the game goes on the difficulty and struggle increases. You want to get to the center of the board crossing through two ""rings"" of board tiles to get to the tower where you take control and cast a spell that slowly kills off the other players to win. After a game is finnished you claim XP and level up to the next level where you can get bonuses to the pawn you pick for the next game.WARNING!! The games seem to take a long time to play through, I've played many- finnished two and both of those took longer than 3 hours to play. Lots of fun! Very replayable, lots of laughs with your friends.If you like tabletop games, GAMES WORKSHOP games you should enjoy this one, I got it for 5 bucks on sale but can say it is worth the full price. The game also has lots of DLC in the form of new player characters- ($1.99) each and several boards or expansions... ($5.99)) and up.-Mr. GrAnD			"

												I like tabletop games, but they are hard to get where I live and really expensive. So after seeing what this looks like purchasing was a no-brainer. This game have maximum of what you can adapt from real, touchable tabletop game into a digitalized version. It almost feel like a real one, especially if you gather your friends in one room (but online play is nice, too). It have even this bitter-sweet rage inducing ""dice-effect"". So, if you looking not just for an adaptation, but a ""simulation"" of tabletop experience, then I personally can't recommend this game enough. Worth every cent.			"

												Great Game, so long as your playing with other people.My only three gripes about it would be the AI opponents, Runes, and the online connectivity.The AI is not the greatest. They do some incredibly stupid things, things not even new players would conceivably do. And often with certain characters (Ogre, Necromancer, Ghoul, Minstril to name a few) will not even use the characters abilities at any point in the match. Runes ruin the experience if you use them, and make certain characters blatantly overpowered compared to others. Most people do not use them anyway, so it's not that big an issue, but i just don't see any benefit for them existing.And for online, connections can be a bit shakey at certain times of day, but so far the dev's have been working hard at relieving that issue, and its shown (for me anyway).There are a few other bugs here and there, but they are also being dealth with all the time, and usually don't interfere with a match.A friend of mine has said Hot-Seat Multiplayer also works quite well, so playing with real friends just like you would on the physical version is a plus. If you like board or tabletop games, or decent games to play with friends, pick up Talisman: Digital Edition. The season pass is also worthwhile considering all of the content that is ahead. Overall its one of the better games i've played in the past year or two.			"

Half your time is spent watching dice roll and player markers glide around the board, and having to click 4-5 times for no reason (""Continue"", ""Cast Command Spell"", ""Roll Dice"", ""End Turn"") just to cast the Command Spell in the endgame is painful.  It's also impossible to know exactly what happened each turn without opening and scrolling down the events log.  A few tweaks in these areas might lure me back.			"

												My first game lasted almost 3 hours, but it worths it!I'm a quick disinterested guy when a game doesn't appeal me, but eh. Pro:+Rules easy to understand: You have to be the last one standing on the iron throne in the middle (ok there's no throne). For that, you must weaken your opponents during the early and mid game, and strenghen yourself killing monsters or training yourself with event cards. Eventhough you can win with luck only, if a dice roll doesn't please you, you can reroll it using one ""destiny point"" which are limited depending on the character your choose. Because yeah, each characters have their own special ability. +This boarding game is also a RPG, and it's well mixed! +SFX are ok, I didn't have to mute the background music.+Addictive: Because you never know what will happen, you won't stop playing-Con:-The basic board is quite small, eventhough it's easier that way, when I ended my first game I wanted more! -DLC's ... I like the game, but I wonder why I have to pay to have additional content and heroes.-The UI is boring. I wish I could only use my keyboard in the game But... I'm so happy to win over an assassin who was 4x stronger than me, a sorceress who annoyed me the whole time with her spells and a gambler, which is also the hero I chose, who was far worse than me because he didn't know how and when he should have used his destiny points to win.

Also like that only one person in an online game needs the dlc for everyone to enjoy it. Has a few problems like the errors and crashes I mentioned and could use some simple features like canceling a spell you didn't mean to cast or being able to get the experience from an online game if you die without having to leave the game open for sometimes hours until it's over, but overall if you like fantasy type boardgames I'd recommend it.

												I can't judge the game against the old board game as I have never played it.  That being said, the game has a great variety characters, gear and encounters to make your e-board game experience feel like and adventure.On the down side, the game can seem to drag on due to alot of unlucky rolls.  It can get so bad, that die rolls don't feel so random.  If this was Yahtzee, I could get bonus yahtzees with 1 rolls all day long on the Crown of Command.  I am guessing they have nerfed some of the game mechanics so players might be more inclined to buy dlc instead of grinding it out.  Perhaps I am being cynical, but I enjoyed the base game at a discounted price, so I will give it a thumbs up.  If I had paid 79.99 for the complete game, I would definately not recommend it.   There is no groundbreaking, earth-shattering, gameplay (in the base game, nor the dlc) that justifies that price.			"

												DISREGARD THE METACRITIC SCORE...IT'S OBSOLETEI got this game, season pass and the Shaman character. After my first full hour, I was hooked. I didn’t know or understand all the nuances or anything, as even at the time of this review, I’m still a novice (only 22.5 hours played and at level 3). But I can’t begin to express to you my enjoyment of this game. I pick a random character and play. No game ever plays the same way twice and no one knows what they’re in for once they reach the pinnacle. The developers have really made a clean and engaging game here and continue to do so. I hate the word ‘fun’, but the fun factor in this game is through the roof. It doesn’t even resemble a ‘card’ game once you get started. Final verdict: 8:10			"

												If you're a fan of boardgames then this is great. It has a lot of different characters and offers quite a lot of gameplay variety, especially if you have the expansion packs. Best to buy the season pass on sale.Gameplay wise, you pick a character, travel around the map battling monsters and completing quests in order to increase your character's strength or craft (magic) score. Eventually, you'll be able to move into the inner region to reach the crown of command, where, you might complete the generic victory condition or a special victory condition (if you have this feature turned on).It's fun, especially with friends. It does take awhile to play though, and all the extra content might seem a bit jarring. 7/10			"

												4 hours in to a game, one turn away from winning, and you get pulled out of the middle and robbed. 3 hours in to a game and your friend turns you in to a frog and kills you. 2 hours in and you're on your 4th character because nothing will go right. You get Talisman'd a lot in this game... why would anyone want to play this? Cause its a heck of a lot of fun. You spend the game raising your strength and craft, the two stats you use to fight battles. Talisman is one big journey to level your character up enough to go challenge whatever is in the middle of the board. Sometimes you might have to fight a boss to win the game, other times you might have to steal everyone's items, or you might even vote to see if the persons worthy. It's the mix of endings, cards, and characters that make the game interesting.I highly recommend playing with actual people, while the computer has decent decision making skills it is far from perfect.

Additionally there are some problems with crashing every once in a while.If the developers are listening please implement a way to skip through dice rolls in which there is no way for there is no way to win or lose. For example, if my roll of one dice +5, resulted in an 10, then the dice roll of the other person is just a dice roll +2 then there is no need for that dice roll to be rolled...Bottom line, good emulation of game, but suffers from some serious slowness and crashing. Only get if you want to enjoy some Talisman nostalgia.			"

												Great game with friends. If you have 3 or more you will have the best experience you can get with this game. The spell casting and card plays can sometimes be wonky, but if you have a good group of friends this sometimes adds to the humor of situations. If you dont like RNG stay away, but if you like to see epic unfair drama play out buy it. You'll have a blast.			"

												A real fun game for you and three buds!!!  You have characters to choose from and they all have special abilities that effect game play. The base game has plenty to choose from so don't worry. Each player begins at a character specific start square on the outer ring on the board. The board is made of three rings of space each with location names on them, some of these locations also have special abilities that effect your pawn. You have 2 sums that are used in combat, strength and craft, then life, fate and gold all of which can be leveled up or chipped away at to reduce them lower that starting amounts.You roll a random generated die and move to the tile options you come up with, than you draw an adventure card that may be a monster, loot, item or event to challenge youor the other players. The object is to level up collecting items boosting your stats and fighting the other players, It plays just like a board game- one player after another takeing turns but as the game goes on the difficulty and struggle increases. You want to get to the center of the board crossing through two ""rings"" of board tiles to get to the tower where you take control and cast a spell that slowly kills off the other players to win. After a game is finnished you claim XP and level up to the next level where you can get bonuses to the pawn you pick for the next game.WARNING!! The games seem to take a long time to play through, I've played many- finnished two and both of those took longer than 3 hours to play. Lots of fun! Very replayable, lots of laughs with your friends.If you like tabletop games, GAMES WORKSHOP games you should enjoy this one, I got it for 5 bucks on sale but can say it is worth the full price. The game also has lots of DLC in the form of new player characters- ($1.99) each and several boards or expansions... ($5.99)) and up.-Mr. GrAnD			"

												I like tabletop games, but they are hard to get where I live and really expensive. So after seeing what this looks like purchasing was a no-brainer. This game have maximum of what you can adapt from real, touchable tabletop game into a digitalized version. It almost feel like a real one, especially if you gather your friends in one room (but online play is nice, too). It have even this bitter-sweet rage inducing ""dice-effect"". So, if you looking not just for an adaptation, but a ""simulation"" of tabletop experience, then I personally can't recommend this game enough. Worth every cent.			"

												This is a great game, I never heard of Talisman until i saw my friends playing the steam version, and I now play it almost once a week if not more with them. I would reccommend this game to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends, but if youre looking for good gameplay on your own... unless you really just want some nostalgia This game isn't for you.Pros---------------Good time waster with friends-nostalgic for you long time Talisman players-interesting interactions-you can laugh at the horrible AICons---------------Horribly buggy at times... many of which are game breaking (for example followers or spells that let you choose what your reroll will be will often reroll your second dice if you have 2 to choose from, or if you visit a shop and dont have enough money for an item the game just doesnt know what to do and breaks)-purely based on RNG very few times is decision making or skill going to win you the game because 90% of this game is pure luck unless you get some crazy powerful items from some of the expansions (cough cough clockwork owl) or if you get characters that can see the top of the deck like sage or spy.-kinda already stated as a pro but the AI is horrible, some might see that as a good thing because they can give you good items for bad ones or engage in battles they clearly cant win or dont use some items because they forget to... but otherwise its kinda stupid-DLC for the game can be pretty pricey, if you buy the game and all expansions (not including the standalone characters) currently available it will go for roughly $45 or you can make it $75 and buy the season pass which includes all current and future DLC except one that was sold for charity.TL;DR: The game is great to hang out with friends especially if you cant get together im person easily (or at all) But if you want everything its gonna be quite the money drop, the game is also horribly buggy and seems to lack some quality of life features like cancel buttons for most actions (shopping or spell casting for example) but if you can get past the bugs and horrible AI, then its a good time with your friends guarenteed!

												This is an Excellent game, I searched this one out after hearing about the game, that originally was played as a table top now recreated as a digital board game. If you played D&D True RPG games from the 60s 70s and 80s then you know about how to use your imagination. If you have an imagination this is a dream to play! This game design wants you to think to learn about its world and believe.. Another great aspect of Talisman Digital is that through game play with AI (computer) the players can learn the rules of the game, this game is like Jumanji the movie that starred Robin Williams, it you imagine your in the fields with a thieif and he is trying to steal your gold or take a life and if your lucky an item from your inventory, it might just feel more real too you than you think.

												Highly Addictive and deceivingly simple.

												A great way to kill up to six hours! A faithful representation of the classic board game, even better if you've actually played the real game (tiny cards hard to read). The automation of moves etc in the Digital Edition allows you to sit back and enjoy the role-play aspect, or focus more on long term strategy, than you would be able to managing lots of tiny pieces and 5 friends! This is a great rainy day couch game, invite a few friends, set up the snacks lay some waste with the Black Witch! (my personal favorite)9/10 Would kill friends for fun and bragging rights again.

												I'm sure that this is a really good game 73% of players have said so plus, I would love to pick up some of the DLC that are on sale this week, I just wish I could play it. Unfortunately, it will only run for about 3- 5 turns then it freezes not the whole PC just the game and I have to ctrl-alt-del out. I am well in excess of the recommended PC specs plus, have tried all the available fixes on the forums here and elsewhere and asked many questions.I reported the problem to Nomad Games however, as there is no crash report generated when it freezes they have very little to work on except my PC specs and my list of tried but failed fixes.Apparently I have logged 2.4 hours play, this is NOT actual play but running the program just to try out various ""fixes"" .I have tried every fix I can find on line plus, turning off background process or varying game play combinations that I can think of that could be causing the problem, add my research time to find an answer and I must have spent at least 5 hours on this game without actually playing it.Perhaps with the soon expected patch it will finally work for me.I'm very disappointed so far, especially as I will miss out on the current DLC sale, the only consolation for me is that I bought the base game during a previous sale.Why a thumbs up? Well, I can't really not recommend or criticize it because I haven't played it yet plus, the freezing problem seems to be a very rare occurrence for the majority and it would appear that most of those who had the problem found on line answers that unfortunately did not work for me.I will revise this review if I ever get this game to run.UPDATEI have no idea what has changed but, the game has been running without problems for over an hour. I'm still somewhat confused over parts of the gameplay although the tutorial has helped. I guess i'll just have to read the game manual again as well.It looks like this is going to be a fun game based on my experience so far with an understanding of gameplay around say 75% I would give the game at least 7 out of 10 andf I have the feeling that after more playing that score will increase.I originally bought this as a precursor to buying the board game if I enjoyed it and I have a strong feeling that I will be buying the board game as well.

												Very happy to have this game on pc.  I still own 2 versions of the original board game which I have played countless times.  As such I can confirm the game rules are superbly accurate to the original, making this game a must for all Talisman fans.On occasion, it can be difficult to use an ability or specific card during your turn (within the time limit given) as the game will not remind or encourage you to check your inventory lists, so you need to pay attention.This is a rare occurance, however, dependant on character chosen rather than any particular oversight due to the game design.  There are plenty of new characters to purchase as well as three of the original six expansion packs already released.  Dice roll for me is depressingly unlucky (just as it always was for my board games) so i find the gameplay quite difficult.  Animations are colourful and the addition of runestones and customisable rules keeps the game interesting. You can even save your progress on multiple games and come back to them when you want.I highly recommend this game already and will love it even more when the Timescape expansion is added.			"

												Game start was fun. Midgame gets repetitive since you just run around and farm items and stats. End game boring as hell. You just need to get stats to enter final level. I expexted in the end some epic encounters or boss fight. Nope. Just random dice rolls all the way. If you are unlucky you just got teleported far away and need to run all across the map again. So fun. In the end you just roll dice 50/50 to make everyone lose 1 health per round. I killed that way 4 my opponents. But the last one had combination that allowed him to get 1 gold at turn start and get healed 1 health for 1 gold. So he just ignored my ULTIMATE COMMAND SPELL and kept playing. And what was the whole point for me to tryhard and rush in center of the map?...To hell this unbalanced random trash game.			"

												Nice game if you like games like snakes and ladders but with warrior and wizzard pieces instead of generic pawn pieces. There is very little to no strategy in this game, it is almost ENTIRELY down to dice rolls. You roll a dice and move here, roll another dice to see what happens, pick up an 'adventure' card which could be an item or enemy, then roll another dice to determine the outcome. It is about as 'strategic' as playing roulette or lottery. I'm not having a go at this game, it is an amusing way to pass time, but if you read that there is a strategy to winning this game it is not entirely correct.. unless by strategy you mean staying in one region of the board until you have enough items to progress to the next then so be it. I guess to some extent that would be considered a strategy. I have played this game for a couple of hours and it was amusing, but it was amusing in the way that snakes and ladders would be if you had beautifully crafted pieces available instead of generic pawn pieces and instead of there being only snakes there were dragons and goblins you had to deal with and instead of automatically sliding backwards down a snake you got to take a dice roll which can be modified by items you pick up to detemine what happens to you. I definately dont see myself investing a lot of time into this game but it is worth the investment if you are looking for an amusing 'filler in type of a game' that can easily pass an hour or so of your time when nothing else seems to tickle your fancy.

												Amazing game!I got the game in July 2014 on a sweat -50% season pass. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE! The amount of content added to this game is epic. I am a huge fan of randomness and replay ability and this game is perfect! No two games are alike and you have a lot of options to customize the speed and difficulty of the game. You might not be a fan of dice games because too much luck is involved, honestly so am I! I rarely play dice games, but I feel that talisman has the perfect combination of luck-to-strategy ratio. I like to compare it to real life. In real life, no matter how cautious you are, no matter how safe your daily routine is, on a particularly unlucky day... you can die... at the prime of your life you can get hit by a car... you can go to the hospital for routine surgery and die on the table... Talisman is like that! One minute you are the terror of the board, banishing demons and slaying dragons with the flick of your wand or tap of your sword, the next minute you are a cursed toad, powerless and vulnerable. The other night I lost a game after a series of 3 unlucky dice rolls, I was in the lead on stats, two turns away from winning the game, next turn I was dead. The odds of me dyeing there were 0.4%. I wasn't even mad, that was amazing! Good things can happen as well. One game I was the underdog, a lowly merchant, unskilled in combat, unwise in magic. After gathering a small pose consisting of a gnome, a guide and a faery; and armed with only a Talisman and a four leaf clover. I managed to pick the lock on the portal of power, brave the forgotten depths of the lost mines, escape a vampire's domain (RIP followers), then defeat four lesser demons in combat, cross the valley of fire and finally arrive at the crown of command. There, I obtained the power to command death as my servant and send him to kill my enemies one by one! All this was achieved with beginner level stats. I had no chance to win by overtaking my enemies the safe way so I risked it all, and this time I won.I have no problem finding games online to play with strangers. It's more fun to play with friends. I regularly buy copies of Talisman when it's on sale (usually 1-2 euro for the base game) and gift them. The good thing is that my friends don't need the expansions to play with me, because in a multiplayer game if one person has all the expansions then the game is played with all of them. In my experience games with 3 players are the best. With 4 or more the game tends to last longer. Two player games are also fine.The rules of the game are easy on beginners. Even if it's a complex game, the rules come at you one at a time. You don't need to know what all the cards in the game do, because you will only draw one or two cards a turn usually and then just read those cards and see what happens! I remember when I first played Talisman, I had no idea what was happening... and that was great! I'm a dwarf in a fantasy world. I fight monsters, find treasure, and buy drinks at the tavern. My opponent is a troll who found a unicorn. The unicorn is smarter than he is...I could say a lot more about this game, it is simply amazing and lots of fun. It's well worth full price, if you are undecided, buy the base game on sale and play it online. You will not regret it!			"

												Talisman is wonderful. A tabletop board game brought to us digitally. HOWEVER,the game isn't just about strategy. The luck of the roll has it's play here. But no more so than it would any other board game like Monopoly. Some people don't like this.I find myself entertained for hours at a time. Playing with friends either online or as a local game with a couple AI's is just as fun. All we do is pass the mouse back and forth! It's addicting, and I LOVE IT.10/10 "

												I do enjoy this game, both the actual board game and this port.Let me just say I wanted to say I recommend it, yet also don't.Unfortunately I feel like the game (when played against bots) is geared to the bots,rolls seem to always be low for me, I've counted maybe five rolls of 6 in all games I've played,and the bots always seem to get high rolls with low rolls against them, without fail. When I use fate to re-roll, I almost always just get the same roll. It's sad.So yeah, there are negatives, part of me sees it as a super hard challenge.But I'd like to think the random generators weren't working secretly against me... having a hard time doign that.I recommend this game if you liked the board game and it's many versions,however if you are looking to play with bots a lot, I feel you may get frustrated a lot,and end up ragequitting while chugging some random bottle of booze you started drinking from when you lost 4 subsequent rolls at the start of the game (and still haven't won a roll yet).Mixed review? Yeah, but I still like the game. And since I got it as a gift from a friend,I feel even more inclined to not look too harshly on the mistakes.Take a chance, roll the die, and see if you buy Talisman.			"

												While I do love the Talisman board game I cannot recommend this video game adaptation. Visuals are nice and it represents the board game well in that regard. But the game will just stop working properly very, very often. It will crash, it will desync, it will refuse to take input ... You name a bug, its there. Private games should be private. I had a random guy enter my private game while we were trying to work out a bug and take over the game when our host left to attempt the said bug resolution.  It needs a lot of polish to be a truly good experience. Right now I have a bad taste in my mouth.  And the micro DLC's don't help the cause of recommending the game much.EDIT: After a while my issues with the game have been fix, so now I do recommend it.			"

												Faithful and well done adaptation of the 80's GDW classic board game (perfidious ailbon not the GDW of En Garde!, Traveler, and a published game a week for a decade over here. Two Steve Jacksons too). The Dungeon as DLC is good to see after the first two odder expansion choices from a later period from the City, Dungeon, Timewarp model of the earlier expansions and some of the characters are being reliesed individualy so the bottom line could gig ya good if not careful it seems but overall it plays like the good old days stupid/blessed luck and all.

												An excellent computer recreation of one of the best fantasy themed board games ever made. Supporting both local and online multiplayer it's fun for the whole family. As you earn achivments by playing games your profile ""levels up"" and you start to unlock various bonuses or ""house rules"". With the number of player characters avalible it's almost a guarantee that no two games will ever be the same.Buy it at the current or future sale price, it's worth the money.			"

												Classic game brought to computer life.  Considering the table game is over $40, this is a bargain!For those of you who try to compare this game to something like Hearthstone, all I can say is ""Don't"" because that is apples to oranges. All the strategy comes from what the cards give you, how well the dice treats you and how badly it treats your fellow players. In Hearthstone, unless you are playing with a starter deck, the strategy is the deck building and praying you get the cards you need out in time. Not unlike MtG. But with Talisman, you only have your class' benefits/drawbacks and MAYBE your choice of Runestones if you opted for that DLC. After that, you just have to watch the game unfold and as another reviewer put it, prepare for some serious ""risk management"". Also, this game has no time limit unless you set one.  Unless you set it up for sudden death (120 turns or less), all I can say is this party can go all night, so have 4 six-packs and a couple bottles of wine to enjoy with this game. I played one game, 3 players and 1 AI and each player, including the AI, each had a major setback and the game took 3 hours to conclude. Might want to order out when playing this game. ALSO, for new players, turn off the timer so you can learn the cards. Had that issue when entering the Warlocks area, he offers 6 or so quests but the timer can time out while you are still reading the second card. This isn't chess. Its on by default, so check setting and turn it off because when it times out, you skip your turn.With that said, the more real players, the better. The AI isn't always perfect and when an AI tries to use some spells or magic items, it can sometimes throw the game for a loop. I have only had this game actually crash TWICE in nearly 2 years I've owned it and only required a reboot from that once. Loops happen a little more often in which case you have to alt-tab out to desktop and shut down the program manually with Task Manager. But it is still worth the occassional headache.			"

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

												Love this game. Love it! I'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG. The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO! Since I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in. So the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.This is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?! Still love the game!!			"
