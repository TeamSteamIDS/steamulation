Early Access Review
								Video Review:


YouTube™ Video: Magicite Review (Early Access Preview) 

			Views: 6,009		

			A video game review of the Early Access game, Magicite by SmashGames. Indie DB: http://www.indiedb.com/games/magicite Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/268750/		

Magicite is a 2d side scrolling, survival, crafting game.  The game includes a basic character editor that allows you to customize the look of your character as well assigning stats.  The game includes basic stats, 2 extra traits, and a race/class that assigns extra bonuses like starting items and shop discounts.The gameplay is simple, intuitive and fun.  It consists of moving, jumping, double jumping, attacking, and using items.  I had a lot of fun just jumping around, exploring, and attacking everything. While it’s simple to control, Magicite is still a challenge.  Death is permanent, so when you die, you start over again.  All of the biomes were neat to look at and felt unique.  The monsters of each biome all moved differently and didn’t feel repetitive.The crafting system, resource collection, and item options are easy and work well but I felt it was a little too similar to other games in the genre.  In future releases I hope the developers differentiate themselves more in this category.Aside from crafting and fighting, the player earns gold which can buy new items and experience which leads to level ups and new skills.If you like a challenging scroller and can get past some similarities to other games, Magicite is really fun and I enjoyed my time with it.

												Pros:+ Fun, combat is more about moving correctly than having godly equipment most of the time, specially early on.+ Permadeath (on singleplayer)+ Cute graphics + Challenging + Plenty of unlockables with different effectsCons:- Lacks any real game options customization other than resolution.- A lot of things are unexplained and not very intuitive at first, such as altars (I thought I was buying a very expensive armor honestly) and town NPC crafting. Some items could stand to sell for more, specially potions and crafted items. (Everything seems to sell for the same or about the same price)- Map randomization is bland, all maps have the same boring, horizontal design with different colors/backgrounds/trees. Could use more vertical variance along with different stage shaping.- Inventory management sucks since your inventory always feels one row too short, specially when opening treasure- Crafting system is clunky, time-consuming, and could use improvements (can't combine 2 sticks on the same square, this is made worse by the poor inventory space) Recipes for the more advanced items would also help.- Need to unlock ANY sort of customization, could add colors to characters?- Netplay is laggy for the player not hosting if your distance isn't short- Can revive teammate indefinitely in netplay with 1hp as long as one of you is alive- Game pretty much abandoned for the development of a game that looks the same, a copypasteI really want to like this game but it feels like an early access at the moment. Hopefully newer patches will make the game more fun and polished, but as it is right now it doesn't feel worth a full price.Edit: I have been unbanned after a discussion with the developer, take that as you will!

Early Access Review
								This game is crazy F%@# hard at first until I picked up a couple of tricks, but once you get the hang of the game, it is easy as pie. Seriously! Just remember these couple of tips that WILL save your♥♥♥♥♥ I know they have mine.1.) Don't pick fights you can't win, especially when you just started in District one. Farm the mobs that don't fight back and proceed to the next area.2.) Get a Wooden Pick Axe and Sword as fast as possible. Then, get a bow as fast as possible. (You have to kill Spiders in the Forest District, or you have to get lucky with the cuttable grass on the ground to get the cowebs.)3.) Sometimes you just have to abandon that ore/chest that is surrounded by monsters. :/4.) Once you get a bow, proceed to♥♥♥♥♥♥everything. You will win most fights if you stay at a range.			"

												If you like dying, this game is for you. 2D side scrolling action takes you through various terrains and monster on a quest to defeat the scourge! At least, I think it's the scourge. With various difficulties depending on how you play; the game challenges your ability to jump, double jump, aim, and not break things when the wasps come for you.You can decide which starting ""class"" you would like to be, giving you various bonuses depending on your play style. Your stats can be adjusted with equipment, so changing up what you are doing as you are playing is entirely possible. Start out with hopes of being a wizard but find out you aren't up to snuff? Collect DEX gear and start shooting things. Find your aim is a bit off? Ditch the leather and go full out ATK for sword on fluffy, on claws, on blue glowing orbs of death fun. For an even greater challenge, bring a friend. Mobs get harder and dying just gets more fun! Bring a whole lot of patience. You'll need it. The game is fun and has significant replay-ability, especially if you like to collect all items available. I hope they eventually add-in trading cards or achievements. Despite some of the levels being insanely difficult *cough*crater*cough* as they work on balance and tweaks, the game provides enjoyable entertainment that will while away your hours, leaving you wondering what black hole you fell into.

												Once in a while, you come across a game that has a concept that, while not unique, implements all the qualities and features you'd come to expect from a great multiplayer game.Positive: The game is fast, furious, and a hell of a lot of fun. The concepts are simple, and, once you figure them out, you can easily transition between roles with ease. The design is cutesy, simple, and implements the roguelike feel without that hatred of dying a cheap death. Very rarely have I had a feeling that I wasn't in control of my character and died to a cheap trick.Negative:The game gives off the feeling of an indie title. While this can be a good feeling, when you've gone through and played several times, you can feel that there is nothing new to offer you, aside from a new playthrough with a different set of hurdles.Overall:The game is good, but I will say it is not for everyone. If you like Terraria, Minecraft, and enjoy a good roguelike game, Magicite is a game you'll definitely be happy you paid $10 for.			"

Early Access Review
								Despite this game being Early Access, I would 100% recommend it already. I've only given this game about an hour of play with two friends but already I am a little bit in love with it. The game combines elements from Platformers, RPG's and roguelikes to create a fantastic little indie game.The gameplay is rather simply to fight, craft and quest your way through various randomly generated dungeons. Unlike most platformers this game isn't a rush and hack'n'slash. You have to craft your own weapons, potions and food in order to survive which sounds simple but can get challenging quickly. Playing with more than one person we quickly found out if we didn't share our resources we would die within minutes. Also, the friendly-fire meant instead of just spamming the attack button we actually had to watch what we were doing/who we were attacking. The crafting list already has a fair few items on it, I am sure you can find the list somewhere but I rather enjoyed guessing what would work with what, which gave the game a nice survival feel.The game is hard though. If you're playing with others you will need a way to communicate, and being in Early Access in-game chat isn't implemented yet.And because this game is still Early Access there ARE bugs, but none that are gamebreaking (that I have encountered), it is fully playable, and enjoyable. So far, I can't find much to fault about this game at all. The developer has been consistent with his work on the game but has also been consistent with his updates on Kickstarter too (19 since November 19th) which for me is always a good sign for games in Early Access. For £6.99 you can't go wrong with a game this fun.			"

												This is probably the most fun I've had in an early access game so far to date. As of the time of this writing, the game is still in Early Access, but there is a seemingly endless land for you to (attempt) to fight through as far as you possibly can, all the while gathering raw materials and crafting them (simple 1 & 1 combinations; think Resident Evil) into tools, weapons, armor, potions and more.This is a roguelike, so if you get frustrated by dying a lot (and you will) and losing all of your progress in the blink of an eye (which will happen), this game may not be for you. Those who do enjoy roguelikes need no further explanation :) When starting, you create your character and have many unlockable hats, races and their variants to choose from. Don't worry, the hats actually do give your character unique abilities :P On top of this, the game also makes use of a ""trait system"" that gives each player two randomized traits (which you can re-roll) that do things like raise ATK, but lower DEF, cut down trees faster, brew stronger potions, increase DEX, etc.If you make it to the end of an area, you will see 3 doors of varying color (which indicate the area type), each taking you to the next area's village where you can sell treasure, buy weapons, smelt ores, refine pelts and hides into leather for armor, and generally terrorize the locals and their chickens. Once you're geared up, you'll leave the village and repeat the process of trying to get to the end once again, only with harder enemies ;)Enough about the baseline details though...let's talk about actual gameplay! Generally speaking, you have the movement skills of a friggin' ninja; you can dash side to side, double jump, and even dash midair (several times if you have the stamina)! Mastering movement is one of the first keys to survival in Magicite; if you can't be hit, then you can't be killed (as easily). Other than your ninja-like abilities, every 5th level (I believe is the increment...don't quote me) you can choose a new skill from 3 paths to unlock and use to further aide in your adventure. These can be anything from a giant sword that shoots underneath you and propels you into the air (allowing for a triple jump, or even a quadruple jump if you have a special item), a fireball that you can shoot arrows at to make flaming arrows, berserker rage, to a protective aura that reduces all damage taken for everyone in your party.At risk of spoiling more potential fun and shenanigans in figuring the various aspects of the game out just by playing (like me and my friends did), I'm going to end here. Pick up the game! Seriously, this is one of the most fun Early Access games out there, you will not be disappointed!			"

												This game is a bit like someone took risk of rain and smashed it together with terraria in the simplest way possible. it's fun, but not as good as either of the games it feels like it smashed together, mostly because the rewards for playing are difficult to get in a way that makes continuously playing really disheartening. however, if i could unlock them all at once i would probably also lose interest really quickly. all in all, i think it's definitely worth spending your money on... when it's on sale.

Warning: The following was composed while the game was released in Early Access Build 0.7.2. [2014/02/13]Please understand that the game is still in development and when the game is updated the information in this review may be obsolete. When the development surpasses Early Access Build 0.7.2 you may be able to use this review to compare how the game has changed over development. IntroductionRogue-like games are normally games which offer some form of level randomization or procedural generator and permanent death; your character dies and you must either start over or keep going until everything is lost. These types of games are normally unforgiving. With Magicite this concept is taken to its very sadistic core.Side-scrolling games are normally progressed by moving on the screen to the right or left to reach the end of the stage or meet some type of goal. Goals like ‘saving a princess’ from the big bad, but she happens to be in another castle. These games normally follow some type of gimmick, like the stage progresses on its own, timed, forcing you to advance.Also with a Rogue-like game the graphics are not normally the main focus, thus if you are turned off by anything below 3D graphics you should consider something else.Please note, this is /not/ a sandbox construction game due to just having crafting, you currently do not 'build' anything. If that is what your looking for, you are truely in the wrong castle.This will be a breakdown of concept and features, atmosphere and stability.Concept / FeaturesThis is a 2D Side scrolling Rouge-like with item crafting.Right now the game has currency which is dropped when monsters are killed along with experience points. Currency can be used to buy random items from towns, which are in between levels. You create a character and can keep re-rolling stats with two perks before starting, after that you thrust into generated levels with death. Personally I kept generating until I has a perk which allows me to open chests without keys and kept raiding the dungeon stage due to high chest generation.It has crafting related to inventory management; making weapons, armor and items. Beyond that this is not a sandbox and you do not build anything. Towns appear in between levels. If you stay on a level to long, well you’re going meet death.The interface is rather clean and easy to use after you have it down, however it can be somewhat frustrating at the start due to it just throws the player into the mix without hints.Many functions are not implemented currently, like a crafting recipe log. However I’m sure they soon will be.When you reach level five, ten and 15 you are able to pick a level up spell/benefit which is accessed by using 1, 2 and 3 respectively from the keyboard.In order to make armors you are going to need to collect ore and smelt it while in a town. You will need three of the same ingots to make the armor.Multiplayer is a blast, however you must watch what you do and share resources otherwise, being doomed to fail comes to mind.AtmosphereQuick and to the point, much is not needed beyond the objective.The art is decent and fits. The music is a mixed bag, the tracks are rather decent however I found myself wanted something more fasted paced. For some odd reason I pictured more of a old style arcade type feel for music, something like those action based games like funky fighter. StabilityThere are in game bugs related to items and crafting.Overall the game had very slight hangs, they where not consistent, not a major problem. It also /did not/ crash on older machines I tested with. I tried on older desktop machines and laptops under windows Vista and Windows 7; it was decent and was not a complete resource hog allowing me to multitask by pausing with ESC. I also did not run into any critical errors which cased instability and the program failed to run. While I’m unable to speak for everyone and their systems it seems to be overall pretty solid. Most of the time games in alpha or beta still are unstable while this game seems to be nicely polished in respect to stability in the listed windows environments. Multiplayer was decent, there is much talk about friendly fire, currently this feature feels like it hits home, and with the fact that this game is sadistic. While I do not think that Magicite should 'force' players to have to deal spacing of teammates and friendly fire, I feel that it should be and on and off switch for the host. While friendly damage is on there should be higher rewards or benefits beyond being up to the challenge.ConclusionIf you like Rogue-like games, I would currently recommend this. If you do not like Rogue-likes I would not recommend this, since this game is truly sadistic at its core. If you happen to be the supreme overlord of your minions, *ahem* friends and are willing to subjugate them to wallow in punishment and death, the more the merrier.Gameplay suggestions:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/268750/discussions/0/540733523379927400/Edit History2015/12/09: Formating.

												This game had lots of potential. I really wanted to like it, but it just needs polish. My biggest issue is no controller support. I bought the game over a year ago because the Dev's claimed controller support was comming soon. Guess what, its still not here. My other issue is the dev's apparent attitude, I dont post often, but I do search forums, and have read other reviews. When doing so I noticed something concerning, most topics with critism were quickly cut short, for example with the controller issue I mentioned, there would be posts telling people to stop talking about it, it was 'in the works, but as I said, this was almost a year ago. Also the game is repetitive and just doesnt play like its fully developed. Inventory lacking, item explainations are poor, and promised feature as still absent.  Normally I am pretty patient with a small dev, but based on the dev's behaviour [and] lackluster performance(removed ""and bad attitude"") I [personally] would just avoid this.Update: Developer offered a kind response (Roguelands Discussion board), and offered a refund. I havent actually received a refund at this point, but it was offered, possibly my response was not clear. I had not interacted with the Dev directly prior to this: http://steamcommunity.com/app/364420/discussions/0/496880503067160862/ . I updated the final sentence of my review on 11/11/15			"

												You run around and kill stuff and improve your character.Stats system is simple but interesting.Combat has a lot of variety. You can choose how you want to fight – with a sword (there are fast and slow ones), a bow, or magic staffs (all 3 of them complement each other so nicely).Enemies are all very different and original.Each type of environment has its gimmicks or special obstacles, different enemies and bosses. You can even avoid environments you don't like most of the time.The crafting system is something I haven't seen before; feels nice. Inventory management is quite a challenge. And it's the main reason why you can't be a jack of all trades.Death is permanent, and this game really is quite hard; to the point where you may think you'll never beat it. But the amount you can improve is immense. And a good choice of unlockable items that give you different and, again, very original, traits, can make a big impact. But first you gotta unlock them, which requires doing additional challenges. Needless to say, they also add a lot to the gameplay.This game doesn't go stale even after 30 hours.Graphics look cool. Music is nice. (Feels similar to Terraria)And there is multiplayer!Gameplay also reminded me of Rogue Legacy.★★★★★★★★★☆			"

												Magicite has a great concept and decent execution, however it is held back by bad game design choices which limit it's replaybility and fun.The game is a rogue-lite and utilizes semi-randomly created  platform levels, the point of each level is to get to the end of the stage. There's 20 stages in each run and between each run there's a mini-hub town that serves as a resting point. Prior to each run you create a character by picking a race, items and pets once unlocked. Each stage has 1 passive animal and about 2-3 enemy types, which gets quite repetitive very quickly.My main issues with the game are:- No save method in between runs, once you start you are locked in and games usually take me 45-55 minutes to complete. You have to commit to this game, as quitting halfway through will result in nothing. - Characters, hats, and pets (each with their own distinct bonuses) are randomly unlocked (ie. 20% to unlock a new character once game is complete).  This forces multiple artificial playthroughs in the hopes of an unlock, and since you're playing with the same characters with limited choices on similar levels versus the same enemies, it's not fun- Combat is quite bland, there's 4 or so weapon types (1 handed swords, two handed swords, staffs, and a bow) and any differences are purely cosmetic/stat wise. You choose 3 magic skills when leveling up and most of them are not fun or useful.- The game handles healing in an odd way, forcing the player to eat food every couple of minutes for a 50% chance to heal 1 HP point or take a rare and hard to find healing potion (for 2 HP or 5 HP if you farm two potions). Most enemies will do about 4-8 damage per hit.- There is basic item crafting, yet the crafting menu is atrocious and with a severely limited storage space you'll find yourself running out of room quite quickly- The game has a weird love affair with random number generators- upon leveling you MAY or MAY NOT gain any stat points and again - not a fun game design choice.Overall, the game is limited by it's love for RNG and poor game design choices. There's very little depth to the game and an artificial barrier of difficulty as you hope to get a lucky roll when leveling or unlocking new items. Nothing carries over between saves or playthroughs, aside from characters/hats/pets which may or may never unlock after multiple hours.Would not recommend unless it was wicked on sale.			"

												This game was a lot of fun and had great potential, but seems to be in its final form now and just doesn't have the depth and polish the game deserves.  If the developers had worked out bug fixes and added just a few more features (i.e. it would be great to be able to save a run after a level so you're not committed to doing it all in one sitting) after release I would recommend this highly, but in its current state I would only buy it on sale.Pros:-fun mix between platformer and roguelike-reasonable difficulty (neither too easy nor too hard)-quite nice looking-the class system is pretty interesting and, despite being simple, adds variety and increases replayabilityCons:-feels like an early access game despite being finished w.r.t. occasional bugs, content feeling skimpy/unpolished-no saving mid-run so if you didn't budget enough time to finish up on a run that goes long, you've wasted your timeWorth $10?  IMO no.  Worth <$5 on steam sale?  Absolutely.			"

												Whilst I have never played this game solo, I can say beyond any shadow of doubt that it is well worth it for the multiplayer. Everything is balanced perfectly.When somebody mines an ore node, an ore drops for every player. If you have one dedicated miner/crafter then everybody becomes relatively kitted out in a reasonable amount of time. Yes, RNGesus can come in and declare you unworthy of the correct ore nodes, and when it happens it sucks, but it's rare enough that it doesn't ruin anything.The controls are tight, very tight. When you glub up, you know it's because YOU glubbed up. The only thing I wish is that I could rebind things a little more. Like having the dash be a double-tap instead of hitting E and Q. It feels strange to me personally, maybe it works for you though. You will die, and you will die a lot. You'll keep coming back though. Grab a few friends and let the good times roll.			"

												At first, you will hate this game, so challenging, so unforgiving. You will play it about a half hour and then say: why the hell did I buy this game? Then, about a week later, you will come back just to see if it really was that bad. You will start playing it, start to discover the game mechanics and the crafting system. Then you will continue playing it and eventually get addicted to it. Then your character will die. And you'll probably rage quit. But you'll come back the next day.I mean, this game is awesome. For $10, you get a really nice product. You can even play multiplayer (wich I didn't try yet). I just love the way the game drops you inside the first biome and tells you nothing, almost laughing at you, it's kind of funny, but it makes discovering crafting recipes so much rewarding. The game is also very colorful, each biome having it's own main color. The perma-death system could look very frustrating at first (and it really is), but it adds a little bit more challenge to the game, wich pleases me, because it makes the game even more rewarding. The combat system is also really well done, because it takes skills not to get brutally murdered by every single creature you encounter. I can't wait for the next updates to add even more nice stuff to the game!I would give this game a solid 9/10If you like platformers, you should definetly buy this game!			"

												I like this game, but it has a ton of glaring issues. It's not what it should be nor is it what it wants to be, yet.This is a rogue-lite in its lightest form, providing hardly any differentiation between runs. The differences will be in the traits you obtain at levels 5/10/15, the items you get from chests (which are varied in usefulness, but are mostly similar and few) and of course mob drops/mob spawns. The layouts for each district follow a very strict pattern, involving massive sections next to each other as opposed to the standard 1x1 platform-style stage randomization. Each non-town district would blend into each other if it weren't for the differing biomes, which serve as alternate mob spawn pools for easier access to certain resources often at the cost of an increased difficulty.Towns in this game currently serve very little purpose outside of a few obvious fantasy tropes. You have the Blacksmith, the Tailor and the Leatherworker, the latter two having static and unchanging names. You also have two shopkeepers which offer normally pointless and randomized items from the shop pool. Tools and weapons being sold are typically out of your price range when you'd need them, and entirely skippable once you have the gold for them. There are sometimes potions on sale, as well as herbs and hilts for treeless runs (I'll mention it later) but other than those the item pool for the shops aren't fantastic. Finally, there's the Hoarder that allows you to sell your items, which you'd think would be absolutely useful... But the sell price for each and every item you'll get ranges from 1-3 gold depending on said item. Weapons don't offer large sell prices, nor do armors. The Hoarder is a very cheap man.The main issue with shops (again) is that they're normally pointless as far as tools and weapons go. With enough experience and proper door selection, you'll almost ALWAYS find the resources you need to make shops irrelevant. Heck, normally the only thing I'm missing at the end of each run are rings (which fight against a rather large and annoying chest drop pool) and rarely one piece of armor. I can go ahead and find a friend to wear a miner's cap to completely resolve the ore deficiency we may have.Finally, Altars sometimes also spawn in towns, and are the only non-constant you'll find outside of giant chickens and normal chickens. (They're not worth talking about, food and potion drops if you're curious.) Altars are currently money sinks for the runs that offer their bounties long before the shops care to stock them, which is normally what happens as stated before. Altars cost 500 gold, which is a steep price for what they offer: A chance at a minimal stat buff, debuff or nothing at all. Rarely you'll earn a return to full health which is by far the best result most of the time, but the game is very stingy with both the spawn rate and good results of the Altars. By the time you have the money to trigger an Altar, you may not even find one... And sometimes they'll spawn when there's clearly no way you could have the money already without chopping every tree down. Normally, it's not worth the min-maxing.... Min-maxing... Forgot about that. This game's mechanics are often lacking fluidity. Min-maxing is something that seems to be discouraged, due to the Scourge Invasion mechanic (a mechanic Spelunky players will find familiar, but irrelevant) and the rewards often not being worth the effort. Most of your min-maxing is for gold, from chopping tons of trees to continuing to break open each ironite ore deposit even when ironite is otherwise out of uses. Your reward for gold farming is, again, Altars and the occasional shop item before you have the chance to forge it. Forging is relatively self-explanatory, but crafting can be a little tricky. Crafting is done via shift-clicking two items like an awkward Bejeweled puzzle. It's an easy mechanic, the issue is just the recipes at times. A lot of the early crafting recipes build off of each other, which provides cohesion and ease of access to tools and weapons. Some of the later items are either wiki bait, or ""Oh, I didn't know that existed!"" items. It can get awkward, but with enough thought it's not too bad. There's not too many crafting recipes to memorize, so once you have the main ones you're set.Combat is simple. Grab a weapon, attack. If you want to use an item, hold it in your hands and right-click. Every item can be left-clicked with to hit enemies melee-style, and that's based off of your ATK stat. Staves and Bows can be right-clicked with to cast spells/shoot arrows, which are based on MAG and DEX respectively. Typically, people break down their runs to three classes. (it's often necessary with the lack of inventory space if you're somewhat new to the game still) With the speed of some mobs, and the fact that a lot of mobs in the game fly, melee is at a huge disadvantage. Ranged players will be able to aim their shots from afar, without aggroing enemies and easily taking out a majority of the mobs they'll see. The downside to Ranged play is that walls can often prevent shots, and by the time you get past the wall they'll have seen you. With the addition of the Fire Bow, you won't be having any issues with damage should you find it. Resources for arrows are normally quite plentiful as well.Mages are strong. Too strong. Fireball shoots horizontally, moving forward seemingly infinitely and even passing through walls. While this is a powerful weapon, there is the downside of accidentally killing enemies and having their xp despawn if you're not careful... But honestly that's the only con to it, which is absurd. Bolt is pretty much the god staff, allowing you to shoot directly both above and below you. With jumps, timing and practice, this is normally the superior option. There's also a strange bug that makes each shot hit the target enemy once for each player in the run, which Fireball is unable to do. Frostshard is more of a melee supplement, offering additional damage that's halved from your current maximum mana. Mages are normally a distance away from their enemies, so it normally provides little to no benefit... If it costed one mana like the other two staves, it might be worth the effort of even using. Summon Zombie is also an option if you find it or use the Scourgeling race, but against flying enemies it's worthless. Speaking of races, each race has it's own specialties. However, some are clearly superior to others. Typically you'll want to unlock the best races early on to put yourself at ease. Some races such as the Qualogg provide utility instead of immediate additional power.Unlockables for character creation include the aforementioned races, the hats and also companions. Like races, there are a few certain hats and companions which are obvious choices once unlocked over the other ones, which is unfortunate. Each unlockable set has at least one thing that's insanely challenging, but most are either freebies or based on RNG which is really unfortunate.The game is simple. Once you know what you're doing, it's as easy as going through the motions. You'll get all the items you need to beat the final boss, and you'll always win even if you're not a seasoned veteran. The skill cap is so low I feel like I'm in a hobbit hole.If you want a game to play with friends when you're bored and you don't have better options, this is a nice game to pick up. (just be weary of multiplayer issues such as de-syncing) If you want a fully featured game with proper balancing and potential for failure even after learning it's mechanics and practice, you'll want to wait on your purchase of this game. I still recommend it, just don't expect wonders in it's current state... I'm sure with time the balance issues will be ironed out and the game will have more to accomplish and do.Sean Young, if you're reading this I do hope you can find some ways to take care of these issues.

												A great experience. I absolutely love it! 9/10More Details:+ Nice artstyle & lighting. Super cool and fitting music. Not too easy. Many different weapons (Swords, Zweihanders, Great Axes, etc.) There's even a Sword made out of Jelly! Unique crafting system. Never seen that before. Cool and fun way to progress: Either you farm yourself up to diamonite or you may be lucky and you can purchase a  diamonite pickaxe at the town. (Collecting and selling a lot of wood is a great way to farm gold. But it recently got nerfed. But in my opinion it's still worth it!) Challenging enemies with a pretty good AI.  You can unlock hats, companions, races and different variants for them (haircuts). Hats are really useful. I strongly recommend the Miner Cap. There are a lot of skills available. For example ""Potion Brewer"". With this skill, you have a 50% chance of crafting a big potion instead of a small potion. Many randomly generated dungeons. After each dungeon, you will visit a town where you can smelt ores, sell some items and make yourself some armor. You can play as a mage, a ranger or a warrior. Of course you can combine those if you want.- Crafting: It's really hard to figure out every recipe on your own. Maybe a recipe book for all the basic stuff would be a good thing to implement. Inventory: Your inventory gets full way too fast. Maybe adding a way to craft backpacks would be nice. Items disappear after a couple of seconds. That's all I can complain about. So to sum it up, I think this game is super addictive and fun. In my opinion, the game is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. After 4.5hrs of total play time I almost(!) beat the game 2 times now. I died at the last boss. I won't spoil it, but the boss reminds me a lot of Terraria. :DI strongly recommend you to buy this game. You'll support awesome game developers AND get a super cool game!			"

												Beneath Magicite's colorful rogue-lite veneer lies a surprisingly grindy platformer. Random stat gains and % effect items are exceedingly, almost excessively balanced - it's very rare to find yourself too low on any one stat, or for an item to fail to activate within the desired margin of error. This is not a flaw in and of itself, but coupled with the repetitive level generation, playing through Magicite quickly becomes a stale experience. The crafting system is quite shallow, and biomes contain virtually-identical enemies varying only in stats and artistic style. The races, abilities, hats, and companions all add some replayability, but since there are only three viable playstyle archetypes, these diminish in relevance, as advanced strategic combinations are not possible. Magicite has the depth and simplicity of a mobile game, but with the time commitment of a much more robust game. A few hours of enjoyment may be had, but this is not a game that will tantalize you with additional progression for long.			"

												First of all, let me specify that I recommend playing this game despite its numerous bugs and despite thinking that the game feels slightly ""unfinished"". Why do I recommend it, then?When played cooperatively, this game can be good fun. This holds provided that you manage to play, that is. With the help of the Hamachi software I am being able to play with a friend (but whenever we tried to play with 3 players we failed, and some other friends are unable to make the game work for some reasons).It's a roguelike: you create a random character, you progress from one biome to another killing monsters, gathering resources, and crafting objects, and you unlock stuff in the process (new races, new abilities...). It's fun, once you understand what you need to do (like increasing your Dex to use ranged weapones, crafting objects to use magic...). And it's incredibly difficult to finish! The last level is a nightmare...!Pick it up if discounted, and I hope you'll have fun!			"

												This game may not be the best, but I still had some fun with it in the past, hell, I played it since Beta, I didn't play it for almost a year, I come back, and it's worse then when I left. The game is buggy as hell!! In multiplayer, you can just duplicate items without even trying, simply giving an item to another player has a chance to duplicate it, the game once acted like me and my friends lost while I was still alive and when I went through the door, half of out items were gone, cooking chicked freezes your inventory and the worst of all, the game crashed at the final boss!!I don't know how the dev manged to make the game worse in the year I haven't played but this is just basic, this is version 2.0, how in the world did they ♥♥♥♥ this game up so bad?Don't buy this game, I can't recomment it when it's in such a terrible state			"

												I think Magicite is a fun but challenging game, I enjoy playing it. But it has some major problems! I have played Magicite and beaten a few times on my own and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The same cannot be said though about the multiplayer of Magicite. EVERY time my friends and I try to play this game together (key word being ""try"") we experience a problem where there is either A) Absoulutely horrible desync or B) The other players simply do not move at all. This is a game breaking problem, especially when it occurs in the middle of  a playthrough. I hope that soon this problem is fixed and I am able to enjoy this amazing game with my friends as well as alone. Overall I would reccommend Magicite for its singleplayer but definitely not its multiplayer.			"

Posted: November 14, 2014
												In a nutshell:A charming little 2D side-scrolling platformer with a solid foundation in gameplay for anyone who enjoys the genre. Although you begin your journey with just a generic playable character armed with an axe and a few random items, after harvesting enough wood, stone and precious metal to craft more advanced tools and weaponry to better slay a variety of enemies, you will quickly unlock more playable characters, pets and hats with different traits, and you will be inclined to try the whole journey again. The game is fun and plays well as it is, and the new contents/improvements constantly being added definitely makes it a value-buy in the long run.Gameplay:You will move, dash, jump and double-jump to get you across from the entrance on the left to an exit located to the  right, stopping briefly to chop down trees for wood, mine some stones/ores and to harvest herbs and mushrooms. You will encounter slimes, boars, skeletons, spiders and many other type of enemies, and you may choose to engage them with well-timed slashes of your item in hand (i.e not necessarily a proper weapon), snipe with your bow and arrow or simply introduce them to one or all three types of elemental magic attacks should you desire. Gain experience to level up for better stats and special skills to aid you in slaying the final boss at the end, but with permanent death, it is likely that it will take you more than a couple of tries with one of many unlockable characters before you succeed. Get friends to play together and it will be even more enjoyable, depending on who survives better.Aesthetics:Numerous examples have shown that pixel-art graphics can be part of a successful product, and Magicite have no problems being one such product. The colour palettes used varies according to the biomes, but are generally colourful and goes well with the background tunes of the respective biomes.Final word:Highly recommended for the gameplay as a platformer, as well as replay value for the almost constant streams of new contents from the developer.

												Once upon a time there was a great civilization that ruled the surface of the planet that Deephaven resides in; how unfortunate that they all were driven to the depths by hordes of montrous Lovecraftian-esque beings so that we could play with their fates as they struggle from one level to the next with no clue how they will retake their formal realm.However the player attracted the particular interest of these foul lifeforms so that they continually chase him or her through each district, promising death should they tarry, isn't really important.What is important is that this doesn't stop the poor soul from living out their day-to-day existence in an almost capricious manner, an adventurer of Deephaven is openly encouraged to:- Massacre your fellow villagers for pittances of gold.- Put the starving out of their misery.- Deforest everything.- Kill the indecisive.- Eat raw chicken.And a host of other atrocities! All the way from:- Brewing your own potions, like you ignored the ""don't try this at home"" statement on Bill Nye's chemistry experiment.- Pretend to be Alice, and drink it even if you don't know what it does.- Hunt the wildlife until they're endangered, and not stop there.- Harness magical equipment without proper testing.- Play with poison.To the worst of all, for a resident of Deephaven leaves waste of all kinds behind; with no control over their biological functions and an obsessive desire to drop that item just to pick up this one, these war-mongering humanoids are a blight to sapience.No wonder the Scourge wants to get rid of them... But why should that stop us, you ask? An excellent question! It obviously shouldn't, so buckle on your mining cap and take control of your pixelated destiny, destroy the invaders of your home!Side-effects of playing Magicite are undocumented in the wake of the recent planetary invasion, please disregard any and all negative symptoms in favor of overthrowing your new rulers.All hail the Scourge Empire!Yours truly, a subjugated surface-dweller.

												After about 2 hours with the game, I was seriously debating whether I would recommend this game or not because despite what I dislike about it and the times when I would get frustrated and rage quit it, It's hard for me to deny that I did indeed have some fun with it once I really got a rhythm going.I do have some issues with this game that can kill it for first time players like it almost did with me. I simply can't ignore them. Issue 1: Lack of instructionsBesides the 'tip' on your inventory screen, the game doesn't really tell you much about what will create what. Wood + Wood = Wood plank. Wood plank + Stick = Sword hilt. Wood Plank + Wood Plank = Wooden Blade. Wooden Blade + Sword Hilt = Sword. Do you see how many steps it takes to get to a sword? The same things won't make a axe or a pick either. You have to add two sticks together to make an axe hilt. Three sticks to make a pick hilt too. The game tells you nothing of the sort so it's mostly guess work. Minecraft is the same but it's easier to guess in that game than it is in this one. (3 wood across and 2 sticks down looks like a pick before it even makes it for example). I don't want to have to keep minimising the game just to look at a crafting page. An optional tutorial in the main menu wouldn't hurt anyone. Issue 2: The spawns9 times out of 10, I will spawn right in front of a bunch of items like they're guarding the trees I need to make a sword so I end up having to fight them with my lone little axe. Several times I spawned in front of two boars so they just charged me down and killed me right away. This issue isn't too big but it can be annoying when it leads to quick deaths before you're even able to put up a good fight. Issue 3: The..randomness.Hear me out with this one. I understand that the game is about randomly generated dungeons. This I have no problems with. I'm all off every playthrough taking me through a different layout and different enemies. The thing I have a problem with is something that actually happened during my playthrough right before this review as well as (about) my fifth attempt at the game. I was in the 5th district and very low on health. (Guess I suck at the game :P) I had a herb in my inventory which, when combined with another herb, would make a healing potion. Where do you get another herb? In tuffles of grass around the area. Seems simple to just avoid enemies until I find another grass pile, right? Wrong. I encountered several grass piles but they can't paying out in mushrooms (Two of them make a mana potion) or spider webs of all things. I kept trying and trying but it would not give me a herb nor would anything else give me a herb. Even the shop before the area didn't have any potions. I was managing to kill the jumping spiders even when backed into a corner when all of a sudden, some big bug boss monster thing that took up a big chunk of the screen flew in and killed me immediately. The same thing happened during my fifth try at the game. I was standing still and trying to craft some stuff when a floating head came down and dealt 9999 damage to my 8 hp guy. Dead. It's like if Mom suddenly started attacking you in one of the thing rooms of Binding of Isaac. It's just ridiculous. Issue 4: The cursor camera. So while you play this game, your mouse cursor is turned into a cross hair symbol and it controls which direction you're looking as well as moving the camera. If you move it to the edge of the screen, the screen will move in that direction so as to kinda let you see what's ahead before you go over there. I like it. It comes in handy for seeing future enemies and if you've missed any materials. But where I feel the issue leaves is that it does both of those things. So if you fling the cursor to one side quickly because you just noticed an enemy is coming, the screen will move away so you can't see anything. It'll be very quick too so it gets disorienting and by the time you have it back on you and the enemy, you've needlessly lost hp or died. A simple option to be able to tweak its speed would fix this quite easily. Issue 5: The inventory.Remember when I told you at the first issue how to make a sword? Well that as well as all crafting has to be done inside your own inventory screen. So you have to work around all the other objects you're carrying and when you don't have two squares open (To put a lone wood plank into both in order to create a Wood blade for example) then you're going to have to drop some stuff then pick it back up when you're done. It's not that big of a deal at first but when you're doing it every time you stop to craft, it can be. A sub box next to your inventory could solve this pretty easily. Like a big grid right next to your inventory since your quick selection boxs, armor, extra pieces and inventory take up about 15% of the sreen. And those are my issues with the game after about 2 hours of play. Other than that, the art style of the game is very appealing to look at. The music can be nice to listen to. It's pretty fun to fight the enemies (when super op boss monsters don't float down out of nowhere to instant kill you)If you've played Minecraft or Terraria then don't bother getting this game. It's basically the same thin as both of those except when you eat, you leave a poop on the spot where you ate. If you feel that's worth £7 (or whatever it is your currency) then go for it. In the end, I have to say I do not recommend it to people that aren't interested in this type of game or the issues I mentioned seem like they would get to you. It's an alright little game but doesn't stand out enough to warrant the payment.			"

												I do recommend this game everyone who:likes Roguelikes/ Rogueliteslikes Pixel Graphicslikes 2D Platformerslikes RPGs(-elements)likes to die over and over again like in Dark Soulslikes to kill poor Chicken and VillagersThis game is hard. I have played 3 1/2 hours so far, and have started about 15 new Characters. My latest character has survived nearly 1 hour and only died, because I didn't pay attention to my HP!This is the Roguelike I've been searching for, for a long time. It's just as I imagined it to be. This is just like Dark Souls only in 2D and Pixels. Only that you loose all your Stuff and restart from scratch, with a new randomly generated WorldI recommend to play the first few hours with friends, because they can revive you and it's generally easier!

												This game is hugely fun! Especially with friends.I played this with a friend of mine from day one and we had a great time dying over and over to beat it. Then we died about 100 more times trying to unlock all of the content through different achievements.Great game for a great price. If you can't convince your friend(s) to buy it, maybe just get them a gift copy!			"

												This game has so much potential, but I feel as if the game devs aren't updating it. The game is EXTREMELY buggy. Random crashes, enemies that glitch through walls, if one player goes down you all die, the buttons to interact with NPC's disappear, etc. It makes playing past the first two levels nearly impossible. I was really looking forward to playing this with my friends in multiplayer, and now I kinda regret buying it at all. Game devs, don't abandon this game! Please release some patches.			"

I'm not going to change my review until I actually see that the bugs have been removed.			"

												A great looking game with a lot of promise, completely ruined by multiple bugs and glitches. The glitches can range from anywhere as just being annoying, getting stuck in walls, game crashing ect., to rendering the game completely unplayable. Shop and crafing features completely break for no disernable reason, making it actually impossible to progress in the game. I would say wait until the dev fixes these bugs, but the updates for this game are extremely rare, it took nearly 2 years for the dev to update the game and all the update did was break the foundation. It's been almost a year since the last update broke the game and no update or word from the dev since. It has promise, but until the dev proves he cares enough about the game and the people who bought it to fix it, avoid at all costs.			"

												-Good sides of the game------------------------------------------------------.The game has very good graphics that fit it really well..The mobs (monsters) are very well designed and have good animations..Every new area has an unique look to it and has well fitted monsters..Bosses and regular mobs have good difficulty levels for each area..The game has a lot to do and has a lot of things to unlock..The game has good music that seems to fit the atmosphere.-Bad sides of game--------------------------------------------------------------.The attacking cycles for the mobs are a little wonky..It sometimes messes with you and puts a charging mob infront of you when you start..Selling items barley gives you anything..There isn't much invetory space so sometimes you have to go through lots of trouble just to pick up an item, therefore waisting time..There isn't mob health bars so you dont know how many time to hit it (sometimes this really messes you up).------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite how many things this game has bad there is a lot of good going for it, so I'd recommend this to anyone interested in it. Trust me its not a waste of money.			"

												I'm just getting into this game and love it already. Magicite is a combination of Minecraft's crafting, Terraria's sidescrolling monsterfighting and Don't Starve's surviving. Magicite does not help you too much; it gives you some hints, but mostly you have to discover everything by yourself.You aren't told how to craft things, it only gives you few hints here and there. You have to try by yourself.The character you start with has random items, which also give you some hints of what you can craft. For example, I once started with a bone bar, and learned that bones can be used in crafting too.Definitely a good game for anyone who doesn't want to be taught everything and likes Minecraft's hardcore mode. I, personally, don't enjoy Minecraft at all, but the hardcore mode is the best way to play it.Overall, it's little too pricy, but if you're reading these reviews, you're already probably going to buy it.

												Fun game but riddled with game ruining bugs. It had bugs here and there before version 2.0 but since 2.0 I would say the game is almost unplayable. I say almost because it can be played but you will not progress as the game will randomly decide that you die in a village or that it crashes, closes, and does not safe everytime i manage to cope with the bugs and beat the final boss. If the bugs are fixed then I will full heartedly recommend this game.			"

Posted: November 27, 2014
												Simply put, I would recommend this game.A few reasons as to why I do, are down below this line.Low system requirements allow almost anyone to play.The price is relativley cheap (10$ at normal price)Can really put friendships at a test, as there is a reviving system to the game. (But is it worth it to revive your friend or to go for that chest further ahead?)And a overall fun game due to the small challenge it brings along to it. (I do like games that aren't straight up easy most of the time)Not to mention this game is rogue-like, which gives it unlimited run-throughs.Unlockables will keep you stuck to this game, playing it over and over for that one hat.What I dislike about this game, is down below this line.The kinda steep learning curve can really get to casual players.Your friends may be douches. Maybe.Some of the traits you can get are straight up useless, I mean... Who REALLY needs a 50% chance to not lose durability when mining or chopping trees.The ""weird"" multiplayer scaling for damage on the enemy's part is, weird. (I beleive the damage dealt to you is upped by 50% per player. EX: 150% for two players.Unlockables, as mentioned before may also be rather frustrating for players who just want to try something new, but can't simply get anything new.After playing for awhile alone, (time varies depending if you want to go for all the hats alone and such other things) this game simply gets boring. Multiplayer aspects make this game a much better experience, but having it as a sort of ""requirement"" for it to be fun isn't a good thing. Also, along the lines of multiplayer, I've never experienced extreme amounts of lag playing with others, but I have experienced some lag, which really took to the game play. I mean, boars who can teleport andother things along that line really aren't good. Really.			"

												I loved this game. I really did. Sure, I never managed to complete it but the variety in such a simple game concept made every new round fresh. Tactics developed overtime and honestly this is one of my favourite games. However, it has always had a history of (mostly funny) glitches. Normally these happen a few districts in so unless you're used to the game, you wouldn't normally experience them and you didn't have them at all in singleplayer. Unfortunately, the final update has ruined this game. The latest update has made it incredibly glitchy. I literally cannot get past district 3. It spawns in both another village and another area, often walling me in so I cannot progress. Furthermore, the inventory sometimes won't open or won't even close once it is open. This makes NPC interaction impossible. Also sometimes when I die the game will revive me for no reason, but keep open the death screen. It then doesn't let me go any further in the game or even exit without Alt-F4 and unless I'm on a server with someone else it doesn't save any progress.In conclusion: buy this game 6 months ago. Not today. It is literally more broken than Sonic '06.EDIT: A hotfix was released the day that I reviewed this game. This hotfix has fixed the glitch where I cannot progress pass district 3, and most other glitches have become less common. However, they are still there and continue to make the game frustrating. In multiplayer, sometimes the ground will not spawn in and all I will see is the entities, the characters and black, then I have to wait for one of the people I'm playing with to get to the end of the district for it to spawn me properly.

The game itself is fun, but there's a little bit things that quite not rightPersonal Rating : Worth to play, Not worth to masterTraditional Rating : 7/10Magicite is fun! it's a simple game that have a very clear objective from the startGo to the next dungeonNot just that, the battle also quite fun and challangeing,gameplay are eerily similar to Rogue Legacy, but still have different approach.You get stronger by unlocked new ability, hero, or equipped item. Then the problem appears :Cons- The unlockables are generately random, for example : ""Defeat Boss X and have 20% chance to unlocked this maybe awesome guy""getting to the Boss level and defeat him is already hard enough for a rogue-like game, adding the % chance just made us think it's a waste of time mastering the game itself.- Stats Upgrade also random, yes it makes every run is different and unique, but it also make every ""bad luck stat"" is annoying.- Item combination is a tough one, there's no recipe information whatsoever, maybe you can get along with some of the item combination after 20-30 runs. And there's no different window for combining, it's in your inventory, drag and drop to another item to combine, accident click are common.- Inventory is a mess, it's hard to slice up items if you need some. Left-click to hold the item, Right-click to divide it in half, what if I have 40 woods and I only need 2? You guess it, 40:2 = 20, 20:2 = 10, 10:2=5, somehow odd number like 5 get you 3&2, look how much inventory space I needed?.ProsOverall, the game are very challangeing and somewhat fun to play because of curiosity to unlock new things. But you need congenital-luck to progress fast in this game. "

												I really recommend Magicite as it is unbelievably fun, even if it doesn't look it. I know that I started playing thinking ""Am I going to enjoy this?"", but I played for a bit and realised that this game is great - especially with a friend or two to play with.The crafting is, meh, but I couldn't care less about that. It's a crafting system. They weren't exactly going to add a 3x3 grid and clutter the screen up aswell as making it similar to a certain other game. I've seen a lot of reviews that just talk about the crafting system, but that's just imbecilic: it's not the main point of the game.Magicite is replayable, over, and over, and over again. It's like Binding of Isaac, but with more pixel-ey graphics, which are infact a lot more pleasant to look at. The graphic type makes it look very inviting as it's simple and makes it seem like the game is simple; which it is, run around, collect stuff, craft, kill stuff, advance in levels, gain skills etc. Aswell as this, the different types of biomes are well thought-out as you can encounter many different monsters, and you can choose which of the 3 random biomes you want to enter, some appearing more than others.Personally, singleplayer in this game is as much fun as multiplayer. In multiplayer, you've got your friends and all and you can have a laugh, but what's great is that the monsters scale depending on how many people are playing. I realised this when I kept on dieing in multiplayer, but can play almots outstandingly in singleplayer.Also, the game gives you different types of races, which have different benefits and starting items, and it also gives you hats and companions, both giving you different benefits and both have different ways you can obtain them. One of the hats, the ""Robin Hood Hat"" as I like to call it, has a 20% unlock chance when you've shot 100 or more arrows in a single playthrough. That gives you the chance to try and complete that challenge, all be it a very easy challenge. However there are some other challenges which are even harder!The Overworld Helm is unlocked by completing the game and not being hit once. Not once! The Djinn race is unlocked by completing the game and only killing 1 enemy.As you can see, some challenges are hard, some are easy, which is good as you can start completing these challenges as you get better at the game.Overall I really recommend Magicite as you will have a lot of fun playing it and it has a lot of replayability. The price that they're asking for is worth it.			"

												It's actually a surprisingly fun game.  It's addicting to play, and very difficult to master.  However, in a lot of ways I feel it falls flat--to the point where I really just wish it was NOT a rogue-like.  The crafting system is positively atrocious.  Combining one item with another in a sequence in order to make something.  It could easily be overcomplicated and become very tedious when starting new runs.  The monsters themselves are also an issue.  Some monsters are fun and challenging and rewarding to defeat, whilst others are just ridiculously annoying.  I can't stand going around a corner only to be killed by something I couldn't even see to begin with!  The camera system can be a very useful thing, as it allows you to easily pan the screen (to a degree).  Though it doesn't seem to get disabled when the window isn't active, so if you quickly alt tab to do something don't expect to be able to see something coming at you since your screen will likely be far away from your actual character.I want to like this game--and more than anything I want to recommend it--but it's just far to frustrating right now and this isn't mitigated enough by playing with friends for it to matter.  I really hope the developer just trashes the current crafting implementation and reworks it entirely, as it's just not fun or intuitive.  Especially at that price.  There are just other games that would appeal more for the same amount, or cheaper.  I'm interested to see where the developer takes this, but I just cannot recommend it as is.  Note that this is currently only a review of the Early Access (I believe 0.7), so obviously these are subject to change.  It's just a matter of if they will or not.Thank you.Edit: After full release, I still cannot recommend.			"

								While still early, Magicite shows a hell of a lot of potential, and an already awesome game can only be made better. The graphics are charming, the music is very atmospheric, the fighting is reasonably good, and overall it works well and fits amazingly. I'd recommend picking up this game while you can, before the price (potentially) goes up after official release. Plus, i need a few friends to play with!			"

												This game got kinda similarity like FTL: Faster than light speed, because you have to run to end of the district before powerful monster get you. At end of the road, you can choose 3 randonmized district to go new one.This game has also randomized beginning, by that I mean it may let you start nice and slow or imminent death by spawning powerful creatures right front of you. Crafting is quite simple when you know how, let me just give you starting example to make wooden pickaxe so you don't need to be confused. To get Wooden Pickaxe: 3 stick and 4 woods, combine 2 stick to get axe handle and combine last stick to axe handle to get pickaxe handle, combine 4 woods to get 2 boards and do it again to get wooden blade (blade is just a crafting material), for last combine blade to pick axe handle to create Wooden Pickaxe.Even though this game has permadeath, it doesn't mean it wont rewards your struggle, just how far you got it may rewards you by new race, hats or variation of race.I'm quite addicted to this game and I love the challenge it gives, even though if I die right at beginning and I would recommend this game if you seek the challenge and fun.Also, when you eat, you poop... Really.			"

								A fun game that has quite a lot of potential. The crafting is intuitive, the combat is quick, and the platforming feels tight and responsive. Each biome has a cool feeling to it and they ramp up in difficulty as you journey onwards. As of right now there isn't a whole lot of content however it seems that the dev is working pretty hard to squash bugs and release new content such as new races, companions, a bestiary, and more. It'll be great to see where this game ends up. If you're a fan of Terraria or Starbound, then you'll enjoy this excellent spin on the genre.			"

												This game is lots of fun when it works, and for singleplayer it works perfectly! There's a nice curve in difficulty - players learn how to avoid basic enemy movement patterns and adopts strategies for attack in the first few levels. In later levels enemies perform new patterns that the player must adapt to or suffer greater penalties to health than before. I revel in the challenges the game presents, and the way it rewards skillful movement and planning. Each town is a welcomed rest and keeps the action engaging rather than exhausting.Multiplayer should be an even greater joy, it's great fun coordinating with a friend and reaping the efficiency of two players dividing duties and actively harvesting resources. however multiplayer has always ended in a mess for me and my friend. I'm unsure if it is due to poor connection because the initial levels work without a hitch. Once we'd reach level 10 and on though everything starts to go to hell. Enemies lag out of place, projectiles spawn unattached to a source, flickering phantoms of beasts would hover in place after death. Occasionally the ground wouldn't load and I'd fall into an inky abyss. It's worse that the multiplayer functions at all because it's only after great progress has been made that everything goes wrong. In one round I even lagged a full level behind. My friend would enter a door, and I'd enter the (unplayable)level he'd just been through.I understand that with a rogue like game you can't just have a player joining part way through, so allowing a disconnected player to reconnect might not be the best solution. But most games with multiplayer I've played will at least give you an indication that the connection is unstable. It'd be nice if the game recognised a poor connection, and stalled or paused players to try and reconnect/ stabilize. I admit I have no idea what is necessary to actually maintain a multiplayer session, but my experiece so far with it has always ended poorly, and that experience is all I can contribute. If the connection issues could be fixed up I'd happily buy copies just to distribute them to friends and spread the joy, but for now I Guess I'll wait til my friend and I can get a better connection :/			"

												Very enjoyable pixilated rogue-like game that can leave you feeling satisfied with a sense of accomplishment or leave you frustrated and on the verge of destroying your computer. Either way this game is in my top 20 games.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the few games in which I bought ""Early Access"". I pledged for this game on Kickstarter and I am not disappointed, it is really fun. While it can be frustrating it's okay, because you don't live for that long. Has fast paced combat, and lots of armor, weapons, and spells. But its only in Early Access so hopfuly can only get better. I would give it a 7 out of 10 right now.			"

Early Access Review
								Hey, first off I would like to say that Magicite is a really good game with a TON of potential. I would really like to see the creator actually work on it unlike other early access games that get abandoned, that really grinds my gears. I know it is an early access, but there are a TON of bugs right now. I hope most of them get fixed soon! but the ONE thing that I really don't like about this game at all, it that in multiplayer you can hit your friends. That is highly annoying. Can you please make an option to where you turn friendly attack off? That would be awesome. Also make it so you can sell items. I saw in the alpha that there was a total level? like that showed progress and unlocked stuff after you die? Why is that not in this one? That looked really cool aswell. I like to see a sign of progress. But other than that great great game. TOTALLY worth the ten dollars. Don't let the terraria like graphics fool you. Don't get me wrong I LOVE terraria (520 hours clocked in on it), but if you just look at the game and say jeez another terraria rip off without playing it you are completly ignorant because this game is really NOTHING like terraria. It is more RPGish which is always what I wanted from terraria. This game in it's complete state may even be better than terraria, which me saying that means a LOT, because Terraria is for sure one of the best games I have ever played, and now so is this. My main point here is please give an option to friendly attack online, that would make Magicite game sooooooo much better to me. Thank you Sean for this great game! Hope you update it fast and frequently!!! Cause this game could be HUGE. With hard work and listening to the community, I'm sure you can pull it off:) I really want to see this game go far. Take off friendly attack from online and that sells this game as the best game ever for me. Thank you for making this game, Magicite is truly amazing Sean, keep updating it, good luck!			"

								""What is Magicite?"" Well, how can I sum this up best...take Dungeon Crawling RPGs, add material collecting and fairly straight-forward crafting, add a dash of Roguelike Fun (the difficult, random-generation, random loot kind of Fun), and you got Magicite!Oh, and btw, it has Multiplayer. If you fo get this game, tell your Steam friends so you can play with each other!...seriously, do that. This game is pretty tough for ONE person alone to get through it! Took me 2 hours to figure out how not to die immediately!)...That aside, its an epic journey for any who loves the Dungeon Crawl and wished you could make your own gear! Also good for any Minecraft/Terraria fans I guess.			"

												Imagine Minecraft and Terraria's crafting system, with the roguelike elements of Rogue Legacy, and Risk of Rain's area to area placement of random generation. The graphics are similar to Castle Crashers and newgrounds.com, because of the pixel art style its derived from.Your objective is simple, survive at least 20 districts in, and kill the end boss, all while leveling with random drops and level stat progression.There are hats, which change subtle ways you can play, which can be unlocked, along with races which have different gains in those stat areas. Some are more Dex based for archery, some are more towards magic, while others deal in strength.There are also companions you can earn, which can help you in your quest. All of these have to be unlocked, and some are 100% chances to gain, others are 20%. You may have to run more than a few times to get everything.It's a great game, though it does have a few issues, but they're pretty minor. Such as being unable to 'Play Again!' after a loss in Multiplayer, which results in a black screen for those connected to the host sometimes. As well as being able to take advantage of the 1HP revive. Though these are minor, if you have patience to accept it.			"

												The game is really fun, the movement is really smooth with an awesome double jump. Also combat has lots of strategies you use to defeat different monsters because its im possible to tank anything lol. You literally have a couple of health so its a hardcore game but in a really fun way. BIGBIG BIG fan of this game its definitly worth your money! Multiplayer just makes it even better so if your looking to buy a game for friends and yourself to play, this is it. Also, there are different hats and races you can unlock by doing specific things ingame so it always keeps the game fun and you want to play it over and over again. You can quote me on this because I gurantee you'll have fun in this game.10/10 fun!!			"

Early Access Review
								Magicite is worth playing if you're the type of player that loves a challenge. Games in the last 15 years have been progressively getting easier and easier and feeding into this generation's ""I don't want to work for anything"" mentality. This is not a casual game you can pick up and play casually. If you die, you're dead. You don't go back to the last checkpoint, you don't get to try again. You murdered your character because you didn't play smart and you need to learn from your mistakes. This is really fun to play with friends, so grab a few copies of your most hardcore gaming friends and have fun raging together. This is also an indie game by a very talented guy who is starting to make some really good stuff, so support him and you'll be able to tell your friends you were a fan before everyone else.			"

								Professer's Response: The good of this game is that it is quite smoothly running. As well as the simplicity of the crafting of items. The bad things about this game are that the beginning mobs are to powerful. You may need to nerf them a little or make a world generator that starts you off in a happier style biome with few aggresive mobs but plentiful peaceful mobs such as pigs or chickens.Suggestions: You may want to give the player a crafters guide because it took me a about 20 min. to figure how to make wooden planks. This crafting guide should only include basic recipes such as tools and essentials.Overall this is a pretty good game but it needs some work...			"

												Magicite WAS an amazing game for coop; however, the last batch of updates by the dev broke the net code and now it is such a buggy unplayable mess in multiplayer that I have to give this a thumbs down. These bugs include people falling through the world, loading into completely empty towns, the annoying bug where if one character dies it triggers the game over screen, and others.A year or two ago I would have given it two thumbs up but in it's current broken state I have to say stay away.

												I just found this little gem of a game and it has taken hold to my thoughts, even as I work away during the day. I Love it when a game does that. It's a roguelike game which is pretty challenging (especially at first) and with tons of charm, not to mention an addictive gameplay loop (recommend reviewing a wiki for crafting guides, just to see what is possible and to help get over that initial learning curve). I'd say if you love games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try.Update: The latest update (v2.0 hotfix) seems to have introduced some nasty glitches :( When playing last night, any time I lit a fire all of my controls in the village stopped working except WSAD.  Esc out and then resuming the game then allowed me to talk to the villagers again but trying to light another fire to cook food broke my inventory. This happened in every village, something went wrong and all of the menus and controls just stopped working. Now, funny thing is, during this very glitchy playthrough I finished the game for the first time lol :)			"

												Just love it when i saw it in my fav's forum, though my thought still think it will be kinda disappointed like StarBound (complicated). But when it comes to level 1, i just lost it, gameplay is really nice, diffent from Terarria and Starbound, it has nothing to do with building, i spend most of the time crafting, jumping and dashing through all kind of stuff, though it is kinda confuse because there is no guide to show u how to craft ingame, ""Try to shift-click 2 items to craft stuff"",  there u go. This game is fun when u play with ur friends, just like those time when we try to play Maple Story, but the most disappointed things is the game seem that it doesnt use steam cloud, when i try to play it on my friend's pc, all my race and data has long gone.. It is kinda sad. Hope to see more amazing feature in the future.			"

 My experience with Magicite Imagine Terraria and Spelunky. Two great games. And then combine them. So what comes out? Another great game!Magicite is a rogue like survival game with RPG Elements, where you farm minerals and materials,and try to craft better weapons and gear once you are in a town. (There's always a level --> town --> level --> town --> etc.). Really important is Inventory management, since you only have limited space and you still need space to craft materials together. So if you just harvest everything you will soon run out of inventory space. This can be annoying for beginners,since they don't know what materials exactly are important,but it's also a strength of the game: It is really fun to just combine different things with Shift - Click and experiment to see what comes out! (If you don't like experimenting there's always the Wiki to help you out!)Once you understand the depth of the game you will notice that you can specialize yourself on one ""class"": - A Warrior (High ATK,DEF stats and melee weapons)- A Ranger (High DEX stat and a Bow with different types of Arrows)- A Mage (High MAG stat and 3 different Magic Weapons as it is right now)It is really fun to farm ores and materials to craft better gear for your character,because every new item you craft has a noticeable impact on your character (wheter it is damage or HP or DEF).Another strength of Magicite is the ""unlock system"": Once your run ended (by death or by beating the game), you get the chance to unlock certain characters or hats. Different characters have different starting conditions,which can influence your run and different hats give you different bonuses.Keep in mind: Most unlockables only have a chance to get unlocked so even though you reached certain goals, the unlockables are not guaranteed. This can be sometimes frustrating,if you have a 50 minute run (definetely a possilble time) and you die because of stupidity and unlock nothing new.What kinda weakens the whole experience,is that Magicite doesn't really seem finished.There is a final boss and the current version is over 1.0 but it seems like there could be way more.Because once you actually understand the whole crafting mechanism,it seems really simple.(Important to point out here is,that the game is still being worked on and new content WILL come in future updates)There are some points that I didn't really talked about, so I will list a summary of all Pro's and Con's:TL;DR Summary Pro's - Super Mega Awesome Soundtrack (seriously this is important to mention,it creates a perfect atmosphere)- Lovely Pixeldesign / Graphic- Feel your character becoming stronger,so every Level Up and new Item feels like progress- Acquire 3 individual Skill out of 3 different ""Skill - Pools"" at level 5, 10 and 15- It's fun experimenting with different strategies to see what works best for you- Challenging bosses and an epic final boss- Constant Time pressure that creates tension (Some might argue that this is a Con,I personally like it)- It's really fun to play overall, once you understand how the game works- Multiplayer seems really fun (Gotta admit I have not yet played Multiplayer... None of my friends own this game)- Randomly generated Levels --> Every run feels new and different (forgot to mention this earlier...)Con's- Beginners might get frustrated,since this game is certainly hard and not self - explanatory. (Experiment or go to the Wiki)- You might get frustrated if you have a long run and because of bad luck you unlock nothing new...-  EDIT: In this part,it used to say that playing as an archer seems to be the only viable option. Now that I played the game even more,the mage class started to appeal more and more to me. So playing as an archer is definetely NOT the only way to complete this game. (even if it might make your life easier). However, I still dislike the warrior,since he is put in the most danger when dealing damage,since he is melee based. This might be only my opinion though.In the end I can safely say, despite having a few weaknesses, the game is overall a really good and fun experience and I strongly recommend it.P.S.: This is my first Review. I hope it is helpful. Sorry for any grammatical errors, english is not my first language.			"

												This game is hard really hard but it's addicting as hell. So far the game is playable but some improvments could be made to make it even better and some of these are in every game. First I shall say why it's a great game because what's the point of saying what could be improved if I haven't talked about the game in general. It's a rogue like 2D platformer (less platformy) the game is perma death and you have to start over when you die which is easy and it's not friendly. The survival aspect consists of a hunger bar, a health bar you fill these with health postions which a few and far between and eating food which you find by killing each live stock animal type. On most areas you will have a small slime which will do a tiny amount of damage a higher level mob which is harder a live stock animal and at times you can run into a boss. Inbetween each area there is a safe village which you can sell and buy and craft higher level items. The rest is cutting trees, crafting and mineing however this is no clone of Terraria or Minecraft. You can unlock equipment and perks and new characters by getting further in the game so even if you die if you got further on your next run you will likely unlock some new item or hat which makes it worth playing over and over. Multiplayer is hamachi based typical 4 player co op and all that jazz. Combat is quite weighty which adds a degree of skill (timing and dodging). It would be nice to have a save point of sorts since runs can be lengthy. Maybe make it more friendly for newer player instead of looking up videos and tutorials online. Apart from that the game is great and I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of challanging, simple (to a degree), co op, rogue like, platformer experience with some survival elements mixed in.

												First of all, let me get this straight, I used to love this game and have been following it since the Kickstarter. However, the development of this game has come to a halt. This is due to the fact that the developer has abandoned this game in order to work on another one of his games. And at it's current state, I can easily say that Magicite is abandoned. Throughout the development of his another game, the developer said he will still work on this game later on, however, this has been proven to be false. He released ONE, and LAST update for the game, which hasn't even fixed the majority of the bugs. In conclusion, this game has a lot of potential, but a lot of bugs and close to useless features. It used to be updated at least once or twice per month in the beginning, now it's dead. It's broken in it's current state and I would not recommend buying it even if it's on sale.			"

												Magicite has an appealing retro artystle, simple gameplay, and typical roguelike mechanics that encourage replayability. However, the game quickly becomes monotonous. There are unlockable ""classes"" and equipment that can vary playstyles  slightly, but in general the game is short, lacks variety between runs, and gets boring fast.Multiplayer is where this game shines. It breaks up the monotony, allows you to specialize for a certain role in a team setting, and offers fun experiences with friends. The problem is that the multiplayer in this game is extremely buggy.  Extremely  buggy. There is an ungodly amount of lag (even in a LAN), graphical glitches (your teammate may appear to be in one location on your screen, but is actually somewhere completely different) and game-breaking crashes/black screens. After several (at least 20+) multipler attempts, both on LAN and over the internet, me and my teammates were still unable to complete even one successful run. Every single time the town hub area in between levels would glitch out and completely break the game at some point, preventing progression and forcing a restart.This game is not worth an outrageous $10, but itsn't trash. I was able to get a couple of hours of enjoyment out of it at least, but the the rest was just multiplayer frustration. If you want it, get it on sale (I think I picked it up for about $2.50). There is nothing in this game would give you a reason to buy it immediately.			"

												Starting with the posetive:It was fun while it lastedBeutiful sprites, while they are minimalistic are preaty. Enemies are are destinct so you do not mix them up The negative:It is hella buggy, apperently the developer has stoped updating the game while it is still full of buggs. the buggs range from amusing to anoying to downright gamebreaking.Gameplay is realy unvaried and archer is broaken beond repear.No music optionsConclution:The game can be fun with friends if you buy it at the same time and learn together, tho it does not take a long time to crack the code. The game crashing after the last boss and you not getting anny rewards, is not fun.with out all the bugs it would be a cheap 5 houers of fun and i would rate it 5/10.with the bugs it is not worth even buying 2/10 "

												From what i heard, its made by one guy or something so keep that in mind.The game is fluid and simple.Solo game is just as a rougelike works. You play, experiment with what you have, die to some ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" mob(then you look back to your death and learn from it and beat this ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" mob)and then in the end you probably unlock something that will aid you as you retry your journey.Crafting is simple and can be fast, but just to be sure experiment in town so you dont run out of time out on the fields of battle!Then you have MULTIPLAYER. before you get to play it youll need to port forward or use hamachi. My friends didn't like this idea so i assume its not very safe. but it works and i liked it.So in game its good, but i could only try it once because my friends stopped playing beacuse of the rougelike aspect i believe. doesnt matter. Multiplayer works just like solo, but then better. There is lots of room for experimentation and strategies.Your team can be dealt into positions. for Example.: theWarrior: strong melee guy that runs through killing mobs in early game. With really good killing potential in his skills.Backup: can be mage or archer(very strong classes, but in early game no equipment to be useful)in early they would be the ones crafting and mining/gatheringthere are lots of passive skills that lets you gather more materials or lets you craft better potions etc.these skills can make your early game easy as heck.sadly these passives are given randomly at character select which is really weird in multi and solo mode :\Archer: long range guy can kill mini bosses etc without taking a hit. needs arrows(lots)Mage: i havent had the chance to play this class because gathering resources to craft wands is very difficult(i always try to kill mobs that are in my way so thats a bad combi)but i did manage to get a wand once and this guy works almost like an archer but needs no ammo(only mana that regenerates fak yeah?!)pretty hard to utilise wouldnt try to do it soloLong post and i has no potato. :[Very good game. Shame for the multiplayer router shizzle. shame that my friends dont wanna play.I still have quite some hours on this and im really into it.			"

												I'd really only suggest buying it if you like platforming roguelikes with invisble timers. The crafting here is not much of a selling point.The game does quite a lot well. The graphics in the game are nice and colorful. The enviroments are lovely. I like the array of enemies. The game also offers a good varity of options for customzing your character to suit your playstyle. It also randomly drops underserved loot into your lap, which is always a treat. I don't really dig the combat, but it's alrght. The game has a huge ammount of replay value. The biomes are randomly generated which means that the layout and the enemies will be different every time. The game also has lots of items, races and cosmetic options to unlock.I really want to like this game more than I do. It's not a bad game, but some things were implemented really poorly.The hunger system doesn't seem to have any point. The reason it exists in turnbased roguelikes is to keep you from exploring the entire floor and getting all the loot/hp. It's supposed to make you decide if you'd rather continue or stick around and hope you find something useful. Here? It's a minor annoyance. I've never once died of hunger. Being able to get a good supply of food is dead easy. All food does is provide an alternate way to get HP back.I don't like that I had to read guides to find out what the stats did. The traits are explained, but for some reason the stats aren't.Speaking of annoying things, the invisble timer. It  isn't a blight on the game, I just don't like timers and want to warn others who might feel the same way. You only have a limited ammount of time to make it to the end of the level before big scary demons come to eat your face. Normally I found that it doesn't get in the way, but when it does, I feel really cheated.I also find the inventory and crafting system to be awful for this type of game. In roguelikes you have limited inventory so that you can't stockpile cosumables for much harder levels. In this type of game though, it doesn't make sense. The inventory size feels way too small for a game with a crafting system. It doesn't need to let me hold every single item in the game, but more space is needed. You also need to have at least one slot empty if you want to do any sort of crafting while out in the field. I could even tolerate this stuff, if it provided a easy way to destroy items to clear up space for the stuff I actually want. Instead you have to drop them on the ground where they will follow you like a sad puppy before giving up. This makes crafting kind of time consuming, which could but THE SCOURGE HAS INVADED! GET OUT!!!!!!			"

												Like the description says, Magicite is a singleplayer or CO-OP platformer with rogue-like elements. However if you like complex RPGs this isn't what you want to buy. The RPG elements include getting better armor (which really means increasing your health so you can take more hits), getting stronger weapons, and miniscule character creation (which includes clicking on a stat randomizer over and over again until you get the only 2 useful abilities from a pool of about 10). The game also features a almost functioning crafting system which quickly becomes a hassle to deal with when you need to quickly craft something and you're stuck fumbling through your incredibly small inventory. However these issues can be looked over because of the very simplistic and cute design, which is understandable for a game of this magnitude, but note: it's not and RPG. The gameplay, while for the most part (in single player) is sufficient, the lack of any real combat diversity makes the game feel very repetitive. The melee sytem consists of being near an enemy and left clicking until it dies. The ranged combat systems feel a little bit more diverse but still lack any real differentiation in attacking styles. The magic doesn't make much sense as, I can tell you, the only magic you'll ever find useful is the fire staff, which shoots a flaming projectile and nothing else. The enemies you will fight consist of 3 main types, annoying flying creatures that go through walls, land creatures that you can stunlock to death, and bigger land creatures that you can stunlock to death. None of which really make the game interesting or fun. The atmosphere is nice with every area but most late game enemies are just recoloured versions of earlier ones. Which takes away from any sense of progression one may have had.  Multiplayer, which the game brags to be a strong point is a complete and utter mess. I tried to play with several of my friends and we enountered a pletera of connection issues and game breaking bugs. It took more then 6 tries to even load into the first area without atleast one person to have a fatal bug effect them. One of these bugs includes the map not loading, and the bug can happen every time you enter a new area which kills any reason to play multiplayer. Other issues include teleporting enemies, game crashes and getting stuck inside of walls. Don't buy it if you plan on playing with friends. Pros:-Cute art style which is visually appealing to the eyes-Simple to understand mechanicsCons:-Not an RPG(there's no roleplaying, or really a game either)-Music that sounds like a drunk man with a slide guitar-Lack of combat diversity (Repetitiveness-Plethera of game breaking bugs-Overly simplistic/Lack of detailFinal Rating: 2/10			"

												This game is fun for a short while, but I very quickly realized it was not even close to being worth its full price. Reasons are below:(If you want a quick summary, read the bold text at the bottom.)Mediocre gameplay.The crafting system is decent at best, and leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that you have no idea how to get what you want to get until you experiment for 2 hours or just give up and search the answer online is NOT what I call a good learning curve.The combat is okay, but nothing to be amazed at. Melee is timing so that you hit stuff and don't get hit. Ranged is... too easy. Have a bunch of arrows, shoot them at enemies until they flop over. Which leads to the next point:Bad balance.The game doesn't even seem to be trying to give players viable options. There is no multiclassing here, unless you want to end up super weak compared to pure characters. And even then there is only one good choice. It's a pain in the butt to regenerate any health in the game, and magic doesn't recharge fast enough to be useful. The result? Archery is the most OP  path to choose. As soon as you get a bow and enough arrows (which doesn't take that long) you can steamroll pretty much the whole game without getting hit once.Lack of content.Magicite attracts with its glowy effects, cool-looking dungeons and spells, etc... but in the end there just isn't that much in it. Enemies have like 2 attack patterns - charging straight at you or shooting projectiles. The few that attack sort of differently appear rarely, and even then they're not really a challenge as long as you use OP archery. Melee weapons and tools progress in straight tiers, and there are only two types of melee weapon that you can craft. Magic? There are three staves and they're rather boring. Ranged weaponry? There is literally just a bow. That's it. It doesn't even upgrade.SUMMARY:- Gameplay gets dull quickly.- Crafting is annoying to learn and serves as artificial difficulty.- Game balance is broken.- Most enemies have no real variety apart from shooting more projectiles or being larger.- I've seen more content in free flash games.If you must get it, don't get it at full price.

												Magicite can be especially fun during the beginning. It can have very difficult variables as well so it can be very tough to pass the first level. But what makes this game truely fun is the fact that multiplayer is available. Multiplayer can be so frustrating and so fun at the same time that it makes this game very enjoyable with your friends. Trying to get past the first level took me and my friends atleast 1 hour or more because we either died or didn't know what we were doing. Singleplayer is alright, and I would say even more difficult but you have alot more control over the game without you having to worry about your friends dying or baiting you into death. I also would like to acknowledge that the hats, races and companions are a nice variant to the gameplay and give you a challenge/goal to achieve along the way.  Overall, I would give this game a 8.5/10.			"

												Its a great game but depending on RNG you can die the moment after you start due to a strong enemy. I've beaten the game twice and both winning play through's clocked in at just about 2 hours. It doesn't really have a steep learning curve, the enemies all have attack patterns that you can learn, crafting is simple but levels are randomized. Even with the short playthroughs I've made around 18 characters with only 2 wins, the game can be hard and unforgiving at times.To progress you must get through a level and reach the door at the end, this will bring you to a town where you can buy and sell items and craft armor, in the town is the door to the next area and so the cycle repeats until you get to area 20 where you fight the last boss and hopefully win.The game lets you pick a class/ ability when you level up [level's 5, 10 & 15] and you can choose to be a warrior, a mage or a ranger. The game also has unlock-able races, pets and hats that have you complete a challenge on your play through to unlock and so encourages replayability. "

												This game is amazing and insanely fun. The multiplayer works great (considering you have a friend you work well with). Once you begin to figure out how each enemy works you start to get further and further into the caves and it just feels GREAT when you roll a great character.Here are a few tips if you decide to get it:1. Stock up on Herbs, because you eventually might stop seeing them later when you really need them.2. If you're playing multiplayer, decide who should carry what items, it will save you both inventory space (also COMMUNICATE)3. When making a character, I'd highly recommend ""rerolling"" the character until you get the ""Potion Maker"" skill. I think it's definately the most helpful one.			"

Early Access Review
								At first I didn't expect this game to be so much fun. I didn't believe that an Early Access game canbe so good. And why is it so good? I'm here to tell you.It's simple. You will understand how everything works very soon and after that, you just keep improvingyourself more and more until you finally beat the game!Now of course, it may be boring for people who don't like repetitive things because trust me, this game is hard and you will need to play it from the beginning many times. But it's worth reaching the high levels.9/10. This game has so much potential and it's already very good and addictive! Easy to learn, hard to master.I really recommend it to you. Cheap fun game.

												Magicite is just perfect:-nice indie-graphics-some normal bosses and one endboss-chance to play with friends-several ways of fighting (warrior, archer, mage)-many items, weapons & armorBUT...-multiplayer is complicated & does not always work-some glitchesbut I think it's not a big deal.Just pure perfection "

Early Access Review
								The core experience is addictive.  Another game riding the voxxel-pixel craze.  Since it's early access I pray they fix the bugs.  You'll notice minor things like weird hit boxes in solo but the DIY co-op multiplayer is so buggy it's far from playable, characters blink around and I experienced what others have dubbed the black screen glitch.  I liked the fact you could rez downed comrades especially.  The difficulty level is balanced, but the random generated levels can be unpassable at times.Graphics are only ok sadly, but I expected as much.  They seemed to do the same ol' pixel art despite the gui engine seemigly of hi potential.  Chances are if you like Risk of Rain or voxxel side scrollers you'll want to pick this up.  I couldn't get any of the Key binding to work, which is important to a lot of people especially dasabled gamers which I am.  Def not for everybody as is, but its potential is huge...also it looks simular but is truly nothing like terraria or it's many clones either.  Thanks dev's!  I look forward to more :D			"

												One of the most challenging, yet fun video game I've played in a while. Magicite has a unique style of gameplay, where you can get different traits/rolls to start with. Not only that, but there are custom generated worlds. But to top it off, I believe my favorite part in this game is the different variety of weapons and tools. I was quite down because you couldn't save your progress, but you could then unlock items to start with, which somewhat made it alot better. This is a pretty unique game, and I definetly recommend it, but some requirements are suggested:-Be good at default platformer-Have ""OK"" expirience with a mix of Bullet Hell and Crafting Games.-Have fun!This game can be quite rage-inducing, but it can be really fun once you get used to it. :D "

												If you already familiar with Terraria and Risk of Rain, this game combines both. You start with choosing a class to play with (only 1 class available at the first, the rest need to be unlocked). Each class have different stats and starting item. As your character spawn in randomly generated level, you start to collect some item to craft gear,food (did i mention you must eat to keep your character alive? Don't Starve!),weapon,etc. There's some different obstacles/enemies on your level based on it's biome. Each enemy has different attack method.As you kill enough enemies, you gain level. At level 5,10 and 15 you have to choose a skill. There's three kind of skill tree you can choose : Mage, Warrior, Ranger. Each has different function and please note that you can only choose the skill tree, the skill itself is randomly given. As you complete the first level, you can pick 1 of 3 door to enter, it's color tell which biome you'll spawn at the next. Before you spawn at the next level, you visit a town to craft clothes,weapon,buy item, etc. As the game continue, you'll find harder enemies and obstacles that make you sure, this game isn't easy at all.+ Nice gameplay+ Unique crafting system ( if you don't read the wiki :p )+ Tons of unlockables+ Different enemies with different method to kill+ Multiplayer ( Haven't try myself though )+ More to come- Small inventory slot sometimes make manage your item difficult- Some sort of bug (maybe?) as you shoot your arrow, if you pick up the used arrow at the ground, the arrow will be at your inventory instead of your bow arrow slot. Not much- Makes you rage at bees and even slimesOveral : 4.5/5			"

So difficult at the beginning, seems a really skilled roguelike with a weak character, instead you need to get used to the system and craft a lot to survive, once you start mastering your crafting this game becomes so enjoyable, nice one!

												So yeah, I love this game but after a while it's kinda bleh. The combat gets repetetive and boring after a while and the enemies are the same. The enemies are just retextured versions of eachother. The combat is just you standing next to an enemy and clicking Left mouse button until it dies. Other than that the art style is nice and the town music is soothing. a small tutorial would be nice and after you craft something that tip at the bottom should dissapear. Also, inventory space is a big problem after you start getting stuff because crafting become a hassle. There should be a side gui for crafting somewhat like minecraft since everything is made with 2 components. If not that, then backpacks should be a craftable item of varying size depending on the materials used (regular hide for small sized backpack, and then like in increases by 2 slots every tier) Infact I actually like that idea of backpacks more than a side gui. Or both. but that seems eccessive being that there are not a lot of items. I feel like there should be more weapons and that skills should be able to be picked. And character creation is little to none, which subtracts from the rpg side of this. You should also be able to pick what traits and stats you want since I end up clicking away at the stats button till I get what I want anyways; so it seems pointless to make traits and stats random, more like a waste of time to me. Also the amount of multiplayer bugs is crazy. Loading into an area is always scary and it's super laggy. I wouldn't reccomend buying this if you're just wanting to play with your friends because I have to say the multiplayer isn't worth it right now. TL;DR:Pros:- Cute Art Style- Easy to learn- (atleast in my opinion) The music in the towns is really nice.Cons:- repetetive combat for all classes (really lacking in diversity)- inventory too small- character creation is little too none, and takes WAY too long due to the fact that your stats and traits are completely random everytime you make a new character.*EDIT*: To be completely honest, there is a very VERY easy way to fix all of this. Make the game modable. Because then modders could fix bugs and add more, and make the game great again! GUYS, VOTE MODS, #MakeMagiciteGreatAgainRating: 5/10I love the game but it's also really frusterating and I'd recommend waiting until more updates come. *DOUBLE EDIT*: He said he's not updating the game anymore, r.i.pSeriously tho if you're not gonna update it then make it modable so others can do what you don't have the time for!

												The lack of sound effects is particularly jarring for an action platformer. Most of the game would be played in silence but for the music.The crafting system is unintuitive and cumbersome. Some streamlining here would go a long way.The random generation is nice, but gameplay gets surprisingly stale very quickly.Could be a pretty good game with some more work in the right areas, but as it stands now I don't find it incredibly fun. You can't just add a poor crafting system to a genre and call it a day.			"

												Magicite is a Rogue-like game in which you progress through several floors under a sertain time limit while hunting creatures, gathering resources and collecting items. If you have heard that this game is a clone of Terraria then make sure that whoever said that to you has actually played the game, yes the art style and concepts are similar but the gameplay and a whole load of other things a very different. I've played a decent amount of the game and have fallen in love with it. i would say one of my top 5 favourite games now. be careful when playing though, its VERY ADDICTIVE. I ended up pulling an all-nighter without realising just because i was playing this. I would recommend this game to anyone, just maybe one or two games at a time...			"

												Most would say that this is a Terraria clone, or something similar. I disagree; it's got pixelated graphics, and you can mine ores. Oh yeah, you can also kill monsters with magic, melee weapons, or bows. The similarities end there.Magicite is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer/rougelike/permadeath game, and it's incredibly fun. You can spend ages working on your character, only to see him (or her) brutally murdered, never to be seen again. You can get killed by a pirate penguin, over and over and over again until you figure out how to dodge. You can also get the game-breaking ghost pet and jump across the roof of every stage and never take damage. I'd recommend it. 9/10.Tl;dr It's not a Terraria clone, it has permadeath and is 2D, buy it.			"

												I'd liken magicite to The Binding of Isaac - it is a rogue-like game that starts you off with nothing and when you die, you die.  It can be really fun to play if you get a good run going or frustrating as hell if you simply can't get that far.  It is highly addictive and I find myself coming back to it again and again - something about the simplicity of it is very attractive.  Overall - I've played this game a hell of a lot more than other games - I'd give it about 70% - it's a pretty fun game!			"

												Sadly, this is a ""don't buy"" if you're looking mainly for a co-op game to play with a friend.  I really love Magicite, but it seems like 1 in 3 games lately have been ended prematurely by bugs that cause one player to lag out and drop the game or even fall through the level endlessly.  Moreover, the melee play-style is frustrating and severely underpowered compared to ranged and magic, so there are only two viable skill paths to take instead of three.  These issues could be fixed with updates, but haven't been in spite of a long standing and unanimous request from the community.			"

Early Access Review
								Playable, funny, adorable, challenging, and charming.  Everything you want in an Early Access Game.The people who say this game is too difficult obviously must not have experience with roguelikes and/or 2D platformers.This game is not too difficult.  It is challenging, and you have to tread carefully - but it is very much playable and very enjoyable.There are a few glitches that can get annoying - like sometimes in a multiplayer game, certain players will just fall through the floor and will have to disconnect (and can't get back in).  That can get annoying - but since it's a roguelike, starting over is hardly the end of the world.Either way, I bought the 4 pack, have given it to a few of my friends, and we are all having a blast.

Posted: July 1, 2014
												This game caught my attention immediately due to the graphics: it looked very colourful and full of lights. Since this kind of graphics always catches my attention, I started watching some gameplays until I started playing myself.What I found was a very cool mix between a roguelike, a platformer and a survival. And VERY hard.> PROSGraphically, the game looks very nice: a pixelated style mixed with very shiny colors. Quite appealing to the eyes according me.The crafting system is very simplified (click two items to combine them) but for a game like this I think that it's just perfect.The combat system does not accept ""LEEROY JENKINS"" people: attack enemies recklessly will 90% sure end with your own death. Being careful is the key and good players who learn this will be prized.> NEUTRAL and VARIABLESince this game is still in development, there are some things missing, like a main menu music, some sounds effects and also some little bugs. But the game is fully playable.The crafting itself can be a little nuisance for newbies. First of all, there is no in-game instruction for how to craft certain items, like a sword (which you need to fight enemies). If from a side, part of the fun is discover how to make it, on the other side can appear a little annoying, especially because items don't last forever and you'll have to try all possible combinations to discover how to make a sword, an axe or a pick, unless you have a guide.But on a positive side, since crafting is very simplified, it's easy to memorize them.The controls also are an headscratcher, but this depends by the person. Surely who never played Minecraft will learn quickly how to play this, but in my case sometimes happens that I try to open the inventory with ""E"" (which is a dash to the right) instead of ""R"", making me run into traps by accident. Plus, moving a pointer (used to attack, especially with arrows) using the mouse can be a little disorienting: it works on first person games like Minecraft but for this, which controls the camera and can even go over the character view, can give some problems. Especially when you have to attack an enemy and you have to move the mouse from a side to another. Sometimes I forget to do this because I mostly press buttons. But this is subjective and other people can be perfectly OK. Plus, I think that those controls give this game its difficulty.> CONSSo far, the only true con I found in this game is this: the lack of a save feature.Did you just made a great run but now you are tired, you want to close the game and rest a little?Well, too bad: if you do, you lose everything. You have two choices only: die or finish the game. I hope that a save feature will be implemented in the future.> VERDICTThis game is HARD. You must learn to master the controls and all the various mechanics before you can even go over the first district. But once you learn, I can guarantee it will be a fun experience.I personally like a lot roguelikes because of their high repleyability and this is no exception, thanks to the various unlockable things (classes, hats, companions and so on) which can make each run different.The game has still some features to be implemented so probably there are more and more updates on the way. I will update this review accordingly.> VOTE7 / 10			"

												An enjoyable little platformer. This is not like terraria in that it is not sadbox, its just a roguelike with some weapon and item crafting. You die a lot, but thats okay because the more you play the more stuff you unlock, great replayability. I Would give this game an 8/10.			"

Early Access Review
								This game, although not finished yet, is a good game for short bursts. Extended play DOES get boring, as all the stages go from left to right. I would love some scailing and falling levels, as well. Not scrolling.But, none the less, this game IS fun. Even more so if you have friends of yours playing with you. But dont expect to win the game easily. It is HARD. At times. The levels are called ""Districts"" Which I find nice, instead of ""Level one"" Level two"" The skills are nice, as well. Levitate's Hover Box tip- ""Makes your friends jealous"" xD Wolf's Hover Box tip- ""Spawns a wolf that kills♥♥♥♥♥♥""The hats do bring a nice touch of reward, as well. (If you think your the best Magicite player, I DARE YOU to reach district fifteen with The Scourge Hat. For those who dont know,  It DRAINS your health as you play. )I cant give this game a full reivew, as its not finished yet. I will when the game finishes, but, in it's current state, I reccomend it. Buy it.			"

												If you're a lover of platforming adventures, you'll love this game.With colorful and engaging graphics, a neat soundtrack, and incredible replayability, Magicite will keep you hooked for hours. At least, it kept me hooked. Personally, I enjoy the game for its simplicity and oh so adorable content.The rogue-like RPG you'll find yourself playing can be frustrating at times, but well worth the play. The game has a lot of unlockable content including races, companions, and HATS! Because the creator is still updating the game, there is sure to be more fun to come.Once again, if you like platforming, adventure, RPG, unlockables, colorful animations, and a good CHALLENGE, buy Magicite. You won't regret it.And did I mention you can play with your FRIENDS?! Me gusta.			"

												Don't let the charming graphics give you a false sense of security. This game is is waiting to feast on your rotting corpse and shattered dreams.Side-scrolling action game with light RPG and crafting elements that has you gathering resources, slaying beasties, finding powerful items, and losing said items all while dying repeatedly. It can be challenging at times, but with practice, a mighty warrior such as yourself will surely overcome this task!The game controls well, has a clean/simple interface, and has nice art and sound. There's multiplayer too! You can watch your friend get killed by a slime because he just needed to get one more swing in on that tree.The game has also been receiving steady updates that add things like new races, pets, items, and enemies.

												Initially watched Pyropuncher's lets play of this game, I purchased it a little while ago due to the interest of wanting to play it and boy is it worth it, Magicite as the description says it's a rpg- style 2D platformer that has simple controls and a simple goal, reach the end game boss the Scourge. Currently it is still in an alpha/beta kind of stage but so far the game has run very smoothly minus the one or two crashes with the game but I do not take it to heart as Magicite is still playable.It has little to no bugs when playing the game and it well worth the time playing, in the beginning it is an absolute rage- inducer when you have no idea in how to play the game or to dodge damage. Given time it becomes very fun and a great challenge, the character is customisable with different races, different hats, companions and varieties of a race. It allows for a good variety of gameplay and the flexibility to tweak your character's stats.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a rpg challenge and something different, I do not regret buying this as I am enjoying this game and am even making a new lets play on it.

												This game actually had more content then I thought when I first got it, it's pretty easy to pick up and a good time killer. (not to mention it's addicting)You can choose between a multitude of classes once you unlock them, equip them with hats that each have their own perks, mine ores to build better swords, pickaxes, or armor. You can make elemental staffs, and theres a unique leveling system that you can fit to your play style, whether you want to go balls deep as a tanky melee, or sit back and cast spells as a mage, or perhaps shoot arrows with massive dexterity as an archer. The creator keeps coming back and bringing wonderful patches as well, adding more classes, items, and pets.This game is entirely up to you how you want to play it and that's whats so cool about it.I give it a 10/10, would recommend.

												Getting this game gifted to me on Steam last week was the best thing that happened to me this month game wise, and those are some big shoes to fill and I’ll tell you why. Magicite is a piece of procedurally generated genius, packed with hours of fun and intuitive game play. If it wasn’t for DOTA 2 I would have jumped on this game months ago, but that was consuming all of my time along with my Steam wallet. I saw this game in the Steam Greenlight forums and investigated further and found a very generously funded Kickstarter.I was attracted by Magicite and its pixel graphics immediately, hard for me to compare, leaving Magicite in a field of its own. Since my affair with Terraria, these 2-D platformer games always seem catch my eye. Much like Terraria but even more like Castelvania: Symphony of The Night, Magicite is addicting like that first bite of sriracha covered chicken. Rougelike, with a crafting system and the ability to build weaponry and utilize merchants in town to make armor or melt ore, this semi-sandbox game is brilliant.“Explore, craft, and survive in this Multiplayer RPG Platformer with permanent death. Featuring many Roguelike elements, Magicite randomly generates each underground dungeon for you and your friends to delve deep into. Chop trees, mine ores, and hunt beasts in order to collect the resources and materials you need to survive in the harsh and unforgiving environment. With a ton of character traits, stats, companions, and classes, players will have a different experience each play through. Be prepared to die… A LOT.” – MagiciteEach world and town being randomly generated along with your characters starting stats keeps this game fresh. Before you begin each game, you decide what character you want to play. Depending on which hero you choose, you’re given select attributes that go along with that characters race. Another thing keeping Magicite fresh and new is the unlockable item system. The more you play, the more races you unlock, the more items and companions you unlock.  Each of the unlockable items have a boost attributed to them, so when equipped to your hero it stacks with his stats.For every item you craft and enemy you kill, you gain experience points and levels. When you level up, like most games your stats are buffed, and every 5 levels you are able to choose a magic ability. These abilities are divided into 3 different categories; Melee, Magic and Ranged. With 5 special abilities per category every 5 levels offers something new aiding in your quest. Certainly a complex game, you must keep track of your health, weapon durability, and much like real life you need to stay fed. In early game, you will find it hard when trying to attack enemies, so focusing on gathering materials before engaging in a fight is usually a good strategy. Enemies can be as easy as a pig or murderous as a toxic lava ball spitting dinosaur, and everywhere in between. But watch out for the scourge, they leave no one alive in their wake, and are only summoned after spending too much time in a stage.Magicite is a fast paced game, and its good for hours of fun, or a few minutes trying to kill time before work. One of the best things about a rougelike is its ability to pull you in for hours and watch you fall violently from grace after building an epic hero. Even more fun is the multiplayer aspect of Magicite, easily its best feature so far. Playing with your friends and sharing finds is even more fun. My first play through was with one of my former DOTA 2 team mates, so it was a blast from the start, as he was able to give me a few pointers to ease me into the game. A money system is also present in Magicite and certainly serves a purpose. The gold is obtained from killing enemies, found in treasure chests, or when selling unneeded items in town. Town is where you will craft your gear and cook your food, but if you choose not to, you can save up enough for some gnarly sword that does serious damage.When you die, and the game ends you are given score. This also is a layout detailing your gameplay from kills to potions brewed. I love games that do this, because after 45 minutes of gaming you find yourself looking to improve and get better for the next round. Their is no word that describes this game other than fun. With every character having his own back story, all the different biomes and unbelievable imagery; it’s like I always say, the little things make a game as truly awesome as it is.Graphics: 8/10Playability: 7/10Story: 8/10Challenge: 8/10Replay Value: 9/10			"

												Simplistic, yet possesses vast potential. Randomized levels give some replayability, but at the moment the content will run out fast (as it is very addictive and makes you play it over and over again). Some class balancing issues aside, this is a nice fun game that unlocks more starting options as you play it more and more... until you've unlocked everything you readily can. Probably aimed a bit at cooperative multiplayer than single player gameplay. The difficulty is a combined factor of bad luck with random generation and character's squishiness. Has glitches, but did not encounter any that prevented me from enjoying the game. The skeletal framework is there for an insanely great game, but it still needs flesh. Lots of flesh.			"

												I ate a small porkchop then immediately took a dump the size of myself. 10/10Ok but in all seriousness, I have a legit review: This game is a very nice blend of familiar and unique mechanics. The pixel art is stylish and when i say ""pixel"", dont get your hopes down; the nice pixel art blends very well with the colorful, and smooth shading, and the animations are very well done. Magicite will remind you of Terraria, but its executed in more of an acrade-ish manner, with a leveling system and different randomized stages/levels. The deaths are permanent, yet each time you go through this onslaught of cultural fabulousness, you earn rewards through different tasks such as new playable characters unlocked by doing things such as killing X amount of monsters, or obtaining a rare item, that will stay with you forever.

												I really love this game and I play it with my friends a lot! There's great replayability and the art it beautiful, but there's just a little something that needs to be added. The trailer specifically states that they found hope with ""Magicite"", but what the heack is it?It's not even in the game that it was named after, and I think if ""Magicite"" was added to the game and had some purpose, then the story/RPG-feeling of the game would be much better and you'd probably feel like there's more purpose to the game than just getting to the end of the level and winning. I hope that the developers take my idea into concideration.But with that aside, overall this is probably one of my favorite games of all time!			"

												I adore this game, It's a very well built rogue. The best aspect of this game, in my opinion, is the permanent death. The permanent death has an influence on a player's decision making. It gives the player a sence of creativity. Permanent death gives forces a player to find creative ways to combat enemies instead of just lunging into battle. Even though this game is still unfinished, I believe it has great potention and has come a long way. I would 100% reccomend this game.			"

												An awesome RGP, you can play solo or with friends, magic, mosters, and more. you can even get hats that give you different abilities and different ""species"" of people like the oreclops that lets you start with a bone pickaxe and sword that does a crazy amount of damage, it's a great game that lets you explore this new world filled with mayhem and chaos "

								Playable, funny, adorable, challenging, and charming.  Everything you want in an Early Access Game.The people who say this game is too difficult obviously must not have experience with roguelikes and/or 2D platformers.This game is not too difficult.  It is challenging, and you have to tread carefully - but it is very much playable and very enjoyable.There are a few glitches that can get annoying - like sometimes in a multiplayer game, certain players will just fall through the floor and will have to disconnect (and can't get back in).  That can get annoying - but since it's a roguelike, starting over is hardly the end of the world.Either way, I bought the 4 pack, have given it to a few of my friends, and we are all having a blast.

								This game, although not finished yet, is a good game for short bursts. Extended play DOES get boring, as all the stages go from left to right. I would love some scailing and falling levels, as well. Not scrolling.But, none the less, this game IS fun. Even more so if you have friends of yours playing with you. But dont expect to win the game easily. It is HARD. At times. The levels are called ""Districts"" Which I find nice, instead of ""Level one"" Level two"" The skills are nice, as well. Levitate's Hover Box tip- ""Makes your friends jealous"" xD Wolf's Hover Box tip- ""Spawns a wolf that kills♥♥♥♥♥♥""The hats do bring a nice touch of reward, as well. (If you think your the best Magicite player, I DARE YOU to reach district fifteen with The Scourge Hat. For those who dont know,  It DRAINS your health as you play. )I cant give this game a full reivew, as its not finished yet. I will when the game finishes, but, in it's current state, I reccomend it. Buy it.			"

												Magicite is a very unique game of it's genre. It's hard to make a rogue-like runner in the form of a platformer, but Magicite pulls it off quite nicely. It's a little hard to pick up, as the game is kinda played by trial and error for a few hours, but once you get into it, Magicite becomes a great expirience. I will say, you can't get too many hours out of it, as there is only one game mode, but there are plenty of challanges to face for the unlocks. However, There doesn't seem to be anything to look forward to, as when the game came out of early access, the developer left it alone.I'd give it an 8.6/10			"

												This game is just..wow. I love it. I can't stop playing. It's so easy to lose track of time. I've played 11+ hours and it felt like I only played for 5 hours. People will say it's like minecraft and other games similar but don't knock it till you try it. It's worth the money and I like that you can play with friends. I currently don't have anyone who I know playing this yet, so I have yet to explore the adventure with others. The art style is just sooo cute. I love the slimes the best. This game starts of super cute and fun with the slimes, bunnies and pigs but go into the wrong portal and hell awaits. I think it's a fun way to explore diffrent places and a good way to test how good you are at the game. It may be a little sad when you die and you got so far but each time you play you get better and better. Just don't stay still for a long time....you will face the horrible fate that has come across you.			"

												I really recommend this game, it's Terraria meets FTL. It's a perma-death survival-platformer-rpg and it pulls it off really well. It has a good soundtrack, and great pixel art graphics. It has really good controls and every playthrough is different and interesting. You may need to check the wiki for crafting recipes and the like, but you won't need to check it that often after a few playthroughs. Once you've learned the crafting recipes and how to play, you can get started really quickly so death isn't too annoying. It's quite difficult and can be very challenging sometimes. Finally, it has multiplayer functionality.			"

												This is one of the best games that I've ever played with my friends.If you have a group of friends that can (somewhat) manage to work together, or even if you dont,messing around in this game is fun either way!I have played this game a ton, and here are some of the things I found that make this game so appealing:+ The levels are randomized every time you play to keep it interesting.+ Lots of customization with traits, races, pets, hats and stat rolls.+ EXP is shared! That's right! So if you have that one friend who storms through the level and kills everything while you   are peacefully catching fairies, you get all the EXP that they do too!+ 3 different ""Skill Trees"" so to speak, based around Magic, Dexterity, and Strength. So you can be an archer, mage,   warrior, or even try to create a mix between them with the game's varied weapon choice.+ Many different bosses that will kill you over and over with their plethora of unique, (yet annoying,) skills.+ Replayability! I want to say that I've beat this game at least 10 times, while I've played it around 50 times. Even if you   beat the final boss, It's never over. There are so many hats and races to unlock that you can invest hours into running   the dungeon over and over with your friends!+ Level scaling. Don't have any friends? That's ok because they make the game harder anyway! The bigger the number   of players, the stronger the enemies are! But that also means 4 times the resources to compensate.+ An amazing soundtrack that is both ambient and exciting!+ While this game has a pixel-style vibe to it, it's still beautiful! The glowing effects, the details in the landscape, the   blood of your enemies on the floor...+ The game is updated frequently. Tired of running through the same levels over and over? Don't worry! The game   developers release patches and updates very frequently to add new biomes, weapons, races, or even just bug fixes.Are you sold yet? Yes? Well then before you buy it at least let me tell you about a few problems...- This game is a work in progress so there are bound to be a few small bugs here and there but they get fixed pretty   quick.- The mechanic to sell items is still a little unbalanced. (ex. a single stick could be worth 3 gold, and then a diamond   sword could also be worth 2-3 gold.)- This game IS a rogue-like so if you die, you have to start from the very beggining again. (I personally find this as a   plus, but most of my friends think otherwise.)- You have to be able to port foward or at least use hamachi if you want friends to join your game. (Again I don't think   this will be much of a problem for most people but i decided to list it anyway.)- Becase of the random stat roller, it can take a long time to roll good stats with equally good traits, or if you are   looking for a specific build, (Mine is Potion Brewer + Swift).- Although the developers have been very good about fixing connection issues, some people may still lag or disconnect   from the game, though most of the time that's just because of their internet.Obviously there are a few more bugs that I haven't mentioned, but they will probably get fixed over time and I didn't want this to just be a bug list.And that's it! Overall the cons really aren't that bad or game breaking, and I would definitely give this game a try! It's worth the money, and if your friends can afford it, then even better! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go try to beat the new boss, Axelark III... for the 7th time...			"

								This is a fanstic game.  If you enjoy platformers, rougelikes, crafting/resource exploration games and really good pixel graphics, this game is for you.  Even in early access the game is replayable over and over.  Sean, Magicite's designer, is also awesome.  He is very active and wants to give a great game to the community.  Overall I am super pleased with this.  It is a really nice game to pickup for 30 minutes here and there to have fun, or spend hours destroying it.			"

												I have wanted this game for a while. It went on sale, so I bought it. This game isn't for everyone. I will however list off some pros and cons. This game is a pixel graphics rougelike. If you like terraria or minecraft, or any other voxel/pixel graphics game this still might not be for you.Pros:Many different UNLOCKABLE races to choose frome.A lot of UNLOCKABLE hats that gives buffs(and a few that give debuffs for those who like a challenge)It's not easy (LIKE REALLY who likes an easy rougelike)A vareity of different UNLOCKABLE looks for the races.Some UNLOCKABLE companions that do some pretty cool stuff.Cons:It sometimes becomes very reptative.There are few skills to choose from, and are givin at random depending on the tree you pick.There are only 3 different magic attacks for the mages.It can take quite a while to complete a single playthrough(If you don't just suck and die instantly).All the races/hats/companions have to be unlocked.Did I already mention repatative. I did didn't I. It's repatative.			"

												Awesome game!  I thoroughly enjoy this game.       Each time you die, you start over.  But the experience is never the same.  It has a great replay value for several reasons.  First of all, the dungeons are randomized.  You will never see the same dungeon twice, which really keeps things interesting.  Second, you can play with friends.  Play through by yourself, and then get a different gaming experience by playing with some friends.  Third, you unlock a ton of cool stuff!  When you play though the game, if you get far enough, you will unlock new races, variations, hats, and companions.  All of this stuff keeps the game fresh, even after you have played through it a few times.     Another aspect of the game that I really enjoy is that this game is a challenge.  If you enjoy challenging games, then you will probably enjoy this.  If you are new to gaming, or just prefer casual games, this game might not be your cup of tea.     The biggest downside is that the game really needs an update, as it lacks balance in a few areas.  For example, I feel like the warrior falls off too hard.  He becomes really useless towwards the end.   Also some of the perks seem really useless.  Other than that though, this game is great and one of my favorite steam purchases so far.  "

												Type of Game:PDL (Procedural Death Labyrinth) with a focus on craftingVersion Played:PC version through SteamMagicite Build 0.7.5Similar Games:Spelunky, Terraria, Rogue Legacy, and to a lesser degree Risk of RainThe Good:- The overall sense of wonder and exploration as the player progresses in the game keeps it exciting and engaging- The crafting system is deep and relatively intuitive, which helps with the overall feeling of discovery that the game continually conveys- Experience point generation leads to leveling up the player’s skills in different manners that can complement a player’s style of gameplay- Current skill trees are strength, intelligence, and dexterity- Procedurally generated biomes that feature random enemies, resources, and loot drops- Weapon and tool crafting has the potential to attach bonuses to the stats, which can greatly improve a player’s chance of survival- Character creation has different benefits with each character that the player unlocks through game progression- The game is quite difficult, but as is the manner of this genre, it adds to the sense of accomplishment when the player beats a previous record or level- Multiplayer is a blast and can really encourage proper teamwork and planning due to the difficulty level of the game in general- The developer(s?) Sean Young is constantly responding to feedback within the steam forums and also implements many of the ideas brought up by the community- Updates and patches to the game are common and consistent, which keeps the experience fresh and exciting- Hats!The Bad:- As expected there a quite a number of bugs in this version, which mostly reside in the user interface         - As explained above, many bugs are known and are being addressed in future releases- While multiplayer is a blast, the process to start a network game with others is not very intuitive and may leave some non-techie gamers fustrated- When first starting out with the game, the crafting system and difficulty can seem overwhelming and may scare off players that don’t bother to hang with it. This could be remedied with a comprehensive in-game tutorial that explains the basics of the early gameplay.- Having a timer for each level can be a bummer as this is a crafting-heavy experience. Since crafting doesn’t have a craft-book or interfaced crafting system, early players will be spending a lot of time Alt-Tabbing between the game and the wiki figuring out what resources build different items. That time will cost them dearly as the “scourge” will inevitably destroy them before they reach the end of the level.         -A streamlined crafting method would potentially address the feeling of a “cheap kill” and encourage the player to move swiftly through each level to avoid the scourgeCan you play it while the children are awake?:Sure. The game is pixelated and does not contain excessive gore. There are blood sprites, but again the retro look diminishes their effect.Did I make time to complete it?The version I played did not have a final boss, so the levels repeated endless or appeared to do so. I did, however, spend a lot of time playing the game with friends and found the experience very enjoyable!Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a greenlight.Magicite will appeal to any gamer who enjoys a challenge. The sense of exploration and achievement really encourages that feeling of wanting to play one more game when your last one ends. As a fan of the PDL genre, I highly recommend our readers pick this one up.A Quick Look At Those Games You Might Play:http://www.gamersglance.com/ "

												It is thanks to Markiplier that I actually took notice and interest in this game. It would seem as though that the trend for games is the 8-bit style of character design; some indie games specifically. With the game ""Magicite"" however, despite this design it does not disappoint. There is a continuous effervescent glow throughout the background and the enemies with which you fight. The music itself is rather fitting with the rest of the world which is both relaxing and has the potential of becoming sort of hypnotic if you happen to not be paying close-enough attention to what you're doing [ADHD for the lose]. The characters themselves which you get to play are both adorable and are formidable foes against the various monsters you hack and slash with; but it is not a hack-and-slash game as it is with the Diablo series...The down-sides:There aren't really any ""levels"" per-se; you are sort of plopped into the world. If you're a first time gamer or just simply a novice as I am; there's not really a tutorial, there aren't any sort of difficulty ranges you can work with [beginner, normal, hard, die-inside-it's-so-difficult]; there's just you being thrown into the world. While yes, that does make you feel like you need to fight for your life and gives your character a sense of purpose [based upon the back-story that the creator has made rather clear and very cool]. If you're going up against a boar (boars are♥♥♥♥♥holes in this game if you're a beginner) like any natural boar you're going to get charged at; and the gaming gods help you if you don't know which button the ""jump"" is. I did notice, took note and did my best to follow through with the [while very sincerely appreciated] guide to what you're supposed to do; it would have been nice to have some sort of walk-through within the game itself. The gaming guide is pretty long and the writer did in fact take the time to even put a disclaimer that basically says: ""Your eyes are going to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with ALL THE WORDS. FOR DAYS."" Which was smart of the writer to put on. Pixel Cheese is their name? Not sure, but no snark at all when I say: I am genuinely grateful for the time you took to write out this review. But what about some pictures for more of a better reference? While that does sound very immature; it also helps those who are more visually inclined and can help the gamer apply what you took the time to write in exchange for better game experience. Plus for the sake of efficiency the visual reference or perhaps a video you can insert into the tutorial would be beneficial as opposed to reading through all the words, and then finding the right video on Youtube of a ""let's play"" to see which situation said video is on can help you with precisely what you need. Texting a friend is always an option if that friend has played it before - however you do run the risk of getting your balls busted for it. Or in my case my ovaries busted. The controls are kind of finicky when you fight monsters. The ""WAD-etc"" controls are a bit to get used to; but the seasoned PC gamer will have no trouble. As for the n00bs such as myself... Trust me as you read this; it will take some getting used to, but you will get the hang of it. Despite the minor pain-in-the♥♥♥♥♥details I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10 in its simplicity, its music, the adorable-looking green monsters that you get to bash with a wooden ax, and over-all despite the 8-bit design it's rather polished. Color me impressed.As Captain Hook would say, ""Good form, Peter Pan!""  "

												I started playing Magicite about exactly when it hit version 1.0.  Since then, every update has only improved an already amazing game.  A brutal roguelike, this game punishes you for every mistake in combat, but gives you the tools to dodge, attack from a distance, and obtain a larger health pool, so that (most of the time) you can only blame yourself.  This isn't to say you can't get an overwhelming amount of bad luck.  Facing down two tyrannox, a bee, and a couple boars while dodging spiked blocks can (and likely will) happen to you right off the bat at some point, but most of the time, you get a fair chance to prepare or avoid such things.The crafting in Magicite is simple, minimal, essential, and for the most part, intuitive.  Once you understand that you can only combine two items, experimentation will likely result in figuring out how to make fires, cook food, make basic tools, and basic potions.  Very few things in the game are not obvious from basic crafting practice (drums and enhancing a certain rare sword).  Overall, it encourages enough item collection to enhance your character without feeling like a terrible grind.  The longest you ever have to grind is for enough sticks for arrows if you want to be an archer, but you'll need two easily obtained stacks at most.As for your character choices, you can customize a setup for your preference, but you usually have to choose to be a spellcaster, an archer, or a melee fighter.  Currently, melee is the easiest to power up your attack for, but also by far the hardest to play (because you are constantly in danger).  Archer's are the easiest to play, but require the most maintenance (you always need ammo), and spellcasters are somewhere in-between (not always easy to access the items for your basic staves, and a bad run of it with skills can make going out-of-mana a true hazard).  However, despite being locked into a less-than-obvious class choice, unlockable races, hats, and companions (companions being one of the most valuable, and most difficult, set of unlockable items) ensure you will have a lot of choices after you start playing through multiple times.Finally, multi-player.  This game needs work on its multi-player, but it's already fun (if you can set it up).  Currently it only supports LAN games normally, so some external networking effort is required to play over the internet.  In addition, playing with multiple people has a few bugs (that are being worked on) and some imbalances (which are currently not being addressed... yet).  Only the host can see the crystal nodes needed to ease the defeat of the final enemy (and, in fact, the only decent way a melee player can attack it).  Often you won't find enough ore for everyone to upgrade their armor (or melee's weapons), and there is only really enough for one archer's arrows (which is just as well, since they have it easier).  Food also becomes a lot more scarce, because you have multiple people growing hungry, and while the enemies have more hp in a multiplayer game, they do NOT drop more food or become more plentiful.  That all said, playing with a friend can be a very fun and rewarding experience.All in all?  Buy this game.  Play this game.  Love this game.			"

												I think this game was more like terraria but it wasn't.this is actually different, it has it's own charm!I played it with my friends , got it 4-packed when it was on autumn saleand it worths every pennyok, here is my review, pro things about it : the game has crafting elements like minecraft but you are able to choose class and you will get your initial equipment base on your class. This game is not forgiving, if you died (or your whole party is) you have to play again from the beginning but I think that's the fun part is. You learn how to craft different things from each play and getting better. I have played like 20 -30 rounds so far and still not able to beat it.things I dont like: I don't like the multiplayer feature when you actually have to put your mate's IP address manually (same thing to risk of rain). and it's buggy on my mate's macbook, he got black few times when loading a new level. and when you open inventory for first time, there is a chance that the game will lagged for few seconds (due loading new objects on unity --  I believed) .  and there is a bug where the game loading two different levels to entire party, so I ended up in town and my friends are in dungeon and this one happen occasionally.I think the minus part is still forgiveable -- we enjoy it!Editted: we beat it! yahoo! so next target : unlock all races, hats and companion :)			"

								Absolutely wonderful mix of typically roguelike difficulty and reward. Lovely scaling model which means it can start quite difficult but can quickly develop into a smooth flow. Cutesy graphics and audio accentuate a simple control mechanism which actually works well - dying often doesn't result in mashed keyboards, but actually an admission of fault - I'll do better next time.Clever medling of MInecraft style crafting mechanic which again, is simple enough to pick up, I just hope this gets explored out further. For an early access game, it's fully loaded and as a result, comes fully recommended!			"

												Pros:+ Game is worthy of replayability, which is major for the genre.+ Multiple combinations aid in different play styles+ Unlockables everywhere+ Soundtrack+ Spells/Abilities aid in progression+ Crafting system forces better management of inventory+ Addicting+ Generic basic pixel-styling with some filters ease the eyesCons:- Enemies lack unique characteristics from each other during early game- Sound FX is ""RIP headphone users"" at best- Speed boosters + late game weapons/powers = quick game- Cheap shots from the developer late game due to distinct damage boosts and more hazards without proper build-up- Lack of recipe lists without online wikis- Several unlocks lack information in regards to unlocking- You'll spend half your time just shuffling for good combos and stats on startup- The perk shuffler is useless. Would be way easier to self-pick the perks instead of shuffling 10 times for the preferred combo- Axe's are next to useless due to the previous time adaptions for quicker weapons- Some abilities are just re-skins for different classes.7/10. Fun to play by yourself, or with friends. But, wastes a lot of your time with simple loadout arrangments and trips over itself with minor problems.Wait until more content comes before purchasing it at full price. The developer updates the game periodically, and cares about it, so that will come soon, perhaps.			"

								I recomend this game its cheap and fun. graphics are beautiful. For an early release game its pretty good. I cant wait to see the full version......aNY players who fin this game difficult can look up crafting wiki also dont go around hacking and slashing everything when you spawn. i recomend spawning in jungle its the easiest.

								If I had to describe it in terms of other game comparisons, Magicite is the beautiful love child of Super Meat Boy, Mario and Terraria. It's amazingly easy to pick up the basics, especially for a Roguelike, and I've used it to introduce a number of people to the genre who would have been otherwise turned off by it. The crafting is simple, nessisary and somewhat complex at the same time because of item combinations, but the combos are easy to learn and can be done straight from the inventory instead of needing to go into town and craft.The music is also brilliant, and even the current bugs are more funny than they are annoying.I know the game is still early, but my friends and I can't get enough, I'm more than happy that I kickstarted it and got eight keys to share.

The rpg elements and side scrolling rogue like gameplay is amazing, yet it is still early access this game has a lot of potential to be greater than it already is. It is really difficult and have not yet tried playing with friends but I can tell it will be even more challenging with resources being very scarce. I cannot wait to get even more playtime on it!!

												Great ♥♥♥♥ing game, I love the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.  Only problem with it, which is pretty disappointing as it's the reason I bought it, is the multiplayer.  It's dismal.  The lag is impossible to play with; characters and mobs flash when they die and half the time I can't see the other player's model.  Other than that, the thickness of the a in the logo is really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, so if that could be addressed as well I'd be thrilled.

												This game is basically a Rouge-like Terraria and it works amazingly. The basic goal of the game is to farm resources so you can become more and more powerful as you prepare for the progressingly difficult levels that you must face. STEPS:1. Cut down Trees. 2.

												Very addicting and replayable game. Nice combat, smooth interface and a simple approach to gameplay that is very refreshing. This game is very fun with a friend or two but certainly has it's flaws. The main flaws revolve around 3 things; balance, crafting, and luck. The balance is probably it's worst aspect. Damage and health values are all odd and there is almost no reason to stick to a melee weapon over a ranged bow or magic staffs. Too much risk vs low reward when using melee, even if you are skilled with it. Magic and bow wielders can inflict heavy damage from a distance with little to no risk on taking any damage. You can also hit enemies at a distance without aggroing them so there is literally nothing they will do to stop you. There are many other balance issues but I'll opt not to elaborate on those seeing as this one is my biggest gripe. The crafting system is fun but loses it's spark pretty quickly. It doesn't have much depth at all and after a while most of the resources that you gather become obsolete. Last but not least luck plays too big of a role. Randomized dungeons certain extend replayability but situations where you start off in a district and you're dealing with a big enemy blocking your path should be avoided. Also how lucky you get when gathering things can strongly affect how well you do.I didn't go too deeply into what's wrong with the game seeing as there is a bit. With that said I still reccomend the game. It's highly addicting and very fliud. There aren't many gameplay glitches and everything moves relatively quickly once you get started. Played with the right people this game is definitely a blast and I look forward to future updates that hopefully address  many of my concerns			"

												THIS IS A EARLY ACCSES REVIEWIts fun and hard and can get frustraiding sometimes but once you learn the crafting system and how to really fight in the game aka jumping and slashing or just using your abilitys.You will have a blast and when  you eat you take a massive dump so 10/10 would poop again  but for some people this might make you rage quit once you get into the farther levels it becomes really difficult well for me. The multiplayer is fun if you can make a server aka hamachi but my friends join one with out hamachi but i still think you have to make your own servers. All around its a great fun inde game that has potencial so You should get it it is worth the 10 bucks you have laying in your credit card waiting to be spent lol			"

Good game, but it could still be improved.I love the pixel-like graphic style and the crafting system, but it is annoying that there is no saving function. However, the game really needs a saving function, since you do not always have two hours time to play through the game. It must be possible to interrupt the game and continue it later!But if there finally a saving function is added to this amazing game, I would really appreciate that, so please do your job developers and add it! :D			"

Has a few bugs that should be fixed soon, since they're a good part of the game and not working correctly, but overall a pretty good game.Recommended in its current state to play a few hours, and even more for sure once it's final version is released.

								First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/magicite-first-impressions/ Rogue-like at its finest, and even better if you play with friends.Magicite, even in its early access stage, is a fantastic game. Being in early access, I'm excited to see what will become of the game, what will be added, etc. As it stands, the game is already very enjoyable, with no noticeable bugs (at least during my time with the game). The multiplayer is a bit wonky (the creating/joining of servers), but it works and the it's a blast to play with friends.My only complaint is the crafting system, which does not tell you how to make anything, but instead, encourages you to discover how everything is made. This is exactly how Terraria and Minecraft work though, so I can't really complain too much about it. However, the crafting in Magicite is done in a weird way. You only need two items in order to craft something, and that is done from the inventory. I ended up mindlessly combining different items to see what would result. I got a few cool things out of that, at least.I can definetely recommend Magicite, especially if you're looking to play it with friends. Although difficult, Magicite is an excellently crafted rogue-like game (wait, aren't all rogue-likes difficult?).			"

								Magicite is a roguelike rpg-platformer that features co-op, a pretty pixel graphic style with very fluid animations, a deep crafting system, and a multitude of areas to battle various original monsters in. Magicite can be tough at first like most roguelike games, but learning about what you can do and craft, or what you can kill and what kills you is what makes these kind of games fun. Magicite is fun when playing solo, but is more enjoyable with friends so invite all your chums to some cavern crawling, platform jumping, giant ax-swinging fun!			"

												Highly  recommended especially for those who enjoy games like Terraria and Starbound. I can be found  screaming at my monitor for every 10-20 minutes or so every time I play this game, throwing tantrums like a 2-year old at a supermarket... and yet I keep playing. Got it on sale for myself and now I wished that I had got the 4-pack on discount. As a single player it can be very addictive. As a multiplayer co-op game I think the fun would be in coordinating with your friends as well as having the back and forth banter trying to make sure everyone will not die of starvation or from being mauled by a wildboar.This game has the charm of classic and old school 2D games but with better graphics. Keep a wiki open on standby for recipes crafting and etc. There's no hand holding here. I wish the developers would make sandbox levels and non-permanent death options available. Oh please, please, please.... PRETTY PLEASE... and please make it able for players to save their progress. Update: For now I have decided to not bother playing till the next update, hopefully more playable rather than dealing with skyrocketing blood pressure levels everytime my character dies a permanent death... losing all progress... losing all hope.

												This game is beyond compare. The story, the war against the scourge, the gameplay, rougue-like and fast and even the graphics are outstanding. I highly reccomend this to all people of the gaming community, as its a hidden gem in the world.(ノ ゜Д゜)ノ ︵ ┻━┻			"

												An NPC randomly proclaimed to the village that he hated chicken, I proceeded to walk away, slaughter a chicken, pick up it coprse and repeatedly hit him in the face with it while yelling, ""IT DOESN'T LIKE YOU EITHER"" until he exploded in a glorious mist of golden coins. I continued to kill two oversized, extremely slow, mutated dinosaurs and several gels before eating the chicken, and falling prey to a large wasp. I then had to start all over again from scratch.10/10 would definitely rinse and repeat again.			"

												Great poop simulator!Food goes in, poop comes out.10/10 would play againIn all seriousness; I love this game.  It's a fun game with, or without, friends.  My brother has logged 62.8 hours into this game and we still love playing it.  Fun gameplay, good challenge, not overly frustrating (it is perma-death).I would highly recommend this game, it's still one of my favourites.			"

												Customization + Randomization + Brutal Difficulty + Multiplayer 2D-Side Scrolling Action + Crafting System + A whole lotta unlockables = Magicite. A game that doesn't hold your hand nor hesitate to crush your souls.I challenge you to beat this game using only melee weapons. Good luck!			"

												I couldn't figure out why there were so many positive reviews for this game prior to purchasing it for myself. Judging by the screenshots and seemingly simplistic idea behind the game, I figured it was just another indie rogue lite with nothing new to offer. Boy was I wrong. When I did finally decide to give in and buy Magicite while it was half off, I began playing the game to see what all the fuss was about. After about an hour or so of me becoming more and more heavily addicted to this wonderful creation of a videogame, I proceded to purchase another copy for a friend of mine so we could experience the glory of Magicite as a cooperative experience. I could go on and tell you of the heart pounding, exciting, and intense emotions that were involved; but I won't. Instead I will politely ask you to throw your money at your computer screen and spend hours upon hours dying over and over AND over again.I rate this game 10/10 for giving me one of, if not THE most enjoyable cooperative experiences of my life.

												This game started out hard but after a few runs and learning the movement of different monsters I found this game so addicting!!! After the first couple of stages you start to snowball into stronger gears and spells which makes it so much more fun, meanwhile you try to stay alive and not lose all the items you've fought for! After you think you've seen it all, you find out it also has MULTIPLAYER! Multiplayer is so much fun and I always get a good laugh out of it and a challenge! Amazing game, would totally recommend it to anyone who likes games like Terraria and Starcraft, but also to the people who like game where there's a lot of skill needed to stay alive, defeat enemies, and gather/farm equipments! 10/10! Keep updating us with more content weekly and I promise this game will be on the 1# indie gaming list soon!			"

												This game is magnificant! Just imagine combining Terraria and FTL all in one game! Not only do you get it's difficulty, but the joy of crafting and using those tools to survive and destroy thine enemies. If you want I made a video review on my YouTube channel detailing more on the game. This can help you decide whether or not this game is worth your time and money.Magicite Video Review: 


YouTube™ Video: Magicite Review - A Minecraft Rogue Like 

			Views: 293		

			I have always been fond of rogue like games, so once I heard about Magicite combining crafting and rogue like elements I had to play it! OVERALL - 9/10 - Due to lack of music on the title screen.

												The mix of general survival, inventory management, crafting, and resource harvesting creates a delicate touch within the game.  It feels as a roguelike game, difficult, but that ONE thing that killed you could have been avoided. The game feels like a survival journey as much as an RPG, with limited amounts of health potions and gradual biome progression. However, the biomes don't seem to get any harder on their own, with the only increase in area difficulty being that the biomes gradually swap each other out in an attempt to get you to go to the harder zones. The game is about risk versus reward in an aspect, as running into a difficult biome will also grant you access to plenty of treasure chests or high amounts of valuable ores. However, said biomes often end up having enemies hard enough to take out your level 30 character in a mere 4 hits without any health potions to rely on.Overall, the game has its ups and downs, but the mix of aspects in the game end up making it worth buying.

												When I first opened this game I had no idea what I was doing. Given an axe and some ores I set out on my grand adventure... and died within the first 2 minutes. This was a rinse and repeat for about the next 20 attempts as I struggled with the enemies and the crafting system (I ended up having 30 sword hilts at one point). As I slowly progressed, picking apart the crafting system, watching the enemy patterns, dieing and dieing and dieing, this game has become one of my favorite games. While I have yet to actually progress past the eighth level, I feel accomplished with my minor achivement, I made my armor and finally figured out how to be a wizard.			"

												I enjoy this game to the fullest because of the art style and the rouge-like RPG genre, it's cool!I like the simple WASD controls, and was originally uninformed about the dash and skill controls. But there was a menu to edit the controlls so I was fine. As for the difficulty, it seems like an easy game at first glance, but I still havent beaten the game despite how easy it looks. I also like how there are some bosses, and I guess you would say ""mini-bosses"" like the Tyrannox, because of its low health and meteors hit it's self. Percyl is a pain in the butt to kill cause of its 600 HP. You know what I'm sayin'? Then theres the RPG genre. The thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can't select your special passive abillities. You have to constantly find the combo that you are looking for, and it's a lot of time being wasted.Even if there are some negetives, the music is just beautiful. Tundra being my favorite, and the Volcano as my least (opinion wise), it's an awesome soundtrack! Beyond 1.2, I'm hoping for a ton of more bug fixes (such as throwing your items into a void againt a ledge), mobs, items (espeically for magic puposes) and a difficulty setting. Once you get the hang of a game, it gets easy, so I'm hoping for a whole other difficulty that applies parkour and a pit of lava (mostly for volcano), or maybe less mobs and more passive ones (for a easier setting for noobs).If I inspired you of some ideas for the new update, your welcome! Oh and if you couldn't understand any of that, I reccomend it for gamers and not casual people, its a rouge-like RPG and all, so have fun playing this game to it's fullest! :D			"

												I don't know how to aptly convey my feelings for Magicite. It's like, an ex girlfriend you hate, but you'd still ♥♥♥♥. It keeps you coming back for more while treating you like♥♥♥♥♥♥and punishing you, and it's so ♥♥♥♥ing good at it. I've played this game quite a bit since I've purchased it, but it keeps me feeling like I'm a mediocre player. I guess that's the draw to this game. The challenge. Not a lot of games have that aspect anymore, and where Magicite does, it does it in droves. It's constantly kicking your♥♥♥♥♥ and you keep coming back thinking that you've finally gained the upper hand. Little do you know, that this game won't let up.

												Magicite is basically rogue like terraria.  It is pretty fun at first but I think it might get a little too easy for many people after you have played it for a while.  Also the game does screw you over a lot of the time by spawning you right in the middle of danger.  Overall, I think there is a bit too much collecting and crafting for a rogue like game.  Most rogue likes are very fast paced even in the start of the game which keeps you playing over and over again despite the fact that you've just died.  I wish they would simplify the crafting a bit so that you can do it a bit faster because it gets very rinse and repeat and it's a lot of clicking just to make some items.  Overall though the game is still pretty fun especially the combat and I enjoy the double jump aspect.  7/10			"

												Once you figure out the game, it only takes 20-60 minutes to beat, but that's easier said than done. A ton of fun to play with friends and I highly recommend. WORTH!			"

												Great game. A wonderful mixture of rogue-like and survival. The crafting is simplistic as well as fun. And plus everything is just so damn cute! There is a bit of research required if you don't want to spend the first hour of the game experimenting with the crafting recipes, but no matter whether you decide to do the research or experiment, it is loads of fun. I would go on about how it has high replay value, but it's a rogue-like so I figure that is already assumed. Another great addition to the genre!			"

												This game, I like it. It has a terraria like feel to it mixed with roguelike elements to keep it interesting. You pick a race, a hat that grants bonuses, and roll stats before being thrusted into the game to fend for yourself. This game can take some time to get used to, but quickly becomes fun once you get the hang of it. While this hasn't been the hardest ""rougelike"" I have played,   it's still a nice and simple game that is definitely worth picking up for cheap. It hasn't been long off the early access section, but it had enough to keep me entertained and the updates will hopefully keep on adding content for it.			"

												Picked this game up after seeing some gameplay on YouTube. Hopped right in with out much knowledge of the game. And let me tell you it was tough. But after you get the hang of things it becomes a unique experience unlike any game that I've played before. It's a rogue-like with RPG and Survival elements and they all come together to provide you with a unique enjoyable experience. This game isn't really comparable to anything else, but if I had to I would say its like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac since you go ""floor-to-floor"" collecting loot and killing mobs and perma-death. But the combat reminds me of Terraria and Starbound. The game also has a crafting feature unlike any I've seen before.			"

												I enjoy this game to the fullest because of the art style and the rouge-like RPG genre, it's cool!I like the simple WASD controls, and was originally uninformed about the dash and skill controls. But there was a menu to edit the controlls so I was fine. As for the difficulty, it seems like an easy game at first glance, but I still havent beaten the game despite how easy it looks. I also like how there are some bosses, and I guess you would say ""mini-bosses"" like the Tyrannox, because of its low health and meteors hit it's self. Percyl is a pain in the butt to kill cause of its 600 HP. You know what I'm sayin'? Then theres the RPG genre. The thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can't select your special passive abillities. You have to constantly find the combo that you are looking for, and it's a lot of time being wasted.Even if there are some negetives, the music is just beautiful. Tundra being my favorite, and the Volcano as my least (opinion wise), it's an awesome soundtrack! Beyond 1.2, I'm hoping for a ton of more bug fixes (such as throwing your items into a void againt a ledge), mobs, items (espeically for magic puposes) and a difficulty setting. Once you get the hang of a game, it gets easy, so I'm hoping for a whole other difficulty that applies parkour and a pit of lava (mostly for volcano), or maybe less mobs and more passive ones (for a easier setting for noobs).If I inspired you of some ideas for the new update, your welcome! Oh and if you couldn't understand any of that, I reccomend it for gamers and not casual people, its a rouge-like RPG and all, so have fun playing this game to it's fullest! :D			"

												A Fun Side Scroll Platformer with Crafting should be Difficult and very Addicting. This game does all of these Jobs Great! You could say this game is like Minecraft but no it isn't. It doesn't have Creepers blowing up in your face or Tall Endermen stalking you. It has PERMANANT DEATH in single player. In Multiplayer it has Permananat death if everyone dies, otherwise your teammates can run over and revive you. The Crafting is a little out there but  just incase you have a little difficulty crafting you shift click two items to craft them togehter. This Game is very addiciting in the sense that you play one single player round and you get incredibly far, then you die and you unlocked a ton of stuff you never had before, and then you play anothor round, that's why it's so Addicting. All in all a great game with High Difficulty, Great Crafting. Great Soundtrack, and Tons of Unlockables! This is a game you wan't wanna miss!			"

Standard archer, mage and warrior-type. Several interesting biomes and bosses have semi-different mechanics, quite straight forward and the game is hard.It's actually really hard on your own.I've not managed to finish the game yet, but I'll get there soon!It is, without a doubt, worth the 9.99£.

												Simple yet exciting gameplay.The multiplayer is very nice and quite the challenge.But the Multiplayer-Client is buggy.For example one of my friends has some trouble after the creation of the caracter, he won't get into the ""loading screen"" and won't be able to play. With the other friend I can't hit ""play again"" (as host) because then his game crashes.I would definitly buy it again!Hoping for some new content maybe?			"

												Magicite is a very solid combination of Platformer and Roguelike.While exploring one layer of Deephaven after another you gather ressources and kill enemies that are stronger or weaker based on the biome you are in. In the last layer you have to fight the boss.There are a lot of different Races, Hats and Companions you can unlock by competing different tasks. Each race starts with different stats and items. Hats and companions grant special bonus effects.You can use your gathered ressources to craft new weapons and armor or you can sell stuff in the villages between the levels.The madman-mode is insane.The only thing I miss in this game is an endless-mode.

The game is really amazing for it's price range. 5 out of 5 for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 for PC controls.			"

												A fun, simple little game, with an interesting, brightly colored art style.  The monsters are ALL very tricky at the beginning, but after a few hours, you should be able to master them without taking damage.  The level design is very repetitive, although I somewhat like that you can see the entire world, top to bottom, and don't have to explore up and down at all.  Crafting is MEH, there need to be a LOT more items, and more unique ones... you can pretty much make identical, albeit more powerful items depending on the materials used, which isn't interesting at all.  The inventory menu needs to be made larger, and the only way to get gold (which is, at last in the early/mid game, the only way to get decent armor) is to monotonously chop down every tree in every level, since all items have the same $2 selling value, you may as well load up on 99x wood in each inventory slot.I think this game has potential, but needs to be greatly expanded upon.  I'd recommend it if you've played through other, more polished games like Terraria, Risk of Rain, Don't Starve, but honestly, the quality and depth of all those games eclipses Magicite by so much, it'd be tough to move on from them to a strict downgrade.  That said, I'm looking forward to what the creator has in store for Magicite, there's a lot of room for improvement, and sometimes it's nice to have a ""lite"" version of Terraria to play.			"

												Magicite is a 2D sidescrolling roguelike, packed with enemies, unlockable hats (almost as many as TF2's selection) and unlockable races.The game itself is extremely challenging, so if you don't like games that take you 40 hours to get to the final boss JUST to get viciously murdered (This is totally not a reference to how I play... *nervous laugh*) this is NOT for you.The game itself is very interesting, cool enemies, great references that you would only get from an indie game, and very nice playstyle.The game isn't perfectly polished yet, there are still a few bugs in the enemies... And in the bugs, like, wasps and stuff.Anyways, other than that it has an interesting RPG element to it, you roll up your stats, and there are various classes (playing as these classes is not required, but it often benefits you more to play an archer if you play as a Dwelf race...)Pros: Interesting storyline (even though it isn't too important to the game)Great game design, it's an interesting graphical old/new mix.Lots of replayability (from achievemnts and unlockables)supports a great indie game developer! (I wanna see more stuff from you Sean!)Takes a long time to master, defintely stays true to the ""Rogue-like title""Rocket RacoonFun RPG elements.Great multiplayer.Procedurally generated levels gives an interesting twist to your gameplay.Cons:Still not completely polished, still some bugs (although not gamebreaking) that could throw a good run.Does not have it's own server client, as far as I know for Multiplayer.Extremely difficult (while not necissarily a bad thing, but if you don't want something that makes you mad this may not be your thing)No tutorial, so it is very unfriendly to new players.Save game files do not transfer over computers, so if you want to show a friend the game at his house your progress in unlockables is gone.Final rating:Definitely a 8.5 or maybe even a 9, this game is definitely worth the price tag even though it's fairly unknown.If you do get it, or are thinking of getting it, tell your friends, get this game popular!

Every death or two gives you more hats, classes, or ideas on how to progress. Instead of being a burden, the permadeath acts as a way for you to clean the slate and do better. It's healthy.The game lasted me around 15 hours. I beat the boss multiple times, each taking me around 20 minutes (i think). Eventually you get used to how the enemies work, and the game becomes an exercise in muscle memory. Unlike similar games (like rogue legacy), this muscle memory doesn't get challenged very much. It won't put you into situations where 3-4 enemies with different powers are spewing them all at once, and you have to navigate the world to defeat them. Instead, magicite tests your patience. You have to identify each enemy and be careful with them - because regaining health is difficult. By the end of the game you'll be taking enemies out at range more often than not, because you won't be finding enough potion materials to heal yourself. Only one or two equipment/hat/trait/skill combinations can keep you healed, and even then it's tiresome and slow to heal to full (notably, the ice queen hat, clairvoyance skill, and high MAG).After all this invested time, my big gripe is that melee is just too important. The three different general paths (melee, archer, magic) are fun and play differently, but it always boils down to using your sword. No matter how you build, the sword is the only ifinite source of damage; your magic will run out fast and regen slow, and your arrows compete with armor for crafting materials. So it feels a bit like the magic/archer classes are more work than they're worth. Even with the right skills and playstyle, it doesn't usually feel like they're really worth it.After unlocking most of the items, hats, and races, I think i'm done with it. But at this price, 15 hours of gameplay for $10 was pretty reasonable.			"

												A mix of terraria and rogue-like rpg, Magicite is a unique, fun, and difficult game every time you play it. It's a fun 2D side scroll where you chop wood, mine rocks, eat meat, poop, and fight monsters. The combat in the game reminds me of monster hunter mixed with legend of zelda where you have to time your attacks and understand the enemy attacks so you can jump and dash to dodge. The item crafting is simble yet expansive with crafting weapons and armors being fun and acomplishing. The game is challenging and I still have yet to get to the end of the game but I get farther every time. I unfortunatelly have not been able to play multiplayer yet but I have no doubt Magicite would rock even harder with multiplayer. All in all, the game is difficult and very fun for those who like terraria or 2D rpgs. Buy it!			"

												Magicite is one of those games i keep coming back to, although every time i die im dead and have to start over i keep playing, usually i would be fed up and not bother plaing anymore, this game reminds me of Starbound mixed with Castle Crashes :Dhighly recomended for the money ''especially if you brought in the summer sale'' One thing that i think could be improved, once youre dead youre dead thats fine.. but if i have been doing really well and playing for a while and want to take a break, you cannot simply re load or continue.if you get to a town you have to sit on pause untill you want to play again. as turning the game off efectivley kills you. because of this little annoyance  7/10			"

												This game is amazing and a nice price though I still think this is a work in process game and does have some issuses like for one I kinda have trouble finding people to play on multi player but that can be the fault of me rather than the game. I haven't run into any bugs or errors yet ether so that's a plus.          Now about the playing itself it is awesome it is a rouge like platformer similar to Rouge legacy in that it has random spawning floors and has perma death but it's art style is that of almost 8 bit like games which is awesome for those who like to relive the art style it also has character customization such as multiple races, traits, hat's that give there own benefits such as more critical strikes and stat bonuses. It also has skills upon character's leveling up that are broken into 3 groups such as the Warrior, The Mage, and The Ranger. It even throughs in some crafting mechanics as well so if you like these kinds of games this could be a fun game for you.Edit: I also forgot to add about the creatures they come in many shapes and sizes from being easy to being hard there are also several bosses as well, but I will say that some of the creatures do seem to repeat in each area but that could just be me nitpicking so hope you all have fun and if you get the game hope you have a blast with it.

												An extremely challenging game, that requires you to master all forms, but what I reccomend doing is going for race unlocks early on then suiciding so you can get the perfect run. I've managed to unlock everything by this method. Also, the pets and hats really help. The hardest hat unlock is so worth it because it you take 1/2 damage. The graphics and music in this game are also some of my favourite among any game.			"

												This game, I just... don't know where to start. First it's crafting is very difficult to get the hang of, all you have to do is shift click two items and it combines it for you. Simple right? Wrong! Figuring out what to put together is the hard part. If you have ever played mine craft throw every little piece of information you know about crafting out the window. To make a sword hilt it is a wooden plank and a stick then to make the blade you combine two wooden planks then combine the sword blade and hilt and you have craft a sword, see what I mean? And it's all like this as well. Not saying it's bad, in fact i really like it but it is a little confusing at first. Second, the world are randomly generated which I love! This adds sooooo much replay value to the game and a bigger challenge. This brings me to number three, this game is hard as BALLS good lord this game is challenging. It's challenge level is up there some where between super meet boy and dark souls, no joke. But the fact that every thing is different every single time makes it harder because you cant remember and strategize for it. Number four, the combat and skills. I'm still really new to the game but the combat is fairly simple, all you do is click and it swings the sword but you also have a dash left and dash right so you can dash in, swing, and dash out with out being hit. The skills, every couple times you level up a little box with three pictures appear, I am not sure what they do but I do know that the red picture is for attacking with swords and axes and up close combat. To use these you just hit z, x, or c corresponding to the picture location next to your life bar. Number six, there is an interesting feature to the game, when you accomplish a certain thing you have a chance to get a new race or a new hat which each have advantages and disadvantages to you play through. Finally this is just a question I have, WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE FLOATING HEADS THAT CHASE YOU THROUGH THE FREAKING LEVEL?!?! they're these floating purple head that chase you down as you are going through the level. they hit 9999 damage and have killed me more than anything. I don't believe there is a way to kill them but if there is let me know. All and all I would gove this game a 9.5/10			"

There is a ton of things to unlock that are really hard to unlock so you want to play again multiple times but the game is much more fun to play with friends than anything because you get to have some good laughs and you get a better experience. There isnt a tutorial or anything you just get thrown in the game and it is permadeath like Risk of Rain and the crafting system is unique. The game can be a bit broken at times but its still very fun and the way the game glitches sometimes can be hilarious. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Magicite, when I first saw it, I said, wow, terraria clone FTW (same thing I said about terraria when comparing it to minecraft). Alas I was happily mistaken again, this game combindes the fun game type, and fast advancement of terraria, the adventure and bleak crafting of minecraft, and the sudden merceless deaths of dark souls. A thought child of games that no one may ever replicate. I first got it during this year's christmas sale for 5 bucks, albeit after playing it, it is worth the same as any new game for counsole coming out. It will keep you captivated, and still be a flappy bird style game, you fail after so much, and yet go ""ahh what the heck, ill give it another shot"". I do have to remark that the multiplayer (unless over actual lan (ie NOT hamachi or evolve)) is REALLY laggy the further in you get, and I mean unplayable, people fall through the world, people standing next to you yet fighting a monster at the edge of the map, monsters hurting more than one player at a time by being in multiple places at once.All in all i find this to be a fun game, but if you want to play multiplayer, make sure you can go to someone's house.Replayability 10/10 you will come crawling back every timeMultiplayer 5/10 Works for lan, but is impossible to play over the internetPlayable for hours 10/10 you will get lucky in some games, and just keep goingRagequitability 11/10 *smashes computer* yep definantly, i have a dented keyboard to prove itPlain Fun 10/10 *to busy playing to write anything here*over all46/50, all fantasic, just work on that multiplayer a bitEDIT: Multiplayer over hamachi (untested on internet or evolve) works with just one other person, or with multiple people on actual LAN, *IE* I played with my friend on hamachi (just one friend) and we could play flawlessly, then my friend came over to my place and played with both of us, and it still worked, but any more than one person over the internet and its game over			"

Early Access Review
								Magicite is an addicitng game of crafting, strategy, and survival. In it, you star as a lowly peon (or other unlockible race) as you fight monsters underground in order to make your way to the surface world. There's a lot of craftible weapons, armor, and potions, as well as special abilities and hats with various effects (any TF2 player will know just how important it is to have hats in a game). The various biomes you traverse include grassland, veldt, tundra, lava, cave, and dungeon, and they are all randomly gererated, with their own sets of enemies. This adds a lot of strategy to the game, as no two areas will ever look alike or have the same enemy placement. Resource management will also be a big factor during gameplay.The creator, Sean Young, is very dedicated to the game and has put a lot of work into it to make it the game it is today. I got this game a couple months ago [March 2014] back when it was still in ver 0.7.3., and a lot has changed since then. However, the in-game bestiary, quest generation system, and PvP battle arena that were mentioned on the game's kickstarter page have yet to be added, but that may change as time goes on. The game is now on ver 0.8 and just got a lot of new content added.Honestly, as fun as single player is, the real fun is experiencing this game with a friend. It is a lot of fun to plan out long-term goals and strategies with them and work towards meeting those goals. When your plans go off exactly as you planned and you both display excellent coordination, it's hard not to be excited about it.Overall, the game just keeps getting better with each update and it is still being worked on, so I would say that there is no reason to not get this game. Whether you play it alone or with a friend, you are bound to enjoy this game and also get extremely frustrated when your charater dies (I forgot to mention until now that this game uses a permadeath system), so if your character dies one you will need to start from the beginning again. It really isn't that big of a deal, but if you are someone who dislikes permadeath I would not recommend this game to you. For those who stick with it though, you will really enjoy everything this game has to offer.			"

												This game is the funnest game i have ever played honestly.I reccommend this to everyone becuase it is a very simple game and its graphical style is Epic! The story is simple easy to understand but the game is challenging and takes practice which is why its awsome. Albeit is buggy but many people can look past it because the game is so ""rich"" with fun, and the devs put out updates very very often which is awsome of them! So for just 10$ I would say "" BUY IT NOW BECAUSE IT IS LIKE FREAKIN AWSOME""			"

												Warning: This game is rather hard... until you learn some tricks :DLike most games that attempt to be difficult there's the; Difficult but fun, then there's the ""so difficult this game is not fun at all >:c"".At first it will be the latter, as the learning curve is minorly hard and there is no crafting guide in-game (though there are plenty of guides through Steam). But once you get used to it the game is rather easy.What I recommend doing is learning most of the crafting recipes and reading some guides based on your favorite play-style.			"

												Magicite is one of those games i keep coming back to, although every time i die im dead and have to start over i keep playing, usually i would be fed up and not bother plaing anymore, this game reminds me of Starbound mixed with Castle Crashes :Dhighly recomended for the money ''especially if you brought in the summer sale'' One thing that i think could be improved, once youre dead youre dead thats fine.. but if i have been doing really well and playing for a while and want to take a break, you cannot simply re load or continue.if you get to a town you have to sit on pause untill you want to play again. as turning the game off efectivley kills you. because of this little annoyance  7/10			"

												This game is amazing and a nice price though I still think this is a work in process game and does have some issuses like for one I kinda have trouble finding people to play on multi player but that can be the fault of me rather than the game. I haven't run into any bugs or errors yet ether so that's a plus.          Now about the playing itself it is awesome it is a rouge like platformer similar to Rouge legacy in that it has random spawning floors and has perma death but it's art style is that of almost 8 bit like games which is awesome for those who like to relive the art style it also has character customization such as multiple races, traits, hat's that give there own benefits such as more critical strikes and stat bonuses. It also has skills upon character's leveling up that are broken into 3 groups such as the Warrior, The Mage, and The Ranger. It even throughs in some crafting mechanics as well so if you like these kinds of games this could be a fun game for you.Edit: I also forgot to add about the creatures they come in many shapes and sizes from being easy to being hard there are also several bosses as well, but I will say that some of the creatures do seem to repeat in each area but that could just be me nitpicking so hope you all have fun and if you get the game hope you have a blast with it.

												Magicite is a superb 8-bit Rogue lite. It has a wide variety of races to choose from. Ranging from: Useless pigs to Cyclops Miners. You journey through caves. Some caves are swampy, some are hellish. There are 3 different cave entrances at the exits of each cave you go through. Choose wisely! Some caves are more difficult than others! Small towns are available at the start of every cave. Here, you can buy any supplies you think you'll need along the journey. Or, you could sell some items you won't need to gain a little extra coin. Careful not to spend too long on a level- I'll let you figure out why ;)10/10 Would recommend to anyone with money to spend.			"

												10/10. This game is simply amazing.Magicite has most of all the genres you can find in a game nowadays, and that alone makes it a gem worth digging for.It has the elements of a hack-and-slash dungeon crawler rpg with customizable classes, such as being a greatsword swinging wizard or fireball shooting knight. There are endless possibilities to your character and how you go through each run.It also has survival elements, as seen with a well done crafting system. You have to make almost all of your gear yourself or find it inside rare little chests. Not to mention the hunger bar looms over you, making you feel like life is even more important. Death is permanent, so you had better make each step count and choose your battles wisely.Not to mention the great use of the pixelated style. It looks like an old school game, but is fluid enough to stand with the modern day competitors.The creator of this game is a genius in my opinion, and I would recommend this to everyone and anyone who's even considered the rpg universe. It is well worth the 10 dollars.			"

												This game is a rigorously challenging 2D platformer. It has unlockable character equipment (completely unrelated to the armor in-game) and keeps you on-edge yet it also is very enjoyable. The crafting system is also very intuitive when you get used to it. It's very unique and I find it more fun than the shaped crafting in games like Minecraft and the ambiguous crafting of Terraria. If I had to give this an actual rating, it would be, if not very near, 10/10. I highly enjoy it and I recommend you try it as well.			"

Thats the farthest I have gotten in this game so far, and atm I am a major newb at this game.

												Magicite is basically rogue like terraria.  It is pretty fun at first but I think it might get a little too easy for many people after you have played it for a while.  Also the game does screw you over a lot of the time by spawning you right in the middle of danger.  Overall, I think there is a bit too much collecting and crafting for a rogue like game.  Most rogue likes are very fast paced even in the start of the game which keeps you playing over and over again despite the fact that you've just died.  I wish they would simplify the crafting a bit so that you can do it a bit faster because it gets very rinse and repeat and it's a lot of clicking just to make some items.  Overall though the game is still pretty fun especially the combat and I enjoy the double jump aspect.  7/10			"

												""Like Skyrim with slimes.""-IGN10/10No really though. Magicite is a deceptively tough platformer with rogue-like elements, featuring one of the best feeling combat systems in a rogue-like I've seen in a while. I'm a sucker for a good rogue-like, so this game is a no-brainer. If you're into the same sort of thing, Magicite is a must-buy.			"

												simple short and sweet. nothing much to it. basicly a 2d version of minecraft, but with alot more foes, which catches the attention of action players who want a game just to play which is quick and is fun at the same time. Magicite does this. although that y die quite quickly and has no real story line, it is a game to pass time. so if you like minecraft but want more foes then this is game for you!			"

												What can I say about this game?  Not since Rogue Legacy have I died this much in a game.  It's hard. DAMN hard to get started.   Seems more like a beta somewhat.  Needs some scaling help with the graphics.Pros: -fun. -simple interface, -easy controls, -good replayability. -multiplatform (works great on SteamOS/LinuxCons:   -Difficulty. If you don't like to die, don't play this game.  -Bugs:EDIT: every single bug I used to encounter on either the Windoze or Linux/SteamOS platforms has been squashed. Kudos to the devs.   -cost, really? $10? get it on discount until more bugs are fixed.  Otherwise it would be worth it.-NO MANUAL, (that is total shazbot!)  2 different Wikis, neither of which seems to have all you need to get started, sigh.  After half a dozen or so games you'll get the basics down and be able to cruise to the later levels almost every time, but it's damned annoying to go to 3rd party sites for such a simple thing as documentation.

												A pretty nice game. Nice graphic and audio. If you are used to rogue like games; this game is a good addition with loads of re playability with cute graphic to boot. Not an easy game and you will definitely die quite a few times before finishing the game. Even after that; there are still quite a number of stuffs to unlock. Races, companions, headgear and look variations are some of the stuffs you can unlock. Headgears, races and companions are some of the better to stuffs to unlock as they can potentially change how the game is played. This game is quite worth the money and if you are on the fence on whether to get it or not; my advice is to get it. You won't regret it (but first please make sure you are into rogue like games. If you are not familiar with this genre; the game will be frustrating to play). If you are fine with games like Rogue Legacy and Risk of Rain; this is the game for you.			"

												Good game, very well made and the co op is always fun. The perma death is always enraging so if you are the kind of person that hates restarting every time you die i wouldnt recommend this game, however any races/hats/companions etc you unlock will remain with you forever it is just your character that is deleted upon death. Lots of stuff to craft and many different enemies and things to unlock, there is a ton of content in here for hours of enjoyment and addictiveness. The game itself is pretty linear like an old school super mario, always heading in that right direction platformer, but its not bad, there is a good variety of biomes however you always start in the jungle.

												9.5/10 Great gameI enjoyed the heck out of this game, although I have a couple of issues regarding the final level, District 20. In this District you face off against the final boss. I have discovered that it is quite difficult to beat, there are just simply too many enemies that spawn. It would be great if you can even out the ammount of enemies, perhaps make different sections of the level. One section could contains several enemies and another section lets the player prepare/heal up and collect shards. Another issue I have is the agro of the mini-spiders within the cave levels, they tend to agro simply when I enter the level. Also I do comprehend that this is a bit of a beta-build and believe that once this game is 100% completed it will become a master-piece but until then there are still a couple of bugs that can be fixed.Keep up the outstanding work!

												Simple, easy to understand and rather fun.Magicite is a rather basic game with bugs and a moderately ok-ish visual aspect. Combat is kinda plain with limited weapon diversity but pretty fun possibilities, unlocks are rewarding and runs can keep you engages for quite a while.Can't really recommend without friends as it get's bland and a little annoying to have to work on your own. Inventory management is rather tedious but always needed, small inventories really aggrivate me. I will however still recommend this game because it can be nice to jump on for a bit and try to unlock some fancy Race's to play as or Companions that make the game just that little bit more interesting to play.

												Magicite is a rogue-like platformer developed by Sean Young. You can play as one of the many in-game races, all with different stats and starting gear. Unlock hats, which give your character certan buffs, race variants, a purely cosmetic customization, and companions, small creatures that follow you around, granting buffs.I will be breaking down this review into a few sections, as seen below.  Gameplay Magicite starts you off with nothing but whatever your race starts with. Collect wood, mine minerals, and vanquish enemies along the way to each district's exit. After completing a district, you will be break to a town, kind of like a resting place to smelt minerals, craft, and chill for a bit before starting the next district. There are multiple districts, each with their own monsters and loot.Craft things out of collected or bought materials, and gradually level up to bcome stronger, but be warned: this game is  HARD . Be ready to die a  LOT , and that's not a bad thing.  Multiplayer Yes, there is online multiplayer! Up to four players can dive into the underground world of Magicite. While there are bugs, the multiplayer experience is the preferred method of playing this game.  Unlockables Magicite offers a healthy helping of unlockable gear, most requiring good play. Unlocking things, even just cosmetic eyes, is extremely satisfying.   Conclusion  Magicite is a game to be played with friends. While you can solo the game, it is much more fun with the multiplayer experience. The game can be replayed many, many times without boring repetitiveness. Just get ready to be challenged.I would highly recommend this game to those who love multiplayer games, rogue-like games, and platformers.			"

												This game is amazing and a nice price though I still think this is a work in process game and does have some issuses like for one I kinda have trouble finding people to play on multi player but that can be the fault of me rather than the game. I haven't run into any bugs or errors yet ether so that's a plus.          Now about the playing itself it is awesome it is a rouge like platformer similar to Rouge legacy in that it has random spawning floors and has perma death but it's art style is that of almost 8 bit like games which is awesome for those who like to relive the art style it also has character customization such as multiple races, traits, hat's that give there own benefits such as more critical strikes and stat bonuses. It also has skills upon character's leveling up that are broken into 3 groups such as the Warrior, The Mage, and The Ranger. It even throughs in some crafting mechanics as well so if you like these kinds of games this could be a fun game for you.Edit: I also forgot to add about the creatures they come in many shapes and sizes from being easy to being hard there are also several bosses as well, but I will say that some of the creatures do seem to repeat in each area but that could just be me nitpicking so hope you all have fun and if you get the game hope you have a blast with it.

												I highly recommend this game. It is like terraria and a rouge-like combined. Plays very well for an early access game. It is a difficult game, but that contributes to the amount of time you get from the game and how good you feel when you beat a district. At this time the crafting is a bit simple, and in my opinion could be fleshed out. All in all, buy this game while its on sale			"

												When I first opened this game I had no idea what I was doing. Given an axe and some ores I set out on my grand adventure... and died within the first 2 minutes. This was a rinse and repeat for about the next 20 attempts as I struggled with the enemies and the crafting system (I ended up having 30 sword hilts at one point). As I slowly progressed, picking apart the crafting system, watching the enemy patterns, dieing and dieing and dieing, this game has become one of my favorite games. While I have yet to actually progress past the eighth level, I feel accomplished with my minor achivement, I made my armor and finally figured out how to be a wizard.			"

												Highly  recommended especially for those who enjoy games like Terraria and Starbound. I can be found  screaming at my monitor for every 10-20 minutes or so every time I play this game, throwing tantrums like a 2-year old at a supermarket... and yet I keep playing. Got it on sale for myself and now I wished that I had got the 4-pack on discount. As a single player it can be very addictive. As a multiplayer co-op game I think the fun would be in coordinating with your friends as well as having the back and forth banter trying to make sure everyone will not die of starvation or from being mauled by a wildboar.This game has the charm of classic and old school 2D games but with better graphics. Keep a wiki open on standby for recipes crafting and etc. There's no hand holding here. I wish the developers would make sandbox levels and non-permanent death options available. Oh please, please, please.... PRETTY PLEASE... and please make it able for players to save their progress. Update: For now I have decided to not bother playing till the next update, hopefully more playable rather than dealing with skyrocketing blood pressure levels everytime my character dies a permanent death... losing all progress... losing all hope.

As a multiplayer co-op game I think the fun would be in coordinating with your friends as well as having the back and forth banter trying to make sure everyone will not die of starvation or from being mauled by a wildboar.This game has the charm of classic and old school 2D games but with better graphics. Keep a wiki open on standby for recipes crafting and etc. There's no hand holding here. I wish the developers would make sandbox levels and non-permanent death options available. Oh please, please, please.... PRETTY PLEASE... and please make it able for players to save their progress. Update: For now I have decided to not bother playing till the next update, hopefully more playable rather than dealing with skyrocketing blood pressure levels everytime my character dies a permanent death... losing all progress... losing all hope.

												An NPC randomly proclaimed to the village that he hated chicken, I proceeded to walk away, slaughter a chicken, pick up it coprse and repeatedly hit him in the face with it while yelling, ""IT DOESN'T LIKE YOU EITHER"" until he exploded in a glorious mist of golden coins. I continued to kill two oversized, extremely slow, mutated dinosaurs and several gels before eating the chicken, and falling prey to a large wasp. I then had to start all over again from scratch.10/10 would definitely rinse and repeat again.			"

												Surprisingly fun and addicting.  If you like Platformers and Rogue-likes, this game is a must.Pros:   Very well done controls for mouse+keyboard play.  Beautiful pixel art graphics.  At a sweet spot (for me at least) in difficulty.  Easy enough to pickup, but hard enough to prevent you from walking up to the boss on your first 50 tries (Expect to die a lot).Cons:  There is some re-use in monster behavior and monster types (eg A stronger/faster purple spider in contrast to the regular spider from the first level)  Monster AI is not particularly sophisticated nor hard to figure out how to counter.  The bow mechanics.  The bow can fire outside of the range of most of the early monsters, so you can hit them with your bow before they even know that you're near them, making a lot of bow combat one sided with you firing at non-moving monsters.  Arrows are also not affected by gravity, making it really easy to use (maybe too easy).  The hunger bar seems kind of like an afterthought and doesn't affect gameplay all that much.  Food is extremely   abundant in most biomes.  I like the crafting element, and I like the fact that the game was designed to encourage the player to experiment with resources.  There aren't that many things to craft though, so once you've already learned all the recipies, continuing to do them feels like an unnecessary chore sometimes.That's a lot of cons, but this game is really fun and really addicting and is all-round pretty well designed.  Definitely worth it's list price.			"

												Magicite is a great game created by Sean Young, a one man developer. At this time, he will no longer post real updates but will be posting hotfixes. He also created roguelands and soon another game, which I've heard will be a mobile RPG game. This game is a Single/Multiplayer 2D sidescrolling roguelike RPG in which you must defeat the scourge, who are basically just creepy purple alien/demons/things. This game has a large learning curve and can be very difficult, so if you don't like difficult games I would not recommend. However, if you like a challenge there is much to be had here. There isn't really an overall goal to the game except to collect all races, hats, and companions which are modifiers to make the game easier or harder. You can unlock about half the content without beating the game, three or four items by beating it, and the other half by beating the game in certain ways (such as without crafting anything). TL;DR: The game is hard but fun.			"

												I bought this game on sale to play with a friend and it's a fun little platforming, crafting experience that's pretty challenging, possibly a bit too grindy and has a clunky combat system. The atmosphere of the game is quite relaxing and the graphics are cute. I'm not sure I would pay for this game at full price, especially when comparing it to the level of complexity that other games of a similar price offer, but if it's on sale and you want to try and fight your way through an ambient underground world with a friend, definitely go for it. So far it's worked fine using Hamachi.			"

												Magicite is a rogue-like platformer developed by Sean Young. You can play as one of the many in-game races, all with different stats and starting gear. Unlock hats, which give your character certan buffs, race variants, a purely cosmetic customization, and companions, small creatures that follow you around, granting buffs.I will be breaking down this review into a few sections, as seen below.  Gameplay Magicite starts you off with nothing but whatever your race starts with. Collect wood, mine minerals, and vanquish enemies along the way to each district's exit. After completing a district, you will be break to a town, kind of like a resting place to smelt minerals, craft, and chill for a bit before starting the next district. There are multiple districts, each with their own monsters and loot.Craft things out of collected or bought materials, and gradually level up to bcome stronger, but be warned: this game is  HARD . Be ready to die a  LOT , and that's not a bad thing.  Multiplayer Yes, there is online multiplayer! Up to four players can dive into the underground world of Magicite. While there are bugs, the multiplayer experience is the preferred method of playing this game.  Unlockables Magicite offers a healthy helping of unlockable gear, most requiring good play. Unlocking things, even just cosmetic eyes, is extremely satisfying.   Conclusion  Magicite is a game to be played with friends. While you can solo the game, it is much more fun with the multiplayer experience. The game can be replayed many, many times without boring repetitiveness. Just get ready to be challenged.I would highly recommend this game to those who love multiplayer games, rogue-like games, and platformers.			"

Also, when I played I had to guidelines as of what the crafting system consisted of.

												Killed a bunch of chickens and then a giant raging chicken descended from the sky and starting fluttering about everywhere and killed my friend10/10~~~~~Serious review for serious people:Do you like Rogue-likes? Then you'll like this game. Do you not like roguelikes or have never played one? You might still like this game, I dunno.Pros- The crafting system is awesome (shift+click two items), particularly because you aren't given any of the recipes - part of the fun lies in experimenting and figuring things out (or if you really want to you could use the wiki)- Lots of recipes- Different races provide for different playstyles - if your starting items don't include an axe, for example, you have to kill everything to get coins and then buy an axe in the marketplace at the end of each level so that you can get wood and sticks to make handles for more tools. (I think there's actually another way but I don't know what it is)- Challenging (I think that's a pro anyway)- Procedurally generated everything- I can't make any guarantees, but I feel like you don't need to be a roguelike fan to enjoy if, but if you are then you'll definitely enjoy it- Co-op up to four players- Plenty of unlockables that aren't too easy to unlock- Haven't encountered any bugsCons- No LAN play, so you'll still have to set up port forwarding to play locallyTip: Don't stay still for too long			"

								[This is all said on the version Im currently playing on this day]This is a rouge RPG (Meaning you die). You start off with random items and usually an Axe (As far as I know). Through out your exploarations you encournter cute, colorful, scary and big creatures. All you have is your one life and what ever you have on you at the time. You better choose wisely and preper to die ... Alot.You can customise your character and there are some more features to your that you can add but I havent found them yet. Once you wander out you quickly encouter Creatures ranging from ants to GIANT Monsters that you must fight to continue. The envoirment is VERY colorful and pleasing to the eye and I hope to actually help in the art work of it if the creator lets me.  :D !!!!11!!			"

												Best platformer I've played in ages! Super smooth controls, great graphics+music, and a magnificent multiplayer mode that I seriously can't get enough of. The stat differences and abilities that come from the various races/hats/traits provide great variation in gameplay, too, so everyone can find the playstyle that works best for them.			"

												Fun little game. The crafting can get a little annoying at times but is still a positive experience, regardless. My only minor complaint is that I wished there were more things to buy exclusively to the shops. Also, there is not much to do with gold in the game once you have it. Other than that it's fairly entertaining. I can only hope more updates occur in the future.			"

												this game is great for any fans of grinding rpgshowever it is not for the faint of heart or the sqeemish when it comes to penaltiesthe gameplay is intuitive enough for either long drawnout sessions or even a quick fixfor anyone who would consider themselves masochists, i highly suggest this title.""Magicite"" is a fun addictive game with many reasons to play,from the crafting, to combat, and the lvl up systemthis game keep even the most relished of players who have claimed to of seen it all, very much entertained for hoursmy personal rating for this game(not professional, but personal) is a fairly descent- 7/10-its a fast paced title where a playthrough could last from a couple of minutes to several hours despite the harsh factor of perma-death-multiplayer is fun and entertaining-and the character progression is always interestingthank you very much for taking the time to read this personal review of the new game ""Magicite""			"

												This is a great game for an Early access game. Although there are an ENOMOUS amount of glitches, in multiplayer at least, the gameplay makes up for it. ""If you thought the Binding of Isaac was hard, then try this"" that is the only way to describe this game with fun online multiplayer as long as one of you can host, not to mention this game is still in beta which gives the devs time to fix these things, and in fact in every update they have had they fix bug after bug. The gameplay itself however is VERY fun with multiple people in the game, even singleplayer has a completly different feel to it. Singleplayer while everyone may ""dis"" it is a very challenging way to play and can be fun for anyone who, as i said before, likes 2D plateformers in the style of ""Bloody Trapland"" with RPG and Rougelikeness of ""The Binding of Issac"". So good luck peons, and have fun.			"

												=HEADS UP=I had a review before this one about the game being good. This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=1. My reviews tend to be a bit longer. If that is the case please be patient and read everything.2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]3. If you want to try to change my opinion with arguments that make no sense in any way then please do not comment at all.=REVIEW=This game is truly cute. I love it to bits. Tiny bits if i am going to be honest here because that is what i do in this game. I go in and love them to bits.Now lets be serious. This game is a roguelike 2D Platform Sidescroller and it truly makes itself look amazing. The overall game plays itself very easily and the controlls are just as easy as the game is. But dont think the game is actually easy. The game is just like any other Roguelike game very hard. The game can not only be hard but also nearly impossible at times. Or atleast that is how it seems.In the game you will not get anything. Everything depends on your class and Perks. Well actually it depends only on your playstyle since even with the most amazing perks you will die if you are not good at the game. That means that in the end you can die if you cannot dodge a certain attack or enemy. And if you people know what bullethell means then you know exactly what can come at you.The game has unlockables but you have to do certain things to unlock them. You have to even cheat for one of the unlocks but i am not going to tell you how. The hint is out and now its your thing to find it out. There are three different types of unlockables. Class | Equipment | Pet.The Classunlocks give you different Skins and different Items to start. The Equipmentunlocks give you Hats that give you certain attributs and effects. With one hat you might be able to jump higher or to run faster. With the next one you are able to get more from Mining rocks and ore. The Petunlocks give you Pets. Every Pet has a different effect and remains as a neutral companion who grants you his powers. One pet may grant you Health as you complete a level. The next pet may grant you extra stats up while leveling up.But how do you get all of this? By playing the game a whole lot. And by completing it too. And that is no easy task. If you people are familar with Terraria then you know what the infamous ""Wall of Flesh"" is. The same Enemy waits for you as Endboss with one really big twist. The Level ends at a certain point and is just as long as the other levels. So it is up to you and your playstyle if you live or die.But no matter how frustrating this game was for me i can only recommend this game. It is cute and just amazing. I had a lot of fun playing it even though i am not playing it anymore.			"

Early Access Review
								[This is all said on the version Im currently playing on this day]This is a rouge RPG (Meaning you die). You start off with random items and usually an Axe (As far as I know). Through out your exploarations you encournter cute, colorful, scary and big creatures. All you have is your one life and what ever you have on you at the time. You better choose wisely and preper to die ... Alot.You can customise your character and there are some more features to your that you can add but I havent found them yet. Once you wander out you quickly encouter Creatures ranging from ants to GIANT Monsters that you must fight to continue. The envoirment is VERY colorful and pleasing to the eye and I hope to actually help in the art work of it if the creator lets me.  :D !!!!11!!			"

We played a few hours every few nights (longer as we got better at the game), chatting the whole time about this and that.  And that was the thing.  We could just game and talk.

												Super fun game when it's coop. it's way harder in single player since you can't revive, didn't have much fun in single player at all. Love coop though.

Posted: June 10, 2014
												(I'm apologize in advance if this guide sucks, 1st guide ever.) I was interesting in this game because it was a rogue-like game with multiplayer. I have played many rogue-like games (Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Legend of Dungeon) but none of them have had multiplayer capabilities. Magicite's feature that divides this game from other rogue-like games is crafting, a very likeable feature. Graphics are nice and they resemble Terraria graphics. Combat takes a bit to get used to (For me at least) but very fluid. The bug i've found through out my very short play-time was the HP Bug everytime you start a new character, use always start with 1 less health then your full health value. Either way I think Magicite is a very good rogue-like game because its different from regular perma-death games. (Levels and Crafting) If your looking for a rogue-like game that is different then other rogue-like games then you will love this game. Sorry again for a mediocre review and maybe rambling.			"

												The game i would vote as game of the year.Ok now onto the review itselfMagicite is a rogue-like dungeon crawler involving platforming.Character creation:You have the ability to pick a race (starting gear + stats)Hats (Different abilities depending on the hats usually more loot or stats)Pets (Health regen and other amazing abilities)The route is obvious go from Left to Right in a linear fashion.Each enemy has a set pattern such as firing projectiles or just going straight melee.Due to this being randomly generated there will be times where you just spawn in and bosses are in your face.Ok onto the good part. You will have to craft items from scratch and gradually upgrade your tools from:Wood -> Stone -> Iron -> Gold -> Diamond... You can figure out the rest.Similar to the progression of minecraft.I haven't completed the game as of yet.If you have money to spare i would recommend you getting this game for yourself.If you enjoy it so much convince your friends to play this too...It's money well spent.And yes i do recommend this game!

												I played and 100%'d Rogue Legacy when it came out, and have been looking to chase that dragon ever since. I finally found it in Magicite. It's very similar in a lot of ways, especially with the ""rogue-lite"" permadeath but permanent upgrades found in Rogue Legacy. I didn't get it right away because I thought it was more like Spelunky, which I just couldn't get into, but this somehow felt 100x more enjoyable. It's more like a love child between Rogue Legacy action platforming with Starbound's crafting. There's at least 30 hours of content in Magicite, but you could easily use 100s unlocking all the perks and items and just enjoying the game.It's a lot of fun in co-op as well, and the online works well, but a lot of coordination is needed between players so I would definitely suggest using Mumble or some other VOIP program to communicate. Text chat is supported IIRC but would not work well at all anyway.			"

												It's a really cool and hard game. I'm not really a GOOD gamer, so maybe it's not THAT hard, but I found myself trying to get better and better just to reach one level more than I reached before... And that's an amazing feeling.The gameplay is quite interesting, and the fact that you have to unlock the races one by one is really a good motivation to play the game. Same thing with hats. Yep, hats. Hats with bonus. /o/You can also change the stats you have at first, but it's random with the passive skills, so... :3 Having a good combo between these two isn't quite easy and sometimes, you just give up and launch the game anyway, without having the perfect-amazing-of-the-death-combo you wanted to have... And end up having a better score than before.Luck is also needed for this game, as the world is randomly generated, and so are your options at the end of each level. Sometimes it's frustrating, sometimes it's just perfect to motivate you to continue.But the BEST point of this game is, in my opinion, the dev. Updates everywhere. It's not in Early Access and there are updates quite often. And if not, the next update has great changes. Really, that's an amazing selling argument.That was my opinion for this game, I hope it will convince you to buy it. It's not really expensive (10€ for my country), so it's really worth it. Thank you, and sorry if I made mistakes in english~			"

												terraria meets binding of isaac first hour or so will be a painful experience, lack of knowledge will lead to deaths and lack of persistance (past race/hat/companion unlocks which will affect subsequent runs with stats, starting items and unique effects) will make those early deaths particularily frustrating... but i promise you perseverance is worth it, magicite is an absolute gem of a gameit loses some aspects of the game comparisons above (mainly building and world persistance from terraria in favour of binding of isaac rogue-like temporariness), i feel like it would benefit greatly from steam achievements and theres some balance issues with a melee playstyle (good early game, fine most of the game - punishing, not great reward for the risk - but in some encounters its completely un-viable)			"

Oh boy, what a story...(Note: Roguelikes have different ""Good"" features and ""Bad"" features than most.) Pre-2.0Magicite is a -ALLMOST- completed roguelike game that is very easy to get into, but hard to master.+simple yet complex crafting system+Permadeath+Procedurally generated levels+Randomized loot + ""Legendaries"" (in a way)+Lots of unlockables~No saving-Magical weapons are sub-par late game-Unfinished features (I.E ""Gods"") left in, increasing load time for near-pointless thingsSeemed allmost a  9/10.....Then the 2.0 Update came.-=-BUGS!-=-i have had the luck of suffering very few bugs in singleplayer. Singleplayer generally works fine for me. HOWEVER, a freind of mine has suffered constant bugs and glitches in singleplayer. so really, take my sucess with a grain of salt.When i did multiplayer, holy cow was it a bugfest. everything from falling through the world to CTDs or even the game ending randomly! multiplayer is pretty much unplayable. Especially if your freind is crap at the game (every time a player dies the game has a chance to explode into a buggy mess).I am upvoting this game in the hope that Sean will return to it and repair these bugs. Even though he said he's not supporting it anymore.. <,<			"

												This game is a mix between Minecraft and Terraria with more RPG elements and it is a fantastic game. There are many ways to approach this game and all of them work so well.If you can buy it, get it. This game is so much fun, especially with other people.			"

												Really fun game. You start out as a Peon, choose your stats based on a roll, (you can reroll), and then go at it to gather up enough resources to defeat the boss. If you die, you start over - this makes it rougelike, but you can unlock different races / companions  / hats / heads(deco) thus you don't loose all your progress. Takes ~1 hour to complete a run.Multiplayer is a little buggy, but still fun.Music is awesome.Art & lighting is awesome.Content is a little lacking, and it's not as polished as a mirror, but it is still a really cool game.8/10.

												I was unsure of this game when I first picked it up on sale. On first boot I noticed there was next to 0 load time, which can make games that have to load often very frustrating. Singleplayer is where I started my adventure. I created my guy and I spawned in a nice forest. I survived for about 15 seconds. Belive me, this game is not easy, and it isn't mean to be. You are going to die, a lot. Eventually I got used to the controls, crafting and gameplay and found myself quite addicted. I was really digging the game so I thought I might get my buddies hooked on it aswell. I was quite confused on how to use the multiplayer features in the game until I found a thread explaining most of the details. Multiplayer for me was my only bad experience of the game. After setting everything up with Hamachi my friend could finally join my game. But it was unplayable. Falling through the floor, not seeing the other person move and seeing him chop down a tree that I already chopped down was just a few bugs we experienced. It's annoying how I have these problems while others don't but regardless this game is still a gem. Some things I would like to see are: Achievements, an option to resume a game, multiplayer fixes, in-game chat, a cursor you can see, bug fixes (e.g. game sometimes hangs when you open crafting menu) and full sound (some interactions have no sound)I look forward to seeing this game evolve and wish the developer all the best.

												As someone who didn't play the early access, I have no opinion on wether the game has improved since then. The game is amazingly good fun, and I'd reccomend it to anybody who likes rogue-like combat-based games.The combat is a nice touch, simply left clicking (or right clicking for some effects) is very cool and it allows you to enjoy the game to the fullest. There are many unique mobs, and enough to fit nicely. You always start in the relatively friendly forest/jungle and have to run through various levels. After that level is complete, you get an option of 3 different rooms, some of these (or sometimes all) can be biomes you already visited or a completely new one. Every time you die in the game, you have to start from the very beginning with nothing on you but the starting gear of that character and the traits you used last time (if you press the play again button, cancelling out resets the character's traits and stats). You may sit there for a couple of minutes trying to get the perfect stats with the perfect traits your character suits.I've discovered 4 different types of ""classes"", Warrior : The basic and most easiest to start with, using swords. Ranger: Using bows and arrows, focuses on the dexterity skill (DEX). Magician: Using magic staves (which are quite limited at the current time) and Barbarian: using Giant axes and Zweihanders, dealing MASSIVE damage. The easiest and most common is the Warrior, as the other 3 are pretty hard to set up early on, and by the time your later on in the game, you already have the best sword... Odviously, you can mix and match these, but these are the 4 main ways of dealing damage. Even though this game is amazing and has no glitches (that I've found, at least), the game has a lot of area's lacking in content. the game is really fun to play, and there are quite a few unlocks, but there's not enough content to make you play over 40 hours, as at that time you've already had everything there is. Not saying 40 hours worth of content is bad, but the fact that there is not a lot of unlocks limits the replayability of the game without having to completely start over, and having a lot more hats, minions, customization and characters would be nice.Overall, the game is great for it's relatively cheap price, so get it if you like the look of the game!

Oh boy, what a story...(Note: Roguelikes have different ""Good"" features and ""Bad"" features than most.) Pre-2.0Magicite is a -ALLMOST- completed roguelike game that is very easy to get into, but hard to master.+simple yet complex crafting system+Permadeath+Procedurally generated levels+Randomized loot + ""Legendaries"" (in a way)+Lots of unlockables~No saving-Magical weapons are sub-par late game-Unfinished features (I.E ""Gods"") left in, increasing load time for near-pointless thingsSeemed allmost a  9/10.....Then the 2.0 Update came.-=-BUGS!-=-i have had the luck of suffering very few bugs in singleplayer. Singleplayer generally works fine for me. HOWEVER, a freind of mine has suffered constant bugs and glitches in singleplayer. so really, take my sucess with a grain of salt.When i did multiplayer, holy cow was it a bugfest. everything from falling through the world to CTDs or even the game ending randomly! multiplayer is pretty much unplayable. Especially if your freind is crap at the game (every time a player dies the game has a chance to explode into a buggy mess).I am upvoting this game in the hope that Sean will return to it and repair these bugs. Even though he said he's not supporting it anymore.. <,<			"

												Magicite is a fun time, but it doesn't have the depth or replayablity of games like rogue legacy. I think of Magicite like a platformer version of desktop dungeons, it is worth a few runs, but ultimatly isn't worth the $10 asking price. The crafting system is awesome albiet small, the mechanics aren't flavorfull enough, and the amount of content isn't expansive enough to consider it a worthwhile alternative. I would skip this game for anything more than $5.The game is fun for a few play sessions, but is more of a precurssor to Rogue Legacy than anything else. If you want a rogue platformer, right now I believe the best option is Rogue Legacy.			"

												OverviewMagicite is a rogue like platformer that has a mix of survival and exploration elements mixed in. The games developers SmashGames have create a game that is not only fun to play but challenging if not downright merciless. The game was originally on steams early access but has since left but is still updated with the funds that were raised on Kickstarter.StoryMagicite doesn’t really have a story. But townsfolk that can be found between the levels can be spoken to and can give you a bit of info about the world.GameplayMagicite seem to draw idea and concepts of other game, the platforming from games like Spelunky and the survival system from Minecraft as well as some RPG elements. The first thing that the player is required is to create is their character. At first the level of choice the player has is very limited with only two different hairstyle and the ability to roll a dice to determine what stats and the two random traits they will receive. After a few good play through, other options will be unlocked such as new races, hats and companions that can give some extra buffs and make the game easier. Different races have a different set of starting gear. Hats have special effect and companions will provide passive effects. After the player create their character they are dropped into a forest biome with the starting item of their race. Every level is randomly generated when a level is completed the player will be given a choice of three other biomes which are also randomly generated. Player can visit towns in between levels were item can be bought or sold as well as craft new ones. When the player level up that gain more stat points and with be able to skills from skill trees melee, magic and ranged. Player can have three skill and they are given to them randomly.Player must collected resources to craft new tool to help in the higher level as well to help manage hunger. Crafting is easy to make an item you must combine two other items. They are not many recipes so they are easy to learn and you just need better material to make better items.Magicite is an unforgiving game health pools are few and far between and potion are rare.

Anybody that likes a challenge, platformers or just like to play game with some friends or by your self should definitely give this game a go.   "

												OverviewMagicite is a rogue like platformer that has a mix of survival and exploration elements mixed in. The games developers SmashGames have create a game that is not only fun to play but challenging if not downright merciless. The game was originally on steams early access but has since left but is still updated with the funds that were raised on Kickstarter.StoryMagicite doesn’t really have a story. But townsfolk that can be found between the levels can be spoken to and can give you a bit of info about the world.GameplayMagicite seem to draw idea and concepts of other game, the platforming from games like Spelunky and the survival system from Minecraft as well as some RPG elements. The first thing that the player is required is to create is their character. At first the level of choice the player has is very limited with only two different hairstyle and the ability to roll a dice to determine what stats and the two random traits they will receive. After a few good play through, other options will be unlocked such as new races, hats and companions that can give some extra buffs and make the game easier. Different races have a different set of starting gear. Hats have special effect and companions will provide passive effects. After the player create their character they are dropped into a forest biome with the starting item of their race. Every level is randomly generated when a level is completed the player will be given a choice of three other biomes which are also randomly generated. Player can visit towns in between levels were item can be bought or sold as well as craft new ones. When the player level up that gain more stat points and with be able to skills from skill trees melee, magic and ranged. Player can have three skill and they are given to them randomly.Player must collected resources to craft new tool to help in the higher level as well to help manage hunger. Crafting is easy to make an item you must combine two other items. They are not many recipes so they are easy to learn and you just need better material to make better items.Magicite is an unforgiving game health pools are few and far between and potion are rare. Playing with friend can make it easier because downed player can be revived by another player. However the reviver is left vulnerable for about three second.The controls for Magicite are for keyboard and mouse only, the keyboard for moving and the mouse for interacting and aiming. The control are very responsive which is so important in a platformer with this level of difficulty. VisualsMagicite has a very retro feel with it simple 16-bit graphics and bright and vibrant colours, with the games background being as dark as it is make the colours stand out even more.

												Magicite is a fun time, but it doesn't have the depth or replayablity of games like rogue legacy. I think of Magicite like a platformer version of desktop dungeons, it is worth a few runs, but ultimatly isn't worth the $10 asking price. The crafting system is awesome albiet small, the mechanics aren't flavorfull enough, and the amount of content isn't expansive enough to consider it a worthwhile alternative. I would skip this game for anything more than $5.The game is fun for a few play sessions, but is more of a precurssor to Rogue Legacy than anything else. If you want a rogue platformer, right now I believe the best option is Rogue Legacy.			"

												This game is brilliant, fun and challanging but has only one flaw and that is the lack of dedicated servers or the inability to creatre a server without needing hamchi or your own dedicated server... so actualy two things. But all joking aside this game is fun the crafting, races, perks, monsters, areas, town and loot and all done really well,  the rouge-like area generation make this game highly replayable  its just a shame about multiplayer although single layer is fantstic i feel like fixing the multiplayer would make 10/10, if the problem is solved by the time you read this then just buy this game as soon as your done reading.

Early Access Review
								What can I say about Magicite that hasn't already been said about the wheel, penicillin, or the iPhone.... this is one of the greatest inventions of all time. My wife and I would argue constantly over who had to find a decent game on steam. It's one of those chores NO ONE wants to do! You know, the old ""I spent the entire day rearing OUR children, maybe YOU can pitch in a little and find a decent game?"" and of course, ""You think I have the energy to slave over finding good games? I worked a 12 hour shift just to come home to THIS?!"" These are the things that can destroy an entire relationship. It got to the point where our children could sense the tension. The minute I heard our 6-year-old girl in her bedroom, re-enacting our game finding fight with her Barbie dolls, I knew we had to make a change. That's when I found Magicite. Our marriage has never been healthier, AND we've even incorporated it into our lovemaking. Thank you Magicite!			"

Posted: March 16, 2015
												I am writing this rather quickly, in order for it to be available to those considering Magicite while it is on sale, but it should accurately reflect my views on the game.Magicite is most definitely a roguelike, at least in the Isaac/Spelunky sense. It is not a game of a different genre with roguelike elements. However, there are certain aspects that, in my eyes, make it rather odd for a roguelike. I will get to those in a moment. First, the basic concept of the game.In Magicite, you are a solitary adventurer in an underground realm called Deephaven, the place to which the surface dwellers have retreated in the face of an invasion by an enemy called the Scourge. Your objective is to make your way from District One to District 20, the Scourge Lair, and to kill their (assumed) leader, the Scourge Wall (which is rather like the Wall of Flesh from Terraria). In each district, if you linger for too long, the Scourge will appear, and individuals will begin chasing and attacking you, similarly to the Rebel pursuit in FTL or the Ghost in Spelunky.Every other district, starting with District 2, is a town area, with no enemies and an assortment of NPCs, some of which are window dressing and some of which are merchants or artisans.Within regular districts, you will find resources, mainly trees and rocks, which can be harvested Minecraft-style with pickaxes or hatchets. There are also herb patches, which can drop several ingredients, and small shrubs with magical insects living inside, which give special magical regents.Each district, aside from the first and the last, can have one of various biomes. At the end of each odd-numbered district is a set of three doors, each of which is color-coded to show the biome to which it leads. You may pick one then, which will take you to the town level, and then to the biome you picked. Early on they will usually only offer easy biomes, with many resources and weak enemies, with the options gradually becoming more challenging over time.Now, how is this game odd for a roguelike?First, there is a relatively small assortment of items in the game. At first many will be suprises, but after a while, you may come to expect most possible drops- and this includes rare treasure items that are uncraftable. I don't consider this bad, as such, but it heavily reduces the differences from run to run.Second, because most of the items necessary to do well are craftable, you can usually get roughly the same level of equipment run to run by the same points in the game, if you follow the right 'build order' of items, which also tends to reduce the novelty each run.And third, although each District is randomly generated, ones of a given biome are nearly always highly similar to others of the same biome- although admittedly, different biomes are drastically different and interesting. A Swamp level will, at least in my experience, feel pretty much the same as any other Swamp level most of the time. You could argue that Nuclear Throne does the same, with many of its zones, but although many times the, say, first three levels are highly similar to variants you have played before, they are also sometimes quite different instead. In Magicite, that rarely happens, in my experience.Now, I may come across as dislike the game based on this commentary- but actually, other aspects of Magicite more than make up for these points, and honestly, I have grown to like these three aspects of the game. In most roguelikes, because of just how random things become, you have no idea how things will go beforehand. One run in either Isaac could well be different in every particular from your previous run. And in some roguelikes, such as Tower of Guns or Ziggurat, the layout of the first couple floors could well determine if you manage to make it far or if you die immediately, even after a few hours of playing. In Magicite, you can largely determine how you want to play a run when you set up your character, and most of the time, the challenge of a particular biome will be the same run to run, meaning that your success or failure is due almost completely to your own ability- not to snub any of these other games, all of which I greatly enjoy. My point is, because there are many other games which play out different, Magicite's constancy (for a roguelike) makes it somewhat unique, and for me, a pleasing alternative.But most importantly, there are many aspects of Magicite that I find wonderful in and of themselves.Combat- with magic and ranged as well, but primarily melee- weighty and precise, simple and yet difficult to use properly, allowing you to evade most every attack against you if you are practiced enough, yet also making it so that even a few mistakes may end your life. It reminds me some of Monster Hunter, although on a smaller, more responsive scale.Combat Styles- as hinted above, this game has melee, magic, and ranged. Each one feels substantially different, and each one can be used by the same character; or, you can specialize in only one, through armor and leveling. Yes, this game has level-ups, through experience orbs that dead monsters drop. As you level, you will get to pick three skills, each time given the option to choose a class. You will get a random skill (from a small pool) for the class that you picked. You can pick all three from the same class, or one from each, or whatever combination seems strongest for the character you want. It adds an interesting element to the game that otherwise would not exist.Unlockables- most roguelikes have these, and Magicite handles them quite well. There are three types of unlockables: character races, companions, and hats. Races each begin with modifications to their base stats and up to three starting items. Companions provide some form of passive bonus, such as periodic healing or stronger level-ups. And hats provide a single special bonus, varying from a chance to gather double resources from certain sources to special magical attacks from attacking barehanded. All three types allow for interesting builds, especially some of the more difficult to obtain ones. And some are very difficult- such as to beat the game without taking a point of damage, ever. To my knowledge, all are doable, but some seem incredibly difficult. When you set up a character, you pick a race, one companion and one hat, thereby letting you decide how your run will be focused.And finally, Music- which is just superb. Minecraft is my high mark in ambient music, which I have never seen surpassed myself, but Magicite, with some of its town themes and biome songs, comes close. Honestly, just have a listen.All of these combine to make Magicite a suprisingly unique, enjoyable roguelike that feels far more special that it may look at first glance. I would highly recommend this game, especially on sale as it is now. The developer has consistently shown commitment to updating and improving the game, so it could well become even better with time.TL;DR- Magicite is a unique, engaging, and beautiful roguelike that has far more going for it then it may appear to have, although it does not have the same difference between runs and sheer variety of possible items that many other roguelikes have.

												Mixed feelings here... Voting ""no"" to balance the votes I feel this game deserves.I got a lot of playtime out of this, BUT it's very very repetative until you learn the moves of each monster. Die on stage 16, play from stage 1 AGAIN (for the 100th time).After beating the game twice (dex based then magic based) - both times in about an hour - there wasn't much reason to continue playing. Sure, I could make the game more challenging by playing Str based, but there aren't any surprises waiting (esp. since most of the game I was hack n' slashing anyway).That said, I never tried the multiplayer but with no server list, it limited my ability to do so.Felt tedious and I likely would not have finished if I wasn't a tad masochistic.

												I would totally recommend this game if it worked.  But ever since sometime in mid August, my singleplayer hasn't worked.  I get a black screen with just the hud.  I just tried again with the recent update with no change.I haven't played multiplayer with the recent update, but most of my hours of gameplay came from playing with a friend since I couldn't play by myself.  The game is fun, don't get me wrong, but I would like to be able to play by myself sometime.If you have friends to play with and want to risk the chance of getting this single player bug, then go ahead and buy it.  It is worth the $10.But I will have to give a no overall for my recommendation until this game is fixed.  This bug has been talked about in the forums since before I first encountered it, but no solution has come up.			"

												Gifted to me during the Xmas Steam Sale, I wasn't sure what to make of Magicite. I started the game and died literally a minute later. The game is quite harsh to the new and uninitiated, and can be difficult to learn when under such oppressive circumstances.But give it a chance, and you won't regret it.Best described as a Terraria and Rogue Legacy lovechild, MAGICITE has you traversing randomly-generated biomes, collecting resources and crafting tools/weapons while fighting off hostile creatures. Between levels (called 'districts') there are towns where you can trade, sell, and buy.However, if you die, you lose everything and have to start over. The higher your score, though, the more chests you can open, giving you a chance to unlock more classes.The game can be quite punishing, but ultimately feels satisfying when you make it further than the last attempt. It borders on downright addicting.After a few runs you start to get better and travel further. Might want to try giving it a shot yourself.			"

												My heart was pounding as I entered the Dungeon biome. I had grown an attachment with my items I've worked so hard to get, but the things I didn't have were potions. Through the 26 hours I've played I haven't yet lost interest, it's fun, hard, rage inducing, and over all just great. Magicite will peak your interest, I'm sure of it.			"

												This game is a ton of fun. Simple, challenging and addictive. But for a game that emphasises co-operative play the online is tremendously laggy. When I play with more than two people at a time one person always seems to freeze up, lag out or just disconnect. (The same situation with different hosts) I often find it difficult to make it through the first level without a hitch. Although still fun to play alone, its much more enjoyable with a couple friends. But due to the connection issues it can get frustrating when someone disconnects after a half hour of gameplay with no saves or any way of reconnecting.			"

												Magecite is a fun action-platformer with some rouge-like elements and basic crafting thrown in (because everyone loves crafting). Its has decent combat mechanics, and randomly generated maps. I've played a about 8 hours of the single player (haven't beat the game yet) and its a hard yet rewarding game. I've played a bit of multiplayer and I would say that playing with friends brings the game to an other level. Unfortunatly the online multiplayer feature is EXTREMLY broken and hard to get working. The only instance I've had multiplayer work is when playing over LAN. Hamachi doesn't fix any of the online problems and if you plan on playing with other people you will most likely run in to a brickwall if you try online. Despite the broken online I enjoy this game and its a fun singleplayer experience and an excelent LAN game, and maybe some day Smashgames will ad a functioning online feature (and they should because they are advertising this as a ""Multiplayer RPG Platformer""). My recomendation however is not to buy this game untill they fixed the online feature because they have already sold way to many copies out of a incomplete/broken title. How ever if they do fix it in the future buy the hell out of this game.			"

												Incredibly challenging rogue-lite platformer. You craft your variation of weaponry and equipment rather than loot or buy it most of the time. It's best played with friends, it's even easier to play if you have friends since you are able to revive your friends if one was to falter - but not yourself.+ Replayability+ Soundtrack, really fits the kind of mood each map theme has+ Wide variety of characters+ Wide variety of range and melee weaponry+ Beautiful lighting, overall graphics are good and fit together well+ Platforming properly integrated into the game unlike in Risk of Rain where you didn't use the platforms much to add an advantage in combat- Crafting takes a lot of effort to try to memorize and you'll miss out certain items that can mean your death simply because you didn't know the recipe existed- Multiplayer isn't fitting several people, it's the same difficulty as if you're playing singleplayer, except you're two and you can revive one another which reduces the chance of having to restart. Multiplayer is incredibly forgiving while singleplayer isn't.			"

This is a good and bad thing, saying that the game relies on skill and not stats is a good thing, but the player retention might be slightly lower because of the learning curve.I recommend this game highly, especially if you are willing to take on a learning curve.

A few times when I would spawn I would immediately die because of the monster right next to me, the health was far too low and didn't regenerate, no such thing as 'saved data' and it didn't tell you how to craft the items.

												The platformer gameplay doesn't mesh well with the crafting aspect. Crafting is time consuming and relies on patience, trial and error, and exploration. Platforming is about quick deaths and reflexes. The two are contrary to each other. This could be mitigated with interface design choices to make crafting faster or easier, but not enough was done in that respect. The game also doesn't do enough to help new players.

The perm death function is halfway bypassable in multiplayer, but regardless of single player or multiplayer, the game revolves around perm death and the idea of new stats and perks every game. For those who like a straight playthrough until the end, I would not recommend the game for you, as I was able to ""beat"" the game in about 2 hours. However I plan to continue to play the game as I feel the replay value it offers is definitely good enough to consider the game buy worthy!			"

												Great rogue like, it takes some time to figure out how to craft items but a quick skim over a crafting guide will tell you what you can craft or you can experiment until you figure it all out.  The game is challenging but once you get into the groove of it, you can easily get to the end of the game but there is still difficulty in unlocking the accessories and other classes.  My biggest gripe with the game is that there is no way to select the perks that you have at the start so you have to keep rolling until you get exactly what you want or just run with a random pair of perks.  Id also like to see them add some steam achievements or trading cards in the future.			"

												Another particularly hard 2-d platformer, -Seems I have been reviewing a lot of these lately- I really enjoy games like this, from the outlook of my reviews. This is a very amazing example of a Fantasy (Or Phantasy as I like to refer to it as) 2-d platformer, I normally play this whenever I have a small bit of time but not enough to play a larger game. The game takes place underground, when you as the player have fallen far below the surface to escape the corruption and your objective is to slowly maneuver your way through the many random dungeons created. It’s very addicting; a good game to transform into an app however like all app-like games it is very challenging. You start out with very little life, there is a large palette of monsters waiting to slaughter you, if you don’t collect enough resources you will have no chance of surviving in the next level, and on top of all of that if you spend too much time in one level giant purple eyes descend upon you from all directions. It runs very smoothly, no lag that I was able to detect at least. I recommend this game to any Phantasy lovers, and to anyone looking for a good challenge. Good luck, may we all see the surface once more...			"

												This game mushes the genres of survival, rougelike, and RPG together and makes something beautiful.All genres are put into the game excellently, and it makes a unique experience unparalleled to any other rougelike out there today.That being said, the game is quite hard and has a large learning curve. This is a good and bad thing, saying that the game relies on skill and not stats is a good thing, but the player retention might be slightly lower because of the learning curve.I recommend this game highly, especially if you are willing to take on a learning curve.

												I've played a lot of Magicite, and I would definitely recommend it to others with a few ""BUT""s thrown in. Magicite is addictively fun, BUT:1. Co-op is incredibly frustrating. Having to use Hamachi or a similar program to connect is a hassle in and of itself, but on top of that, I'd say at least half of my games have been ruined by lag mess-ups. The screen will go black for one person, or one of us will start falling through the world, and then the game is just done -- there is no fixing it once the lag issue is there. 2. The stats system is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It's the typical mages go for Magic, warriors go for Attack, archers go for Dex, but with traits (like needing less food, bonus luck when crafting, chance to mine an additional ore, etc.) thrown in. You get unlimited re-rolls, but it's randomized every time. You can literally spend 5 minutes at the beginning of a game just clicking over and over and over again until you get an optimal setup. Plus, it isn't explained well. 3. This game promised a lot of things via Kickstarter that haven't even begun to be delivered in-game yet, and likely won't for a while. There is no backstory to speak of, no gods, no shrines, no trainers, no huge variety of items/vendors in towns, etc. It's fun for what it is, but it isn't worth the full price right now IMO. I love this game and have banked a lot more hours on it than Steam has on record, and I fully recommend that people pick it up and try it, but really only when it's on a half-off Steam sale.			"

Jump from platform to platform and kill countless enemies, and naturals mobs in order to gain that sweet sweet experience. Chop down trees, and mine rocks for great resources that you'l use to craft weaponry and diverse gear! This game is like a bag of Doritos just waiting to be opened, get it while you can!

												I got this game just under a week ago, and though it took many tries, I did manage to beat the Scourge Wall. I really enjoy playing this game because I love games that are both based on the player's actions and choices as well as the game's ""decisions"". I know that those decisions are based on a RNG but if you are going for a certain play style like I do, it is almost up to the game whether or not you will succeed. I found playing as a ""Warrior"" my first few tries was a good strategy while I was still getting used to the controls and general crafting. However, I decided to try playing as a ""Mage"" and ended up sticking with it because it was really challenging sometimes to get the numerous items necessary to play it, several times, I ended up at District 10 with none of the staffs built. I haven't tried playing as a ""Ranger"" yet, but I plan on trying it soon. The only thing I don't really like is the traits when you go to make your character. I often try to get specific combos of the skills, typically the one that lets you make bigger potions and then whatever else I feel like using at the time. However, I have often been sitting there for minutes at a time trying to get those skills to what I want. I feel that we should at least be able to customize those a little bit, like maybe locking them in as we find ones we want. However, though I don't like it entirely, I feel that it is still actually fair, seeing as how you are going for certain things so it should take a bit. I've also noticed a few weird things about taking/dealing damage. For instance, when using the ice spell, you can't hit an enemy with the same crystal more than once, unless it leaves the enemy's hitbox entirely. This is understandable. However, you can take advantage of the invincibility frames  and actually ride on some enemies. As long as you don't leave that enemy's hitbox, you can stand on top of enemies such as the Tyranox (I probably spelt that wrong but those of you who have played it, know what I'm talking about). If the developers see this, could you maybe change this? As cool as this is, I feel that they should be able to damage you as soon as the invincibility frames are up.Ok, that got rather long, but I feel that I have said everything that I wanted. In summary, I really love this game and look foward to seeing more updates in the future.			"

If you don't have an amazing rig, a decent computer would fun very smoothly. The crafting system is very uniqe, same with many other game aspects. Curently there is a lot of bugs (mostly in multiplayer) but it is still an alpha. Overall I highly reccomecd this game and I give it a 10/10.			"

												A unique rogue-like platformer. Really fun to play solo but even more so with friends. New updates come out frequently so there will always be new things. I recommend this to anyone that is a fan of rogue-like games or difficult platformers. I do warn you, however, that there are a lot of deaths awaiting you.			"

												A wonderful game, Highly think you should pick this up, Its roguelike,  the game is harsh with its death, the crafting is rather fun, and the battles are rather fun too, The only thing i'd say needs to be better would be the swords and such, its rather boring to play as the damagy tanky kinda guy, ya dig?Otherwise, the game is fun with unlockables, Which is super fun and hard to get them, You have a little companion fairy that could heal you moving onto the next stage, A hat that can increase your chance to get more dexterity, All in all, its a rather fantastic game.

												Amazing Game! Kickass graphics, great gameplay, And a great challenge for rogue-like veterans. Anyone who likes combat formula on Rpgs and Binding of Isaac, I gurantee this will be a great game for players like you. Here are some positives and Negatives:Positives:-----------------------------------------------------------------------Fun, awesome with friends.Good challengeLonglasting gameplay and lots of unlockablesAwesome formulaGreat looksMany items and things to doNegatives:-----------------------------------------------------------------A little buggy sometimesOccasionally you could get a punch in the balls with bosses.Very hard game to master, which can be a little frustrating, at least for me.Some items are very annoying to get, which can waste a lot more time then it should take for a certain thing.This kind of matches up with the one above, You could have 20% chance to unlock something and do it tens of times, but you could not get it, which is a little unfair. EXTRAS AND /10 SCORE:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In all, It racks up about 8.8/10! Awesome game. Also, if you want a little tips add me on skype and add me on steam! Ill be willing to play with anyone if i am on. Have fun with magicite!			"

												Magicite is an outstanding game, if you like games such as ""Realm of the Mad God"", and other survival stratagies of permadeaths such as ""Skyrim"", Magicite is for you. If you don't have an amazing rig, a decent computer would fun very smoothly. The crafting system is very uniqe, same with many other game aspects. Curently there is a lot of bugs (mostly in multiplayer) but it is still an alpha. Overall I highly reccomecd this game and I give it a 10/10.			"

												Starting off can be hard and you'll probably die a lot but that's what makes the game great! The game is always a challenge and when you beat it, you can try to unlock everything and to do that you might have to do certain things like beat the game without using any health potions, theres also a multiplayer which can make the game eaiser so playing with a friend who's good at the game could teach you a lot. Even if you beat the game 100% you could try to make your own goals or try to find bugs in the game since you can find some just by playing normally. In multiplayer sometimes you might enter an area and all the floor could be gone for one of you so that unlucky person would just fall forever and eventually teleport back up juts to go back down. There's also tons of different combinations of play styles! With several races, hats, perks and companions to chose from, you will always find some sort of style you will like! I would reccomend to almost anyone.			"

												Magicite is one of those games that becomes a gem the more you play it. Alone this game is a fun challenge that rewards careful thinking and skill with faster upgrades and more loot but, is brutal when you make your mistake.Magicite is also one of those games that is extremely hard to write about so, if you would like here

												An amazing game, for all those that enjoy 2D side scrolling games along with crafting and fighting monsters to survive, this game thrives to keep the player ocupied with learning how to craft certain items and abiltitys (like minecraft). Along with choosing your class by picking your abilitys like magic, melee and ranged attacks in which you get the new choice of an ability every 5 levels, I recomend this game to any one that loves minecraft, side scrolling games and challenging enemys which will put you to the limits!

												I will definately reccomend this to others. This was a well-made, visually pleasing, challenging and fun game. Magicite is a rougue-like with elements such as a procedurally generated dungeon and perma-death. However, and even though it is not the most important part of the game, there is crafting included (cause who doesn't like crafting), and a huge variety of items to obtain. In addition to gameplay that simply makes me happy, there are also many perks like races, hats, and companions that are unlockable.For a fun game with cute graphics and challenging gameplay, this is DEFINATELY worth 10 bucks.

One life, no building, platformer game, different races, different hats, different companions, bosses everywhere, and best of all... Magic and skills such as throw a giant axe through the air. Honestly great game 8/10			"

												I enjoy rogue-like games and platformers, so this game was perfect for me. It is rather difficult at first since it just throws you into the game with no instructions or tutorial, but once you can figure it all out it is super fun.			"

												Magicite is a roguelite action platformer that I can best describe as Starbound crosses Spelunky mixed in with Minecraft's crafting system. Magicite allows for you to play three different ways, Strength/Magic/Dexterity. Strength is Swords and Great-axes while Magic is wands and Dexterity is bows. Each ""class"" has their own up/downsides. The amount of content feels a little low at the moment, but the developers are actively working on adding new content and updating the game. So with that in mind I can say that Magicite is very addictive, fun and very much worth its price!			"

												it's funny how a little indie 2d game can be so much fun. this game is very challenging and makes you have to dodge a lot of the mobs mechanics which makes it fun, but once you adapt to it you can get further which makes it even more hard! Overall this game is amazing and definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes challenging games with races, classes etc :D			"

												Magicite provides a nice rogue-type game to play. The only thing that holds this game back is its no save feature. What I mean by this is it needs a way to resume a character after quitting or leaving. This prevents loading previous save files, but allows a ""continue""  feature.			"

Posted: March 12, 2015
												I got this game just under a week ago, and though it took many tries, I did manage to beat the Scourge Wall. I really enjoy playing this game because I love games that are both based on the player's actions and choices as well as the game's ""decisions"". I know that those decisions are based on a RNG but if you are going for a certain play style like I do, it is almost up to the game whether or not you will succeed. I found playing as a ""Warrior"" my first few tries was a good strategy while I was still getting used to the controls and general crafting. However, I decided to try playing as a ""Mage"" and ended up sticking with it because it was really challenging sometimes to get the numerous items necessary to play it, several times, I ended up at District 10 with none of the staffs built. I haven't tried playing as a ""Ranger"" yet, but I plan on trying it soon. The only thing I don't really like is the traits when you go to make your character. I often try to get specific combos of the skills, typically the one that lets you make bigger potions and then whatever else I feel like using at the time. However, I have often been sitting there for minutes at a time trying to get those skills to what I want. I feel that we should at least be able to customize those a little bit, like maybe locking them in as we find ones we want. However, though I don't like it entirely, I feel that it is still actually fair, seeing as how you are going for certain things so it should take a bit. I've also noticed a few weird things about taking/dealing damage. For instance, when using the ice spell, you can't hit an enemy with the same crystal more than once, unless it leaves the enemy's hitbox entirely. This is understandable. However, you can take advantage of the invincibility frames  and actually ride on some enemies. As long as you don't leave that enemy's hitbox, you can stand on top of enemies such as the Tyranox (I probably spelt that wrong but those of you who have played it, know what I'm talking about). If the developers see this, could you maybe change this? As cool as this is, I feel that they should be able to damage you as soon as the invincibility frames are up.Ok, that got rather long, but I feel that I have said everything that I wanted. In summary, I really love this game and look foward to seeing more updates in the future.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. Epic loot and boss battles will always keep you on edge. This game is also hard and has a lot of replayability since every single run is different. Multiplayer is not bad but has glitches. The developer is also probably the best at talking with fans. He loves fan ideas and will respond to almost every message you send him. This game is THE best Rogue Game except for Rogue Legacy and The Binding Of Isacc Rebirth.			"

A crafting system much like terraria/minecraft/every survival indie. all placed in a gorgeous (if you like pixels) side scrolling rogue-like adventure. This game is just as rewarding as it is sadistic, and to be honest each death is more motivating than demotivating.Over all, like most other games, looking up videos just wont give you the same feeling as when you finally start to grasp the game and feel its progression.I highly suggest			"

												It doesn't feel like a finished game to me. The most glaring thing was how few sound assets the game has. Sounds only seem to play when you click on something or hit something. The BGM concealed this for a bit at first, but it didn't take long before I really felt the absence. Attack animations are sluggish, enemies are spongy, the crafting system and inventory are really fiddly/obnoxious, and the hot bar is much too small for the number of items I was wanting to use regularly. Just more hassle than fun really.			"

												It is a nice little game... Pros:Rogue game/random maps The retro look fits the game play High difficulty and lots or replayabilityCrafting SystemLeveling System Tons of different classes/races/accessories you can unlock (which rewards continued playing)The art style is consistent in the game and it works wellThe game runs stable and I encountered no issues with the application itself (fast loading/closing too)Cons:Unforgiving game play that punishes exploration and mistakesThe crafting system is a little redundant for making weapons/toolsControler support may be an issue if you feel you need it (I did not, Keyboard and Mouse here)Cost - I bought it on sale at approximately $4/Paying $9 would feel steepOverall:If you have a soft spot for old school games which are hard as hell, you will love it.If you are looking for an alternative to a game like Terraria, this will not be the game for you.7/10far from perfect, but what is here shows huge promise.

								I found this game alright, it had craftable items, randomly given items, bosses items and was quite good, but there where some downsides. A few times when I would spawn I would immediately die because of the monster right next to me, the health was far too low and didn't regenerate, no such thing as 'saved data' and it didn't tell you how to craft the items. If these where improved or added, the game would be very enjoyable			"

												The platformer gameplay doesn't mesh well with the crafting aspect. Crafting is time consuming and relies on patience, trial and error, and exploration. Platforming is about quick deaths and reflexes. The two are contrary to each other. This could be mitigated with interface design choices to make crafting faster or easier, but not enough was done in that respect. The game also doesn't do enough to help new players. My first death was because I was trying to craft a ladder, not knowing you could double jump.			"

												Something you should REALLY know about magicite.You can have ENDLESS fun in this game in just singleplayer mode.About 14 hours so far and i did not even touch the multiplayer button, the singleplayer is so fun and hard.For me this game is basically ""Platformer binding of isaac"" because you can reply it so many times and it keeps changing.though you should keep in mind this is nothing like terraria or all the other 2d pixel online games. This is a Rogue like, and you unlock, Races(classes) , Companions ( gives powerups and stuff) and hats(special abilities and bonuses to state). And since its a rogue like when you die next time you play you make a new character pick its bonuses and ""traits"" and Play the game again.You can decide to go Warrior, Mage or archer, and they all have some good abilities.what i really love about this game is crafting , i am really the type that REALLY hates crafting, but crafting in this game is so incredibly easy and fun and you keep discovering new Weapons, armors, Items....etc.its so fast you can craft weapons while fighting a boss if you're fast enough.Because its not too complicated, you press shift and join 2 items, there are no recipes or anything its pretty basic and fast and fun.The game is really challenging or maybe i just got rusty with platformers.. hmmmm.havent finished the game yet, came close but died, its really hard has a great Replay value.Love those animations, and all the level designs and enemies, everything is done just right for this games atmosphere.Dont listen to those comparing this to terraria, this is nothing like it , i really dont like terraria at all but i'm in love with magicite. 10/10 pickup for any platformer gamer out there			"

												Another particularly hard 2-d platformer, -Seems I have been reviewing a lot of these lately- I really enjoy games like this, from the outlook of my reviews. This is a very amazing example of a Fantasy (Or Phantasy as I like to refer to it as) 2-d platformer, I normally play this whenever I have a small bit of time but not enough to play a larger game. The game takes place underground, when you as the player have fallen far below the surface to escape the corruption and your objective is to slowly maneuver your way through the many random dungeons created. It’s very addicting; a good game to transform into an app however like all app-like games it is very challenging. You start out with very little life, there is a large palette of monsters waiting to slaughter you, if you don’t collect enough resources you will have no chance of surviving in the next level, and on top of all of that if you spend too much time in one level giant purple eyes descend upon you from all directions. It runs very smoothly, no lag that I was able to detect at least. I recommend this game to any Phantasy lovers, and to anyone looking for a good challenge. Good luck, may we all see the surface once more...			"

												Controlls like Terraria, and has crafting, but that's where the simularity ends.  Difficulty is high, but mostly because enemies move very quickly in very confined spaces while thwomp-like damage blocks fly up and down for no apparent reason.  The game incorporates 3 different class archtypes, warrior, ranger, and mage.  Don't bother with the ranger because crafing arrows require the use of valuable minerals that are better spent on armour and other weapons.  For example, 4 of iron are required to build a sword with 60+ durability, but the same amount of ore will only make 20 arrows.  This is clearly to balance things out since bows don't aggro enemies, but it would have been more fun to have them aggro enemies and allow you to craft more arrows.  The warrior class skills are straight forward and fun enough, while I can't say I got far enough to really get the full feel of the mage skills, though they had potential. The reason I can't recommend this game is because it incorporates a mechanic where if you don't clear an area in 5 minutes, a group of enemies called ""scourge"" show up and one-shot you.   In a game that requires a substantial amount of menuing to craft, so it is extremely frustrating trying to make weapons on the fly, as time lost will limit your ability to collect resources and kill monsters for XP.   Powerful enemies show up very early in the game, forcing you to avoid them most of the time, which is fine, but by the second area, you start to run into enemies with hundreds of HP, that move very quickly and unpredictably.  Up until that point, the enemies you face had in the realm of 7-40 hp and have clear movement patterns.  If you are looking for a game that makes you feel frantic while you try to accumulate sufficient resources to only permanently die part of the way in to start over, this is the game for you.  People who really enjoy a hardcore challenge may take more pleasure in this game than I did, though I personally think most of the challange comes from the poor design decisions mentioned above.			"

												Could've been good, the devs gave up on it. If you can find a way to get it on the cheapside, go ahead and pick it up. Its worth playing around with if you're not giving too much up, but in its current state it really just isn't worth picking up at the set pricepoint.If it gets polished, then perhaps this will change, but the devs have given up. Check out roguelands, what the devs gave up on this for. Use a healthy skepticism when considering buying it. It isn't the same game but better, however it shares many similarities.This is the risk of early access.			"

												Magicite is a fun little game provided you play it with other friends. There's nothing wrong with it if you go solo, it just raises the difficulty and lowers the hilarious fun factor. As advertised it’s a rogue-like with short, procedurally generated levels that includes a good bit of risk-reward gameplay. The game loses several points in my book however for its crafting system and control scheme.The craft system is content to let players stumble about, guessing at what they need to do to make something until they get fed up and go to the wiki for recipes. Even something as simple as Terraria's crafting system, giving you a list on the side of everything you can make with what is in your inventory would go a long way. Any game that all but requires external resources to play is docked a point.The controls are fine and responsive but out of place. A and D move you left and right, W interacts with things but Q and E are short dashes. Its basically imposable to press both D and E to do a right dash while continuing to move (and it’s a twitchy game so if you aren’t still moving after a dash its not often useful) therefore dashes only get used in non combat situations like avoiding static environmental damage. Also, your leveling abilities are tied to Z X C V by default which makes it equally impossible to press the Z triple jump ability while moving left. Controller support would have made the game much easier to play.Despite all that, we still had a blast. You will die a lot learning the game but if you have a buddy with you, they can revive you when you do, drastically extending the lifetime of each play through.7/10 Certainly recommended at <$10			"

												Difficult to play single-player. This one's made for multi-player... and the more the merrier. You start off with only a few points of health, so you can die very quickly if you don't have a teammate to revive you. With enough practice, it's not so difficult to solo, but starting off co-op is recommended.A few bugs  (some items do not and never will unlock, like gatherer and naming and in-game cheat) and sometimes your toon will get stuck facing backwards)(and one very large one (if too many people try to go through the door at the same time), but otherwise it's legit. As long as you're not really going for unlocking everything, it's good fun. *NOTE: must love frustration and have tenacity. You will yell at this game. A lot.			"

												Starting off can be hard and you'll probably die a lot but that's what makes the game great! The game is always a challenge and when you beat it, you can try to unlock everything and to do that you might have to do certain things like beat the game without using any health potions, theres also a multiplayer which can make the game eaiser so playing with a friend who's good at the game could teach you a lot. Even if you beat the game 100% you could try to make your own goals or try to find bugs in the game since you can find some just by playing normally. In multiplayer sometimes you might enter an area and all the floor could be gone for one of you so that unlucky person would just fall forever and eventually teleport back up juts to go back down. There's also tons of different combinations of play styles! With several races, hats, perks and companions to chose from, you will always find some sort of style you will like! I would reccomend to almost anyone.			"

												I will definately reccomend this to others. This was a well-made, visually pleasing, challenging and fun game. Magicite is a rougue-like with elements such as a procedurally generated dungeon and perma-death. However, and even though it is not the most important part of the game, there is crafting included (cause who doesn't like crafting), and a huge variety of items to obtain. In addition to gameplay that simply makes me happy, there are also many perks like races, hats, and companions that are unlockable.For a fun game with cute graphics and challenging gameplay, this is DEFINATELY worth 10 bucks.

												This game is a lot of FUN! If you like like games like Terraria/Starbound with a rogue twist like Binding of Isaac/Spelunky then this is an amazing game for you. I love both rogue and indie crafting games and have put a couple long sessions in since I bought it.  The multiplayer can be a pain to play with friends but is the more fun experience.  I used the evolve client to connect with friends and it worked really well.  The rewards you get for progressing to certain levels and beating certain enemies is a concept I really enjoy and the levels are challenging but fun. I can only imagine the game getting better with more updates.			"

												I loved this game. It was charming, fun to play and, at times, very tense. But after ages with no updates, me and the friend I played with gave up on this. Finally, after some time, the devs post a update, adding in some new things. BUT with a game out that is basically Magicite plus Terraria (I'm sorry if I'm wrong on this, as I haven't played it, only looked at screenshots) called Roguelands, the devs, or should I say dev, quits development on a game that many people have enjoyed, and after one or two major updates (that I personally have seen), saying he needs to expand. If you want to try this, go ahead, but don't pay full price for it. Buy it somewhere cheap, or mooch off a friend who owns it. THIS GAME IS DEAD!			"

												A amazing title so far. While a little lacking in features currently, the developer seems commited to updating regularly and adding more content. My only complaint is the netcode for multiplayer does not seem to work the best, but I am hopeful this will be resolved. Other then that, there's no real complaints. The pixel art is great, the enemy AI makes fighting challenging, and it requires skill and a little bit of luck. All in all, this is a must have game.			"

												This game is so unbelievably fun that I invested 20 hours into it within the first week. However, there are bugs. My past 5-6 runs on multiplayer have ended because we couldn't leave the town. Luckily I've only ran into trouble with these game-breaking glitches once or twice in solo, so you shouldn't have to worry if you're not a fan of multiplayer. Overall it's magnificent, and worth you ten bucks!			"

												On paper, this game shouldn't work but it's managed to work itself together so flawlessly that I'm actually in awe of how good it actually is!Think of this game like a cross between minecraft, Terraria, and (of all things) Rogue Legacy. Don't let the first two games on that list fool you though, there's no underground. In fact you can't dig at all. You're just a PC running through a linear platformer trying desperately to pull together the materials to be able to push onward, all the while praying the RNG doesn't decide to ruin your flow.  Because while this game might be no small amount skill, luck plays an incredible role in deciding if you'll survive another level, so for casual players actually making it to the end might take some time... thankfully, despite a death being game over, this game manages to keep you going by giving you little rewards to help customize your playthrough, like races with different starting items and racial perks, hats that give you bonuses (the prerequisite to gain said hat in the hat selection menu,) and companions.. that aren't as useful as you'd think, but I still got a warm and fuzzy feeling when I got my regen fairy!  Beyond that, it's a very flow intensive game that can be fiendishly difficult to win if you get hit one too many times due to healing items being fairly scarce, but a well timed move or two can typically get you out of the way with enough skill.More on the RGN though, there are a finite amount of resources on a single level and sometimes you won't get what you need. Need gold? Sorry, no gold on this screen. Maybe you need bugs to craft spells... nope, no bugs. The game honestly seems fairly fickle at times, but three of the possible biomes are fairly easy, so it's no reason to sweat... unless of course the game decides to spawn 3 dungeon doors on you early on, THEN you should be worried. Furthermore, the stat system works nicely, the abilities seem quite solid for the various class choices you can build (although warrior does seem to lack some survivability), and the abilities you unlock are quite random, so you shouldn't have a playthrough that's too much like your other playthroughs as you're going on.Finally, there's the multiplayer system. Getting started in multiplayer is a LOT harder than in single player, but if you can actually get everything going the game's a LOT easier with a second person by your side. I haven't found a natural chat feature though, so skype calling might be necessary for this if you want to quickly, and effectively chat with your friends. Even if there is a chat system, the game's fairly fast paced so I don't really think you'd have much time to type before a monster decides to goomba stomp you... and yes, monsters CAN goomba stomp you. If they land on you, they pin you down and continually deal damage on you between invincibility periods.  So in short, it's a fun game by yourself but it's much more fun, yet also slightly more aggrivating in multiplayer. Thank goodness there isn't friendly fire, or multiplayer wouldn't be recommended... granted, my only experience with multiplayer was 2 player so yeah~, it might be a little bit different with all four slots filled up.All in all, this game is well worth the $10 I paid for it with.  I'd honestly recommend this game to all of my friends, and I feel kinda sad more of my steam friends haven't gotten this themselves...			"

												The game was fun overall. It's difficult in the beginning unless you decide to use a crafting guide to figure out which items combine to form what. I bought it for five bucks, and it was definitely worth that price due to the many hours of gameplay it provided. I definitely recommend it to others. "

Posted: June 24, 2014
												Where must I begin. I was honestly taken aback after playing this game for the first hour or so. Before I go into saying why I was taken aback I have to say this from first impression of watching my friends video on this game I was honestly not too impressed (then again he kinda sucked at the game when he played it). Now back to the subject at hand here, I say that I was taken aback because it well exceeded my expectations of being a pixelated 2-D side scroller. While yes I will give this game the benifit of the doubt and say that this was a pixelated game, but this was a really well done game and I think this game earns a good 9/10 if not a 10/10. My reason, well let's just say that this was a very colorful game, and no, not as colorful as Akihabara (that's a district in Tokyo for those who don't know) and to add on, the lighting for this game was absolutely incredible. You would expect like a pixelated light source on you character and the ground (because the ground does in fact illuminate which is awesome all in itself) but it is in fact a smooth lighting which in my opinion is absolutely glorious. Now let's move, for story, well let's just say that I haven't played the game enough to see the story develop but I am willing to bet that there is a story so for now I will leave this section unrated. For gameplay, I will admit it right now that I love games that make you want to replay it so many times and this game has done it. Though I have embarrased myself in dying so many times to the point where it's not funny, I was always finding myself coming back for more and more of this game and eventually, I actually starting getting good at this game. So in the end I would have to deffinetely give gameplay a 10/10. To wrap up, I have to sadly give this game a 9/10, now I know what you are thinking right now, ""but wait Boom Box, you have been ranting for the last 5 minutes about how good this game is and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"", I know but here's why I have given this game the score that I have given it. The reason why is that while yes the game seems perfect in every way there were glitches in the game but of course this game is a work in progress so I guess there is an exception there. But the real problem was this, the multiplayer. I understand that the developers of this game wanted other steam user to play with their friends and what not but really? You guys couldn't make an easier set up for those who don't like setting up the server. In my opinion I think that the developers should've created a system of setting up a server to play on that is so easy that even a zombie could do it. But at the end of the day all I can say is this, Magicite is a great game and I would highly suggest this to anyone who is interested in a real challange, but for those who are interested in a real challange with friends and aren't really good or don't know how to set up a server, I would want to excersise some caution with the multiplayer side of the game cause you are going to run into nothing but problems and wind up becoming very frustrated with the game and possible beat your dog or child, but please don't do that though. Again it's a good game and I do recomend this game to any who are interested in a good challange. Thanks, and enjoy you experience.			"

												A amazing title so far. While a little lacking in features currently, the developer seems commited to updating regularly and adding more content. My only complaint is the netcode for multiplayer does not seem to work the best, but I am hopeful this will be resolved. Other then that, there's no real complaints. The pixel art is great, the enemy AI makes fighting challenging, and it requires skill and a little bit of luck. All in all, this is a must have game.			"

												This game has a little bit of charm, but it cannot be played with a controller. The deaths are permanent, take that how you will. It strives to have replayability, but I find myself exiting after one or two runs. The game is a decent idea that in my opinion fell short of what it was trying to accomplish. The levels design seems to repeat over and over. I personally don't think that even it's sale price tag was worth it.			"

												Magicite.This is a funny game, its a mixture between Terraria and Castle Crashers (Mainly because of the game feel) You ought to have the game to understand what I meanI'll persuade you!This game is a fun game, you spawn him at the start screen only able to play as one character. But you can change its traits. Like start of with a pickaxe or just an axe. A variety of health traits aswell. You spawn in district one, and you progress through. You can chop down wood, fight enemies and mine rocks. Now, you can't build in this game, that was the biggest downfall seeing as I'm a major Terraria fan. It'd be great if you could build in it. It'd give the Terraria feel a big boost. All in all. It's not worth it at full price, but on sale. It's a bargain. Especially in its early stages.			"

												Risk of Rain meets Terraria. Feel like it's missing a bit of content, but the developer says he'll be updating regularly, so I guess it's all ok. Be warned, though, this game is not for those who tend to rage, as your health may vanish on you if you dont keep an eye on it.			"

												Unforgiving gameplay paired with methodical combat and game mechanics that need to be learned rather than understood. A paralel or three drawn to Dark Souls (or any of the Souls series for that matter) is very accurate. While most might be put off by that last comment, there's a serious amount of satisfaction to reaching the next area, without the feeling of self-flagellation lingering over the monumental sum of hours and days you'll spend trying to beat this game.Also, humanoid penguins dualwielding swords and rocking pirate hats. It's the little things.			"

												First of all, I'd like to guarantee that you have at least 10 hours of playtime in this game. That is why you should only go for it if it's at least 75% off. I am not going to discredit the developer, call him a thief, and stuff. But here is my adventure with this game went;We were promised a lot of stuff, but most of the promises were never fulfilled, after a while the developer announced that he started developing a new game, leaving this one buggy and unfinished, I see a lot of potential in this game but. I guess that's how the developers go in gaming industry. The developer just told us that he would 'come back' after he is done with his new game ''Roguelands''. He must be very fond of EA games.Good game, bad dev			"

												Magicite is pretty unforgiving but ultimately addictive.  I do better and better with each round (usually) and the unlockables hook me into running through it again.  Once you get the hang of crafting it gets a lot better so I'd recommend looking at a guild first so you don't get overwhelmed.The worst part of the game is it's annoying on dual screen monitors as the mouse will move to my other screen and minimze the game, when I go back in I am usually dead already when it gets centered on my hero again.

												Things to know before buying this game:This IS a fun gameThere is no save feature at the time of writing this reviewSome games last longer than others depending on skill level/what stats rollThere isn't really any support going into this game at the moment.  If you want to play a game from this developer that is supported that is extremely similar but with more weapons/skills/diversity, I recommend looking into a game called Roguelands.  As for this game, if it's on sale for half off or more definitally pick this up.  Otherwise spend your money on Roguelands instead.			"

												This is one of those games that I HATE, because it clearly has a good concept, but it's too flawed to really make use of it at all. At its heart, it's good, difficult, classic Castlvania-esque platforming action, complete with button-delay combat (which is a GOOD thing, I assure you) but it's just soooo poorly executed.Here's a couple examples:-Armor increases max health but not current health, and there's very few ways to restore health, so armor is mostly worthless.-Food can't be eaten unless you are slightly hungry, but cooked food is one of the best ways to restore health, so high-tier strategy involves ""hunger grinding"" to get those precious health points back.-The crafting system is convoluted and out of place. Combined with the hunger, it feels like a cash grab at emulating Minecraft.-New characters' stats cannot be chosen, only randomised, so starting a new char means clicking ""randomise"" until you get the stats you want.-Many things cannot be unlocked until you beat the game.-Lockmaster trait no longer does anything, but the creators never bothered taking it out, so your character may randomly have one trait instead of two if they get Lockmaster.I try to look past the problems and focus on the music and the pixel scenery and the core combat stuff, but all the bad things bog it down too much. It all just makes me want to remake the whole game from the ground up and make it work better.			"

												Here we are in 2016, and we still have games without tutorials.This game is a highly repetetive grind fest with a cumbersome, unintuitive UI (crafting, inventory, item use; all are as bad as it gets).Roguelikes have replay value and a fresh experience each playthrough; Magicite is nigh identical every time you play, without interesting random generation.Other things are a messTaking damage causes awkward things to happen: you recieve knockback and i-frames; while in i-frames you can still put out an attack animation, but it won't do any damage. Your attacks are very laggy, so getting hit while attacking means waiting for seconds before you can actually attack. Enemies also get i-frames, but they have contact damage during said i-frames. Enemies have attack animations, but always do contact damage even from behind. Enemies get knocked back by your character, but the knockback is ambiguous.Jumps and aerial movement don't have tight controls, and the character moves with the gusto of a cement mixer.			"

We've been doing this for around 20 years so why is it so damn hard to play any multiplayer games nowadays?Everytime my buddy and I buy indie games like this, we always know that we're gonna have to go through Hamachi or some other nonsense but in this case, since upgrading to Winodws 10, even that now is a problems.Look I have some really good advice for all developers out there and I am one also. If your going to release an online multiplayer game and sell a 4 pack, then at least make sure that you can play multiplayer with your friends.This game doesn't work online. I've opened port 7777 but to no avail. This game's online is broken. There are no servers on the server list.Dont buy this game.			"

												Magicite is decent game to play with friends.Bought it a long time ago and playd few runs today and somehow it seemed they had messed up rangers wolf ability quite a bit. Game requires quite a bit of skill and fast reflexes to play. It's a shame that most rare loot comes from the golden chests so when playing single player it's a very good choise to pick up lockpick trait.I like the chance to trait system, when you can now pick the traits you want and you don't have to spend ton of time rerolling for the desired result. I think they should same kind system for the stats, because basically if you want to play to ranger you get dex and hp, mag and hp for wizard and att and hp for warrior. Having a pool of 18 choises for stats is also too small to make it more 'random' when choosing stats for your character. Altought random is a good theme in roguelike games when it is not applied to everything.			"

												Magicite is an epic combination of terraria and spelunky.you start off as a peon and 2 randomly generated skills wich can be rerolled until you have the 2 you want. the game is really hard and takes a few tries before you finnally know how to handle the creatures and how to craft your items but once you know this the game will become really fun. and it will be even better with friends combining different skills and different play styles. throughout the game you will unlock different classes and hats each with their own (dis)advantage to make the game more interesting.

												This game is probably one of the most fun games I have ever touched.In general, you start out with 1 race, and a set of skills. You spawn in a forest where you have to get resources to survive and not die. Later on you unlock more races, hats, variants and things as such that give you stat boosts or special perks.The worlds themselves are breathtaking. Along with the music, the graphics are amazing, the sprites of the enemies are wonderful, and the feel of the area gets you really amped and happy to play the game.There is difficulty to this game, as not only are the enemies hard but there is also permadeath. Permadeath would pretty much be the only thing I don't like about the game, but thats more of an opinion, as permadeath in a game is not wrong its just some people like it and some don't. But having permadeath actually makes you want to play the game more and more to get further than where you were before.If I were to compare this game, I'd say it would be very close to something like terraria, but I don't usually like comparing games. Why? Because games like this are unique. This game is its own thing, nothing like I have ever played before. It showed me a whole new type of platformer and I am just so happy this game fell into my steam library.So, would I recommend this game? Certainly. Definitely worth the price!P.S. if you ever meet percyl in the forest he will destroy you			"

												Would not reccomend. I've played a lot of this. And I love this game, really. But I cannot reccomend it to anyone in good conscience, unless the game is on sale. The game itself is fun. But it's plagued with many bugs, some of which have ruined my experience many times. And the Developer ran off to work on Roguelands (Might actually buy that) before even finishing Magicite. So unless this game is on sale, I would not reccomend it. It's worth at most 5 bucks. Not 10.			"

												I tend to rate things on a Price-Enjoment scale. In terms of Magicite I have played a relatively enjoyable 30ish hours for the addmission price of $10. With a simple calculation that leaves the price 33 cents/hour, a more than far price for this game in my opinion.unfortunatly, this comes with a few disclaimers:1. The game is ment to be played A LOT and it is very brutal. Expect multiple runs meeting requirments only to lose a dice roll for your hard earned reward.2. Muliplayer isn't a garenteed thing. If the game doesn't have built in multiplayer it doesn't have multiplayer in my eyes. Magicite does have built in muliplayer but it is incredably buggy to the point where monsters are almost always in different places between users and resources flicker on and off. (occasionally one player will even continuously fall through the map untill a game restart). All this given I cannot say that Magicite is an out of the box multiplayer expirence worth anything.3. Combat. I would describe the combat as ranged or nothing, a sword will just kill you off because combat feels like two pufferfush attempting to joust and you just take to much damage to make it viable.4, Updates. Now I'm lazy so I'm just estimating here but I would say it's been more than half a year since any significant update to the game so I wouldn't get hopes up about a patch. (Will remove if updated XD -get on it man!)Conclusion:The game is a Rogue-Like. I love Rogue-Likes so Magicite has a lot going for it in my books. That said, and it pains me to say this.....I can't recomend Magicite. *GASP* it just feels incomplete.I love the concept, Don't like somewhere around 45% of the execution.if you have [ftl,boi,N-throne,Don't Starve] BUY THIS GAME, but otherwise steer clear untill your ready to accept all of it's burdens and glory.

												Magicite is a truly amazing roguelike game. I enjoyed every last bit of it.ProsPro 1 It's hard.Pro 2 A lot of content.Pro 3 Soundtrack is amazingPro 4 If you beat the game, you can try it in other ways.Pro 5 Worth it's price.ConsCon 1 Doesn't get updated as much anymore.Con 2 Multiplayer is very buggy. And hard/impossible to play multiplayer.Con 3 Controls are a bit finnicky, but gets better.Con 4 No ingame tutorials. You generally gotta figure out the stuff for yourself.Overall? 9.5/10. Very, very replayable.Pro 6..? And the rewards are so nice, but generally hard to get too- when you get them, it feels amazing.			"

												This is a good game in and of itself for single player which is fun and great and all. it\'s fun to play for those who like a slider style crafting game with many in-game unlockables like characters, companions, and hats (most of which have in game effects). However, since the developers have abandoned the game multiplayer doesn\'t really work. With my bf whoever hosts, their game works fine and they can play easily. but whoever isn\'t hosting ends up being glitched and stuck either in previous levels/towns unable to continue or move. they slowly catch up but still cannot move or continue. So unless the creators come back and overhall the game or redo their system so that it runs off of steam connection rather than a third party (such as hamachi, evolve or other which eats up ram and causes big latency problems described above) the multiplayer only lasts a few levels before you\'ll have major problems with your other players. thus making the multiplayer useless.Otherwise, Magicite is a fun single player game with many achievement based unlockables of varying difficulties. Naturally most would be easier with a second person to help (such as the no hp potion usage in game). I really like this game and wish the creators would at least come back to FIX the problems such as black screening and multiplayer set to steam connection. people have invested money into this game, which isn\'t really that expensive, and CONTINUE to do so because they like it and want other people to be able to play with them, but soon realize they cannot. its a VERY POSITIVE voted game, when really it should be lower due to the inability of using the multiplayer option that most people aren\'t aware of until after they\'ve purchased the game for themselves, and likely another person.fun game, would be great if it could be multiplayer.4/10 rating honestly because most of the game is fun with other people.. and someone who would APPEAR to take pride in their creation abandoning it is honestly disgusting to me, if you publish something like this, don\'t leave it up for people to waste their time on if you aren\'t going to continue to at least keep it running smoothly, you don\'t need to ADD more, just keep it running just as people keep paying for it. you\'re being paid =/			"

												Magicite is a cute little, fiendish roguelite action platformer with simplistic gameplay and graphics but addictive features that make you want to keep on playing. The game covers inventory, crafting and items very well as it does its platforming. The combat is decent and revolves heavily around timing and stats. It does not take long to get used to the game’s controls and its basic crafting techniques, but when you do it’s a little joy of a game. You could place Magicite under the easy to learn hard to master games but once you’ve got the hang of it and you’ve gotten better it is not that difficult. My least favourite thing about this game is that once you have a good run and gear and then you die you have to start from the beginning again. It kind of makes this easier to take because you can receive different races, hats and companions and cosmetics from achieving certain things in a run. Magicite is not endless and has several bosses, (none of which I have defeated yet) and an ending. All together I Think Magicite is a superb video game and would recommend it to anybody who enjoys roguelites that don’t require an obscene amount of time and can take their characters death. I think it is very underrated and should get more light.7/10Note to Developers: I would love to see steam achievements implemented please!			"

												Great concept, but I would not recommend because of networking issues.  A friend and I started out with no knowledge of the game and died instantly a dozen times in a row, but that's part of the learning.  It was satisfying to progress through and figure out the crafting, and eventually we got to level 11 with some diamondite armor before quitting.But the online play seems to always run into connectivity issues somewhere along the way.  One person would start dropping through the world and not be able to see any other characters, or they couldn't be revived, or items would de-sync and duplicate.  If two players pressed a portal at the same time, we would skip a zone every single time.  We had to agree on who would activate portals to avoid any issues.Since this game has NO saves and makes it very challenging to make any progress at all, the fact that the networking breaks constantly is a huge deal-breaker.  I don't consider it worth playing at all unless they decide to fix those issues.			"
