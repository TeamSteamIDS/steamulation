												I was torn on wether I wanted to put down a negative or positive recommendation. It's still kinda sad there's no neutral variant.The game has a solid foundation, and nails the atmosphere / Design a Warhammer Game like this should have. Also, to the Developers Credit, the game has gotten very far from the days back when it was just a Tutorial and some skirmishing (I bought it a long time ago in Early Access). The Warbands are varied, and developing characters and building your Warband is interesting. I wanted to get this stuff out of the way first, beefore I go into the bad traits.What holds Mordheim back massively in my opinion, and the main reason I cant reccomend it, is the sheer number of rough edges and weird design decisions, a lot of them taken not long before release. Let's start with the major ones:The Difficulty. A lot of people say the game is hard, unforgiving, challenging. In truth, it just has a steep learning curve, before turning into a failry easy game with some major random spikes in difficulty. Let's not mince words, the AI is stupid. Really, really stupid. This by itself would not be an issue, it's incredibly hard to design even a half decent AI for a system like this. The problem is the way the Dev's are trying to compensate for it. The game basically works with a handicap system. Enemy Ai Warbands will ALLWAYS be superior to yours. More hp, higher Stats etc. The Difficulty of a mission decides how high the difference in strength will be. So in Normal they are just a bit stronger, while in Deadly you are clearly fighting a superior foe, who will absolutely ruin your day in a fair fight.While this sounds unwinnable on paper, in practice, it's actually childishly easy to just set up fight at chokepoints, in buildings or just on Elevation, and then slowly drop the enemy one by one. As your Warband raises in Level, this becomes progressively easier, since your Guys actually become more and more decent at the specific thing you build them for. While the AI stays it's usual, dumb self. You will reach a point where everything but Brutal or Deadly seems like a waste of time. And even those are, as I said, just slightly harder as long as you play it safe.In short, the game will seem hard at first. Unfair even. But as soon as you get even a basic grasp of the mechanics, the AI and building your guys, it falls apart and becomes almost too easy.That is until you get hit by the RNG of course. There are quite a few mechanics implemented solely for the purpose of ruining your day, showering the AI with even more advantages, and reinforcing the ""Hardcore"" feeling the game likes so much.Firstly, there are ambushes. There is a chance (10% last I checked) on taking each mission, that you get an ambush Event. Basically the one doing the ambushing starts out with all his guys in a offensive Stance (Ambush for Melee, Overwatch for Ranged), while the one that got ambushed get's quite a few penalties (Less chance to hit, for example). As if that wasnt enough, the Deyploment is usualy set up in a way where the ambushers are set up very near or outright next to their enemies.It's completely possible, if your Warband is not built for high Initative, to get ambushed by a highspeed Skaven Warband and loose 1-3 guy before you even get to act ONCE.There is no strategy to this. There is no way for you to properly react to it when you get ambushed, beyond praying to Nuffle that you'll get lucky in that first turn. On the other hand, getting to ambush the AI basically means a free win, which feels cheap and unsatisfying.Then we have Demons. To give the game credit, they do not appear in early game and only on Brutal or above. But they add another, unnecessary, easily abused factor to the game. They are very strong. Having a ton of hp, a lot of attacks, and high damage. They usually home in on the first guy they see. So usually, it's actually fairly easy to wait for the AI to just run into them and then enjoy your free win. Ironically, they cannot climb. So just hiding up in a building and waiting until the victory screen pops up is a frequent thing. On the other hand, if you get unlucky in deyploment, running into one is almost certainly a death sentence. Don't get me wrong, you CAN kill them. But you will NOT be in shape for another fight, especially on Deadly.Next, we have the different Warbands, and how they're built. Chaos Warbands are nigh unplayable right now, due to random mutations. Imagine you buying a mutant. Imagine you get lucky and you get a blue bow early on. Great, I wanna build a ranged guy! Cool, he got clawed Feet on Level 1! Now he's faster! Then you hit Level 5. And his arm mutates. He can not use ranged weapons now. Oh you invested all his points into Ballistic Skill? Well too bad. Throw him out. Then you have melee guys who get a thousand eyes. Now they cant wear armor anymore! You built him for tanking? Well up yours and your silly tactics! Buy a new one!It's arbitary, there is no system to it, and it will frustrate you to the point where after the sixth time you had to throw out a high level guy, you're just not gonna play them anymore.Finally, and probably the ""least"" offensive, is the UI, loading screens, and bugs. Some of the information is hidden behind 3 different windows, and there is NO way to customize any of it. Everytime you wanna look up something, calculate your next move or just flat out inform yourself about the guys you're fighting, it involves annoying clicks, searching through 4 different menus until you finally find what you're looking for. Deployment does not allow you to jsut click on the spot on the map, you have to cycle trough each deployment point manually. Some maps have what feels like 50 deyploment points. Imagine how fun it is to cycle trough each with EACH of your guys. 10 man Warbands? The fun is here!There was also an announcer added with the release. The general announcer sounds like a random dude, let's call him Jeff, they pulled out of an office to announce EVERY BLODDY THING you do. Gotta collect 10 Wyrdstones? Don't worry, he will ""update"" you on it EVERYTIME you pick up one! The voice is not even cool, it's not a cool evil voice like you'd have in Dungeon Keeper, or War for the Overworld. It's just a boring, regular guy. You got the atmosphere down on the other stuff, why suddenly slack off here?Bugwise, it's a lot better than it was in earlier versions. But there are still random things that should not be acceptable in a full release. The ai will sometimes randomly engage and diesengage people it isn't supposed or get stuck (Usually on staircases). Some doorways and holes cant be entered from one side, but from the other side they can. The game feels like having rough edges, that should definetely have been fixed in EA before coming out proper.Now, if the above is looked at, changed, or adjusted, this game will get a big fat blue thumb from me RIGHT AWAY. The foundation is there, the game can and will be fun for you, if you can get past all that. But IF they fix it, it's gonna be even better. Fantastic even.			"

												NOTE: if you consider yourself as strictly casual player please read the last paragraphs and better pass on this one.This game should seriously be named City Of Slaanesh cause playing it feels like constantly cutting your wrists, or being kicked in the balls... but for some weird reason you quite enjoy that and want more.It's hard, it does not forgive mistakes but it actually feels really good when you acheve something.And don't look at all these posts complaining about the RNG (random number generator)... well, its random! Clue is in the name.There are few things that made me love Mordheim:+ Great warhammer feel, no knights in shining armours or single characters chopping hordes of your enemies in one strike. The world is grim, sad and constantly you lose something - your warriors became decapitated, weakend or start loosing their mind. Dark fantasy done right. + As for almost every warhammer game I've encountered so far audio is superb! Especially for skavens, but the narrator's voice - can't stand this guy. + Amazing customization, tons of skills and attributes to choose from, which gives lots of possibilities in developing warband members to your specific needs. + Mordheim as a battleground has been created perfectly. It certainly gives good WH feel and offers various tactical advantages/disadvantages, traps, random loot etc. Sadly that most of the time you cannot fully use it because AI will blindly rush you head on. +DLC's came out after a while and are not ripped away parts of an original game, or some overpowered aspects for multiplayer which seems to be rarity in these days, lol. It's just the additional content for players that like the game and want to have something extra - nothing fancy, nothing too bad. Although all i just said I can understand many people disliking the game, here are the reasons why:- AI is terrible, but on the other hand I understand that you cannot simply create challenging AI for a game like this (which highly depend on tactical gameplay) without giving it some advantages. Yet still it sometimes makes me flip the table when your opponent is simply rushing you straight forward, when there's whole crapload of wyrdstone winking at you... bloody irritating. - There's no save button, one huge mistake or series of bad luck can sometimes cost you the whole game (imagine spending 40+ hrs on a single warband). - It will cost you many warbands to actually learn how to properly play the came and counter your enemies, but when you do it becomes fairly easy, if RNG wont strike you in the face that is. All that said, there's one big issue I have with the game and that's your progress in the single player campaign. The thing is, if you consider yourself as a casual player you wont even probably make it through chapter one. Why? Mordheim is reaaaaaaaly time consuming, and without any way to somehow secure your progress an unfortunate stike of RNG can end your journey easly. If you want to play this game from time to time, to kill boredom and chill out please, please run away and never look back. I'm pretty damn stoic when it gets to videogames but this one... oh, it made me scream, belive me. In my opinion there should be an option for strictly casual players to have their ONLY single player restricted warband that you can save ... dunno... at least every at chapter you go through. Not having that simply takes away a lot of potential customers from the game, so why not allowing them to enjoy it and give the devs sum more $$?  Thanks for reading :)			"

												Hi all,I will present this review in different segments depending on if you are:1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)3) everyone else (EE)First the TL:DR version:1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)You have been waiting for this game since the first time you critted the Ogre mercenary. It's here. Go buy it. Oh wait, its not a straight conversion like BB? Hmmm. Well then have a look below to see if this adaptation is for you. Yes there are some bugs and yes the AI is not great, but this is meant to be played vs friends anyway right?2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)If you like levelling units, creating a unique warband in a medievalesque, semifantasy setting where death lurks around every corner, where every conseqence is final (no re-doing ANYTHING) in a turnbased environment that you can play vs the AI or vs a friend online, then this might be for you. If you do not like permadeath and rather be able to reload a battle until you get that perfect win: stay away. 3) everyone else (EE)Well actually see 2. You wouldnt be reading this if you were looking for a great footballmanager now would you? :)See below for a more detailed description. Use ctrl-f to quickly find your part. 1) If you are  a GW fanatic and familiar with the TT version. (GWF)I'm betting you have been waiting for a vid adaptation of TT for ages. Well here it is. So go get it. I'm thinking for you the most important question is: Is this Mordheim?The answer is both yes and no. (isnt that great ;) ). No because this is NOT a straight conversion (Like BB for instance). Some mechanics have been changed, see below. Yes because this is indeed the city of Mordheim and how you always wanted it to look. Yes, because in essence its about levelling units, gathering wyrdstone.Yes because its unforgiving, no turning back, no savescumming, no redo if you pick a wrong skill. This can be frustrating but never more so than in the original because there progression was basically random (yeah! +1 Initiative for my skaven assassin, woot woot! Not).So whats different, whats the same?Main similarities are:-turnbased mechanic-injuries and levelling-climbing-charging-critical hits-wyrdstone gathering/selling-most weapons of the TT are in-and some skills. -there is RNG ('dicerolls')-psychologyMain differences:-the turn-bases system is unit-, not warband based (so units alternate turns according to an initiative ladder instead of complete warbands ).-the skillset has been changed with many new skills, some familiar but many that are new.-there are a lot more stats which have a lot higher thresholds. -dodge is no longer a 'skill' (like sidestep) but together with parry, overwatch and ambush are selectable stances that finish a units turn (and activate when a unit is in range or attacks). -warband rosters have been changed around a little to make them more similar.-stuff like fear and terror behave differently from the TT etc. -There is an action pool for movement and reloading and such, another one for attacks and spells and such.-There are no wounds but each unit has a health bar, and thus units damage for health not wounds. -Deployment is not the same as in the TT as the nodes you can deploy in a are predefined. You might not like all the changes they've made to the game. For me, in the end, the similarities outweight the changes which I see as an attempt to recreate the game for a vritual medium. Again, if you like GW and like(d) the TT this is a must-have. Watch some lets-plays if you are unsure about the new ruleset. 2) If you are a general fantasy/tactics lover. (GFTL)Then you don't really care much about the comparison with the TT because you never played it. You know the GW universe perhaps but have never been into their miniature games. However, if you do like fantasy stuff then the setting of this game will appeal to you. There are ratmen, there are horribly mutated creatures, regular mercs, and some crazy nuns with hammers. Sounds good? Read on. This game is basically an X-com type game. Units take turns on a map, that represents a district in the city of Mordheim, a Medievalesque city that has been hit by a meteor so its somewhat in shambles. You and your band are there to gather fragments of this meteor (called wyrdstone). Since the meteor hit however the City of Mordheim has become somewhat unpleasant. So what are some features of this game? -procedural maps that retain their basic layout (street here, square there) but are different each time, (hey last time this building was still standing now its gone/missing the topfloor/completely ruined etc.) creating new routes, blockades etc. each time you play. -customizable units (appearance and playstyle).-many many skills. -units progress and become better or get hurt and die. -non-obligatory story missions -four warbands with distinct playing style. UPDATE: with the current DLC there are six warbands, the two new warbands will also appear as adversaries without the DLC. There are also four new heroes, two for each side: Order and Destruction. -MP play possible (but limited in its options, i.e. no matchmaking or rankings or whatever). -variety of weapons, spells and units to equip, level and master. -Difficulty: I think its important to note this from the get-go. This game is not easy, esp if you are a newcomer. RNG mechanics seem to favor the AI (as they always seem to do :) ), your captain can go Out of Action (OOA) during the match by failing three 80% parry chances and end up post-match losing his leg, being megalomaniac or worse, plain dead. As in terminaly, no turning back, no re-loading dead. And he just turned level 6. And now he's dead. Get the picture? If you are hoping for an easy game stay away, because you will ragequit so often you'll develop haemerroids. The next point ties in with this. -alt-f4 is punished. If you, for any reason abort the game, the engine will treat it as if you ran away from battle and all your units are considered to have gone OOA. This means they all get to roll for injuries. This could mean your warband is crippled and its startover time. Is there no save? Well offc there is. But you can't reload it to 're-do' something. If you mess up and charge a deamon with your level 1 youngblood and he's dead, he's dead, and he stays dead. No turning back. So let's say that you like all this? Anything else? Well yes. While the game might be difficult because of how it works, the AI is not very, you know, smart. In fact, given some practice, you will be able to defeat the AI on the hardest missions unless you are unlucky with your deployment. On higher difficulty missions the AI gets a health and damage boost and that goes a long way to increase the challenge. But if you are looking for a really hardcore challenge in tactical terms you need to play online because the AI will not deliver.Also, the story missions can be a bit of a chore sometimes, but hey, they are optional, so the game doesn't force these on you. But still, even with an AI thats not perfect (and let's face it, in which complicated game is the AI ever perfect? Total War, I'm looking at you, you money-receiving, morale boosted, stackbuilding, mapsitting incompentent!) this game is many hours of absolute fun. The maps are beautifully created with lots of attention to detail and winning matches can be exhilarating. Especially online where they are butt-clinching, sweat-drenching affairs.			"

Early Access Review
								For anyone looking for a faithful replication of the boardgame: keep waiting/look elsewhere. While the graphics are nice (they have done a good job of making it LOOK like Mordheim), the gameplay is tied to a clunky UI and control scheme that the developers are very attached to and they won't consider changing.The game is clearly built around a controller being the primary input device: in-game menus and the UI cannot be controlled via mouse cursor but instead use a right and left click for up/down/forward/back through UI elements. There are no mouseovers and feedback from the UI is very poor as a result.Each unit plays their turn in initiative order. All unit control is done from a 3rd person/over the shoulder perspective when it is that unit's ""turn"", using WASD/Controller to move the unit in realtime around the point at which they started, up to a certain distance depending on that unit's stats.There is a tactical overview map which can be brought up. Unfortunately, due to some fairly arbitrary reasoning: you cannot control any of your units from this tactical view like in other strategy games. I feel as a result the game suffers quite a lot. The developers have confirmed that this will not change.The choice of inital mercenary bands is disappointing. All empire mercs are now lumped into a single faction (no Reiklanders, Middenheimers or Marienburgers).I am very disappointed I bought this game, and would urge anyone considering a purchase to wait for a demo to be available to be able to give the game a try before fronting up any cash.Update:To be fair to the devs, since I wrote this review they have started a thread asking for ideas to improve the mouse and keyboard controls: http://steamcommunity.com/app/276810/discussions/3/606068060820913464/Unless some really dramatic changes come out of this however, I don't see my opinion changing.

Early Access Review
								Mordheim City of the Damned was originally a tabletop game by Games Workshop that combined tabletop strategy with RPG elements. For those who neither know mordheim nor tabletop games:It's a turnbased strategy game where you command a gang of heroes and henchmen exploring the ruins of a town destroyed by the forces of chaos searching for treasures. Since you aren't the only with that great idea you will meet other gangs there ... meeting in that case means you fight them. The gameplay can be compared with other turnbased strat games like X-Com but your warband (your gang) is a bit greater. Since there are no custom warbands yet I can't tell what exatcly sizes are possible. In the original boardgame most warbands have a maximum size of 15 and only skaven warbands (mutand rat people) can recruit up to 20 bandmembers.In this early acces state these RPG elements (like building your own warband, recruit new ""soldiers"", buy equipment, search the city for loot and treasures after battle, learn the fate of your wounded bandmembers or level up your bandmembers) aren't implemented yet. But you get an impression on how the gameplay is working and in my opinion it plays out well. Further there are some enhancements compared to the boardgame: for example vision and spotting system.While playing the boardgame you always know where your opponents troops are. Thats changed here and adds a great immersive feeling to the game ( threats could lure behind every corner in the narrow gaps of Mordheim) and of course it opens new possibilitys for ambush tactics.The controls and gameplay are very simple and even playable with a controllerpad if you want to play it on your TV from the sofa. Although most of the rather complex strategy elements of the boardgame aren't missing here. (Like several stat checks on moral, ini, etc.. Great for ppl. like me who are cursed with misfortune as soon as they grab a dice, all random events are calculated automatically. )So positioning and awareness of your strenghts and weaknesses are as important as they were in the original boardgame.Fight itself is also calculated based on stats. Hits have a chance to fail, victim has a chance to parry/dodge, damage varies and has a chance to crit and so on. But fights take longer as they do in the boardgame since combatants have more HP. In the boardgame fighters (espeacially henchmen) happen to be taken out of action extremly fast. Often a succesful hit + damagecheck is enough to take em out (most fighters haven't more then 1 HP). The ""more HP system"" of the PC version pleases me more. On the other hand, the crit system is a bit booring (as far as I saw it). Crits just do extra damage and once I stunned an opponent with a melee crit. Crits in the boardgame are more funny since crazy **** is about to happen after a crit :) I'm missing that a bit here.Graphics are quite good and events like climbing/jumping/fighting are shown like a little movie (like in X-Com)The atmosphere is great so far.Only con from my side so far:- only 4 Warbands ""races"" are planned so far ( Human Mercs, Skaven, Sisters of Sigmar and Cult of the Possessed ) missing are Witchhunters and Undead that are also available in the standart boardgame rules without any expansions.I could imagine that they will probably be added as DLCs but I hope they don't sell em for ripoff prices. With all the boardgame expansions the variety of different Warbands is nearly endless.I really think this game has a lot of potential and I really hope they implement all the things that made the boardgame great and don't screw it up. TLDR:No RPG Warband content yet. Combat gameplay only.Pro:- Great combat gameplay so far- Boardgame mechanics are represented well - Good atmosphere- Nice graphics- At some points better then the boardgame ( for example real ambushes since the opponent can't see your troops all the time... technical impossible with a boardgame ) Con:- Only 4 Warbands planned so far, original boardgame version had 6 (+ X with expansions)- Critical hit system was more exiting in the boardgame. As far as I saw it here it was more damage + chance to stun.So far great potential (it even made me write a review ... that happened never before). Curious to see the RPG elements coming that made the boardgame great and special.PS: Sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.			"

												If you're considering this game, do yourself a favor and get it.  This is what a Games Workshop adaptation done right looks like!With more than 70 hours of play time under my belt, I'm still just as captivated by the game.  The tactical combat is serious fun and easy to pick up but just keeps getting deeper as you learn and progress.  The persistant warband progression features a huge skill tree to customize your units and both permadeath and persistant injury to keep things tense.  The four factions (Human Mercenaries, Skaven, Chaos and Sisters of Battle) are nicely varied, asymetrical and can be sucessfully adapted to different tactics.  Battles are filled with meaningfull tactical decisions where positioning, timing, equipment and skill set all matter.  Each trip back into Mordheim still feels like an exciting, high stakes risk.   ---Original Early Access Review Below---Having just finished my first Early Access skirmish, the first thing I wanted to do was come here and report that it's exactly what I was hoping for.   The game systems remind me of my favorite things from Firaxis XCOM and Valkyria Chronicles, and it's easy to tell the developers care about the GW source material.  The first Early Access version only includes a small slice of the game, but it's already possible to play a fun skirmish, and there is a ton of potential here once persistance and progression are added. Three thumbs up (Three? Blame Tzeentch..) for a good looking, faithful, and most importantly, fun Mordheim adaption.			"

												This game is about carefully grinding up your warband and honing them into perfect killing machines over many, many hours then having all of your heroes get permanant wounds from a single fight because you missed 5 95% shots in a row and the enemy critted on every single swing they took.  They are then replaced by level 0 punks who are immediately targeted by the enemy and killed in two shots in every fight making it impossible to level them up again.  It is highly repetetive and slow.  The AI does not change it's strategy in any way, ever.  Whatever the goal of the mission they will rush you and try to inflict permentant wounds without any other goal or concern for its own troops because it's squads are randomly generated and not presistant.  Occasionally it is exciting, but it is the excitement of gambling, only good when you happen to beat the odds.There is a good game here, buried under bad decisions based on apeing the boardgame and making things as grindy as humanly possible and providing no 'endgame' to that grind besides killing your units so you can start over again at a significant disadvantage.  ""but the point is to fail and then start over!""  if so, it is poorly designed because starting over is a vastly painful waste of time.			"

												love the premise love the fact the game is unforgiving and hard, which based on lore it is supposed to be.however what is not acceptable is how ♥♥♥♥ing dumb it is that winning feels still feels like losing becuase you lost out on all the valuable stuff that was just lying next to your guys when the final blow was struck.i found a fairly nice crossbow, the guy carrying it got K.O'ed turn before victory. He was next to 4 of his own forces so youd think they might have picked it up when they left victorious.  but nah that♥♥♥♥♥♥ait worth the time.  neither is apparntly looting the area when the entire objective of your little possy turning up was to loot the area but nah, we killed some dudes lets go home without picking up any of the♥♥♥♥♥♥it is a point of bad game design when you have to rely on arbitary loot mechanics to make the game harder. there is no reason to leave items be it warpstone or crossbows ever given. nor can i think of any practical reason. it forces you to make dumb decisions like prolonging fights just to loot stuff: it just feels so detached and it compleatly ♥♥♥♥s with immersion. which is a shame becuase if not for thouse aspects the game would be extrodinarly fun and rewarding to play.  instead it just feels like it slaps you in the face if you win or lose.

												I know the feelings about this game are very mixed but as far as I am concerned it is perfect. The difficulty is the kind of unfair that requires you to think about every move you make, even one attempt to cut a corner and you're punished severely.I've played a fair bit now and from the negative reviews I've read alot of people seem to dislike the hardcore nature of the game. I can appreciate why but I don't think anyone was ever mislead about how difficult this game would be or the penalties your units face for going out of action in a mission. This is almost a roguelike RTS, the best thing about this game is that you use the environment as part of your strategy to out manouvre the far superior enemy, lock them down and beat them into nothing.At the start of this game everything is a struggle, in the middle of this game everything is a struggle, and the nature of this game is that you will eventually lose. At the beginning you will be strapped for resources and struggle to meet demands, but after a while you will be strong enough to use key warband members to cover small areas while your fastest guys rush to get what you need before diving back into the fight. You do slowly build up breathing room as you go on but its only ever really enough to cover the losses you suffer since the further you get in the more devastating each loss gets.To close I will tell you the story of one of my favourite troops, the troop that really got me attached to the game. This is the story of Stumpy. Stumpy wasn't always called Stumpy he used to be called Lushkin Var but that only lasted a few weeks. Stumpy was just a normal Verminkin with a simple goal, not die horribly anytime soon or suffer an injury that leads to a name change. Sadly this is Mordheim so that was always going to be based on a wing and a prayer. Stumpy served the warband well, he was fast and efficient and gathered much wardstone but one day he got carried way and over extended against the dreaded Possessed and was cornered by two Brethren and a Chaos Spawn. Stumpy was mangled before he could even fight back and although the battle was won by his side Stumpy lost an arm and from that point on he was Stumpy. Stumpy used to be a halberd user, all his stats and skills were based on this and at level 7 at the point of losing his arm this effectively made him not as good as he could be, (I know alot of people like to call a troop useless at this point but the truth is they are not useless, they are just not optimal which is not the same thing, and the fact that makes you give up on your troops is appalling its your fault they end up this way anyway). So the newly made Stumpy picked up a sword and bided his time till he recovered from his injuries.Once Stumpy got back on the battle field he was kicking♥♥♥♥♥and taking names, with 20% less body for the enemy to hit he suddenly had a massive advantage in terms of 20% more dodge. He'd take anyone on head to head with almost a suicidal recklessness, alas after months and months of being the back bone of my fighting force he eventually got cornered in an abandonned building by the dreaded Possessed heavy line up. Unable to beat them in a fair fight he tried to run out but the only exit to the building available to him was the attic, and to get to it a climb was required. With only one arm Stumpy was trapped, he could not escape and had only one choice, fight for his life. Stumpy did the only thing he could and stood at the top of the stairs forcing the enemy to engage him one at a time.Stumpy fought hard and took out two of the dreaded possessed before the unthinkable happened, a Dark Soul jumped into the room through the attic Stumpy had hoped to escape from with an enemy on both sides and not chance to disengage of room to flee just to buy time Stumpy failed his All Alone Test on the next turn. He failed it soo badly he tried to flee and the first free attack from the Dark Soul stunned him,  he was a sitting duck and because of this he was taken out.As the rest of my warband mopped the enemies up and broke through the ones stopping them from helping Stumpy the battled ended with us winning, but sadly Stumpy suffered the dreaded permanent death. He was gone forever, I was devastated, like I had to make a cup of tea and watch TV for a bit. It was awful but life is cheap, and I got over it before my tea got cold and moved my focus to my Black Skaven duo, the gruesome twosome - Belle and Sebastion. But thats another story. In summary this game is hard, this game is frustrating, this game needs patience and this game is not to be played for hours and hours every day. This game is slow and best played as a mission a night, after work and before bed its a great unwinder after a long day of a 2 hour commute and a 10 hour shift. The atmosphere of the environment and its aesthetic are sublime. It does have long wait times but so what, start loading and go make a cup of tea, or pair your socks or some other thing that takes a few minutes that you always put off. Its worth it.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THIS EDIT WAS ADDED 6th February 2016Since the latest patch and the introduction of two new hired swords in DLC the game has improved significantly over some of its initial flaws held against it in alot of other reviews, the most major improvement of which is the loading times have been drastically reduced. I am not impressed with this however as I no longer have enough time to make a cup of tea while its loading.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a lazy, lazy man. I tend not to write reviews. I tend not to take out the rubbish (trash) and I often find myself tutting at the sound of my girlfriend cleaning up around me. I tell you this to put my recommendation into perspective. It would be spiteful of me not to recommend this game. This is one of my favourite games. I watched it, I waited for it, and, finally, I bought it. I regret not a coin. This game is not even finished, and it's already awesome. I hope and pray that I don't tempt fate (or encourage the devs to get lazy) but I have very high hopes for the final release, and I'm even looking forward to the inevitable DLC (a concept I loathe to the core). As for what it is, it's a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. The customization is what makes it. I love games like Xcom, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem but I have always wanted a game where the team really felt like my own. This is the closest yet. Let me demonstrate how. I use a player on my near perfect team who is missing an eye and a leg, sometimes gets confused and fails to acts, and is so battered that he can only move half as far as his teammates. Why do I hamper myself with Glen Hobble? Because he has been with me since day one. He picked up his injuries in the line of duty and he lost a leg saving his captain. I care more about Glen Hobble than my own good-for-nothing son. Buy this game. Help the community to make it even better. Do it for me. Do it for Glen.			"

												When reading reviews for this game pay attention to the hours played. The people complaing about the AI being too hard or the RNG throwing off the game are mostly all still playing with low level characters. When you first start out, your soldiers are lvl 0. Of course they will miss alot and get their♥♥♥♥♥kicked. If you keep them in groups they will support eachother and you'll level up pretty quick. I have a lvl 6 soldier who can kill enemies in one or two turns at the most... just a few levels prior he was getting his butt kicked almost every battle. About the game itself... if you like turn based games like X Com, or you D&D, or X Wing Miniatures... and want a fantasy theme... this game is great. I enjoy it a lot. The graphics are cool... the environments have a nice mood and feel. The battles are very strategic and challenging. The game doesn't allow do overs so you have to play with caution if you want to keep your soldiers around for many more battles. I'm having a blast playing it and think its worth the money. Glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of gams.			"

												I recommend this game but ONLY if you can live with:-> Ironman Mode(Hardcore + no voluntary saves)-> RNG Infestation-> Moderate+ difficulty(it starts very high and drops from there)It has:-> Beautiful artwork(not to be confused with graphics which are just passable)-> Fun gameplay(if you are into xcom type games{I'm not})-> Nice character building-> One of the best IPs around(Warhammer Fantasy)-> Awesome devs(things they do put AAA devs to shame)Unfortunately, I can't play this because it causes nervous breakdown(plus I'm not into this kind of game and care only about WHFB part of it), but that doesn't mean I'll be unfair and not recommend it. Because, after all, this game truly is a gem in the rough.Good hunting in Mordheim! Have fun!			"

								The game feels like your playing the table top.The mechanics are nice even at this stage and the maps are large and interesting, and they are very detailed with you being able to hide characters inside houses and even jump from Z level to Z level.Right now you can only play preset war bands but in the coming weeks you are going to be able to design your own and have a persistent warband you fight with through multiplayer and single player. It is well worth the buy but if you are undecided i would wait until the warband management section of the game is released, in my opinion this is where the most fun is going to be keeping your guys alive.

												This is a tough one. I've given it a fair crack and there's a lot I like about the game, but in the end I've decided that the negatives outweigh the positives.It has the worst case of RNG♥♥♥♥♥hattery I've yet encountered. It makes bloodbowl look even handed and fair.Routinely expect to rack up failure after failure at apparently simple tasks. (Writing this, I have just failed 13 sequential attempts to climb a wall that apparently had a 67% chance of success). It's also common place for you to miss a swing at an almost dead opponent who promptly turns around and kills your hero, while tzeentch strikes down your spellcasters at random. There's not enough men in a warband to compensate for these failures, so each battle quickly becomes incredibly frustrating and a few bad luck failures in a row cost you the battle and theres nothing you can do about it.Crappy map work with lots of inexplicable cant-go-there spots.Bugs. Many and various bugs. Ranging from graphical glitches and some twitchy camera work to it being completely random whether or not your guy in ambush stance actually attacks people moving into his range. Also I'm damned if I can figure out what conditions you have to satisy to make ""charge"" an option. Sometimes its' there, sometimes its not.Gameplay is slow and drawn out. I've played for about 15 hours or so and only completed 1 story mission. Exciting it is not.Battles have optional objectives which are intended to shake things up, however the moment you come into contact with the enemy you quickly become tied into a series of small fights and the optional objectives are forgotten. Since the enemy will rout and the battle ends as soon as more than 2-3 guys go down you never get a chance to go back to them.The RPG elements dont appear to have much affect on the gameplay. None of the skills you can learn are really significant, most add a couple of % to a few RNG tests which, as previously stated, are utter bolloks anyway. Certainly they're massively outweighed by the effects of injuries.Obscenely long loading times. I mean it. Go get a drink and do something else while the levels load.			"

												Despite thoroughly enjoying Mordheim, I'm finding myself cautious about recommending it. The reason for this is simple - Mordheim is not a game that will appeal to everyone. It is not casual, it is not forgiving, and it is not polished to the standards of a AAA game. That being said, what you do get is a very solid turn-based strategy with RPG character development. Its gameplay is well thought through, and once you get into it, it is very hard to stop playing. The four starting races are reasonably well balanced, and differ enough to give each a unique feel (I struggle with the Skaven, but their play style doesn't really suit me).At the core of the love/hate reactions is the fact that Mordheim is a sadistic mistress. It is mercilessly difficult, especially at first, but even once you get familiar with it then a single moment of carelessness, cockiness or overconfidence will end horribly. Maastering the game relies on absolute concentration, and contingencies for every possibility. If you don't master the steep learning curve, you will die. If you're too cautious, you'll run out of money and die. If you're too greedy, you'll die. If you don't prepare in advance for the deaths of your best heroes, you will die. You get the idea. The game autosaves after every action - no do-overs or loading after a disaster. Your fallen warriors will suffer persistant injuries or perma-death, and a single mis-step can mean the end for even the most veteran of warriors. Some complain about that the RNG is stacked against them, but I've generally found it fair - if you're leaving your plan in the hands of luck then it's not a very good plan!If any of the above put you off, then Mordheim is probably not the game for you. If you're still reading then you can probably buy with confidence. The game is pretty well made for the ambitious scope and small developer, though a few minor niggles leave it feeling a little rough around the edges. Customisation options are a little limited, so you'll probably be stuck with some very similar looking troops in larger warbands, but at least equipment shows up on the character. The AI pathfinding is sometimes a little wonky, but you'll be glad for every time the computer gets their Rat Ogre stuck in a doorway. Occasionally a piece of terrain will unexpectedly be a little bigger than it appears and block a shot or charge, but you're given considerable freedom to undo and redo your movement until you're happy with it. Very small complaints in the grand scheme of things.So, a qualified recommendation for a game I personally greatly enjoyed. If you like turn-based strategy and aren't put off by a challenge (or by your favourite hero getting wiped out by a tiny miscalculation) then you'll likely find Mordheim a fun and rewarding experience. If not, well, probably best to give it a miss.			"

 I'm having fun* playing this game, so I'm going to reccomend it HOWEVER! this is possibly the most unintuitive game ever so I'm going to include a small guide on how to have fun* playing it.*DISCLAIMER: fun is a completely subjective experience. The author cannot ensure that you will have fun. In fact equal parts stress and fun are to be expected. If you do not have fun playing this game try going for a bike ride or playing skippy-rope.Firstly, a concept that might be familliar to some: Winning isn't always good! If you've played Darkest Dungeon, you'll already know this, but if you haven't bare this in mind. In this game there is winning and there is  winning . There is ""killing the enemy team with minimal casualties, collecting plenty of precious green-crack (wyrdstone) and completing all of the objectives"" winning. And then there is ""half of my warband that I spent thousands of gold on died but it's ok because the narrator told me I did good in the loading screen"" winning. Now people might tell you it's the hideous AI that cause the difference, but I've found that every time the latter has happened to me it's because I was too greedy. Too greedy for that sweet green crack.That leads to the second tip on how to have funᵗᵐ Don't be too greedy! Actually I should rephrase this. Don't get upset if all your dudes die when you're greedy! Being greedy is pretty fun in this game, so I'm not gonna tell you to refrain yourself from scrounging up enough green crack as possile. But be warned - this is the primarily way your warband will die. You will have just won a mission pretty convincingly. You'll be assursed of your skill as a masterful tactician and may even be convinced that Sun Tzu himself would have been proud of your most gracious dispray. You'll start deploying for the next mission:""yeeeeah, I'm sure I can be spread that thin"" you'll tell yourself, ""I'll just make a rush for the wyrdstone then regroup my dudes!!"" And then two turns later all your heroes will be surrounded whilst your fat little henchmen try and scramble to help them, plodding slowly accross the map before deciding ♥♥♥♥ it, it's not worth it, and surrendering half way. This how is my wizard became a blind psychopath who can barely use magic anymore. I still keep him around, though I'm not quite sure why. Now for some guidance on the more unintuitive points: The loot system is a little bit ♥♥♥♥ed Okay, so apparently a mercenary is unable to throw 5 gold pennies on the floor in order to pick up a piece of ripe green crack rock worth around 100 gold. The loot system in this game can be pretty frustrating, but once you get used to it, it definitely adds to the flavour. You cannot swap items unless there is space in what you are looting, which means you can't pick up any green crack if you're inventory is full. This is something that annoyed me at the start of the game as you just want to pick up all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you can and then not being able to swap items for far more valuable wyrdstone is frustrating. But later on you realise it adds more to the game. You have to be careful with what you loot and decide early on who you're pack ♥♥♥♥♥es will be so you can have them sup from the pap of strength.This also applies to extra mission objectives. If you win a mission by killing someone - guess what? You can't loot their corpse! This doesn't really make a lot of sense and it makes extra objectives a lot more difficult, but rightly so really - they give you pretty hefty rewards. If you have a bounty mission you want*(*optional being the key word here) to complete you have to try not to win too fast so you can kill and collect the bounties before the games over. your dudes are pretty fat, be careful where you put them! Ocassionally you will accidentally place your buddy a little bit too centred in a tight pass. Ocasionally this will block 4/5 of your buddies/guys from getting where they need to go. Ocasionally this will cost you a mission as half your warband sit there waiting for your buddy to get his fat♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the way. You may also end up getting your favourite hero trapped in a corner and brutally murdered by an enemy hero because you thought a hard difficulty mission wouldn't be that bad and you assumed there was space to flee.That brings us to the next point: Only do normal missions!..  ...at firstStarting out with a warband be very wary about doing missions other than normal ones. Your first warband is like a newborn babe. It is very fragile and very precious to you. Attempting a Hard or Brutal mission is like trying to feed your newborn baby a rare steak when it's only just started teething. Only start with harder level missions once you have some levels under your belt and/or you start to understand how the AI works. When you have a more developed warband they can be more fun, but don't be surprised if something goes wrong and you're favourite hero dies.  RNG in this game is RNG ""REAL ♥♥♥♥ING OBVIOUS MAN""Not so much. There is RNG and there is  RNG . You won't find any PDR handholding here like in dota 2 or wow or most other mainstream titles for that matter. Some people seem to claim that the RNG in this game is fasle and the actual percentages for completing actions is lower than what's listed but this seems like BS and I can't see any reason for the devs to do this.From my perspective the RNG in this game seems exactly that - random. You'll have moments where your dude will miss 2 attacks in a row that had a 86% chance to hit, but you'll also have moments when all 3 of your marksmen will manage 40% chance shots into combat in a row and save your hero from getting his face mushed into putty. Also, failing acrobatics tests are both frustrating and hilarious. Yes, my leader did just spent half his turn trying to scramble up a small ledge, losing half his hp and then giving up, yours was busy collecting green crack? Well done.  Pick up this game if: you like other masochistic titles like Dark Souls or Darkest Dungeonyou like watching men in tights trying to scramble up wallsyou like watching people kill themselves by trying to be wizardsyou like watching mutants slap people in the headyou are catholic/ like nunsyou fantasize about colonies of rat people living in the sewers under your city/ townFor the best dramatic effect I suggest you start the game with Reikland Mercenaries, take mostly marksmen for your henchmen, and give everyone a gun and an American WW2 name.

												- Update - Since the game has now been released and the game developers have reminded me of the title, I figured i'd update this review for anyone reading it in the future. I have to say that the game devs have impressed me with their attention to the community, despite some of the issues remaining (see below for original early access review) it has improved a lot. I'd still say that if you're only looking at the game because of the title, you will likely be disappointed. The style of game is not the same as the tabletop original. It plays better than it did in early access, a lot of it has been fleshed out now. And the XP/progression and customization has been added rather well. I haven't played all that much since release but it seems that warband progression increases the overall difficulty of every single battle available, so that progression seems to be offset by how much the fights increase. Rather than giving easier options for lower rewards, everything just gets harder based solely on your warband score. So you can min/max it, or just keep disbanding experienced troops to lower that score and farm. Which goes against the purpose a bit if they were aiming to avoid people grinding against easier opponents. It just removes a choice of play. Again, this is based mostly on the community posts I've read and the limited time i've put into the game since release. I'm still wary that this game will be yet another DLC heavy game, and being one of those who find that to be very anti consumer it's another black mark. The existing 4 warbands seem fairly fleshed out, not exactly balanced yet nor true to the source but each seems fun to play. Tl;Dr - I would still have not purchased this back in early access if I could go back, but if it was on a sale I'd give it a look. Maybe watch the progress for a while if you're unsure, I doubt it's finished yet despite being released.-Original Review-Stay away from it for now. After pre-order it MIGHT be worthwhile, who knows..Firstly this is coming from a fan of Mordheim, the tabletop game. A lot of my issues with the game are solely down to how much they've deviated from it, as the only reason I even looked at this game is because of the name.Does it play well on PC? Barely. It feels like a console port.There's currently no XP/progression/customization. This WILL be in the released version, but how well they manage it is in question..4 initial warbands promised, this screams a warning of a DLC heavy game. As well as minimal customization. But are those warbands accurate to the tabletop warbands? So far, not at all. The game's being balanced around equal sized warbands, and as they've included skaven as one of the first released this becomes an issue. Skaven were always meant to be weaker in equal numbers, but they had a significant number and mobility advantage. That's gone. The humans have been merged into one, and been stripped of any actual character. They're just generic humans now.1-2 Knockdown, 3-4 Stunned, 5-6 Out of Action? Nope. Hitpoints, when that gets to 0 it's more than likely out of action.Armour saves to shrug off all damage? Nope. Very small damage reduction.The only positives I can think of are that finally someone's making a mordheim game, even if it is just in name and theme rather than content.. The graphics are pretty damned good so far, but not that great compared to other games that are currently out. The third person perspective's an interesting concept, but so far it's just been a bit of a poor gimmick rather than something that actually benefits the game.I really hope they take a few steps back and recreate the game in a closer manner to the blood bowl PC game. They're clearly going after the fanbase of the tabletop game, and this game really doesn't feel anywhere near to the tabletop version. Hopefully this doesn't end up another game that I regret pre ordering, my inner fanboy (mordheim was my favourite games workshop game) and hype swayed my hand and now I'm looking at it a bit clearer I shouldn't of risked it.

												To start with, lets establish something: Im a Mordheim nut. Before there was any information about this game really beyond ""it sort of exists, a bit..."" I pre-ordered it. And i've never stopped regreting the decision.And it was a mess. The maps were badly designed, the navmeshes were buggy as hell so targeting was a total crapshoot and the stat system was hilariously complex and arcane. But that's early access for you.Unfortunately, its not much better in full release.To start with, if you're expecting a faithful recreation of the tabletop game a la Blood Bowl - forget it. This is not that. It sort of limply gestures in Mordheim's direction, but its an affectation at best.The core of the game revolves around fairly repetitive missions in which your little band of warriors will be scattered around some ruins. These ruins are populated by defined points at which you can climb and descend, knee high walls WILL irrevocably impede your process and no, you cannot climb out of a ground floor window or push open a ruined door.So far so forgivable.The issue is that the AI is stupid, but the game is enough of a general crapshoot that it hardly matters. So much is dependent on a random number generator whose margins of favour are so razor thin that the game devolves into a series of coin flips. The only reliably strategy is that if you flip more coins than your enemy, more of them will probably come up heads (no guarentees though!) and you'll win.And that's about it for depth.You'll also struggle to get more than a couple of missions into it. Its not brutal in the sense that say, Dark Souls is brutal. Mordheim doesn't teach you lessons, or punish your failure to precisely execute manuevers by setting you back to your previous position and saying ""try again, this time don't suck.""No no. It sets you back to your previous position, ties one of your arms behind your back and tells you to try again.There's no learning curve, really. There's no opportunity to take a mistake learn from it because that mistake will haunt you forever. Every screw up, every misclick, every bad dice roll will be added around your neck like a millstone, and you will never get to remove them. In a purely multiplayer environment this might be a part of the fun. Everyone would acquire these albatrosses and the players with fewer of them would have an edge.But the AI doesn't suffer these problems.You will spend your first ten hours of the game being beaten into a bloody smear, winning by hair's bredths and losing by massive margins. When you do lose, and you will, it will set off a landslide of consequences you will never fully recover from.If I could refund this, I would. If playable demos were still a thing in gaming, this product would never sell another copy.Its bad. Its not fun. The only reason to peservere with it is spite, but you'll lose more of your life than the sale price is worth. Save yourself the hassle and just play something else.			"

												As you can see by the many hours I've put into this game, I find it to be the most fun game I've ever played, at least on PC. And I'm a quite a very active player.As many others beofre me have stated, this game is very punishing and you need to embrace that, or it's not for you. The RNG isn't flawed at all, it's just that because the game can be so punishing, having some bad rolls can make you quite frustrated and think the RNG is broken. That's because most people don't understand statistics. They think two missed 90% rolls is a conspiracy in a gamewhere hundreds of rolls are made per mission. If you have 10 warriors each hitting twice per turn at 90%, there should statistically be two misses. But when it happens, people think RNG is broken.The game has some DLC but they are not needed to enjoy the game, and the AI will play all DLC races against you even if you did not buy them. There is a lot of grind to be done in this game, adnd I am not even close to be done with all the hours I've put in, but noen of the grind is necessary at all. It's just a nice added incentive to keep going while you develop your warband.TI haven't even done all the story misisons, but they're pretty fun. Some can be very hard though. For me, multiplayer is where the real fun is. I am an admin of the currently only active MP league, called the Mordheim MP Permaleague. We have a great system for doing fair matches and anyone can join with a new team and play on equal terms against others. What's fun with MP games is that there are tow modes. Exhibition games without permanent effects afterwards, or Contest games with permanent effects. The league I play in do Contest games. So any loot you grab off your opponent you get to keep and they lose it, any injuries you suffer are there to stay, and so on. It's great fun if you can accept that you WILL suffer losses. But league players also get AI games that they can use to recover in when needed.Unfortunately this game lacks a server based matchmaking system, and that is its biggest flaw.Pros:- Best Games Workshop game adaption to date with its awesome fantasy and lore.- Awesome an helpful community.- Devs stays in close touch with the players and do balancing changes based on community feedback and they have a great sense of humor and a genuine interest in the game.- Many different warbands that all have a very unique playstyle and spellcasters (if you own all DLCS, base game has 4 warbands which still is enough for many many hours).- Very long replayability because there are countless of diffferent viable skill builds to make and toy with for each class and race.- Lots of skills to choose from, where most of them are quite useful.- Procedually generated maps and many different deployment types.- A lot of different runes to discover and enhance your gear with.- Generally a good economy system where you'll find yourself in short of money for a very long time unless you're quite skilled and know what you're doing.- The become a ""pro"" player you will probably need hundreds of hours and understand how to work the RNG in your favor, which is a good thing!Cons:- Punishing and unforgiving, can cause serious ragequits.- Poor AI pathing, especially with Impressives often getting stuck. An issue that's still not been resolved after a year.- Some very annoying bugs connected to ambushes, stairs and obstacles on the ground, that can cause desyncs in MP games.- No MP matchmaking system. If you want to play MP you need to find friends, ask in the forums, or join a league.- Some skills are pretty useless, but they're thankfully not that many and with a lot to choose from it will not impact overall gameplay.- Devs go very silent between DLCs/patches, and become very active and communicative weeks before such a release. Could be more consistently visible on the forums.- Lack of customisation options for your warband. There are some, but generally fairly limited. Doesn't bother me much, but for many it does. "

												This could quite possibly be my favorite game ever. It is in no way perfect, but man oh man did they capture the thrills AND frustrations of the table-top game, which I adore. The visuals are perfectly suited to Mordheim and look like they've been torn right from the rulebook and town cryers. The character design and development system is terrific. I love the fact that you have no idea who you're going into battle with beforehand, and I love how the game is played through the eyes of the characters.Yes, it can be very aggravating when attacks are dodged multiple times in a row, even though your character has a 95% chance to hit. Yes, it's maddening to have a warband route just before you accomplish a secondary objective. Yes, it's insanely frustrating when a character with over a 70% chance just can't climb a wall. Yes, it's brutal when you have a few bad games and you have to disband and start again. But all these ""problems"" are absolutely how the table-top game plays out, too! Welcome to Mordheim! To all who worked so hard to make this game, THANK YOU! I can only hope there will be some future DLC with more warbands joining the mix!			"

												Oh RNG, let me count the ways i hate you...Yes, it's one of THOSE games..Warhammer setting is really cool.Permadeath squad management is super-duper cool.RNG sabotaging a 20 hour playthrough, with nothing you can do about it... Not so cool.thei nherent problem with this game is that you start with fresh little recruits that can barely stand up to a mild breeze, and it is mostly luck or overwhelming odds that allow them to live to be these elite mercenaries hope want.But not even the most elite is safe from the RNg saying ""no, youve had too much fun"" and instagib's all your best guys in a row, no matter the odds.If you can stomach the Xcom level of RNG shenanigans, by all means, it's a great game.

Early Access Review
								Turnbased Warhammer Fantasy Squad game. With Skaven (don't we all love them?) Considering it's only early access you should not get too depressed at the lack of options at this moment. The game flows quite nicely with the two currently available factions (Skaven, Empire) - And at that I did actually enjoy myself despite the lack of variant gameplay options. Right now it's only 1on1 Skirmish (quick-battle) for us to play. Altho, as I've only faced the computer I noticed the AI is quite simplistic, and also it's abit too easy for units locked in melee to disengage, thus completely stopping a melee character to root an archer for example from shooting him in the face after disengaging melee,Also, the options to make use of the last actionpoints after attacking are very lacking - After you attack, either parry or dodge action is allowed for the typical melee character. Thus there is no real punishment for an attacker. After you swing, you'r always allowed to boost your parry/dodge stats. - Why not simply make it automatic - since no one would simply click end turn and thus wasting the free boost. There are several weak points in combat so far - no terrain advantage/disadvantage in combat. An archer on the ground is able to snipe at high percentage possibility vs a small rat hiding 1 meter inside a building. Go sixth sense! - But do not ever forget, it's still early access and these things are subject to change. If you buy and test this game at early access, it will be your obligation to report issues and give positive feedback to the developers, if not for them - do it to make sure your investment makes a quality purchase instead of a ""chance-risk"" of a money exchange for entertainment. It's totally up to you if you wish to dedicate yourself into an unfinished product.  "

												This game has a lot going for it.  It's a great turn-based strategy game with individual levelling for all characters.  There is a great feeling of satisfaction that goes into levelling up a party.  To that extent, it's a lot of fun, but it has some pretty serious issues.This is a ""hardcore"" style game.  If a character gets hurt, he stays hurt.  If a character dies, he's gone forever.  this is an interesting dynamic which I typically do not like, but it's okay if it's done well.  In this game, it is done well.  Most of the time.  however, towards the end game, it turns into a game breaker, and I'll explain why.The story missions are challenging, to say the least.  No, I'll go one step beyond that.  They are hard.  First of all, they put my warband into a tactically stupid situation that I would never put myself into.  Both of my archers were paired with my mage, and two of them were dead before they even had a turn on my first play-through.  On my second playthrough, after losing one of my archers to perma-death and firing the other because he was pretty much worthless after suffering a brain injury, I used only melee characters with much better success.  That doesn't change the fact that my warband was pretty much decimated due to a flaw in the game.  Oh well.  Another 20-30 hours of play time to get my warband powerful enough to take on the mission again.On my second playthrough, I was plugging along just fine.  The basic premise behind that mission is that there is an invicincible opponent that goes around destroying all of your characters without batting an eye while the player struggles to figure out how to inflict damage on her.  When I finally figured out that you need to disable the pillars, it took three turns to arrive at the first pillar while this enemy is mercilessly killing my warband.  When I finally arrive, I think ""finally.  I might be able to inflict some damage!""  But no.  I need some shard or something, and who knows where the heck that is.  Suddenly, it sinks in.  Even with the shard, it will take 5-6 turns to disable all of the pillars.  And that's not including the amount of time it will take to find the shard.  So, yeah.  My warband was completely decimated a second time, and I'm not willing to put 20-30 hours of play time into this game again just to get my warband powerful enough to take on the mission again.Simply put, when I purchased this game, I was looking for two things.  I wanted a turn-based strategy game.  Check.  Secondly, I wanted a game where I had the ability to level up individual characters in my war party.  Check.  What I did not want is a puzzle game where if you get it wrong the first time, you realize you've wasted 20-30 hours of your life.  If I wanted to solve puzzles, I'd go play Portal.  There is a reason why I don't play Portal.  It's because I hate puzzle games.  What's worse than a puzzle game?  A puzzle game where failure is pretty much permanent.If that type of frustration is what you are looking for in a game, then by all means:  Purchase Mordheim.  As it sits, this game took over 100 hours of my time, and I want that time back.   "

Early Access Review
								PRE-RELEASE REVIEWI have been playing Mordheim: City of the Damned (M:CotD) for about eight weeks.The Early Access copy was not supplied by anything other than my own cash.THE UPS:-A multi-dimensional challenge with many different builds, challenges, and tactics.-A really nice aesthetic representation of Mordheim post-comet.-Rewards intelligence, tactics, foresight, planning and force multiplication while retaining a random factor.-No two games ever work out the same.-A devoted community already developing.THE MEHS-The RNG *WILL* bend you over at some point. Not because it's unfair, but more because you're planning opposed rolls based on YOUR probabilities. A fictitious example: Your captain attacks and the system tells you that you have a 90% to-hit. What it doesn't tell you is that with enemy abilities, skills etc., you actually only have a 30% chance to hit. If you knew it was 30% overall, you might choose to disengage and/or switch to ranged. But you won't be given this opportunity.-Min/max builds and system gaming already rife. Needs a balancing mechanic.THE BAD-I haven't won the lottery so it's going to be a while before I can retire and play 24/7. RECOMMENDED AUDIENCE-Necromunda fans-Mordheim fans-WHFB fans pre-WHFB sharkjumping olympics-Born during the Vietnam War-Super cool people who used to play tabletop games but developed careers-Stoners-Obsessive-compulsives-People who are super talented at painting minis and building terrain, plus they brew their own beer, but not any more-Sad old tabletop wargamers looking to relive their glory days-Awesome cool people who just don't give a tinker's curse about K/D ratios, lanespam, grenade spam etc. and just want a thinker's game linked by an ongoing campaign-Me and every gamer I respectSeriously 10/10 top effort. This game deserves to succeed, if only to open up DLC, Necromunda, WW2: the Turnbased Third-person Tactical game, et cetera. If you're a thinking gamer not a twitch gamer, don't think: buy.			"

Early Access Review
								Mordheim is a gritty and near to literal take on the original Mordheim system.  The emphasis in early access has been on balance and keeping to the spirit of its tabletop predecessor, and it has done that in spades.  Its color pallete and graphic design are ludicrously dark and forboding.  Every map is liberally painted with corruption and death, with every little bump or crevess hiding another way to get killed.  In this aspect, it is just like every game of Mordheim you've ever played on your high school buddies kitchen table.Where the game differs is in its combat and warband growth.  The warband building system is difficult to master, yet varied enough to cater to quite a few different playstyles in one warband.  Half of the challenge right now is finding out what works the best, and I forsee it becoming quite similar to the tabletop game's tendency to rely on cookie cutter net lists, but this doesn't bother me at all.  Its something you can plan for and counter with ingenuity and skilled gameplay.  Combat is often initiated totally by surprise, yet can be flipped in just two or three actions.  While individual characters can shine, what really makes the difference is your follow up.  This is a great way to really do combat, as it makes you truly have to think out each turn before you take action.  All of these together come wrapped up in a very neat little package, a promise of things to come.  Its still in early access, but there is still so much more Rogue Factor can do.  The skys the limit...try it out..watch the learning curve, and you will be happy you spent the cash "

												There's a lot to like about Mordheim, but not enough to recommend it. The visuals are solid: graphics are good, aesthetic customization is satisfyingly deep, and the ruined city, forgive the expression, comes alive. Though some have criticized the gameplay, I really liked the combat system, and had a lot of fun in the actual fights. However:The campaign becomes extremely unfun pretty quickly because of how the game compensatses for the poor fighting skills of the AI, namely, massive, massive bonuses. You can see it in the description of the difficulty of a given mission, but what isn't clear is how the game ""balances"" the strength of your warband as you level up. Enemy warbands will have a rating similar to yours, but will have /all/ their members leveled. In addition to this, they'll have a composition similar to yours, so if you have six members, they have six members. If you have one of your special heroes, they'll have one of their special heroes. One of the biggest frustrations I experienced was leveling up my Cult warband until I could, FINALLY, hire the Possessed. Once I fielded him, though, I found myself up against a fully leveled and upgraded Augur that handed his♥♥♥♥♥to him. Read some guides, found out that people that Possessed heroes were underpowered, so I ditched him, and started leveling up for the Spawn. Got the Spawn, and then faced a fully leveled and upgraded Rat Ogre. That was when I stopped playing. Maybe I'd like it better in multiplayer, but the campaign became just incredinly unfun to play after a while. The only way to win those kinds of match is to get lucky in the set up, and then exploit the very poor AI strategy. Which, by the way, is to just run straight at you along whatever road is closest. I have never seen the AI go after objectives, which also makes it hard, bordering on impossible, for you to do the same. Unless you get REALLY lucky, expect most skirmishes to devolve into a scrum, which is why the best and only strategy is to keep your whole warband together at all times. But it on sale, maybe, but I'd give it a pass. It's more frustrating than fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me make this clear. This game is by no means finished. I would recommend waiting until it is a little further along in development before purchasing straight away.With that out of the way let's begin. Mordheim City of the Damned is the electronic and spiritual successor to the tabletop franchise that spawned out of Games Workshop's very own tabletop world of fantasy Warhammer. You take control of a band of warriors and proceed to try and outwit and eviscerate your opponent. The gameplay is a nice blend of a turn-based RPG with elements from the tabletop game itself. In my opinion this is the game Relic should have been making for the Warhammer franchise all this time. And once it is finally completed it will be a real gem. There is talk of adding more warbands, adding to the original four. These new bands will supposedly include Undead, Dwarves and Elves.This game has tons of potential, and once all these features which are currently locked in game start working, it will get even better. Plus who doesn't enjoy watching their Commander fall flat on their♥♥♥♥♥from trying to climb a 6ft wall.			"

												Already 25 hours in and I already love this game, and Ive only used Empire Mercs for the most part (maybe 2 hours with chaos.) Why do I love it?- The setting, Warhammer is a brutal universe with great lore that really influences  the setting.- It is a great medieval tactics game.- I like RNG and Permadeath. - The link between Multiplayer and Singleplayer is awesome.- I can really feel the people who made this game have a passion for the core material.Any Cons?- Amount of content/warbands in the long run. I hope to see these come as DLC.- Minor animation and loading issues. I would like to see the load times be faster and have a way to fast forward animations that everyone does. But overall I recommend it if you like Turn based strategy, the Warhammer setting, and games with permadeath and RNG. "

												I can´t recomend this game. Maybe I expected too much, I don´t know, but I expected a better game . It has been just full released but i feel like game lacks content, A LOT.-First of all: Only four warbands. Seriously no orcs, dwarfs or undead?-Very limited customization of characters.-Few warrior classes. I expected more variety.-The management of your units in only 3 groups (leader, hero and adept) is just too basic and rusty.-Very few types of secondary objective (steal idol, kill and steal ""x"" unit equipment and collect ""x percentage"" of wyrdstone).-Multiplayer is broken: almost no matches can be found.Also, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues in this game is the AI: The AI makes lots of ""stupid"" decisions but the real problem is how the devs tried to fix it: In campaing, you will ALWAYS have to face a superior warband (even on normal difficulty), no matter the mission, it will always have better stats than your warband. So the difficulty (normal, brutal, deadly) is based in how high the difference in stats will be. I dont know, but i find this combat system too unfair, especially when you have the risk of losing your warband members forever (permadeath) and losing a couple of valuable characters means almost a forced warband restart because fights, even on normal difficulty, will be impossible.Unit placement is a nightmare: In some maps you will have more than 30 deployement spots and you cant just click the point where you want the unit to be placed, you have to switch between the 30 spots until you get the place you want.Same with inventory management: If you have fulled the capacity and want to pick something from the ground, you can´t just switch items. You will have to go to a chest and leave the objects you don´t want there before taking more. Seriously?Finally, the excesive focus on random chance in this game is just annoying.Of course the game is not rubbish but i don´t think it worths 40$. Not in my opinion.			"

Early Access Review
								I own over 100 games on steam and this is my first review.  I feel like I just have to leave a comment here - partially for the potential buyers, but also for the developers.Rogue - you have created what could be a true epic strategy game.  So far, i am loving your design choices.  Continue to pour love into this game.  Warband development / progression / equipment is probably going to be what makes or breaks this game.  If you do this well and reward players for good play and gently punish those that choose poor strategies - you will do well.  It should be fair and over time the better players should build stronger warbands.  I also feel that the possibility of having assymetric multiplayer could help this feel awesome.  Allow the community to build ""clans"" and allow clans to challenge each other for even greater rewards and risks.  This ""style"" or genre of game could become a HUGE thing.Warcraft 3 initially was going to go with this style of game (small persistent warbands that developed over time), but they abandoned it.  I always wanted that game to be made and this could be it.  The possibilities are endless.  You could overlay a ""mordheim strategy map"" that clans could vie for control over.  Limit a server to a certain number of players and let different clans and factions fight for dominance.  Anyways - i'm excited.  This game so far shows an INCREDIBLE amount of potential.  Please continue to listen to the community, but also know when to NOT listen to the community.  So far, your vision looks like it's paying off.  Good luck, Rogue. "

								Keeping in mind this is just the Alpha stage of the game, I can see huge HUGE potential here, specially in Multiplayer games.This is not a port game, some changes have been made to play it on PC (For example, it's still a turn-based game but instead of moving your band then wait 5-10 min while the other player moves his/her band, warriors are moved individually according to their initiative).Right now you've 4 tutorial to learn the ropes of the game, and a skirmish option to play vs a mate or the AI. Only Mercenaries and Skaven Eshin bands are available, but (at least) Sisters of Sigmar and The Cult of Possessed will be in the full game. I'll keep adding more info in the future, as more content is added, also a list of pro and cons.See you in the streets.			"

												I'm writing this review in response to the negative reviews about RNG. I even seen some reviews mention that they played X-COM so now they are ""experienced"" with RNG games. First thing first is X-COM is the checkers to RNG games while Mordheim is the ""beat ya like a red-headed step child"" chess version of RNG games. For instance in X-COM you get a percentage to hit and thats it...if ya hit gj ya got a hit but if ya miss oh well ya missed bad luck. Mordheim gives ya a percentage chance to hit in melee but thats not the end of it...if you roll a hit then guess what? Enemy now gets to roll chance to dodge or parry which means even though you rolled a hit, you still may miss. There are also many other factors in the game that determine your chance to hit or whether your character will even fight at all, but you can use this against the enemy too.  Mordheim has a great community with many helpful guides to make each and every warband you create a successful warband. The negative reviews about the RNG are just crybabies that are mad cuz bad. Take the time to look at the guides in the community and make reading great again. This is a very excellent tactics game that can make you rage to the point of losing faith in whatever God you worship or make a life long atheist start screaming ""BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD...SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!!"". Believe me, I've seen it happen.			"

												This is my favorite game!! It is quite challenging and so very rewarding when you make achievements. If you like a game that you can totally dominate from start to finish ,then this is not for you. Like most computer games, its harder when you start until you level up your abilities.  Then the dice rolls don't work against you as much. This game's characters are nicely detailed and so is the world. Love the warhammer universe. Its a turn based game, which I like, because you can make many choices as to what your character does in the game. Sure there is some luck involved too, but wise decisions can turn things more in your favor. Too anyone up for the challenge, I would recommend a few basic things. Set earned points on agility and weapons skill in there catagories, this helps prevent damage to you. Also equip your warband characters with highest level weapons possible, early on two single hand weapons give more damage then a two handed. Once your warband rating is around lvl 4 things start going alot better!!  Highly recommend this game if you like turn based games.			"

												Excellent game, makes time fly away and makes you think ""one last map"" and then it's over, you're in the morning and spent the night playing :)Pros:- Beautiful- Interesting character development, with items, levels, skills and spells to play with- Not so bad solo content, even if repetitive after some time- Offers a decent challenge, and is very rewarding if you spent some time optimizing your ""skill builds"", as you'll feel the power of your warband skyrocketCons:- AI is somewhat lackluster (characters can get stuck into pathing issues, giving you a one man advantage -happens more with impressives, which is even more than a one man advantage when it happens-)- Can be a little tricky to learn, but the log parser makes it a lot easier to understand what happens- As stated earlier, can become repetitive once your warband is strong enough to steamroll almost all opposition, but that's why there are ""Brutal"" and ""Deadly"" missions, to keep you challenged in the later stages of your campaign- A bit rng dependant, especially with random character positionning, can lead you into a VERY hard gameTLDR:Excellent game if you like turn based strategy games, even more so if like me, you can literally spend hours optimizing your warband skills and stats. If you like Games Workshop universe and design, you won't be disappointed either.Pass if you are the all-in, impatient kind of gamer, as this game can (and will) punish you for that.  "

												This game is a beautiful gem with some serious flaws. I should know it pretty well after about 600 hours of gameplay.Flaws from the worst to the least:PvP. It isn't well balanced, the turns are painful to wait through, and you never find matches anyway.Moderate to difficult learning curve.AI has major tactical faults, and it's still painful to wait through your opponents turn.Time consuming. I spent more than 100 hours on each of my single player warbands, but at the time I am writing this I have not completed all of the campaigns.Random number generators, usually have a bias. This one causes 1% chances to occur 25% of the time.Looting wyrdstone to improve your faction reputations takes an investment beyond any reasonable effort.Discovering the enchanting recipes is also random (many have no benefit).The Value:This emulates the feeling of table top games like warhammer, warmachines, and malifaux wonderfully.You can make a list from your collection of mercenaries and kit them them in minutes. A full game should take less than an hour, and if both players act quickly can be over in less than 30 minutes.Each of your models is highly customizable in both appearance and functionality.There are persistent effects from inuries and mutations (chaos only). Often times this means you will have a completely unique warband.The reserves allow you enough extra troops to be able to have a flexible fighting force. (You don't have to do the same thing every battle).This game is challenging, and learning its intricacies is rewarding. More importantly information is attainable.			"

												I don't review much, but I have to give a positive to offset the idiots who give negative reviews when they don't know what they are even talking about. If you haven't played the tutorials:  STFU about game mechanics or knowing how to play. If you don't like the game because it's not the same system as tabletop:  Give it a chance please. I felt the same way once. Now though, after knowing what i'm doing, I see the game is actually much better than TT, enough so that I don't know if i'll ever be going back. (This of course is ignoring the hobby aspect of it.) If you think the random number generator is biased:  Idk, just grow up. Actually on second thought, i'm a Nigerian prince who needs your bank account information to give you lots of money. The loomynarti is real too. Before you say PVP is dead:  That is because most pvp is either between friends, or you have to join a tournament or league. Or maybe people have to man up and fight each other, despite the consequences. What is Mordheim:  It is a hardcore fantasy skirmish game, from the old Warhammer setting, set in the city of Mordheim, where you control a warband of 3-10 people vs other warbands (though you can have up to 10 people in reserve too). Injuries happen and are permanent, life is tragic for most warband members. But offsetting that are those that survive and prosper, eventually becoming rightly feared heroes. You equip your warband how you want and choose their upgrades as they advance. You must manage the warband financially, which basically means leading them into the ruined city to find precious wyrdstone (magical fragments of a great comet), which is worth a fortune to alchemists, magic users and those who desire power.This game is not perfect, but it's still one of the best games I ever played. As someone who spent their life working with TT and RP games, I can't say anything about this game's system other than it is genius. Anything I want to comment on about the game that could use work I won't say, because the developers have not ignored the game and are still improving it.Buy this game, and all the DLC, even if you won't play it, even if you don't like it. This is an overlooked masterpiece of a game, and it's rare to find a creator that deserves to be rewarded this much for their work. I think if you learn the game though, and give it a chance, then you will love it.			"

												     Being a fan of the tabletop game, I really wanted to like this version of Mordheim.  Sadly, I don't.     The game does a number of things well, starting with presentation.  The graphics style matches what I always imagined Mordheim to look like, and the music and sound mesh with the art very well.  And at the tactical level, the actions your characters can perform are varied and useful enough to keep things interesting -- stuff like climbing walls to gain elevation advantage, intercepting enemies who enter your AO, providing overwatch, and so on.     That said, this game has significant issues.  Some of the more minor ones include camera positioning that ranges from awkward to actively infuriating, a clumsy and unintuitive control scheme, data feedback that misrepresents the true gameplay mechanics, and AI that's a lot bigger on the ""A"" than the ""I"".     All of the above problems are small enough to be forgivable if it wasn't for the hot mess they made of the strategic level gameplay and multiplayer aspects of the game.  Where the original Mordheim was a skirmish-focused game with some RPG elements, the devs have chosen to place the cart before the horse and create a game where the battles are just a chore you muddle through to drive the ridiculously extended character progression and loot collection.  Gone are varied victory conditions that might reward creative play and create memorable matches; now every fight revolves around grouping your warband into one giant mass and rolling it at the enemy until they rout.  Which you'll be doing A LOT of, because the pace of campaigns has been slowed down drastically to account for the CRPG tropes that were shoehorned into a game that didn't need or benefit from them.     But the most astouding failure of all is that there is no support whatsoever for multiplayer campaigns.  Let me say that again: THERE IS NO SUPPORT WHATSOEVER FOR MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGNS.  IN A GAME THAT CALLS ITSELF MORDHEIM.  All you get are one-shot battles where you use the same warband that you spent 60 games grinding against the crappy AI with.  Ugh, I'm done.			"

												Reasons not to get this game:1. You get upset if you've spent a good bit of time working on building a character up only to have him killed by a 1/1000 chance occurence that you couldn't do anything about.2. You think games need to have save slots that you can reload if you make a mistake.3. You don't want a game that has a moderate learning curve and no forgiveness whatsoever4. You only want to fight - This is a game about trying to scavenge items in the middle of a battle.5. You are spoiled by AAA titles.If none of these apply to you and you want a difficult strategy game with good replayabliity, you probably should try this one out.  The gameplay is excellent and my only real complaints are the minor bugs in the AI and that I'm greedy and want more content (warbands, maps, hired swords, etc.).			"

												Mordheim: City of the Damned Review: An Turn Based Strategy Game with RPG ElementsFirst up, this is not Table Top Mordheim. It looks like it, it feels like it, but it is an adaption of the table-top game, not a direct port. So if you want Mordheim as you remember it, this is not it. But it is still an amazing game.It captures the look and feel of TT Mordheim very well. The characters look like they jumped right off your miniature shelf and into your monitor. The world feels exactly like Mordheim should...dark, scary and evil. It is very close to Warhammer lore, and if you want a Warhammer Fantasy fix this is surely your best bet today. No Age of Shitmar junk here! Just traditional Warhammer goodness!PROS:-The maps are truly amazing and detailed. There is nothing else like it. Multiple stories in buildings, raised walkways and terrain, traps and dead ends. Ruined buildings and plenty of flanking and high ground opportunities abound. It blows away anything else in the market and needs to be seen to be believed. All maps also are different every time you play them due to procedural terrain generation. Never the same experience twice.-The graphics are well done, the animations are varied and many, and as said above they really captured the feel of Warhammer in it's entirety.-The development options are immense. 175 total skills and 8 unique spells per faction. 7 different characters for 4 warbands. So many ways to build your characters to fit your playstyle.-'Hardcode' gameplay. You cannot save and reload (although you can save/quit and continue again at any time) or as it's known, save-scumming. Characters can get injuries and die. You live with consequences.-Huge array of maps for multiplayer, with many options.-Seamless integreation of Single Player and Multiplayer. They are basially one and the same.-Unique campaign for each faction and a large single player experience.CONS:-The wealth of options can be overwhelming to new players. If this doesn't bother you, you'll love it.-The lack of dedicated MP support. Since the publisher didn't cough up the cash for dedicated servers, the community will need to start their own leagues. But nothing stops you from doing MP-only with friends. You will need an 'honor' system (and screenshots) to enforce MP only.-Hardcore gameplay can be a turn off. If you can't handle setbacks, you won't like this game.-AI still needs work. It can be challenging at first, but after a while it is fairly beatable. Of course, that's where MP comes in. Note the developers are still working on the AI.-""Only"" 4 warbands. If you want a lot of options they aren't here yet. That said, the four warbands offer immense options anyway. But if your a TT purist, or really want Undead or Dwarves, they aren't here yet.-The complex maps can sometimes cause issues with AI pathfinding, and you may not get why you cannot disengage from combat because some rock or skeleton is blocking your way.It has to be said the development team, Rogue Factor, has been truly amazing throughout the early acces in terms of accessibility, communication, and feedback. A number of suggestion I myself have made are in the game...they really listen to the community, beyond any other developer I've ever seen. They will continue to refine the game even after release, and if sales justifiy, it, they will add more Warbands and functionality.In the end, I found this to be an incredible game, well worth the $40 US. If you like warhammer, and deep turn based strategy, and want fully 3D maps that blow anything in the market away (XCOM has nothing on these maps) then this is the game for you.VERDICT: 8/10Improved MP support and AI will bump this up to a 9 or 9.5.

												they have a good foundation here, but the game is no where near finished:- code is not optimized, load times are waaay too long- balance and tactics seems off, even as the best ranged faction, i basically won everything by clumping together and having a lot of close combat guys- interface super clunky- minimap is not functional - camera is bewildering- units don't end their turn once they run out of AP, instead every single grunt has to end his turn by choosing a stance. even the AI seems to have trouble picking, since the AI plays every. one. of. its. models. as if it was a real human being (you'll be waiting 4-5-6 mins to just mop up a broken foe. not a €40 game, at least not yet. - on that note, AI is like a Rome Total War general who rushes his leader unprotected into a mass of your guys that are just lined up, waiting for him. I know AI is hard, but this is just crazy.- no pricing balance. heavy armour is 14gc but a lousy skill is 100gc- *way* too many stats and modifiers for what the game ends up being, which is something pretty simple (but also not without charm)- ""zones of contol"" orbs around the guys is confusing and now smooth. also seems buggy. e.g. you can't loot a corpse if it's inside the zone of control of another warrior in your own warband. whaaa?so what are good things, you ask?+ it's Mordheim and they got the atmosphere and factions right+ you can level up and collect stuff for your gang. hooray+ rogue-like permadeath etc. that makes kiddes cry when they can't che... i mean savescum. it really is the right thing to do for mordheim and anyone who says otherwise never understood what mordheim is about.

												If you enjoy a challenge, beware: this game is horribly, horribly ADDICTIVE.Reading through the reviews, you'll find lots of common threads: you will come to care deeply about your warband; you will curse the RNG (and the entire lineage of anyone who created it); and you will be pulled deeply into a thematic, immersive world.In the end, narrative will be a key factor in your experience — not just the narrative of the game's campaign but, more importantly, the narrative of your collective experiences. That will include tales of victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, frustrations due to unforeseen events (likely combined with minor mistakes), pyrrhic victories, and even fortunate defeats.I once had a relatively inexperienced character hold against, and severely damage, a massive Rat Ogre, long enough for help to arrive. In a later game, when facing the lethally quick Skaven (rat people), he stuck his neck out to help two fellow warriors get to a safe position, delaying the Skaven leader and tying up three others for two turns, before paying the ultimate price (perma-death).Through it all, you'll be challenged, and likely have to restart with a new warband or two. But once you get a handle on the gameplay, you'll be rewarded with a nuanced tactical and strategic challenge. For instance, I spend several minutes at the start of each game (against the AI, mind you) looking over the game's map, planning my deployment and strategy for that mission. You'll benefit not only from such planning, but also from careful use of tactics, such as adjusting your formations to ensure shooters have clear shots of incoming enemies, and ensuring that your fighters are in ambush stances to prevent access to your soft targets.Oh, and friendly tip for fellow lovers of ranged combat: set melee weapons as your primary weapons for your shooters (you can have 2 sets of weapons), and their ranged weapons as secondary. You'll be able to switch back during the game, but (most) melee weapons give you far better initiative, which can buy you time to get into position. And for this purpose, stick to initiative-boosting weapons, like spears, daggers, and swords.Enjoy!			"

												The Early Access phase of the game is over, with the game making tremendous strides since then. This game is a hardcore experience, which players often forget before purchasing the game. You will lose warband members, RNG will not go your way sometimes (as with any RNG based game), you'll be scraping to get by with your wyrdstone shipments, and many other frustrating experiences. But the game is worth, oh is it worth it. Pros:- The city of Mordheim is beautifully rendered. It really captures the feeling of exploring a haunted city. Each map is randomly generated, so no match will be exactly the same. -Each warband feels different from one another, with different skills and strategies being important for each one. -You are able to progress your character through leveling up characteristics, purchasing skills, and equipping different sets of weapons and armor. -If you're a warhammer fan, you'll love this game. -Permanent injuries make you feel a connection with your characters, since you don't know when it'll be their last session. -In depth tactical experience with positioning, stances, and environmental advantages being crucial to victory. -Rogue Factor is an amazing company. They value player feedback and have sculpted the game through Early Access in response to the community input. They are very quick to fix bugs, and bring out updates. Cons:- only four warbands (witch hunters are being added, so more warbands are on the way)-The AI can be really annoying. Their pathfinding isn't the best and they can make silly tactical choices that cost them the game. -Loading times (fixed, only 20-30 seconds now). -Needs more multiplayer support. -Could use more warband customization.I would suggest this game if you like tactical RPGs or the warhammer universe. There will be times where you are frustrated, but that comes with any game. Rogue Factor deserves another round of applause for being extremely responsive to player feedback. There will most likely be DLC down the road (warbands, customization, maps, etc).			"

												Really really good, especially for fans of Warhammer or dark fantasy in general. My message to the devs: ADD HOTSEAT!Edit:This game has come so far and improved so much. I have been playing GW games since 1996 and I consider this the most faithful interpretation of the atmosphere and aesthetics so far. Gameplay wise, I'd say if you are an X-Com fan then this is for you. Turn based (ish) with lots of depth and room for clever tactics.You and your men (or women, or ... rat people) will suffer greatly throughout the course of your campaign but half the fun is rolling with the punches and finding a way for your braindead/betentacled/peg-legged cripples to still be useful, and with a bit of imagination your characters will develop their own stories based on their exploits, triumphs and failures.

												Valkyria Chronicles in a Warhammer Fantasy related universe, this is how I would describe Mordheim to friends with my full recommendation attached.I rate it highly as it is a hidden gem that values and celebrates sophisticated turn-based strategy. The modes and mechanics offer endless gameplay, be it online or in the multi-layered and extremely replayable campaign.It still needs optimisation and polish as it just came out of early access, other than that it is a dream come true for every turn-based strategy fan.If you like the flavour of TBS that Valkyria Chronicles presented and have a knack for the gritty and dark Warhammer Fantasy universe, then you will love this.9/10 - Brave, unique and absolutely needed game.

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI highly recommend for fans of turn based strategy. Although it has been said that to players of the Tabletop Mordheim it does not feel like Mordheim except for the looks (meaning some core rules not being implemented), this is a fine game already. From playing the early version I can say that devs work hard to get rid off bugs and balance the units and they are highly appreciating user feedback in the forums. It feels a lot like XCOM in Multiplayer but has a initiative-based turn order per unit (not per player like XCOM). To me the best aspects of the game are yet to be implemented (statistics, customization, leveling, mission goals)The downside of this being early access is that you have only 2 pre-defined warbands available for play, while customization, leveling your units and creating class/skill/euipmtent combinations of your own is key to replayability. If you buy the early version you have to be aware that it is getting repetitive and the best thing to do is play 1-2 games per day max and report bugs in the forums. If you don't want to spend your money yet I recommend to follow the announcements because this game feels like it's going to be great.			"

												Pros:-Warhammer game which guarentees excellent characters and story.-Maps are beautiful rendered with a few randomly generated features and because of how quickly the AI mindlessly charges you, will never get to explore it and realize just how similar the maps really are.-Permanent consequences and wyrdstone shipment requirements make gameplay much more intense and involving.-Campaign missions are very well done and each faction has a well detailed story that gives some purpose to your warband's struggle beyond just grabbing loot.Cons:-Heavy reliance on RNG takes away from the strategy aspect and turns every engagement into little more than a game of dice, which more often than not, will feel heavily weighted in the AI's favor.-AI feels less like a rival warband attempting to seize as much loot as they safely can before engaging in battle and more like a suicidal band of madmen/madwomen with a pathological hatred of you. It will simply charge you with whatever  units it has as soon as the game starts and will largely ignore even the most valuable loot along the way.-Only way to replace units is to either hire level 0 scrubs who will be wiped out in 2 attacks later in the game or pay exhorbatant fees to hire from a weekly pool of randomly generated warriors who still are just barely a few levels higher than 0. Advancing along the games campaign and smuggling system will give a free higher level unit, but in a game so heavily reliant on RNG with such aggressive AI this will not make up for the heavy number of losses you are likely to experience.-Small number of factions combined with a very simplistic AI creates tremendous repitition with the tedium only broken by campaign missions.-Loading screens long enough for you to pick up a new hobby.-Clunky UI. Although I hear is much better if you use a controller but I was not that fortunate.My experience with this game has felt a lot less like some tactician and more like a compulsive gambler who enjoyed the ups and downs of such a hardcore game but every gambler has a point where they realize the pain of the game has finally outweighed the enjoyment. Mine came when I had 4 critical hits on three different characters and my leader killed himself with a 9999 damage bad luck roll all in one turn. That was the last straw that made me realize the game just wasn't enough fun for me to be worth such frustration.			"

												To be honest, i normally don't take the time to write reviews. This is one of my few exceptions. I bought this game when it was early access... because i love 40k... the video looked cool... and i thought that maybe i'd play it as one of my ï'm bored and i don't know what else to do""games.It developed slowly but consistently and i have to say that the devs have methodically ironed out the flaws as they've arised to make it a solid game. It now loads much faster, has few bugs, is genuinely fun and has beautiful little parts such as your warband members develping their own story over time. For example I was GENUINELY upset when ""Reject Ralph"" finally died. Reject Ralph was initially hired as a ""replacement"" gunner for when i was training one of my more valued... party disposables. Reject Ralph became a valued member of my party and... lost a leg... an arm... and an eye in service...! I was very upset the day when i realised that his little wooden leg would no longer be stepped upon and the sword held in his left hand (being no longer able to fire a rifle) would no longer swing... as i could not ""Ält + F4"" and load the game before his departure.In short, my review is outrageously positive due to the genuine investment in your party that the game makes you have. Moving forward, i would like to see a larger variety of maps, warbands and mission types but i have no doubt given the hstory of the developers that this will come.My thanks to the ""boredom game""that i actually rate highly in my library.

												I bought relatively early into Early Access, And I was super disappointed - the game was sluggish, unbalanced, boring and the multiplayer battles without consequences.And then I started again with the last patch, after taking half a year off.Boy did this get far. Mordheim is brilliant now. It's still a bit sluggish, a bit slow with the loading, but it's so, so, so much fun. While there's only four warbands, there's plenty of opportunity with different weapon styles and skillings to build your own unique troop. And every battle counts, every engagement could end badly for you.The AI isn't very good, but it gets lucky every now and then and manages to outflank you, so there's still a considerable risk. Mordheim teaches humility - like when your Matriarch tank loses her shield arm and can't enter Parry stance anymore, rendering her completely useless as a tank. And replacing her from the scratch will take a lot of time and training you might not have, as your commander expects a large delivery of warpstone soon!My initial disappointment is completely gone, and I'll be the first in line when new DLC featuring more warbands hits the store. It's so good, and so exciting. "

												I think this is truly excellent game, with a unique, well thought out take on turn based combat. Set in a rich (and slightly terrifying) environment that never seems to be the same map twice, thanks to the random(?) generation of traps, bridges and the destruction of structures.The 4 factions are well balanced and allow for surprisingly different play styles, thanks largely to their standard passive and Warband specific abilities (when you create a warband you'll see what I mean). Also, the DLC warriors are great. They add a real dynamism to the Warband.A word of warning though. This game is very unforgiving. You will make mistakes, you will overextend at some stage, hungry for Wyrdstone, your warriors will be permanently mutilated or die. Accept that. It is what makes winning a battle so exciting and losing so upsetting. If I could give the old me advice (250 hours ago), it would be:Never do maps where your Warband is scattered randomly - you are leaving them in the hands of the GodsWyrdstone is everything - try to do maps with the highest Wyrdstone rating possible, balancing difficulty.Fill every slot - hire all the warriors you can and rotate them to gain experience. It may take a little longer but that way when one loses a leg or gets brain trauma or dies, you won't be too upset.Be patient - Money is hard to come by and good gear doesn't begin to appear until at least level 4. That's fine. A time will come where you have all the money you want and can really invest in skills that suit your Warband and the gear you have.Lastly, thanks to the devs of this game. You clearly care about the game and the lore of Warhammer. Very good job.			"

Early Access Review
								Mordheim: City of the Damned isn't ready - Even for early access - plain and simple. While everything looks promising, I would not recommend anyone purchase this game until it's either released as the full game, or some significant advancements are made with the game as is. Right now, it's a $30 demo with extreme loading times, and most elements of the game missing - which might be forgivable outside of the fact that those elements are what would make the game worth investing any time in to at all right now. When I say extreme loading times, we are talking 3-5 minutes for a skirmish vs. A.I. The core components of the game are looking promising, but the camera clips constantly through the scenery, often placing the camera awkwardly below the ground behind your current unit during an attack. The U.I. is in desperate need of some revisions. Attribute checks, for example, are identified on one end of the screen, and display the result on the far end of the screen. This is poor design and should be a unified element in the center of the screen tying the attribute check directly to it's result. a tip should also be included to explain what a failure or success means - this feature should be enabled by default, but allow veteran players to turn it off to reduce screen clutter. This might seem a bit strange to say, but this game is so obsessed with hiding things from obvious view that it's overly streamlined. That said, if you turn on everything, it's certainly a lot of info so there is a balance to be struck, but the radial menu feels pretty good to use and would be where I would focus my attentions as the UI designer. The map needs work also. Getting the cursor over an element should identify that element - as is, the strategic value of the map is very dependant on how well you know each and every icon. Memorizing icons is not an edge which should exist.The lack of game modes is pretty egregious for a game they are asking $30 for - certainly it's understood that this is a game in Beta/Early Access, but as is, this is not a game experience, it's a demo that isn't worth playing in it's current state. The graphics are fine, but the models require some level of enhancement, especially on the highest settings. The rat ogre, upon whom I seem to get focused during opponent actions, is quite disappointingly rendered. There is no separation on the large front teeth, the fur and skin textures are flat and outside of the life you see in the armour, everything looks pretty dull. It's not all bad, of course. The game play is pretty spot on (even with the UI deserving a bit of a reworking) and the strategy of the game has been captured well in this digital interpretation. The movement of the Skaven is well animated, and the management/advancement element of the game which is only implemented in a skin-deep ""level your warband to 10 immediately"" demonstation, does look like it's going to do the job well and fulfill the needs of the Mordheim fans to level their warband up and craft it in their own unique ways. Long story short, pop this promising game on your follow or wishlist and wait for quite a few patches and updates before you throw any money down on it. Based on potential, this game is highly recommended for a future purchase. For early access, I would say skip this offering and find something that will give you a little more return on your investment. Early Access Score : 4/10 Potential: 8/10Fun? 1/10 Why? Because playing the AI seems to generate a random warband to face - and every time, they have been significantly more powerful than my warband. As in, they appear to have at least 6 actions to my 3. They hit 2 times harder, and twice as often. October 2015 release? we shall see.			"

Early Access Review
								So originally I had written a bad review mainly out of anger for the games difficultly. After realizing the DEV had actually REPLIED to that review and asked for elaboration I will now write an honest review, and that would be I like this game. My only gripe about this game is its difficulty at times may leave you pulling your hair out of your head in frustration, with repeated defeats dispite the overview claiming you are stronger then they are only lead to increased anger. Other then that however I do enjoy the games idea and mechanics. I also give props to the Devs for actually taking the time to look at bad reviews and actually see how they can improve. You guys are allready better then atleast 50% of Devs as a whole. Keep it up.			"

Early Access Review
								I use to play the board game, and now i am playing it again in the virtual world ! So with that said I am a fanboy, and I am SUPER critical of gamesworkshop adaptations. So for none have met the standard or feel of any of the table top games , besides the DoW series and Blood Bowl which both are kinda hit and miss, but awesome none the less. This game is really good already in it's early access phase. And I can see that it is only going to get better. As it stands now ( an update for the third warband and new functions ,IE stat item allocation , is happening as I type this) you have the human Mercernaries and the Skaven Clan Eshin warbands. Customization is limited , as it is early , but it is getting there. The game is simple and complex at the sametime. The ui and function of each character is pretty self explanatory and if not, the information is easy to find. the Ui , in my opinion , is clean and not distracting. It doesn't break the immersion or distract the tactical mind.  I have played both warbands ( awaiting the patch for the third warband Sisters of Mercy YUS! ) and both feel right. The only probelm i have so far , the devs are working on.... graphical bugs , camera clips , all the NORMAL stuff for an early game. It's the only thing that breaks teh immersion, and well at times can aid you or your opponent, as in unseen movement of enemy troops.I surely DO recommend this game IF you have patience and are willing to see the game grow and expect a game NOT finished, especially at this price of $31.99. As I know GW products tend to sell on the higher end of there produst platforms, nows teh time to get this. Just get it , don't play it , and when it releases with everything , jump on t , and be happy you saved money for a more finished product in the end.UPDATE: With the latest patch, giving us progression and scenarios - This game has become even MORE amazing than before. The devs are styaying true to the GW feel and mechanics. The models look amazing, the atmosphere amazing! The music puts you right n the mindest of the Warbands! UI has been further made user friendly, loading has ssen a decrease in time ( which is amazing !! ) . Injuries ( one of my skaven is missing an arm , and it shows, and it's amazing, he's got a dagger full of skittering anger ready ! ), downtime, wages, gear, consumables, magic , tactics, player progression - aside from indivdual warbands ( warbands are Mordheims word for gang or team ) There are 4 warbands as of yet : Mercenary : soldiers looking for monies  Skaven : ratmen from Clan Eshin ( ninja / pirates ) Sisters of Sigmar : the holiest and angriest women alive >.< and Chaos : fiendish humans selling body parts for warp gifts and angry magic!All very well produced and very true to their playstyle.This is the best Early Access game I have ever purchased, and makes me believe in early access success. I keep coming back to it in between all my other follies of gaming, but this is the one you find yourself going "" Ok one more minute-mission...."" 4 hours later and 3 pots of coffee Either way buy it, play it , enjoy it. Good game !			"

												I still wish Steam had a ""neutral"" rating. While this game has a solid foundation and a very strong appeal, I cannot personally recommend it. If you're an XCOM player, or a player from the Mordheim Tabletop, then I advise caution when considering this game.If you are looking to play the game for story: Don't. It's pretty threadbare. Each faction has a campaign mode, but the vast majority of missions are pre-generated and monotonous. It feels unfair that a good chunk of the game's content is gated behind DLC when you consider the fact that each faction is doing the exact same thing. Let's start off with the basics. At the infancy of your warband, you have your leader, a hero, and three slots for henchman. As you progress through the game, your warriors become stronger through experience. You will eventually be able to have a total of 10 units on a mission, not including various factors. As you progress through missions, you'll eventually get a ""deadly mission"" that's classified as a story mission. This particular mission does not go away, so you can pursue it at your own leisure.But let's not mince words here; it's a big grind. This game is all about carefully grinding up your warband to a high level, just to have it fall to pieces on the next mission.For starters, the enemy AI is odd. You'll be sitting in place, waiting for the enemy to make goofy itineraries. Its units will always be superior to yours, assuming that their warband does not just scale with you right from the get-go. ""Normal difficulty"" really means ""equal in strength"". An easy solution for this is to simply bottle-neck your warband in a place where they can't be flushed from, and whittle down the enemy until you win. Hell, you can even kill the enemy's leader and the rest of the troops will defecate themselves and run.However, while this is going on, you're *supposed* to be collecting Wyrdstone. Your success is rather dependent on it. You will get smuggler missions where you need to collect a certain weight of Wyrdstone in an allotted amount of days, and if you mess around it will punish you.Another glaring issue with the game is its RNG. Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""But XCOM is RNG!"". While this is a fair statement, the caveat is this: XCOM is fluent. Mordheim is not.I think the RNG in this game was created by a hardcore Warriors of Chaos player who thinks, ""But losing is fun!"" is an applicable ideology to game development.  The game has a number of mechanics which favor the AI, reinforcing the notion that the developers have an erection for the ""hardcore"" elements the game espouses so much. Let's take ambushes, for example. Basically, the ambushing warband gets bonuses to their attacks, while the defenders get penalties. Unless you have a warband built around Initiative, it's very likely that you will lose half of your warband before you can even get a hold of the situation. To me, this is not ""tactical"" or ""strategic"". It's an odd RNG algorithm giving you a giant middle finger just because it can.Finally, there's the UI. It is clunky, unwieldy, and not user friendly in the least bit. The control scheme is tied to the use of WASD movement. While the developers have vastly improved it since early access, it still feels like pulling teeth.But hey, with all that said, this is a perfect example of what G-Dubs does best. If you are someone who likes ""iron man"" challenges and pure RNG based games, I recommend this. If you are someone who does not like the fact you can lose hours upon hours of progress because of one bad roll, do not buy this game.			"

												Most of the reviews done by people have bias... I've put about 220+ hours into this game. Without a doubt it has it's flaws and perks. But for the most part people who would enjoy a solid tactical high stake team based tactical RPG, this one is worthy of a purchase. My bias is that I love the Warhammer world (40K-Fantasy), and honestly if you enjoy maiming rat ogres and mutants I think you’d appreciate it too. Pros- Every match is different (after about the 200 hour mark I felt like I had pretty much saw what the game had to offer).- large unit variety, there are probably thousands of different combinations to choose from within each warband… there are 6 total (including dlc’s announced so far)- Tons of loot and equipment variation- Different tactics in taking out your enemy… do you want to fight the enemy out in the open, or   would you rather sneak around and stab them in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Interesting lore behind characters that add to RP values. I have a warband that is full of mishap war veterans, homeless mordheimers, and nut jobs... Dirty Dan is the master of man.   - If you appreciate slow and meaningful plays (similar to that of chess or blood bowl) then you’ll get a kick out of this game.- Runs smooth, I have a dated computer and I’ve never had trouble running it well.Cons*Disclaimer* This is a budget game, and in certain ways it shows its face… be warned those of you who care about such things.- Graphics are dated (although the art is pretty satisfying)- There are still some annoying bugs in the game- Gameplay can get repetitive due to small number of game modes- Online play is pretty much non existent in a practical sense, I’ve had this game for a year now and I haven’t ever been able to play an online match (There are is a small community of hardcore guys who play online) Chances are if you know about this game/are interested in this game, you probably own it already. For those of you who don’t and are on a thread, these are the main selling points that I have found. Is the game sketchy, a bit. But does it redeem the sketchiness through awesome hardcore ghetto street fighting… ♥♥♥♥ yeah. I’d recommend it to any strategy lover, or anyone who likes a 16th century gang fight simulator.Have fun all you Mordheimers			"

												Originally I tried to refund this game but I had already played it for too long for that to be an option (2hrs is the threshold). So I put a lot of time and effort into liking this game. I read guides, warband builds, reddit posts and tried to apply all this information. Ultimately Mordheim: City of the Damned just does not deliver an experience to warrant anymore of my time or in all likelihood yours.  This is a big disapointment, as I love Mordheim the tabletop game and was hoping this adaptation would measure up. While there are definitely some things to enjoy about this game, a plethora of major and minute flaws make it overall unsatisfying.This game isn't hard on the wallet. I got it on sale for $12. But it's a timesink. I have 44hrs in and I haven't beaten a campaign yet. There are 4 campaigns (6 if you buy the DLC races). The campaign is a sparse peppering of special missions that come up as you level up. You level up by doing the unending supply of regular missions which have you fighting other warbands for loot. These are randomly generated and draw from a pool of maps, mission types and warband types. The enemy warbands scale to your warband or are stronger. There is a significant sense of difficulty, you can't screw around or your warband will get wasted. You also can't reload a save or undo a bad desicion so fights can get tense when you find yourself in a bad spot or one of your favorite warriors gets isolated and surrounded. Likewise the RNG system never really lets you feel comfortable or like you can take a battle for granted. The RNG system is fine, people accuse it of being broken or rigged, but it isn't. What it is, is frustrating. Because the warbands are always so close in relative power a few bad rolls can lose you a fight or leave you scrambling to cheese out a victory. Plans go out the window when your enemy succeeds 3 morale checks in a row and you fail your first attempt, meaning you lose. In many ways this is the game's greatest strength. Every contest is so close that small desicions matter, I've played plenty of games that would be vastly improved by some iteration of this approach. Unfortunately I don't think this was executed well enough to make the game fun. Let's talk specifics. I read a guide which suggested that you would probably have to start one or two warbands and have them fail or become to injured to make it worth continuing. This seems like it would be kind of cool. The stakes are so high that when you finally do succeed it will be that much sweeter. In practice you'll evenutally figure out that you need to build your warband around ganging up on your enemy .If a unit is left by himself, they must make a leadership check or break and run, giving you an oppurtunity to make a free attack for every person in proximity to the fleeing target. This is the game. Surround them, make them run, kill them with the free attacks, repeat. You will basic melee attack thousands of times. There are ranged weapons and magic but don't worry we'll crush those dreams later. Because of the scaling it will never be a good idea to go one on one. My beefed up Cult of the Possessed leader learned this by charging at a Witch Hunter and rolling 3 misses in a row and then getting killed in one round. This would have been funny, if I hadn't put a ♥♥♥♥load of time and resources into buffing up his defenses so this shouldn't happen. This moves us to the leveling up. It's kind of cool as every fight you'll get a few bonuses to make your warriors stronger. This game is full of little micro advantages and disadvantages. My problem with this is that this when combined with the fact that other warbands always scale to your level or above it, you'll never really feel a sense of significant progress. You can devote intense resources to making a warrior intensely tanky or to do a lot of damage but the changes are so small that they will only be slightly different then the generic dude beside them. Likewise the customization is weak. There are few meaningful options. A slightly different haircut or a off color shade of brown is all the seperates your goons from there's. You'll often fight warbands populated with guys who look just like yours. There's no flavour text or background as to why you are fighting, other then they were there. Also don't bother remembering the specific warbands you fight. If you're looking for revenge or to steal back that ♥♥♥♥ing magic hammer they looted off your corpse then you're out of luck. All the enemy warbands are randomly generated so don't look for continuity there. My leader was a mage and I wasn't getting a lot of millage out of his spells. Infact all the stuff he could learn seemed like a colossal waste compared to him just running in and doing basic attacks. So I read up on magic to see if this was a universal problem. The answer was yes and no. Helpful members of the community were more than happy to point out that nothing was wrong with the spell system, merely that my question, playstyle and general attitude were the real problem. Apparently magic becomes a viable strategy once you get to level 10 and can afford to spend all your gold on spells and talents. For context, 10 is the highest level you can get to. I think this sort of speaks volumes to the type of person you should be if you think you will thorougly enjoy this game. If you think it's reasonable that an entire aspect of the game is useless until you get to the end of the game then sign right up. Likewise ranged combat isn't recommended until your warband has a posse of level 5 tough guys to bodyguard the delicate flowers who can shoot people. This isn't set in stone or a law you must follow. There's probably some masochist out there or someone with 200+ hrs logged who decided to only use spells and guns or something. But after awhile you will get tired of losing and having your people get injured to the point of uselessness or death. Likewise being broke all the time in this game is about as fun as it is in real life. So you will grind out win after win, by swarming people in 3v1s, using basic melee attacks and trying to get them to break and run. This is the fundamental flaw in this game. For a game that boasts of an immense learning curve and challenges you to eek out every advantage you can, it does everything it can to punish you for taking risks and limits your viable options. Ranged attacks do less damage then melee, have penalties to firing into combat and require complete specialization to be useful. Your spell caster will take a risk to try a spell only to have it backfire, leaving him stunned on the ground, waiting to be pulped by whoever is passing by. Daring flanking maneuvers will blow up in your face, giving your enemy the chance to 3v1 you. These risk vs reward scenarios will tempt you over and over. But the conclusion is that there is no downside to bunching your whole team together and swarming out of position enemy units, it's all reward no risk. Even the special missions boiled down to this. I rarely lose at this game but two of these came when I became so bored with the long and drawn out special missions that I stopped playing it safe. I was immediately punished and a bloodthrister popped out of a closet I hadn't check yet and layed wasted to my spread out team. For me this came down to the game rewarding me for being boring and punishing me for having fun. I would go back to school if I wanted that.TL:DR - Play this game if you have a lot of time and patience. Otherwise the repeatative gameplay and lack of progression will break you.			"

												I want SO badly to like this game.  Against my better judgement, I can't stop playing.  A WHF game where you can PLAY as SKAVEN!  Woah!  Despite a very long early access, there are a ton of balance issues.  The game advertises itself as hardcore.  It is riding the wave from the dark souls ""difficult games are good"" bandwagon.  The problem is, it isn't difficult, it's unbalanced.  Percentages don't mean anything.  You'll have a 90% chance to hit an enemy and never hit them for the whole battle.  You may have a 90% chance to dodge, but the enemy will hit you 3 times in a row.  With 2 of them being crits.  I bought this game when it was first released in early access on steam, and it wasn't this bad back then.  A recent patch says it ""fixed"" the rng system.  Since the patch, I've just noticed getting critted more often and hitting the enemy less often.  Supposedly the unbalanced RNG system is put in to counter how bad the AI can be.  I'd rather have a smarter AI. There are also so many ways for a warband to get screwed to the point that they become unplayable.  Permanent injuries happen often.  Miss 4 payments of wyrdstone and no more single player mode.  If you get rid of a warrior because of an injury that makes them basically useless (severed leg on an already super slow warrior) and you can't afford one of the overpriced hired swords, then you have to hire a new guy at level 0.  He won't help at all and will just die because the enemies will still be leveled based on your warband's level.  Ok, I've ranted enough.  I'll still be playing this game occasionally because I am a skaven fangirl, but this game really needs some fixing.			"

												I want to love this game.I like it, but I want to love it.  It's just not quite there yet.  The good news is the dev. team seems to be very, very active and also receptive to some player suggestions.  The DLC is not too expensive, but for what it offers I'm waiting on a sale.I think that some of the detail in the graphic design is amazing in some instances, and only so-so in others.  Overall, it's fairly good.  But graphics aren't everything.  The setting is interesting but levels sometimes feel a bit repetitive.  I's turn based strategy and that's a bonus for me.The buildings are well detailed and generally the characters are also quite detailed.  Where the graphics fall short is repetitiveness.  Everything eventually starts to look like everything else.  Sometimes there's just too much going on in the scenery and I find that takes away from the game.  It may improve as I progress, I hope it does.The inventory system is odd.  Not what you wield or wear but what you can pick up during a mission.  It's completely dependant on strength, but makes no sense.  Wyrdstone orders from your ""boss"" come with a weight requirement, and each of the three sizes of wyrdstone weigh a different amount.  Herer's the part that makes no sense to me.  You can carry one piece of any size in one inventory ""slot"".  The weight doesn't matter.  Say your strength is high enough for 3 inventory slots.  You can carry 3 of anything.  3 shields, plus the one you're wielding in your off hand.  Or 3 small potion vials.  Or 3 pieces of wyrdstone of any size.  It's still workable, though, and you can take quite a few characters on a mission and most will have 2 or 3 inventory slots, or more, so it's not that bad.Maybe I find it odd that inventory is so simplified because there are so.  Many.  Stats.  So many options, so many skills.  But an over-simplified inventory system while actually playing levels.  And you can't drop anything.  The only option to drop something, really, is to go back to your cart and put things in the chest.  This, my friends, is ridiculous.  If I can pick up something, I can put it back down.  Come on now.  I know, I know, it's something to do with the table-top game it's based on.  But it's not a table top game, so....  Well, enough about that.  It's not that big of a deal, just make sure you remember who picked stuff up because there's no easy way to check who's carrying what.  I can't usually tell and I still haven't found a way to check.The depth in the stats and level system is deeper than most games.  The characters are interesting enough, and can be customized to some degree by carrying different gear or wearing different items.  Despite that, one Skaven assassin looks like the next to me, and the same goes for the humans, they all start to look the same pretty quick.Here's where you start to really customize.  Stats can be upgraded as you gain experience in battles.  They are not just strength and toughnes and intelligence, like your standard RPGs, but also your combat related abilities like parrying a blow, dodging and accuracy.  These points are earned through missions and skill training and they do not come quickly.  I think the slower progression is good because you place more value on the gains when they do come.There are a *LOT* of skills.  You can build characters to perform in a very wide variety of ways.  You can make them fast and nimble, climibing around with ease and dodging almost any attack.  You can make them hard-hitting brutes, tough as nails but maybe not as nimble as their counterparts.  You can focus on melee, or range, or a mixture, or magic, or simply not focus at all and be a generalist.  Which can, actually, work because sometimes you come up against a foe that can counter your main focus, so if you haven't got a backup plan, you might find yourself in a spot of bother.So far the missions are repetitive, but I find they're usually fun.  Some levels are difficult to navigate with tonnes of jumps and winding streets.  Others are more open.  This is a good thing because it gives some variety, despite the repetitive nature of the game I've seen thus far.  It forces you to modify your tactics accordingly and you don't know what the maps will look like until you actually get in them.  You can't stack your team for range attacks only because you might be in tight quarters.  You don't want to go too heavy on melee, because if there's alot of open ground and vantage points, you'll get picked apart.  If the win-some lose-some AI is having a good day, that is.  I've had alot of luck with Skaven melee fighters since they cover a lot of ground fairly quickly.In addition to straight up fighting face to face - you can set ambushes, or stumble into them.  You can lure people into traps that you nealy bumbled into yourself, if you set yourself up in the right place and wait.  There are a lot of combat options, but I find it odd that certain warbands can only equip certain weapons.  Why can't a certain character figure out which end of an axe to hold on to, yet can easily swing a polearm that also has the pointy-sharpy end and holdy-dull end, but just a tad shorter?  Probably a game balance thing.  Same reason you can't take four ""leaders' and six ""heroes"" into a fight.  Starting off you get a leader, a hero or two and a few henchmen.  As you play more your warband ""levels up""allowing you to bring a few more along on a mission.You keep what you pick up on each mission, plus a percentage of other loot.  It seems to be based on a percentage per character you bring in to a mission, so the more the merrier - but beware, each time you go on a mission your warband expects pay.  The more you take out, the more you pay when you come back.  You don't pay 'em until the job is done, but they won't work for you again until you pay them.  Run out of coin and you'll have to sell gear, or wyrdstone, to pay them.  You also pay to treat their wounds.Speaking of wounds, they take days to heal, so your fighters can be out of the game for a while.  Luckily you can have backup waiting in the wings.  Hiring costs coin, but if they don't go fight, they don't get paid, so once you have them they don't cost upkeep if they're not going on missions.  Training also takes days, usually a few, plus a lot of coin to learn new skills.  There's no explanation why it costs money and training tokens (or points, whatever you want to call them), but it does.  Keeps you poor, too... most training starts at 90 coins and goes way up from there.  Luckily wyrdstone sells for a good amount of coin.  I two small batches to two separate factoins and earned over 300 coins on the transaction.... and if you're wondering why your warband is fighting, it's for wyrdstone.  You get ""orders' for the stuff from your boss, basically, and have to send a certain weight of wyrdstone in a certain amount of time.  I don't know what happens if you don't, because I have not yet failed to send the required amount.  You get paid for those orders, but at what seems like a reduced rate.  You can, however, eventually bring it up to a better rate.  The other sales seem to fetch full value, but be warned, sell too much to one party usually means they start to pay less.  Supply and demand, you know.I can't really get into all the nuances of the game.  I'd be writing for hours.  Suffice to say it's decent, and if you like turn based strategy, it's worth a look.  Be warned, however, the AI is wonky.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just plain stupid.  Which is fine by me, my Skaven love it when enemy archers get a bit too close-near.  Which doesn't have to be all that close because the Skaven are pretty fast-quick. (Skaven double talk-speak a lot-much.)So, despite some negatives, I like the game.  Take a peek, watch some gameplay videos and, maybe give it a try.			"

								Genre - Games Workshop Board Game ConversionDisclaimer - I have only played one skirmish game. Although that is really all you can play at the moment. I saw people moaning it was targetted at console users. I used a keyboard/mouse and it as fine (you just need to get used to using Q & E to flick through abilitys). A controller can be used just as well if not a bit better though. The skirmish was hella' fun and left me wanting more. So why haven't I played it more? Because this is such an early build I want to wait and enjoy it properly.You move your 'pieces' with nice 3D graphics in real time, that actually counts as a turn. You engage the enemy and try and rout them or complete optional objectives. My optional objective was collect 16 warpstones, but due to restricted capacity there was no point in this so I just engaged the enemy. You can climb to higher ground with the risk of falling and the various units are unique (such as a stupidity check for a Rat Ogre, spell casters etc.). There is loads of potential here with a campaign, progression and equipment for your squad. There are four diverse squads at the moment. I used the Skaven and they stayed true to the Warhammer universe. So a great game is lying in wait here, but don't get it just yet, unless you can get a discount or a Games Workshop obsessive like me.			"

												Do you like the idea of physically cringing when any of your warband get a hit you KNOW will possibly mean the loss of a limb later? Or getting impotent rage at the screen when you're deployed in the WORST possible places on the map? It's all here and more! Mordheim is a great tactical game full of deep tactical opportunities and ways you can customise your own warband to lead on to glory. Don't expect to have everything your own way though, as the best part about this game is it's ability to throw you into random and deadly situations where you have to think on your feet about how to get your people out of there alive. It's normal to have a few veterans after a few levels to be missing an eye, limb or both, which just adds flavour and story to your band of intrepid treasure hunters!Very fun, very addictive, highly recommended. Would lose an arm again.			"

												Let me tell you the tale of Kashmet, the One Armed Rat.Kashmet was recruited to be the commander of the Vargen Front. A Scaven warband tasked at recovering warpstone from the depths of Mordheim. Kashmet had a loyal warband behind him. His officers, Mik Varr and Drac Rat watched his back and as he led them to victory over and over. As the Vargen Front grew so did they the attention of larger warbands that feared the rats may steal their warp stone from under their noses. Be it overconfidence or stubbornness, the Vargen Front decided to attack the rather powerful 'Cult of the Possesed.' The battle ended in a decisive defeat. Several clan rats where slain and the commanders all suffered permanent injury. Drac Rat lost a leg, but he shrugged it off. He was already slow from the heavy armor he wore, being a little bit slower won't hurt. Mik Varr lost his right eye, limiting his aim with ranged weapons, but as an assassin he preferred to stab his opponents in the back anyway. Kashmet lost an arm though. He could no longer wield his dual warp blades, who's green glow struck fear in his enemies. Unsure of his usefullness, Kashmet went into battle wielding only a club. Instead of being a handicap to the team, Kashmet beat indescribable amounts of♥♥♥♥♥ Not afraid of death, he charged headfirst into battle with his club. Many a foe received a cracked skull at his hand. Fear of the One Armed Rat spread through the rivaling warbands. Under the leadership of the One Armed Rat, the Vargen Front: Decimated the Cult of the Possessed, Burned Empire ship yards, and destroyed the burrows of the Black Paw Clan. Kashmet's status in the Under Empire grew and grew, but all great hero's must fall. The Vargen Front was charged with destroying the Temple of Sigmar in the name of the Horned Rat. An ambitious mission that Kashmet was honored to accept. It was during this mission that the One Armed Rat squared off against a Maiden of Sigmar. As an elite unit, Maiden's of Sigmar are avatars of the god. Normally one would not face such an impressive foe alone, but drastic times called for drastic decisions. The Vargen Front's flank had been broken. A Matriarch and lesser sisters has reached the more delicate members of the warband and Mik Varr's scouts had suffered injuries and to fall back. As the warp guards reinforced the flank, the Maiden showed her self. She approached wrapped in a holy light carrying a mighty war hammer. She had to be held off until the warband could reorganize their ranks. Kashmet met the Maiden in one on one combat. The Maiden hit hard, but Kashmet was fast. He dodged her slow, but powerful blows and lashed back over and over. Slowly he whittled her down. With gnashing teeth and cunning feats of agility, the One Armed Rat seemed to be besting the Maiden until she finally land a blow. Her mighty war hammer brutaly caved in the skull of the One Armed Rat, slaying him. Although their leader was defeated, the Vargen Front still achieved victory. The Temple Burned in the name of the One Armed Rat.That wall of text was the story of my favorite character from Mordheim: City of the Dammed. I have never cared so much about any character I have created in any game. He died a few days ago and I am still sad about it.About the game though. Mordheim is a tactical rpg like Fire Emblem or XCOM. Just like those games it is absolutely brutal. When a unit is defeated in battle, instead of dying right there, they have a chance to just be injured. It can be a light wound or a permanent injury. You can chose from 4 different warbands, Scaven, Sisters of Sigmar, Cult of the Possessed, and Empire Mercenaries. The aim of the game is to scavenge the fallen city of Mordheim for Ward Stone and sell it for profit. As your warband grows you can hire new units, level up each units stats, and buy new gear for individual units. Its a complex game with a very high learning curve. The online play is brutal because your units can still be injured, but it feels so good to get the hate mail when you kill some fools. The developers are very active and the game receives patches every two weeks. They plan on adding new warbands soon. This is without a doubt my favorite game of the year.			"

												So many bad reviews are from people who just don't understand how some of the mechanics work.TL/DR - You'll need to put in 20+ hours to understand all that's happening and really appreciate how much this game has to offer. Go to the forums and ask questions, watch some Let's Play before buying.Yes, this game is very hard at the start. Hell it doesn't so much have a difficulty curve as a difficulty wall built from the frustration, whining and grief of the people who smash against it.This game won't hold your hand. It won't tell you everything. It won't show you all the mechanics in action.It expects you to work some stuff out for yourself. A rarity nowadays in gaming.BUTIf you persist. Not go rage quitting after a couple of hours, ranting that it's crap & un-fair and the RnG is rubbish, etc you'll find a rewarding unique experience, that I think is the best Games Worshop adaptation doing the rounds.Yes, there's some DLC, but it's a small developement group that needs to generate funds, not some AAA title house. You don't need the DLC to enjoy the game anyway, you get 4 warbands with the base game, 2 more through DLC and some DLC hired swords. Wait and pick them up on sale if you enjoy the game.In summary, it's a game you really need to play for 20+ hours before you start to fully understand what's going on. But it is worth those hours, because 200+ hours into playing and there's still a lot I haven't done. Two of the original campaigns I've not started, two warbands I've not played at all.			"

												Mordheim is a great game, but also can be brutally punishing. If you don't like games that make you suffer for your mistakes (also this has a perma-ironman mode so all decisions are final, thus, no chance of save scumming), then this will not be for you. As true to the tabletop game, there is perma-death, there are injuries, and they can happen at the most unexpected of times. The start of the game is arguably one of the more difficult parts, you will have a severe lack of money, you'll lack skills and decent equipment. The AI is always matched to your overall exp level, which helps to provide some balance for the game, but early on this can be deadly, as they'll have had the chance to level up skills which you probably cannot even afford, and even if you could, you may not have days to spare to invest in skills. Over time though the game gets easier, and subsequent playthroughs have also felt easier (I started as Skaven after playing the tutorial and found it challenging, but my second playthrough was as the sisters and this was significantly easier as I knew what I was doing). The best way to play is to take your time and think, this is a turn based stratergy game after all...If you go charging in, you're probably walking out missing a limb. TL;DR: This game is meant to be challenging and punishing, if you don't like that idea, or ironman based games in general, this isn't for you. If you want a game which has a satisfying level of difficulty, but also gives you a slap to the face for making mistakes, this is perfect.			"

												I never wrote any review, I doubt I will ever again. But this game is good.Like, punishingly good, but as fair as possible when RNG is involved.Just so you can see how well the communication is handled, here is a thread : http://steamcommunity.com/app/276810/discussions/1/485622866436368619/?tscn=1447970621I doubt you'll see this kind of thread very often.The lore is respected, the rules are bent so that it's more video-gamey, but still faithful to the Table Top game, graphics are Unity Engine 5 IIRC, so not mind blowing but still classy. The game is gloomy as it should be. Your warriors die. I love it. DA is good. It's the first fantasy game in which I am compelled to play as humans.If you like turn based combat, the lore, fighting rats, women that hit like trucks, humans that care only about money and/or dark powers, go for it.If you like listening and respectful devs, go for it.If you like to support great devs that could put to shame many many many others around here, go for it.If you wife left you, go for it.I managed to sink 150+ hours in the late phase of the EA, so I guess that's saying something.

												Absolutely brutal.  Horribly tough.  Grotesque and unforgiving.You gain perks the more you play, so things will get easier as you as a player level up in addition to levelling up your dudes.If your dudes don't... get maimed, dismembered, mutilated and demoralized.  Getting money to pay your wretched crew is tight, supplying the local powers with the Wyrdstone they want is tough, and although your guys may qualify for a new minor skill, you rarely have the cash lying around.Tactically, it is harsh and unforgiving.  If is for hardcore players who will not throw their computer out when a major upgraded character is permanently killed.  It is dark and vile in all the most amazing ways.This is X-Com for the sewer dwellers.And it is absolutely riveting.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, I always enjoyed Mordheim and have been very excited at the prospect of this game. I really want to enjoy it and want to see it reach its potential. If you and a friend, who were both really into Mordheim have a couple of days free, you will get hours of enjoyment out of the game in its current state. The customisation is fairly extensive and the developers have stayed loyal to the feel of mordheim, without limiting themselves to a straight adaptation of the dice rolling version. Some players might be turned off by this, but the devs have done it right and the game feels great to play. If you like the warband managment side of things, you can currently spend hours just trying out different warbands and setups. The bad side is that playing against the AI gets really old, really quickly. In addition to the AI being really bad in its current form, the CPU warbands you fight in exibition are significatnly weaker than those made by the player. CPU warband rating is generally around 2k, while player made is ~3k. While I find little satisfaction in beating the AI in any game, such a lack is far more pronounced in this game currently. There are alot of bugs, but this of course is to be expected and does not overly concern me. I am confident the devs will work through them in time. Most notably and obvious is the camera angles - AI and camera seem worse on proceduraly generated maps, as does people being able to attack through walls - this should really be addressed before new maps are created, there are plently of maps at the moment, and good replayability due to specific parts being generated differently each time. Somewhat worrying, is the lack of an in game bug report system. I feel like this would benefit the devs no end, and really help focus their attention on getting the game into a better state. It would also soon remove many of the minor issues which can turn players off a game forever. Chaos spawn getting stuck in a doorway two games running is irritating. I know it will be fixed, but others are not so patient. This is doubly so where people have paid for the game, it is not a beta. I am recommending this game, the hours of enjoyment I have gotton so far have been worth the money, and there is the promise of many more hours to come if the Devs continue their hard work. Note however, that online games are uncommon so you really need a buddy to play against. Finally, and if everything else I have said is ignored, I really hope the Devs will pay attention to this point. The planned future updates make no reference to an online matchmaking system. Single player in this game will simply not keep anyone interested for long. Even if you extensively overhaul the AI in advance of the single player campaign, the joy of Mordheim is, and has always been playing against other players. I envisage a perpetual campaign where players are matched against other warbands based on their warband ranking which would effectively act as an ELO. Players will also need the ability to make their own private campaigns. I want to be able to take 6 friends and sit for a weekend starting from scratch. Private multiplayer campaigns and an ongoing online campaign should be given priority over any single player campaign. Even in the games current state, the ability to create your own league (aka bloodbowl) with friends would dramatically increase sales. This seems comparitavely simple compared to making loads of new maps and scripting 32 single player missions for the single player campaign, which will still be dull unless you plan on DRASTICALLY overhauling the AI.

												@@@ RECOMENDED FOR HARDCORE GAMERS ONLY@@@@I have been playing this game on the free weekend.  I have had this on my wishlist for a while now but have always held of buying.  Trying to learn the mechanics of a deep games like this in a day was always going to be a struggle and it did add to my frustration when playing, so bear that in mind. Having played a few games now I can tell you that I really like this game, but its deep and too unforgiving for me ( being a casual gamer).   The game clearly states its for hardcore players and its not joking,  this game is punishing and doesnt hold your hand.The progression system is good and I like the factions and characters, this is not X-Com in a fantasy setting, It's a turn based combat game in its own right.  The game is so frustrating.  For example; one of my charcters who had survivied three battles now had some stats to improve, so I loaded up and played again. During this battle I was ambushed by a spell user who buffed had  themselves and they hit my character three times in a row and he died without lifitng a blade ( I was ambushed, so l had lost inititive). Those are the game rules and not a fault of the game but its frustrting.  I managed to kill one of their team whilst taking major damage to two of my characters and the AI drafted in a reserve to the battle ( which i can't do as I dont have enoiugh money) so they are back to haviong four characters but I have olst my main hero toi an ambush and have two characters who are single hit kills.  The round ended with defeat with one character dying permenantly.  As this was the second defeat I didn't have enough money to heal my charaters or recuit a new one.  As you need four characters to play a round in campaign mode it was game over!    As i said its very unforgving.    I am still recomending this game as its a good game if your a hard core player, but I will not be buying it. The free weekend is still on, but i have stopped playing. If your a hard core gamer then stop reading this and press the add to cart button, for everyone else stay away until they release a normal mode or you will just end up rage quitting.   "

												If you're looking at the reviews, then this game already appeals to you on some level; maybe you enjoy turn based RPGs, games like XCOM, or board game/table tops? If so, I can't think of a reason to hesitate in picking this game up. It's punishing but it's immersive, time-absorbing and very rewarding. It's a weighty and substantial tactical offering that any fan of the genre should play really.I will add one caveat, given the trend of reviews since the sale started. If you want instant gratification and are unfamilar with how RNG works, or are unwilling to get over the tough start at the beginning, then maybe you should proceed with caution. For everyone else, enjoy :)			"

												This game is not going to be for everyone. Here’s a checklist for deciding whether or not you should buy it: You like turn based, squad level tactical games. For instance Xcom or anything from the Jagged Alliance series. You like harder games that actually have consequence. Ever play Xcom on Ironman mode? Do you like roguelikes with perma-death? This game has it. You know and like the source material, are a fan of GW’s WFB world, or played Mordheim on the tabletop, and are looking for a game that somewhat replicates that experience in a PC setting.If you can say yes to 1 and 2 then you should probably buy it, assuming you don’t hate the fantasy genre. If you say yes to all 3 then buy away, no question. It’s an interesting game. The UI needs a little work, but it’s not unplayable or broken. The models look great, and the dev team is adding more warbands. 5 are currently in the game if you buy the witch hunter dlc. The game is mostly about the single player experience with the option to take your warband into multiplayer with either consequence or no consequence depending on your choice. I have not done multiplayer yet so will refrain from commenting further on it until I have done so.			"

Early Access Review
								Looks like a great way to get into Mordheim again. And for those who didn't delve into the tabletop game before, it's a fun setting and a good game from Games Workshop (see Blood Bowl for another great title). The early access doesn't show what Mordheim really is about though, which is to have your own warband and see it develop or die a fiery death in the city. What the early access does show, however, is that the system will be intuitive, the commands simple and the player has time to think about tactics rather than interface. Overall the mood is quite thrilling, i was on my toes to see if my men would live to see another day. "

												Probably 6/10TL:DR- Great game but has lots of issues that will make you tear your hair out from frustration!I'd like to say that i really enjoy this game and it does have issues i found to be very noticeable, but i still liked my play of it. So here is my long review and two cents, i hope you enjoy reading it To begin with i'll mention the great -The game is set in the warhammer universe and the atmosphere of the game perfectly captures the chaotic and ruined hellscape of the ruined city of mordheim, you play as one of four warbands in your quest to plunder the city's riches and satiate the lust of your contractor, whom you must regularly send shipments of treasure (Wyrdstone) to or you suffer severe consequences. The city is tremendously pretty to adventure in, and by that i mean the maps are rather detailed and there are plenty of nods to warhammer lore.The game is turn based with an RNG system and rather similar to xcom in that you have your little ""Base"" where you do all sorts of things such as customisation of your henchmen, buying equipment and so on, as well as the fact that you send your troops off to battles around the city to loot and otherwise stab the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of anyone that gets in your way. The game also contains permadeath, mutations, and permanent injuries too, to spice things up a bit. But they can also result in you wishing to fire a henchman as it is largely a hindrance when your tank darksoul gets his shield arm severed.. The battles are rather intense at times, always keeping you on your toes and rarely forgiving of mistakes, and the loot is absolutely worth it if you take those risks. The game also contains a LOT of different weapons, each with their own benefits and drawbacks and so this allows you to tailor your warband to your tastes and play style, allowing for sneaky light armoured guys that run around shooting things from rooftops, heavily armoured guys that run around bonking things with big weapons, etcThe game has quite the ""narrative"" sort of system going for it as well, for example i have frequently conversed with my friends as to how their warbands are going and we will tell stories of how our henchmen only just barely made it out alive of battles with their lives intact, or how many people lost numerous limbs in one battle, or how even a single skaven went around on a luck streak beating the brains out of half an enemy warband. Other times we will mourn the passing of our level 10 henchmen that we literally spent over a hundred hours playing with and have uncountable stories with. This is further reinforced by the fact that you may rename your characters, and even add bios to them to make them feel more lifelike (and to make you cry more when they inevitably perish due to the city of the damned). Now, positives aside... there are some things that bother meOk, so mordheim is typically described as a ""hardcore"" game, and while it could be said that it certainly is, the problem is that this comes from the fact that most scenarios you are put in are actually...rather unfair. Now hear me out for a second - during all battles, even on easy as far as i know, the AI always brings more units than you, and with an increase in difficulty, the more units they bring than you. To make matters worse, their stats are also ALWAYS better than you, even on easy difficulty. And to further makes things harder, on any difficulty beyond hard (which is the second easiest difficulty ironically), Chaos Daemons show up on the map and rapetrain everything in sight. It's to the point where they either destroy your entire warband, perma killing half due to the level of♥♥♥♥♥♥and permanently injuring the other half of your warband OR the daemon turns on the AI warband and you run around looting every orifice of the map while the AI gets butchered helplessly. If by some strange chance you do manage to take out the daemon as it flails it's arms around the map relentlessly, you typically won't have enough leftover soldiers to actually damage the opposing warband, it took my entire warband to take out a frickin daemon just to have an entire imperial warband rock up immediately after with their pockets stuffed with half of the city's treasure and then proceed to jam their swords into my moist chaos buttocks. Further reinforcing how i feel about the game being unfair to a certain degree, is the campaign. The campaign missions are VERY hard. Very, very, hard. Even if i outclass the opponent's warband rating by 500 points. So how does that work? Well, the campaign levels are always unique to the mission and typically have lots of features you dont normally find in typical missions, such as opening doors, teleporters, weird♥♥♥♥♥daemon things, special abilities, even a unique character to come with you and so on. This means that campaign missions typically take 2-3 tries, at least for me. In which the first try was typically scouting around the map and inevitably having that be my downfall as i am forced to cluster all my soldiers for their own safety (So that they can pile into combat if an opponent reveals themself) and then find out that is a great way to clog up the corridors and get the reverse of what i wanted (One or two guys attacking one AI which eventually chews through them and then the next two unlucky sods step up to get their genitals torn off by the AI) And then if you fail the mission to begin with, your henchmen are typically rather heavily wounded, possibly for several in game weeks and maybe even missing some of their wargear. This means you must wait quite some time before you're ready to take on the campaign mission again, keep in mind you're still fighting AI which outclasses you always AND in campaign missions the AI never retreats AND respawns. Now, for my final complaint about the game i will detail what actually made me stop playing the game.. In the late chaos campaign, i had to assault a bridge which was owned by a mutated ogre, and his chaos possessed henchmen. This mission is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and takes the ""unfair"" to the stratosphere. I will now explain why - Your warband starts off in tunnels underneath the bridge, you must take out a skaven and his rat ogre bodyguard. Ok. not too difficult. However you must then spend several turns of yours then looting the tunnels for skaven gas bombs and then ""imbuing"" them back at your spawn with some spoopy extra ability that lets you take out the damn ogre in the mission to begin with, so this is like 5 extra minutes of tedious movement. Ok... so not as bad as it could be. But, once you eventually get your little pixelated dudes to the top of the bridge, you must loot some rags in the ruined houses and dip them in oil to convert them into oil bombs in order to hurt ANY of the extremely powerful henchmen of the ogre. This is done by throwing said oil bombs at the henchmen and then piling into combat with them. The problems are as follows- 1. The rags are in random locations2. I can almost guarantee one of the henchmen will see and pursue you 3. The oil to dip the rags in.....is next to the ogre's lair... 4. If you dont oil bomb the henchmen, they can reap your soldiers and won't stop until you bomb them and kill themThis gets worse because if you attack the henchmen when they're not debuffed from the oil bombs...then your attacks heal them instead.So you can undo like ten minutes of fighting if you fail to realise that the oil has worn off and then you accidently heal them back to full by chopping them once.The same problems go with the ogre too, but are magnified greatly. the only way to kill him and his 1000hp is to douse him in BOTH the skaven gas bombs mentioned earlier AND the oil bombs. Otherwise he just nukes your warband and you cant do anything. running out of space to rant so i gotta call it a day..haha			"

												Pros:- it is hard, but not as hard as many say it is ! I am not a strategy god, but what some write here in the reviews is just BS !If u don't suck completely that is...I lost my first warband after like 10 missions and that is okay ffs ! Since then I have adapted and I am still playing with same warband after 40 missions or so. It is still hard, but doable.- not unfair: yes, sometimes u have bad rolls, but the ai has too. And yes, I had situations that made me furious, but thats just what happens if everything is based on dice rolls... U just have to play good to balance out the odds.I think everyone in the reviews who cries about the rng has never played pen and paper rpgs. Thats just what happens !- nice art style/lore adaption. most of the units and maps look pretty cool. - customization with skills, items and visuals- the factions seem balanced (at least in general)- the controls aren't annoying or overly complex imo. some think they are, but moving around with wasd and clicking on an enemy to attack them/scrolling through abilitys isn't that complex ^^- good risk/reward economy system neutral:- the base game features 4 warbands which is enough, so u don't need the dlcs- the ui is all over the place, BUT u can just hide most of it and I like the possibilty of showing all the stats etc.cons:- sometimes the ai gets stuck with their impressive units - the ""story"" is basicly just special missions which feel different gameplay-wise, but the game wouldn't be different for me if it had no story at all. But thats just me.- no multiplayer matchmaking :/			"

								Really fun game, and this is coming from someone who does not like turn based games. The combat is fun but think of this as an interesting game of chess. The factions are a lot of fun though the persistent warbands are going to make this game worth playing match after match. Currently with the game in such early stages its hard to find matches as no one plays match after match because there is no real progression yet. Game is defintely worth buying. Though if its not on sale I would just wait until release.  "

												Down-voting this game. The devs have time and time again posted how they want the game to be HARD CORE. They have done everything they can to ensure that players who want an easier difficulty are pushed about and insulted in their community forums. They went out of their way to keep people from save-scumming their warbands. The AI isnt smarter at higher difficulties- it just gets extra HP/Damage/Stats % across the board instead. The AI warbands ratings are always based on your own warband point rating and then modified with extra points(gear/stats/weaponsetc) to make it always an uneven fight in favor of the AI. The AI doesn't have to worry about trying to collect wyrdstone to keep its warboss shipments up.. while you do. The # of enemies in a warband will always mirror the # of enemies in your warband for the AI. Basically the Devs decided that A) You can't really want a more casual experience for the game, you can't WANT it because they say so. Screw you if you dont like it. That is how they come across any time it comes up. B) The AI was never really made to do anything except charge right at you and fight to the death. Individually each AI warband member will be strong and faster and have more health than your warband members - because it always gets a % boost across the board to its stats and rating. They will also be dumb .. and just run right at you the second they see you. Even if waiting 1 round would be the difference between them hitting you 1 at a time .. or all together. No tactics. No strategy.C) Basically I dislike any company that goes out of its way to eliminate savescumming or the like from its single player campaign aspects. It isn't really, IMHO, their concern if someone wants to reload a game where something nasty happened to them while they were playing a computer AI. There is no one harmed by such a deed and their claim that it somehow harms the enjoyment of the game doesn't hold water. THEM telling YOU what you enjoy and do not enjoy is straight ridiculous.			"

												It's too bad this game makes itself so hard to recommend to anyone, since somewhere underneath this game's problems hides some interesting tactical turn-based strategy fun.Issues I've had with the game so far:- Ironman *only*. It's not possible to create and load saves.- Missions completion is very unsatisfying. The missions I've played so far have all instantly ended in victory after a morale check fail on the enemy's turn. There is no chance to prevent enemies from escaping and kill them, or to loot their goodies or to explore the map after a hidden dice roll decided the game is over. Instead, there is a message informing you that the mission is completed. Um, yay?- Inventory management during missions is madness. Did you pick up 3 pieces of armor earlier and now come across something else you want to pick up, like a piece of Wyrdstone? Too bad, because there's no way to drop or swap items. Unless you want to swap items while looting a chest, that's ok. Or unless you're trying to swap Wyrdstone for Wyrdstone, in which case the swapping UI will be shown, partly clickable but unusable. ARGH! Which brings me to:- The game has a very clunky user interface. Mordheim seems to be designed with consoles in mind; the mouse is unusable for situations it would be perfect for. Get ready to swap between actions using the Q and E buttons. Also apparently a good fit for trusty Q and E: selecting locations on a map. Why allow a left-click when you can turn selecting something into a mini-game based on random chance?- A heavy focus on random chance (yes, besides the UI), including to determine between hitting an opponent for full damage or missing entirely.As well as a bunch of small bugs as well as rules you'll need to figure out by trial-and-error, all of which would be less of a problem if the game simply offered a save function.I'll continue playing for a little while longer to see if Mordheim: City of the Damned is worth it for me after getting used to these flaws, but for others who aren't already fans of the Mordheim license I recommend caution in spending the time and money required to explore this game's mysteries. In its various forms.			"

								Finally a good board game adaptation that uses the resources it has, now being a video game. Mordheim offers pretty visuals, strategic options and an intense turn based combat (Didn't think those words could go together, did you.)While the content is still extremely limited, I'd definitely recommend keeping an eye on it especially if you are a fan of the Warhammer franchise, Fantasy or 40K.(The price tag is a bit too high for this early alpha though, it might be a good idea to wait.)Copious gameplay footage for your viewing pleasure:

 THIS GAMES GREAT, but be clear: ITS NOTHING LIKE THE TABLETOP Full Review here 


Full Review 
A Guide for Mordheim: City of the Damned
By: crimsonsun

			Due to the space limitations for reviewing games on steam I've moved my full review to a guide.		


So I've been meaning to review this game for a while and with the amount of play time I have its obvious I'm rather keen on the game but if your like me and were expecting the Tabletop game in a digital format or at least roughly so then you may be disappointed! If your not a table top player skip to the second half to this reviewDepending on your experience with the tabletop game however you may be aware that the original mechanics, progression and balancing in the core games six core War-bands was utterly messed up and that the mechanics though there very simple nature were easily exploitable while also being massively reliant on luck, as such I'd imagine that like myself you'd be less bothered that this game isn't a tabletop conversion especially since the TT is also very dated now and as a whole TT game mechanics are more fluid now days anyway so those rules needed an update. This version is easier to understand if in fact you simply forget the TT rules entirely because beyond the naming of Characteristic's this game has literally nothing in common in terms of mechanics. Anyway I'm going to break this review up into a series of segments - Mechanics and Balance, Gameplay elements/structure & Campaign - SP,  Campaign - MP, Good Point/Bad Point Summary so its easier for me to keep track of because I am somewhat of a rambling writer.Mechanics and BalanceSo I have to admit that I personally find the core combat mechanics somewhat backwards in there approach working in a very illogical fashion as far as my experience with gameplay mechanics is concerned. The basic system revolves around having a %chance of hitting a target modified by the targets resistance for that type of attack, with a (damage caused)*(damage Modifiers) reduced by armour %. But where this game is strange is the initial chance to hit is standard and fighter skill has no bearing upon this initial number.The basic principles of the system being a % based system it uses a 5% auto fail/success chance at either end of the roll but its very important to remember that the percentage modifications for skills and abilities stack way beyond 100% and they need to because of the negatives stacking. So for example a Skaven War-Band has a number Heroes that are extremely adept at dodging featuring a basic dodge chance of around 140% which still only gives a 95% success rate before modification it simply means I can have 45% of negative modifiers upon that roll before my chances get worse. With that understood I can explain what is unusual and as a result provides some very strange alterations to gameplay depending on the War-bands development.All fighters have a allowance of Action Points which are divided into two separate pools, Strategy Points (SP) and Offensive Points (OP), the number of which is based on there level and the type of fighter in question. Strategy Points are used for movement, Stances and activating abilities that provide various buffs and abilities that aren’t directly offensive. Offensive Points are used for anything that could be considered an attack as well as all Spells, some aggressive Stances and generally anything that causes damage or effects that directly affect enemy fighters. Once a fighters pool of SP & or OP is used up they are unable to act further, though it should be mentioned that most stances end a fighters action for a round and there’s no requirement to use all or any of these points, in fact its often wise to store some Offensive points to be used for counter attacks.Fighters have Nine core Characteristics divided into 3 sub groups (Mental, Physical & Martial) ranging in scores between 1-20 (Impressive’s can go up to 25) which provide each fighters combat statistics used for the various tests taken in the game. In addition Fighters also have a Wounds/Health value, a Movement Value (the distance in yards a fighter can move for each SP spent) and a Armour Value.As I mentioned the basic chances for an Action to be successful are as follows: Melee 80%, Ranged 75%, Magic 100% - Difficulty. These are then further improved by Weapon Skill for Melee and Ballistic Skill for Ranged, with some Skills adding further modifiers and Runes adding more, while Magic is only altered by a Rune and a few consumables. This provides a total % chance to make a successful attack, before being modified for the Targets Melee Resistance/Ranged Resistance + Environmental Penalties. Magic is slightly different as the casting roll is separate from the casting success taken independently. If an attack is successful the defender can utilise a active defence if it entered a relevant stance such as Dodging/Parrying (only for Melee however), which if failed the attacks checks for a critical chance which is a again separate test against the targets critical resistance based on Accuracy, Weapons, Skills and Runes (Critical hits Ignore Armour, have a damage multiplier %, cause a Stun Check and apply the open Wounds de-buff – They are extremely deadly) . Then Damage is determined based on the Weapon, Skill damage Multipliers and the attackers strength/Ballistic Skill/Intelligence for Melee/Ranged/Magic reduced by the targets Armour percentage total.There’s a huge amount going on here as is likely obvious, with a vast number of factors that allow you to influence these attacks and actions which is where this game is at its strongest, as the Development of War-band's has so much scope that even after playing 1000 hours with a single war-band there’s new builds and tactical choices I’ve yet to try with them via the games experience system. Further more fighters can be equipped with a large variety of arms and armours, as well as consumables to further alter how they perform in battle. These items all have 3 levels of quality, basic/good/master-work which provide increased performance and Good/Master-work items can be further enhanced by various runes depending on the item group.Despite this variation the game is remarkably well balanced, with the War-band's being fairly equal in terms of overall ability, though some do match up against others better as well as being more focused towards a certain tactical style (though not so much as to make playing differently not viable). Progression is well paced but requires considerable play time before you begin to approach maximum rank and the persistent injuries along with looming death keep any War-band from becoming stale even in the long term as your always needing fresh recruits for the grinder.I'm posting the entire review as a guide due to the limited number of characters I'm allowed to use. I'll link when done.			"

												Great game!Here is a warning though: The most frustrating aspect of this game can be the late-to-end game (warband level 7 - 10) where you may discover rather late that you have developed an insufficient warband. There are several slow deaths to a warband but most result in you not being able to make your diliveries on time.However if you do the following you may be okay. Just remember this game likes to teach you lessons the hard way, so instead of getting angry at the demise of a beloved warband leard from their death and move on.-THE GOLDEN RULE: Use every single day to gather wyrdstone if possible.- Keep reserve members and USE them. I cannot stress this enough. You will need alternates.- Miss as few days to gather as possible. a good roster of alternates will help this when you take a beating.- Keep and train an alternate leader. Your leader is often your most bad♥♥♥♥♥ though if you want him in the front lines you will need an alternate for his eventual healing time.-Only do the story missions when you don't have a delivery pending. Sometimes these will simply kick your♥♥♥♥♥and even with the use of alternates you may have too many wounded out after a story mission (win or lose) to do anything but heal for a few days. "

												SUMMERY:This game just truly lacks any real amount of content. This would be a great game if there was more of it, i'm not sure if they are planing on going the DLC road but there is a lot missing would have to be a heck of a DLC.GAMEPLAY:Over all the game play is spot on of for a video game version of the table top game. The AI is Dumb and that's just covered up by inflating their stats but it still feels challenging. CONTENT:It's truly the lack of content that brings this game down. There are only 4 playable factions, (there are like 10 races in Warhammer not talk mention the countless sub-factions). On top of that the factions you can play are pretty limited for characters that you can recruit into your warband. As well weapons and armor are VERY limited, there is only 1 of each type of weapon that comes in 1 of 3 tiers that only change the stats. GRAPHICS:On top of that the graphics are sub-par, not killer bad but the game is done and still some walls just don't render all the way. It just feels like a Alpha/Beta gameFINAL THOUGHTS:Game feels like an Alpha/Beta game that just got a ""Good Enough"" stamp. I cant say it enough I truly thought this game was still in alpha or beta the last i played it it just feels unfinished.			"

												Overall - I recommend you only buy if you're going to play against others, such as friends.Good - I love the idea of having a group that you control and level up over time.  You could really get a sense of achievement if it was done correctly.  The way they handled the turns and player perspective is great.  You're not really playing from overhead (though there is a map).  Instead, you see what your active player sees, which improves the immersion.Bad - Improving your gang (warband) members has no meaning.  As your gang gets stronger, the AI will automatically match them.  As your gang gets bigger, the AI will automatically match that, too.  Add a big guy to your gang - you'll be seeing those on the other teams, too.  GW games have this approach in table top games so that anyone can sit down, play a game with someone they just met, and things are balanced between the two players - even if one has a much stronger team.  In the PC games, it kills all sense of progression and meaning.  If everything around you scales to match you as you progress, you never really feel any sense of accomplishment.  This kills the game and actually only increases the penalties for failure.  Losing a strong team member and replacing them with a basic new member weakens the entire team and that individual can't really contribute.  You'll see people online trying to find workarounds - such as never levelling anyone up or having gangs split up into an experienced set and inexperienced set.  Ultimately, you'll eventually feel like there's no point, though.			"

Early Access Review
Early Access ReviewReview will be updated as game is updated and finalized upon full releaseI have to give this two scores.Warhammer Tabletop Score: 9.0/10Video Gamer Score: 6/10As a player of Warhammer 40k, and newcomer to Warhammer Fantasy, I have to say this was an amazing and thoroughly enjoyable introduction. I'm a fan of Space Hulk (The original board game, not the steam version, we're talking 1990's here), it was my introduction to Warhammer and Games Workshop. The version on steam comes highly recommended by me. This game is shaping up to be an evolution of that direction, and it's absolutely fabulous. Developers, keep up the good work, as my hat is off to you.Lets break it down, the following scores are for video gamers, not warhammer fans. If you are a warhammer fan, your excitement and imagination will already see this game is possibly one of the most immersive and enjoyable tabletop simulators in existence, with expansions that evolve elegantly into the video game format. A bit of RPGish element, and a threat of permadeth of hard-won characters adds new layers to a style of gaming we've all come to love. And the FX and animations bring the world to life, like I've only seen in it my imagination. Great Job Rogue Factor Realize, no game exists I have ever given a 10 to... yet. That is a perfect score.Graphics: 9.5/10While not completely triple A, it comes incredibly close. Atmosphere and character models are high resolution and the modular qualities of the world are hidden behind well crafted layers of detail. I expect this to improve, but even if they don't, they're far beyond anything a TBS or RTS has ever attempted before.Sound: 7/10The sound effects are admirably done. The atmospherics are up to the task of providing the player with combat awareness. I am expecting, as they progress, for more sound effects to be added, atmospherics, and other aspects along with the dynamic qualities planned. While doing the job, it doesn't make you terrified. And this is Mordheim, ask a Warhammer player, you should be terrified.Level Design: 9/10Once you're done navigating the narrow alleyways and threading your way through the rubble of a house, you'll find plenty of advantages to be had above you from sniper nests to byzantine catwalks, while below your feet lie sewers and pits with murder holes a plenty. Whether your climbing over rubble to take a shot, holding back enemy at a choke point, or slipping through ruined walls and cover to flank, the maps of Mordheim are complex, layered, balanced, and ever changing. The procedurally generated map methods they use have provided me with a puzzle at the beginning of each game as I am forced to reassess and explore. I see lots of replay value.Controls: 8/10While I heard problems about using a keyboard and mouse, I found the controls to be tight and smooth. Movement is elegant, a huge step forward from X:Com and Space Hulk, giving players unprecedented options and a fluidity of play that I've never expected in a TBS. Movement is a simple WASD affair, looking is with your mouse, and all combat is done through action selection. Elegant and intuitive.Gameplay: 6/10The game is Turn Based Strategy. Two teams called warbands, each consisting of up to ten units. Units are varied, and have classes, and these will be developed as the game goes along, allowing for many options that are not available, but should give you a wide variety of customization when it comes to your characters. Currently, warbands are pre-selected.Basically,  its an evolved game of X:Com PVP, two teams, go at it. Initiative is by character not side, and action points are a bit more complex. At the moment, there is enough to keep you playing, but online I have not seen many players yet. The AI is very enjoyable to fight, I have not gotten bored of it yet. It's on par with X:Com without any singleplayer, and a lot of shiny new aspects to add some fun.Content: 2/10A lot of content is planned, a lot simply isn't there. For you who aren't warhammer fans, you may wish to hang back until more content is coming out... however... it is worth the sale price for early access, I would easily part with the full price for this game when its finished.Optimization: 5/10LONG, LONG, LONG loading times. And the game tends to freeze, in combat, without any progress being possible until the game is restarted. It is early access. 3-4 minute waits are not uncommon at this point for me in my playing. Longer are rare, but have happened. Once the game has started, aside from the above bug, the game runs smoothly, quickly, and is quite enjoyable. The slowest aspect of this game in a multiplayer setting will most likely be waiting on the other human being to make up their mind.Final Thoughts:Get the game. If you're a video gamer and love Tactical/Strategic RTS/TBS like me? If you're a fan of tabletop games of ole, or modern video game emulations of them, or if you're a Warhammer fan. Everything in the feature list is already worked into the menus. The game looks professional, it looks promising. While Early Access is always a gamble, I already consider my 32.00 well spent. And that's what it comes down to. Is this worth the money. Will it be fun for the time you spend on it and for what you spent in cash on it? The current content is worth easily 20 dollars, 30 dollars with their most recent content update. If they keep it up, you'll be buying it on sale effectively after this point.Enjoy and see you in the streets of Mordheim.			"

Early Access Review
								I must admit that, on Early Access, starting out with one gazillion Gold, not keeping track of Xp and thus not being able to level up, buy perks, etc., the lack of options other than pure single Skirmishes, only four warbands to start with, no customizations for names, colors, whine, whine, whine..., yeah, it all takes a bit fun out of it. But hey, it's EA, even if it's 31,99 EUR I've played crappier, full version games for double than that (Hello, DOA Paradise!!!).Nevertheless, I've played the tutorials and a few games and I must say it is quite fun! I only played Mordheim and Warhammer Skirmishes seldomly as a part of WHFB and, in any case, I feel this game quite absorbing; you really feel the atmosphere.The loading times are not so dramatic (as of late September 2015), and even though my graphics card and processor are old, it runs on Fantastic Graphics Mode and HD quite smoohtly. (i7 SB -3.40Ghz - 16Gb RAM- 1GB  AMD Radeon 6800 series)It has lots of potential once it becomes Gold. All in all, quoting my band's hero...LIKE-LIKE!****Updated**** : After playing the Progression Patch Release (available since Sept 24, 2015)  I must say the game now is waaaay EVEN better. I won't even go into the ""if the game had this/if it just could do that"" whining. Sure, I'd like to have more stuff and no game is perfect but, despite the minor flaws sure to be soon polished, I didn't enjoy any Warhammer game so much since Shadow Of The Horned Rat.Two big thumbs up.

												Summary: Great concept, some redeeming qualities, fairly good campaign system.  You spend very little time being able to actually interpret problems, think, problem solve, and make decisions, and spend the vast majority of your time doing tedious things, watching lame and tedious animations, or just waiting for the A.I. to complete its turn. This game compares extremely poorly to games like XCOM, which are vastly superior in virtually every way. I was extremely excited about Mordheim. I have long been wanting someone to make a games workshop game like this. I have played almost every turn based games workshop game ever made over the years, and many others besides. This is the only GW branded game I've ever played that I didn't like.  I have played tabletop Mordheim, and it is a fantastic game (though not without some ballance issues).Pros:Excellent concept, inspired by an excellent tabletop game, with the rich back-story and setting of the Warhammer World.Some of the graphics and artwork are very good. Experience and campaign system is fairly deep and fairly well done from what I have seen so far. Gradual development (as well as deaths and injuries) to your warband are fun, and makes for addictive gameplay, very similar to games like Xcom. The scripted main story missions are a good idea, although they certainly could be better.Cons:Most things in this game take way too long, way longer than is necessary. There is a lot of waiting in between taking actions, but also a lot of unnecessary and tedious clicking, in part due to a very inefficient and counter-intuitive user-interface. Aesthetically, there are a lot of problems with the game. Aesthetics should serve gameplay, but most of the eye catching details on a given map have absolutely zero effect on gameplay, and there are way too many of them, making them very distracting. The lighting in the game also often makes it more difficult to actually see things. I also find most of the art to be VERY ugly, taking away from the generally very nice and interesting looking architecture, and often excellent character models. The grotesque or horrible looking things would have more impact if they weren’t saturating every map, forcing you to always look at them. Sometimes, less is more.There are frequent unnecessary animations for every uninteresting little action you take with your units. For example, when going into overwatch, or dodge stance, or ambush stance, an animation of your character plays which looks nothing like what they’d actually be doing if they were going into a stance to be ready to do any of those things. It wastes time, and looks stupid, but what’s worse is that these stupid animations are being constantly repeated over and over again, making it extremely annoying .Navigation is very difficult. There is no minimap, and the map design as well as camera views and lack of informative visual navigational cues makes it time consuming to switch back and forth between the map view and the third person view, to try to figure out what plan to come up with and where to move your units.It is very difficult to actually look at the terrain, either with the map view or third person view, to see where the various possible paths are, or even to figure out what the shortest distance is from one point to another. You can only climb up or down obstacles in pre-determined, arbitrary points, which are marked by ugly graphical indicators. For the most part, you can’t really climb up the sides of buildings, or on top of them (unlike with the tabletop game).The terrain itself is often counter-intuitive, with many spaces which your units could obviously fit through, which are in fact impassable for no good reason. A large gap in a wall, or between buildings, larger than a doorway, is sometimes impassable. Large, open windows, are always impassable. Very small obstacles that could easily be jumped over, are often impassable. The way deployment works is very clunky, and for some scenarios really doesn't make much sense to me. Deployment should be an important and interesting tactical challenge, and more thought should have been put into how this worked, at least making it a lot less clunky. If you’re fighting over the resources on the battlefield, why is it that you don’t get to actually keep all of those resources unless you manually pick those pieces up before the battle is over? This is extremely counter-intuitive. You should get to keep everything on the battlefield if you actually win.  What’s worse is how unnecessarily time consuming it is to actually pick these items up. The A.I. is very poor. A lot of the skills and spells aren't worth taking. You don't want a significant part of gameplay to be spending lots of time figuring out which ones aren't worth taking. Furthermore, the benefits which they give at first are so minor, that it makes choosing between them a tedious, uninteresting, and not very rewarding experience. I would rather see fewer skils, but have them be more powerful, but also have a wider variety of different useful skills, allowing for meaningful specialization and more meaningful, interesting tactical choices regarding how to best use them (or counter them) on the battlefield. Making learning skills and spells cost money (in addition to points earned through experience) doesn’t fit with the setting and makes no sense. First of all, it makes no sense that your warriors would be taking short training vacations in order to develop their skills, who the hell are you even paying anyway? The amount of gold that it costs to pay for these is by far the largest expense of your warband, whereas in reality, the largest expense would simply be the costs of paying your warriors, and also buying equipment and weapons. It is very dissatisfying to have to spend most of your hard earned gold on training skills, and to be un-able to actually afford to use most of your skill points. Experience should always be convertable into improving your warriors, you shouldn’t also need money for it, it's a needlessly frustrating mechanic.I understand that it's very difficult to make a game like this. I think the devleopers bit off a bit more than they could chew, and probably spent too much time on making artistic content, and not enough time trying to develop and polish the actual gameplay, but of course it's a lot easier to criticize than to actually do it right yourself. It's not easy to be critical of your own creation. I greatly appreciate the attempt which has been made here.I would love it if someone would make another attempt to re-make this game, with a much more intuitive interface and faster gameplay (without sacrificing tactical depth).Conclusion: Another reviewer put it very well, and far more succinctly than myself, when he said ""Successfully combines all of the worst parts of XCom with none of the good parts."" Although that's not quite 100% true, it's pretty funny and unfortunately rather accurate.			"

												If you don't want to read: 9/10 Turn-based Strategy; challenging, not punishing; multiplayer somewhat lacking.Longer version:The few Cons: Multiplayer is seriously sub-optimal for playing against strangers. Matches are hard to find, partially because there is no automatic search-function going that would find an opponent of the same strength for you, partially because one does not see if there are games to be had without staying on a screen that has that as the only function, and partially because when one creates a game one can't see if someone else makes a game you would be ready to accept.If you want Multiplayer, get 1-3 friends to challenge.Story Mode is short and minimal, and compensates by being absolutely brutal. However, normal missions are the bread and butter, story missions just the cheese&ham, so it is not all that much of a con. And Story Missions are not required at all, beyond for gaining few points to make life easier (see below).The game has the strategy common sin of being very hard for new players. However, there are mechanics in place for making starting all over easier the more one has played, and recovery within a save is quite possible. After some time, the difficulty, story missions aside, averages to medium-hard-easy: your starting troops are unreliable, in the middle the enemy may surprise you with better stuff than they began with, and at the end your experienced troops should not get easily overwhelmed. Half a con, if I may.Now for the good stuff:The game is quite balanced and has immense tactical depth.Micromanaging is possible and as deep as one wants it to be, but not required beyond the minimum awareness.The artstyle is good, while obviously not quite the same quality as AAA games. Few of us play TBS for absurdly good graphics, however, and it is beyond good enough.Single Player, despite being short on story, is varied and good enough for (looks at time played), at least 450+ hours. AI is a bit dump, however.This point can't pressed hard enough: Despite being a game made with a skeleton crew, the Devs are active on the forums and actually answer to constructive feedback beyond any and all call of duty. Nothing feels like having actual personal dialog with the devs, possibly multiple times a week.Bug reports are read and acted upon. Feedback is routinely checked. We get information about what is going to happen and often why.So as said: 9/10, bought this and both DLC:s, bought to two friends as presents and have 2 more copies to spare.PS. Do, by the way, buy the DLC:s. Cheapish, good, not gamebreaking, and makes the very start somewhat easier.			"

												To paint a picture:Somebody modded a Darkest Dungeon Scenario over XCom and disgruntled the RandomNumberGenerator. The game has been designed around a gamepad. While not an issue in combat, Menu navigation will feel clunky to mouse&keyboard. The game emulates the miniature tabletop game very faithfully. Hence character customization is leaning heavily on colors rather than shapes. Do Not Skip the Tutorials. While they are dry and boring, they explain every aspect of the game. This should spare you confusion, due to this being a tabletop ported to a video game. 4 factions come with the game, while 2 additionals are locked behind DLC (as would any future/unlikely additions) Loading a mission can take quite some time. At least, completing a mission in 20 minutes, would be on the fast side. The environment of a renaissance-style, cursed city is SPOT ON! The skill mechanic system is quite extensive, if subtle in effect. It's often a difficult balance between ""Completing Objectives""&""Looting the Area""&""Staying Alive""; leading to hard&strategical decisions. The RandomNumberGenerator will lead you into a false sense of security and then show you, how much it hates you! The city is littered with traps (or I am a trap magnet). Thankfully they have negative and positive effects. The Turnbased System, gives you all the time to devise a plan (and see it fail) and also makes the game a simple choice for livestreams.If a rather slow paced strategy game in which you get to fiddle with every move at your leisure, whilst a RNG is throwing a wrench in you gear in a cursed-city scenario, is your thing, then you may want to give Mordheim a closer look.

A nice matchmaking for multiplayer and ladder games for long term attraction like BB would be great.The dismal and dark setting from Mortheim is great and pretty implemented.

												Ok, let's see:- interesting turn-based combats? Check!- Warhammer atmosphere full of awesomeness? Check!- Numerous way to develop every member of your warband? Check- just to see him loosing his limb in the next battle? Hell yeah!- literally endless replayability with ""oh my god I should try this setup with this build"" nerdness and lots of battle scenarios/diffucullties? SureWhat you can do not like:- interface is kinda meh, you need an effort to get used to.- I spent half of hour to understand how to pick up these wyrdstones, I almost quit.- loot system - it's arbitrary and you need to understand your strategic goal is collect stones as much as your tactic situation affords you.- Also there is ONLY IRONMAN mode which is so cool for me, no way for save/load  disgrace, but someone with soft balls shouldn't even try it.Bottom line: it's wonderful turn-based squad strategy with deep customisation for every unit. Also it's Warhammer. I can't get enough of it.			"

												I'm giving this a qualified recommendation. All the criticisms in other posts are mostly on-point. You live and die by the RNG, but that's also very much like the tabletop game where a series of sub-par rolls will kill you. If living and dying by the dice isn't your thing, then stay away. The optional victory conditions are unnecessarily difficult because one side or the other usually routes before they can be fulfilled. Unlike the tabletop game, finding chests isn't easy, and in the early game isn't even all that rewarding. The graphics are subpar for a game where the meat of the experience takes place in first-person, and animations are lack-luster at best to the point of reminding of the Seinfeld episode where Raquel Welch was revealed to walk without moving her arms. That said, it's a reasonably accurate translation of the boardgame, and it is fun. When the game is on sale for 60% off, it's worth the money for tbs fans looking for something a little different. At full price ($39.99 at the time of this writing) it's only worth it for dedicated fans of the original tabletop game.Also, unlike the base game, the dlc is worth the asking price, sale or no.			"

												It was nice while it lasted. I was totally sold at first and spent hours designing and customizing my warbands and I had a blast playing those first few dozen games. For awhile I was taken back to the good ol' days of the tabletop version and was looking forward to many more hours of enjoyment. Well the honeymoon is over.Heavily bias RNG strikes again ruining yet another promising game. The trend these days is to kick a game out the door and artificially inflate its AI ""difficulty"" by throwing in a terribly unbalanced random aspect. This isn't fun and it's not engaging, it's simply frustrating and makes me want to uninstall the game.Missing dozens of point blank shots with a 80% chance of hitting, the npc AI slamming into your 60% parry/dodge warband members while landing strings of criticals and an endless procession of career ending injuries that pile up even if your character isn't taken out of action. All this could be yours and more!Games Workshop's IP has been dragged through the gutter for years with very few highlights (Dawn of War being the only reasonable exception) and this is just another game in a long line of products with so much potential that is ultimately a let down. I think I've learned my lesson and will be giving future GW titles a solid pass.			"

												Does it ever happen to you to start a game just to see what its like and then spend the next 24 hours thinking of nothing else, planning strategies in your head and asking yourself at work or while at the restaurant - how will you ever manage to send that shipment, will you have to start a new warband just because of that one mistake... Well, it does not happen often to me, and yes, this is that game.			"

Product received for free
												Behind the wall of shortcomings resides a tactical and thrilling gameplay so addictive that it kept me hooked for hours, even after my dragged on failed attempt with my first warband. As an enthusiast of Warhammer 40k, I've never fully realized how much I enjoy the Fantasy setting and Mordheim helped me see this.                For all the hours I've put into this game I’m still not sure if I can recommend it. Its price tag is getting dangerously close to that of AAA titles, but without the high production value that comes with this type of game. Mordheim is visibly crippled by its lack of production value at every step. It’s clunky, lacking unique content and in desperate need of an AI that can keep up. Overcoming all these issues can be hard. In return it can easily offer dozens of hours of challenging battles, tactical ingenuity and detailed characters development. Factoring in the multiplayer which provides the most intense experience and the replay value that comes with this type of games and there is already a lot of value in Mordheim: City of the Damned.                For the fans of the tabletop games it is great to see a new game in their favorite universe. The fans of tactical turn based games will find it as a good distraction until XCOM 2 comes out. And for the rest of the players it is probably safer to wait for a sale. As for me, it’s an enjoyable game with extremely high potential delivered in a tin crackling shell that constantly undermines Mordheim's best qualities.Pros:+ Great setting+ Complex character development+ Tactical combat+ Addictive+ Unforgiving+ Atmospheric+ Stays true to the universe and lore+ The multiple campaigns add up to the replay value Cons:- Average production value- Mouse support isn’t fully implemented- The battle UI is hard to navigate and has some issues- Lacks visual variety- Long loading screens (at launch)- AI can be awkwardly dumb- Various bugsRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/12/mordheim-city-of-damned-review.html "

												Being a veteran from tabletop Mordheim I just had to try this game. Like most games I feel this game has its strong points, oddities and areas with room for improvement.Yay!- I like the graphics and the field of view when you run around the city with your warriors, at no time did I get odd camera angles or lost sight of my warrior.- I like the movement system and the option to retrace your steps when you realise you ran the wrong way (This ofcourse is not possible if you get ambushed/ step in a trap/ pick up loot.)- Once loading is finished the missions are smooth going.- I like the campaign system. The missions in itsself arent too varied but every battle is hugely differant anyways.- customization is quite nice. Some more wouldnt have hurt at all but you can give your warriors fairly uniqye appearances. I like it you can see on a model which sort of armor it wears and what weapons it holds.Undecided:- Some more information would be nice at times. The tutorial is quite informative but a little more explaination about how combat works would have been apprechiated.- Loading times. Pretty darn long. I guess this is where refills and bathroom breaks come in. Mitigated by the lack of loading once a mission starts.- Difficulty settings: I like it when I can decide myself at what difficulty I play. Yes, you can (ussaully) decide to stick to 'normal' missions but it'd be fun too if you once in a while were the stronger gang on paper yourself.- I am not in too far so maybe this still is to come but I'd be neat if there were engagements with more then 2 gangs involved. 2 weaker gangs ganging up on a stronger gang? Yes please.Nay-Only four types of gangs! I realise the studio is small and adding new gangs costs a lot of time but I for one wouldn't mind paying if some gangs were added as dlc's. Gimme orcs! Undead! Elves! Dwarves!-All games being Ironman can be heart rending when you lose a valued member of your gang. Not seeing what your taking out members of other gangs results in is a bit dull. Why can't member be captured?? I'd be nice to have some sort of league idea where 64 gangs slug it in Mordheim in a Blood Bowl tournament style. Then it's fun to cripple an opposing warband.Despite some nays I still think all in all the game is quite worth the bucks you pay for it. If you like turnbased strategy and warhammer fantasy then Mordheim is defenitely a game you should try.			"

Early Access Review
								It is painstakingly faithful to Mordheim's aesthetics, as a result - it looks excellent. The game's mechanics have certainly captured the 'feel' of playing Mordheim perfectly. (I spent many hours playing it growing up.) It is however, as has been made clear, incomplete. Only two warbands are currently playable and only two more are confirmed. There is currently maybe 10-15 hours gameplay and that's pushing it. I'm really, really excited as to where this game could go; and I really believe it has the makings of a huge success. I say this guardedly though. They've been very tight-lipped as to exactly what features are to be expected in the future and I can't help but feel we'll be waiting an incredibly long time for a game that will really hold our attention. Currently the only really playable feature is playing one of two warbands (Skaven or Human Mercenaries) in a pretty easy match whilst you fight against a warband with half your numbers. The maps are interesting, the gameplay rewarding. But as of now - there's no reason to pick this up over say, X-Com; unless you're purely playing for the Games Workshop IP.  It's expensive for what it is, but I consider it an investment into a really solid game so far. I'm very excited as to where this goes in the future. Don't disappoint us Mordheim!			"

Early Access Review
								Being a fan of the table top mini game, when I saw early access was out I jumped right in. Im a bit disappointed though. I think in an attempt to jazz up the interface Rogue Factor did this third person view and circles stuff. Its a nice attempt to make things a bit more interesting but I dont really think it works with a game like this. Its too complex in its current form, it feels clunky. I realize that its still in early access, but I think if they just used a traditional point and click it would have made things much more simple. I hope that they realize this too - I think this game has tons of potential but the movement system is too clunky for me. I think they could still have their areas of control, and zones, and stuff with a hex, or square based system. The game would be closer to its roots. Thats just what I think .Its a great game, good animation, and tons of potential. I think they have to simplify their movement system, and their interface. We'll see how it develops.			"

Early Access Review
								Fans of Mordheim stop reading this review and go buy it. It is, essentially, a perfect reproduction of the tabletop game. (once all warband maintenance is in properly over the next few weeks it will literally be perfect)For those of you who didn't play the tabletop game.The detail and love that has been invested in this game should be readily apparent from the 10 minute gameplay trailer above. However its so much more than that. The system is easy to learn, and yet has the kind of strategic depth that will keep Turn based Tactical players coming back for more and looking further and further into the little numbers that control the world.Flanking/Charging/Parrying/Dodging, reloading ranged weapons, jumping over gaps and off ledges. All make the genius of how they have you use your Strategy points (movement) within a series of rings marking where you will use a point up via movement. Go down some stairs and the lines readjust as you move making it always clear where and WHEN you will use one.Overwatch/Ambushes Keep moving players on their toes and make scouting important.And yet the game/battles/skirmishes themselves play out fast enough that no individual game will take longer than an hour and most will be over LONG before that. Especially in the early days of your Warbands when there arent maximum members.Theres a lot to love here from a gamers perspective. Turn Based Tactical games are easy to turn into ""Turn Based Repeat every other battle you have ever had here"" This one has enough fresh content with random maps that you can run even the 2 preset warbands in the first early access release at each other again and again and it will not play out the same way.If the final product (due for release Q1 next year) continues in this vein and from all the information i have found i see no reason why it shouldnt. It will be 10/10 from me.For now, 10/10 for the content provided. (its Alpha so i expected more bugs than i saw, theres literally only one that ive encountered in 7 games. and it wasnt game ending)			"

												Whoever decided to allow free weekend access to Mordheim needs a good smack, because this seems to be specifically designed to make your first several hours' play as frustrating and annoying as possible. It may well be that once you get into hours 10-20 it gets really enjoyable, but that's unlikely to happen in one free weekend, and the only people who are likely to power through a dozen or so hours of screen-punching are people who have paid full price and are invested in the game. Anyone given a few hours to try it out is likely to come away with the impression that the last thing they want to do is play any more of that annoying nightmare.It comes down to design, which has presumably been fixed in order to ramp up difficulty and make the game more ""hard core"". The trouble is, whilst most gamers enjoy a tough challenge, what really pisses us off are stupid/illogical game mechanics that have obviously been introduced simply to make success harder. Looting, mission objectives and combat mechanics all conspire to make it impossible to get a good result from a mission. Here's why:You take control of a warband of your chosen faction, a bunch of 5 newbie toons who, in good RPG tradition, you expect to start levelling up and improving. The leader of your faction puts in an order for wyrdstones, and you need to get X stones within Y days or you'll fail: 4 fails and it's game over. You enter Mordheim seeking wyrdstones and other loot. So far, so good. At the start of a mission you see there are, for example, 20 wyrdstones and 15 scavenging points around the city, so you examine the map and think OK, I'll send a couple of guys this way, another couple over there, maybe one to hang back and guard our cart.First off, movement is incredibly slow. It may take you 2 or 3 turns to reach that pile of wyrdstones. Secondly, your inventory is ridiculously tiny - 3 items total?? Forget about carrying potions or buffs! Of course, you can dump stuff in your cart then head back out, but that takes twice the time. And if you get to the stones and there are 4+, you're going to need 2 people (40% of your entire force) or 2 trips (4-6 turns, which is an eternity) to get them.None of which would be a problem if time wasn't such a huge issue, but it is because of how combat works. Within 2 rounds, maybe 3 at most, you're going to run into the opposition. Now, being outnumbered is a real problem in Mordheim, because if you are you have to face an ""All Alone"" roll every turn, and if you fail you flee. And you can very easily get outnumbered because as soon as one of the opposing warband engages one of your guys, EVERY OTHER ENEMY RUSHES IN TO JOIN THE FIGHT. Fights aren't quick, one-shot affairs either, it'll take your newbs several turns to eliminate any enemy, and in those turns all his mates arrive. If you don't immediately start rushing all your own men to the fight, your guys are going to get overwhelmed and killed or forced to flee.What this all boils down to is this: you may think you have a bit of time to explore, wander round collecting the stuff you need to not fail and end the game, but in actual fact what happens is that within about 2 turns a fight will start, and you then have to rush all your men to fight all the enemies and see who wins. No exploration, no gathering, no tactics, just a quick rush into an all-out brawl.And even that wouldn't necessarily be too bad if you could then get back to collecting the very stones you'd come to collect (assuming you won the fight), but no! Once you've won the fight, it's mission over! What do you mean, you didn't explore any scavenge points? What do you mean you didn't go and pick up that pile of stones 20 yards away? It doesn't matter! The last enemy's dead, so poof, it's back to base IMMEDIATELY! And yes, leave all that gear and loot that's LITERALLY RIGHT AT YOUR FEET!It's so frustrating, because you can see how this could have been such a great game, but sadly the devs have decided that they need to make this game ""hard core"", so they've just introduced really stupid and illogical mechanics to achieve that regardless of how much that pisses players off. I'd love to explore Mordheim, roaming around in what looks like a fascinating setting, but in reality all that happens is that you and the enemy locate each other pretty quickly, an all-in melee ensues, and at the end the mission's over. They may as well just have made this an arena brawler. Shame.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is written, based on the first step in early access, and a lot of it is based on what the developers are promising and hopefully deliver,This game have so much potential. It is a tactical game that will generate user-stories based on skirmishes with other players, simply because it is so immersive.The team have created a game that is very true to the concept of the table top game, with the right amount of changes to the rule set to be amazing for the video game scene.I'm really excited and can not wait for all the features to be implemented.But I have also been waiting  for a long time for the Mordheim game being adapted to an online game.For those that are not that familiar with Warhammer and/or Mordheim, no doubt, you should keep an eye with this game, if you are in to strategy games and games where you develop your character or team over time....but you should wait, until a few more steps have been implemented.As for right now, there is not that much to do in the game.- You can go through the tutorial, that still are missing some features- You can play against an easy CPU (your teams strength is about twice as good as the CPU's team)There is still some problems connecting with other players, but it is promised that it will be worked on and fixed soon.Again, this game is most likely to become awesome, but it is still a very barebone product.UPDATE AFTER 1ST PATCH;Connection issues to other players seem to have been fixed. Been able to load the last five games. This is a big improvement.Though, that patch have added some issues with moving up and down stairs, which sometimes cage your characters.This is still an improvement, as you now can test the game against other players, though still with a set warband. Next content update, should add some options to customize your warband.			"

												I want to like this game. Actually, I want to love this game. But it is too strategically limited, too slow, and just too random. Let me explain...On the plus side, the game evokes the Warhammer feel very well, and the ruined city idea means the developers have been able to create environments which are tactically interesting without seeming contrived. So I keep wanting play it - to dive into the evocative ruins, in a brutal, scrappy series of skirmishes where the risk of permadeath gives extra weight to every decision. That’s really appealing!But....First off, as lots of peoples' reviews have noted, as a player you are often victim of the random number generator. And this can be spectacularly random. (As an extreme example, consider that if you cast a spell there is a random chance of something bad happening; one of those things is that the character can lose all his hitpoints; if a character loses all his hitpoints, there is a random chance of permanent death. So, on one occasion I had my fully-healthy leader lose all his hit points as a random result of casting a healing spell – and I could have lost him entirely. Seriously.) Now, some will say ""ah but Warhammer is always strongly random."" And that’s true. But that doesn't change the problem that there is a basic disjointedness between actions and consequences - if your main character can be killed because you decide to cast a healing spell, or if a glass-canon or scout-type character can be killed because a random set-up put him/her right next to a pack of enemies, this is not rewarding or fun. It's just dis-empowering.Secondly, this game is slow. Really, really slow. You wait while each enemy warrior moves even if you can't see him/her. The user interface takes a little while to go through, so your own turns aren’t uick. And then at the end of each turn you even have to sit through a message saying that the game is processing a move for each of the already dead enemies. So, even if you take a direct approach to hunting out your enemies it can take a while to finish a mission. And if you decide to try hit-and-run tactics, or lay traps and goad the enemy, etc., then it takes even longer. (The last mission I played it took 3 hours just to kill off four enemy mooks.) And of course because it is so slow you often won't bother trying different tactics - it's much less frustrating to just use a direct approach.And the same problem of pacing that bedevils the tactical game also impacts the strategic arc. Upgrades to troops are earned slowly, and don't often seem to have much real impact. A typical upgrade might give you a bonus of a few percent to some skill or other. (So, after X hours of grinding a character, what do I have to show for it? +4% to something or other? Hmm.)This leads to the third point - that there just isn't much room for experimenting with different strategies. After 20 hours my main warband was basically doing the same stuff it was doing at the outset, but with slightly higher stats. Nor is my strategy even really one I've chosen - it's just the strategy that seems to work best across all warbands. (I tried developing a hit-and-run style, I tried a missile-weapon-based warband that lured enemies into murder zones... nope, those strategies just aren't as viable as what appears to be the expected strategy.) And trying different warbands opened up no apparent strategic options, as each band (with a few minor variations, like the Sisters not having many missile troops) basically behaves the same way. By comparison, in the XCOM or Shadowrun games, as examples, having different combinations of characters allows you to approach missions in very different ways, and as the characters level up this opens up new playing styles and tactical options; in Mordheim, however, the slowly granted bonuses are really just allowing the characters to do the same stuff that they did before (perhaps with a little more specialization).So, I really want to love this game. I enjoy the feeling of the cities, and am enticed by the idea of delving into the chaos-riddled ruins. But unless you're a die-hard Warhammer fan you may find that there is only so much fun to be had from ploddingly repeating the same tactics over and over and hoping that the random number generator doesn't do anything too crazy.

												Great game! It's challenging and rewarding . . . sometimes pain. You really want your warband members to survive, since they can suffer permanent injuries or permanent death. Warbands can be customized and you can fight other players online. I spent over 300 hours in this game and I'm still not done, because the campaigns are huge.I just hope there will be more warbands in future, since the warhammer universe has so many awesome races. I think the game needs orcs and dwarves, but the 4 existing warbands are still fun to play. The DLC characters added to the game, are good to improve your warband and give you even more ways to make an unique warband.			"

												I really want to like this game... its got loads of positive qualities (the atmosphere, the fact that it's bloody MORDHEIM, and the the overall gameplay). However, there are some aspects that basically just kill it. Secondary objectives, and the wyrdstone loot (which is entirely necessary for you to get) are scattered throughout the map, and require you to pick it up, with a terrible inventory system which limits 3 pieces of loot per character. Also, there's basically no way to keep exploring/looting once combat is initiated, unless you're willing to sacrifice valuable members of your warband as cannon fodder to allow the rest of your guys to go scavenging around for stuff. Not to mention, any stuff looted by your warband members that are downed during a battle is lost... and there's no way to keep looking around after a battle is over. Even if you are winning, these battles can just end abruptly with a rout failure, making you lose any further stuff you might have gained. Also, I wish there was more customizability for your warband, more than one type of hero, etc, and maybe a couple more customizability options for each character type. But alas, its a great plan, and I hope it gets better... but as of now, I can't recommend it.			"

												This is an excellent port from the tabletop version of the game.  As an avid Mordheim player for the better part of two decades, it was great to finally have a platform version that does not suck something fierce.  My only gripe is that all of the original warbands from the book are not here.  Two Mercenary factions are missing and the Undead are completely gone.  I am looking forward to the prospect of other warbands being included like the Chaos Dwarf Slavers, Night Elves, and the Clan Skyre for the Skaven.  Also different map scenarios like Rush for the Treasure that were expansions in the Town Crier for the tabletop version.  These additions would make Mordheim complete for me.			"

												With over 60 hours on record, I give this game a huge thumbs up.  All of the complaints about hit percentages are unfounded.  I belive the percent chance to hit shown does not calculate the doge or parry chance of the enemy.  Therefore for example, a 90% hit chance will hit 9 times out of 10, unless the enemy dodges or parries.  I think the balance is quite challenging.    Finally a game that does not just let the player walk thru with ease.  This challenge has kept me interested for many hours.			"

												I saw it, I bought it, I love it.A good game for people like me that have limited multitasking skills and dislike managing massive armies.Tactical slow phased action with a nice (but steep) learning curve, filled with information that might scare some people off, but after taking some time to read its actually somewhat easy to understand.Immersive character progression and creation and after roughly 5 hours I have a newbie-leader, one experienced Hero with one eye, maimed hand and amnesia, a twitchy warrior and one with head trauma.The only downside to this game I have noticed so far is that the UI in combat can be somewhat of a hassle.Too many ""hidden"" menus with odd shortcuts. I would rather have the option to have some menus, like the available actions in combat to be always present to either side or the bottom of the screen.21/21 Golfballs.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, its early access, so lets hope it will be improved. Gameplay: nice implementation of the miniature game, however, orientation on the battlefield is little bit limited, due the insufficient mapAtmosphere, graphics: great but colors are too desaturated. Do not expect, that the game looks like the screenshots in the setam store. The ingame scenes are allmost black and white (i do play on highest gfx settings)User interface: Terrible, the game is designed for consoles, the PC version is implementing this 1:1 this needs polishing, i hope, this will be really improvedI think, there is a lot of potential, but it needs lot of work, at this stage, i would not recommend this (as steam does not have a ""neutral thumb"", which is something i would choose)			"

												Great game, very addictive. You get strangely attached to the members of your warband and when one dies it's gutting! I've only played as Chaos so far and I have to say that the comments about the mutations making them unplayable are dumb. Just adapt to them or hire another Hero and try again. The game loses some of it's appeal when everyone is at max level anyway. The RNG can be frustrating at times but that's just the nature of it. I've read a few of the negative reviews and they seem to either be people who don't understand how to take advantage of the poor enemy AI, board game players with lofty expectations or are sufferers of RNG PTSD. The only things I would really like to see are more customisation choices and more warbands to choose from.Overall 8/10 and fun enough to have prompted me to write my first review.			"

												This game is a sad joke to anyone who knows the first things about statistics.  the percentages it shows for chance to hit and dodge or parry are complete lies.  a 90% chance to do something will fail 70% of the time on most ai opponents.  the ai gets +10 damage as if they had blue weapons from the start of the game.  the only way you win anything is by 3v1-ing crap before the rest of the enemy team shows up.  if the show up before then, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ automatic loss.  (this is on normal missions, forget doing hard, or brutal, the bonuses are so huge at that point if you don't get perfect deployment and perfect luck you lose every time.  this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from a mathematical standpoint and a frustrating piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.  it might be fun for 5 mins but when you realise that everything you do is automatically going to result in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths of your characters due to the super-powered ai who can charge and ambush atomatically every time because your ranges are the same and their actions auto trigger, you won't want to play this garbage any more.  fix your frucking game.edit:  2 months later, still broken as ♥♥♥♥.  a match that should have ended went on for 3 more turns with the ai route check succeeding 3 times and a marauder w/ a 2h sword 1v3ing through 3 max health opponents dodging 13 consecutive 80%+ attacks.  the math behind this game is just ♥♥♥♥ing broken.  not worth any money			"

												I'd give this game a neutral review but since Steam only allow for a thumbs up or thumbs down, ill have to lean towards negative. But only for one main reason: this game is not Mordheim.If you have ever played tabletop Mordheim and were expecting this to be a direct translation, you'll be disappointed. In and of it self this game is an ok game for its genre, it's not a great game though. That's not to bash Rouge factor. Like tabletop Mordheim, Rouge Factor probably didnt get a lot of funding from Games Workshop. TT Mordheim had simple skirmish combat system that made for great quick battles. And Half the fun of the game was the awesome leveling system they used. It was a very casual friendly game. TT wasnt perfect, and had some issues, but with a few house rules it was a great system. Instead of making a translation from TT, Rouge factor (or GW) decided to make their own system based of the Mordhiem setting. Maybe they didnt think that space hulk or blood bowl sold enough (those games where more of a direct translation). The game mechanic system that rouge factor made seems overcomplicated for what it does, half my play time was spent trying to figure the system out. Where in tabletop you could level up almost every battle. In this game there is a lot more grind involved. When you level up in this game, a lot of the time its hard to notice any improvement. There doesnt seem to be a whole lot of game variations so it can get repetitive fairly quick.Pros: This city visuals are amazing. The cities really have the look and feel of Mordheim. Unless you had tons of dosh, and/or time and skill. You would not be able to get that on tabletop.The Developers seem to actually read and respond on the forums far more than most game Devs do. So props for that.Cons:Way too much grind in this game. Its usually not a good thing if game develops substitute grind in place of content.City movement is very restrictive and constrained. You can only climb/jump in certain spots, even though that ledge looks just as good as this one. Many times you'll find an area that looks like you can move no problem, too bad its impassable. Rotting paper thin door blocking your way? Nope cant kick it down. Trying to get into a locked “cell”(that only has two walled sides and no roof, with a grated door skaven could easily climb over) and you dont have a key? Too bad.Lack of visual character customization. Im guessing that they had plans for lots of customization, but ran out of time and/or money. Some units have a few options, most have very little.Too much focus on gathering wyrdstone during the battle. In TT this was mostly handled in the post battle sequence. It just gets too repetitive in this game. If they streamlined the system of picking it up, it would be much better.I can appreciate and understand why the developers made their own game mechanic system instead of making a more direct translation from tabletop. But, to honest I much prefer the original.			"

												Good concept but poor execution. Unpolished. Long loading times are inconvenient but turns take too long to complete as well. Lack of soldier customization other than outfit colors. Grind required to get to the good bits.On the plus side, hilarity ensues when soldiers lose an arm or become insane. Combat is good enough. Will probably appeal to Warhammer fans and/or fans of tabletop.			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent rendition (so far!) of a classic table-top game.  While there are some rule/play changes I think they might actually serve to enhance the game.   Such as strategic points (how many actions a toon can do) to the negation of the W (wounds) characteristic , and instead, a pool of hit points.  Saw something about Idols,  and that did seem a little hokey.Music and atmospheric effects are right on.  Graphics ditto.  The even have Morslieb correct.  (That green little moon).Read a comment about Ranged troops being over-powered.  In table-top, where one shot takes out a warrior, and ranged troops always in hard cover, they were just as dominant.Not enough here for yet for someone who is new to Mordheim.  Once warband experience and equipment is functional, then its a hell ya. "

												Mordheim is definitely worthwhile despite what negative reviews it might have. Missions will begin to take on a repetitive nature, but the random mission generator has kept every single encounter fresh. Party and character progress really hooked me from the beginning. It's only when you max out your heroes and complete the story quests that the game leaves nothing left to offer. By that time though, you've put in 100 hours like me.The game forces iron man mode on you and there are ways to mitigate the danger that your party ever gets into, even if a mission ends up being a slaughterhouse. If you avoid the most difficult missions, the game can actually be quite easy. This can be due in part to the AI not being as good as it should be (the worst being that opponents will swap between targets if they're surrounded instead on focusing on the one with the lowest HP and impressives often get stuck on the geometry of the map). I found it no trouble to replace warriors that died or were too wounded to be useful because of the system that allows you to hire a rotating list of leveled units.Overall, it's got engaging combat, factions with unique personalities, and gameplay that hooked me. I personally don't think the DLC is worth it, but if you're the type that loves the game so much that you'll start a new warband once maxing your main, then I see the appeal.			"

								After playing all the Tutorial missions and a skirmish game i can recommend this game.  What we have here is a solid set of core game mechanics and two warbands to try said mechanics out. The devs promise more Mordheim eskqe soon along with Warband management, a feature that anyone who played the GW version of the game wants.This game has great potential and i look forward to seeing what happens next.

Early Access Review
								I played the Mordheim 😊 at steam all week!  Humans are a little better than the Skaven(ses) 😊.  I think it is because the Reiklander heroes do melee damage higher than the listed amount on the screen and the Ogre is a boss, but the ogre is well an ogre..  The 2 Warp Guard (used to be black skaven) feel a bit weak too.  The one listed “black skaven” is pretty good though with claws and strength.. The rat ogre started out weak for a rat ogre but he has improved in damage and the ogre has reduced a little but is still the biggest damage dealer.. he can roll a good critical hit 7% of the time that will floor the rat ogre in one of 2 swings with a great hammer.. They could fix it with a little more move on the skaven to improve the swarm feel of the troops but it is still prerelease and no saved game yet..  They need to at least list the damage of the humans correctly.. Man they have the buildings too.  And fountains of fishes with blood and bubbles..  Sewers galore and chaos eyes are every were..  Its not ready for standard gamers yet.. 😊  its only the 2nd week of early release and they have 18 more to go.. It seems better than blood bowl was to start but you have to keep verifying the game code after every game.. then there is the disconnects, campaign advancement, adding Possessed, adding Sisters, better A.I., and bot losses that need to get fixed but I am pretty sure they will hammer that stuff out with time..

												This game is amazing and will either make you hate it or love it!To begin with it will be hard, but as you progress and learn how the game works (do the tutorials and watch some gameplay if you want your warband to live) you will start appreciating the difficulty of the game.If you want to check out some gameplay videos, take a look at my YouTube Channel: youtube.com/GamekNightPlays as I cover this game vigorusly!-------------------------------------------Pros:High replayability - it is almost impossible to have two missions that are the same with the randomized maps and variation in the warbands. There are also a ton of different ways you can skill up your warriors making different builds that suit your playstyle.Exciting gameplay - you will find yourself in situations where you need to make difficult descisions and that descision will mean life or death of your warriors.Great atmosphere - The city really feels like Mordheim, just beware of traps and daemons ;)Story missions - if you want to explore the Dramatis Persona's stories you can do that. They are well written with voice acting to accompany them and brings a completely new aspect to the regular missions that you face. Just be aware that these missions are usually tougher and you should prepare accordingly!------------------------------------Cons:I'm not oblivious to the problems that the game has, so here are a couple of things. Sometimes the AI will act really weird or get stuck on things - which is due to horrible pathing issues. Sometimes this saves the life of your warband and can feel a bit like cheating.The graphics are not the prettiest - but then again nor is life in Mordheim. I feel that more work could have gone into the models to make them look truly amazing.PvP is hard to setup with the lack of a matchmaking system - but there are steam groups that are dedicated to bringing people together to setup matches, just like in the TT.-------------------------------------------Remember going into this that it is a video game adaptation - not a direct port - of the tabletop game. This means that some things are different, will feel different - but I asure you that this is Mordheim in it's finest form.Thanks for reading buddy - I hope you will find your way into MordheimHave a wonderful Game kNight!youtube.com/GamekNightPlays "

Early Access Review
								Mordheim: City of the Damned  is a  Turn-Based Strategy Game that´s based on the Rules of the Games Workshop Tabletop Game Mordheim. Mordheim: CotD offers the Player the possibility to explore the ruined City of Mordheim with his Warband to scavenge for wyrdstone and treasure and  of course to battle rival warbands. Mordheim offers a single player mode as well as a multiplayer mode. The game looks fantastic and can be both great fun and highly frustrating due to its Games Workshop typical randomness.  The tactical fights in Mordheim are, especially during the first half dozen or so fights, challenging, not so much because of the brilliant AI, but in Hard, Brutal or even Deadly Maps the AI Units get buffed to the point where unskilled warbands are very likely to perish. The more strategic side of the game (levelling your warband and picking the right skills) is fun and rewarding, but due to the lack of a save game option your faults will be permant and that might proof to be very frustrating for players new to Mordheim.  The developer decided to make the game a permanent ""hard-core"" mode, meaning there is only autosave and closing the game during a battle (or the game crashing) will leave your warband in a devastated condition (wounded, missing equipment,probably even dead).So IF you allready play the Tabletop game and like it: buy Mordheim:Cotd. But as for now I wouldn´t recommend Mordheim: CotD to casual gamers because of the formentioned ""Perma Hard-Core Mode"", the game might proof to be to frustrating and time consuming to build up even your first warband.

												I really wanted to recommend this game, because it does so many things so well.  However, the things it does badly are ruin-your-day badly things that turn me off the entire experience.The theme, the graphics, sound, and warband levelling? Brilliant.  Takes me back to my childhood when the tabletop game was released.  It's everything I could've wanted.  Warband options and customization I hadn't expected, and the campaign mode's persistent unlock system - across all your failed games - is a really nice touch. However... None of that awesomeness is worth enduring:  worse-than-XCOM unfair RNG (seriously, even XCOM's non-insane difficulties have a hidden adjustment to save you from complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t failing every 90% chance you come across until you lose) impenetrable/clumsy UI flat-out nonsensical pathing restrictions unintuive-at-best-nonsensical-at-worst rules restrictions (""I know you just found a valuable cluster of wyrdstone, but we can't let you drop that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny you found to free up some inventory room to go grab it""),  complete failure to communicate critical mechanics in-game in a reliably consistent way (""I could defend on another turn... why can't I now?!"")   Straight-up, no excuses, stupid mechanics - like having to keep your warband dancing around your nearly-finished opponent in terror that you might accidentally win too quickly, leaving all the loot uncollected, and all the secondary objectives failed.  WHAT KIND OF IDIOT DESIGNER PUNISHES YOU FOR WINNING TOO QUICKLY?Even mouse-over tooltips are missing.  How hard is it to have mouse-over tooltips for stats so you actually know what that symbol means without having to go read the manual?The game had me thinking, ""That's so awesome,"" on a regular basis, but on the balance of it, it had me snarling, ""THAT'S SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T,"" far more often.  And not in the fun way.  Whether it's your supposedly-nimble ratmen blocked off from a critical route by an ankle-high obstacle, failing every high-percentage roll you make while the enemy doesn't seem to suffer the same problem, or a UI that makes you shift through several different menus just to equip your team with some gear, the negatives have so much of an impact that all the positives stop being enticing enough to encourage me to persevere through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The UI and its problems are probably the most unforgivable, especially when you can see how elegantly other games  can do it.  I want to fight other warbands, not fight the UI.			"

												Preface; Don't trust the store page screenshots, fewer than half are actual screenshots of the game and the game has so much asset overuse and OTT particle effects that it runs like garbage all the time - This is on an i7 skylake with a £550 GFX card.Good points:-+ Great voice acting+ Concise UI (but it's scattered across multiple panes)+ Great story+ Truthful to the lore+ Interesting characters+ Good tutorialBad points (oh here we go…):-- Imbalanced gameplay- Little strategy (as a result of the pseudo random generator and unbalanced gameplay)- Grinding is the only way to play- Hard because it has a lot to live up to, not because it is- Endlessly punishing and unfair progression- UI has been seperated into windows, making it difficult to see all the information you need as you have to slam your ctrl and alt keys almost constantly to get information you need- Exceptionally dumb AI- Clippy terrain- Toxic community- Zero character development- Badly designed singleplayer- Lacklustre multiplayer (1v1 only)- Zero multiplayer incentive- A tiny collection of units with only 4 factions, a fraction of the number in the orginal game- Few cosmetic choices- Annoying tutorial you can't skip or disable EVERYTIME you create a new playthroughI’ve been with Mordheim since the very beginning; I’ve seen it have hits and misses when it comes to updates, but the end product of the game was ultimately not worth the money I paid for it.To elaborate on some of the points above, Mordheim is made to be punishing past the point of challenging and into the realms of stressful, irritating and boring. Every encounter is stacked against you, even the easiest encounters; as such you are always losing units and making an uphill battle into a late game progression you realistically can’t win.Mordheim is less of a race with a reward and more of a marathon that doesn’t end. It starts fun but quickly kills that fun by playing the “I’m a hard game because I need to be” rather than “I’m a hard game because I naturally am that way due to my mechanics”.The AI (which will be your primary opponent) still runs into walls and misses tactical advantages that would win them the game; however it makes up for this by having a huge overhead advantage on you from the start. The AI is through and through dumb. It gets caught on doorframes, misses easy wins and even damages itself. In the later stages, winning is determined by exploiting the dumb AI rather than playing tatically.Oh and don't bother with multiplayer, it's bland and often exploited by bad sight lines, biased spawns and imbalanced factions.There is currently an issue with the ""ambush"" feature, which allows you to end your turn but attack any enemies that come close. However, there is a small area where you can engage the unit set to ""ambush"" mode. I kid you not it is about 2 pixels in extra distance. you can get extremely lucky and try to pixel hunt for this area, risking being charged and hit. But that AI can calculate this and has no issue with charging you those 2 pixels out of your attack range, effectively making the ambush feature 100% useless unless you are in close quarters, at which point you may as well kill your own unit because the enemy AI will always have better units than you.To this end, the game quickly begins to seem like a grind, you are always going up a slope slowly and small setbacks have big impacts. Some people may enjoy that, but I don't like grinding in progression, I like to feel like I'm gaining headway every game I play. Not feeling like i'm making progress slowly kills interest in the game for me.The developer's solution for poor AI (that they keep refusing to fix) is just to heap on the imbalance with each mission. To this extent the game gets tiring and absurd very quickly.The way customisation and side missions have been implemented reeks of laziness. The developers couldn’t even be bothered to explain cosmetic customisation beyond “Style 1” and “Style 2”.That said, Mordheim follows a copy and paste layout in generalA typical Mordheim warband play through is this:1)	Randomly generated mission2)	Collectable request3)	Randomly generated mission4)	Randomly generated mission5)	Randomly generated mission6)	Randomly generated mission7)	Scripted mission8)	Collectable request9)	Randomly generated mission10)	Randomly generated mission11)	Randomly generated mission12)	Randomly generated mission13)	Randomly generated mission14)	Randomly generated mission15)	Etc.16)	Warband becomes so crippled you are forced to start again17)	Repeat at 1)On this subject, the scripted quests are so badly designed I never play them. It's always the same map with a differant scenario and items. Most often this includes taking an item to a specific place and using it, however, the map view is top down only and the quest interactions are highlighted by a gold circle where you need to interact. Not only are these circles tiny, they also can't be seen via the map unless you zoom into the closest level and pray they aren't indoors, otherwise you won't see them at all.This design is the biggest threat, not the enemies or setup of the challange. And that is a huge shame. A player shouldn't be fighting against the interface or controls to play the game.It’s impossible to explore this vast city that was made, since the AI will just charge you regardless if they are outnumbered and/or outgunned. This means you get to see tiny parts of the maps, which are very loosely randomly generated and after a while, you get to know the maps inside out because there are so few of them, as many of them have been reserved for scripted missions (which are poorly designed, see above). The maps are large at times, but you often only get put in a small area to play with.In the end, every warband you make will fail because you need to keep up to date with deliveries (which the game does a terrible job of explaining), this means you can't buy new warriors all the time and every injury sets you back by days and gradually makes you fall behind.That said, every mission is the same tatic; group up, go in as a group and just pray for crits and getting that 2% chance you need to win. To this extent, this is the primary reason why I do not like Mordheim, in tabletop Warhammer games, there was always a diverse scenario to be played. But here it's dummed down into focusing enemy units and playing watered down randomly generated scenarios.If you want you can go for the side objectives, which there are three of (yes a whole three!), these side objectives are often highly optimistic, due to how the maps are asymmetrically generated, it's common for the objective to be impossible to complete because the side objective markers are too far away from your starting point. The AI will just charge you and you will have the choice:a) Risk losing most of your armyb) Do the side objective and get a tiny bit more xp at the end of the gameIf you don't do B, your army falls behind in xp and gear and you end up being even more outclassed later on.There were a lot of ups and downs in the development, but it ultimately ended in a game that ended up worse than it started off as over a year ago.Mordheim is dumb, shallow and a waste of money.The Multiplayer is terrible and the singleplayer is even worse. Funnily enough single player seems to have the most effort put into it, of all things.It does no justice to the current failing licence, it had potential, but I seriously doubt that the developers will make it better. Don’t bother.			"

												This game has come a long way since it first released in Early Access. Now there is a persistent, fleshed out campaign for all four factions currently in the game and the interface and gameplay is smoother than it has ever been. Characters level up, get new equipment and start to take on personalities for themselves (with your imagination) sort of like XCOM and it really sucks when someone you've been grooming for greatness gets taken out completely. Also, be careful, the campaign mode does have a game over/perma death feature. Unfortunately those loading screens are still absolutely horrendous... especially when some of the levels last just as long as they do. Honestly though, there has never been a better representation of the Tabletop game of Mordheim on a visual medium than this game and I only hope more factions can be added, more humour brought from the actual game itself, and more content be added into this already complete package. Definitely recommended.Gameplay Footage:

If you enjoy turn based combat, leveling up, loot with the danger of permenant death and injuries to your team, then this is the game for you.Only 4 different warbands to choose from now but I expect once most of the bugs have been ironed out the devs will look to adding additional warbands.Thumbs-up			"

												I really really love this game. There is alot of content. It's turn based in a 3d environment. (mind blown) and there is equipment and skill and spell capabilities. (insert changed pants here)I was never a fan of Warhammer the table top but I loved the idea and concept. This is an excellent atlernative to someone who wants to avoid measuring tapes and overthinking situations. Granted occassionally the environment makes the AI dumb you can always play with another live player which is an exciting if not terrorizing concept. This game can be unforgiving to mistakes or going out alone with one of your heroes. (Stay together least you come back missing a leg or arm, for spellcasters that is TERRIBLE)I'd like to see more warbands and some more customization come to the game but this does not detract from the fact that this game absolutely took over my life and I am no where near completing all I want to do with all the warbands.This game is pretty awesome. It's a no brainer to purchase if you love Turn Based.PS The undead are a great addition.			"

								[27.09.2015]The game is early access (<--means the game isn´t close to be finished yet, so if you want to buy the game, be sure to do it to support the development and not really to play a finished game) and its very clear, that there is still much more work to be done. In this ""Early Access Review"", I will focus on what the game currently has and not what it currently lacks. -The graphics are quite nice and the character models look like the tabletop figures i know and love from my Warhammer Army.-When you built your Warband you can choose their weapons, the abilities and uprade certain qualities like strength/intelligence/initiative etc., name them/change the name of your warband,   adjust their looks. -Skirmish Mode: You fight against human enemies or CPU and you are able to determine the starting conditions of the game (like: all troops in one place or spread all over the map/the winning conditions etc.), however you are not able to choose what CPU army you want to fight, so if you want to fight a specific CPU army you need to make a private lobby and click on the CPU button till you have the enemy of your choice.The game is turn-based, in your turn you...: You walk a certain distance You can engage the enemy You attack/do magic You can loot enemies You are able to flee  You can lurk for enemys to get near to your position for an auto attack  You can increase your fighters defencehowever there are no phases like in the Warhammer tabletop game, so you have more freedom in what to do when you wanna do it.-The Campaign mode is now in the game (it´s the main game focus): In this mode you built your Warband from the ground up, equip their weapons etc., then you choose one of the 2 randomly generated missions, you earn experience, you can loot dead enemies to find new weapons etc. After you finish your mission, you have to pay your soldiers and pay the treatment of their wounds. However if one of your soldiers needs treatment, you can´t use him for a period of time (4 days for example), which can really f**** up your Warband, so you need to play very carefully. Your main objective is to smuggle a certain weight of your warpstone out of Mordheim to your contractee, you earn warpstone by winning missions, but you have only some days to gather enough warpstone for the next shipment. You can go to the shop to purchase armor, weapons and potions etc. for gold. When you are done end your day by clicking on a tent, your warriors will lern skills and the treatment days for the injured will reduce by 1. Then you go on your next missions, or a story mission, that has different objectives and conditions.-The CPU is challening, but combat against other players is much harder.-The game costs plenty of money in early access and it will even become more expensive after early access. Maybe because the Warhammer license is really pricey, but however it limits the people who will buy the game strictly, because no one who doesn´t love the Warhammer universe  will buy this game. (<--At least that are the reactions, that I saw when talking and reading about the game).-The tutorials are only battles with text sometimes and you can´t just read the text in an extra menu (<--Might be improved in the future)-Only four warbands will be aviable at the release wich is my major source of criticism because in the tabletop version of mordheim you are able to choose from 15 warbands. I understand, that making new warbands is pricey and much work, but at least the Witchhunters and the Undead would be very interesting to play and add much more variety to the game.However we will get more after release, through DLCs and this is perfectly fine as long as they have a reasonable price (4-5€)-Although the game is still in Early Access, it seems nearly finished and progressed in the right direction.[I´m German and only made the review in english because the whole game is in english, so there is the possibility of grammatical errors in this review]			"

								This game is very promising compare to warhammer, from what i've seen their updates are frequent and is one of the few of its kind actually enjoyable, with its features of future updates it will be exciting to play this game since some the features are similar to of x-com with perma death, inventory, rankups etc i highly recommend this game a lil later on once a few more of the features come out			"

												Same as everyone else the RNG is just messed right up.I can put that aside sometimes, but every mission seems repetative, group up, find enemies and have a giant melee of missing and being critted.The mandatory shipments are just rediculous, nothing like playing a game and not being able to continue unless you send away 3/4 worth of your $$.The multiplayer has nothing to offer, if it were a system of doing matchmaking, playing a game and actually splitting up your warband to get as much stuff as you can it would be great.But no one does it because there is no matchmaking so all you get to do is group up and get in a cluster ♥♥♥♥ with the computer until 1 warband runs.If they did away with the mandatory shipments and tride to breath some life into multiplayer I would recommend this game, until then no			"

												Nice game if you can pick it up for under 10$ it might maybe be okayish.Mordheim: City of the Damned, bringing Games Workshop marketing & money grab to the gaming world Episode IXBe prepared for:-endless random missions that all kinda feel the same-campaigns that add even more missions (not random but also not fun)-a console ui that is purely written for controler input (always a big plus)-new factions that will be sold per model not per faction(not so soon tm)-current factions that are sold per model not per faction(starter packs included in the game)-no modding support, who would like to write his own campain for a tabletop/rpg port anyways-an engine that is troubled to support more than 20 models, so we will never so anything other than 1 vs. 1-loading times that are officially deductable from any time you have to serve in hell			"

												Really old-school gamer here, I've been looking for a game like this for a looooong time!  This game is phenomenal!  I've never felt inclined to review a game until Mordheim came along, so this is a first! (I have about 40 hours of actual play time on the game so far, I just never close my client, lol).Old-school gamers/TTG gamers will really appreciate Mordheim, and I consider it to be the *only* digital TTG adaptation of any franchise done right (and I've played just about all of them)!  It's not without its flaws, like any game these days (mainly, AI pathing bugs), but it's very easy to look past the non-game-breaking issues when what Rogue Factor has done with Mordheim obviously shows they really cared to deliver a top-notch experience, and I trust they'll work through the bugs in due time.Well worth $40.  Support the devs and reward this amazing game with its fair, old-school business model (no nickle-and-diming Free2Play - i.e. Pay2win - here, just good ol' fashioned buy the game, play 100% of the game.)Bravo, Rogue Factor, keep it up!

												Warhammer flavored Xcom. Overall pretty good, if you like difficult strategic games. I have 3 issues with the game, however.The UI is cluttered and often finnicky. For instance in the store you can't use the scroll wheel if the mouse is on the line inbetween the items, yet if it's directly over an item the scroll works fine, meaning you have to use the arrows or drag the bar. Little things like that are here and there. The gameplay generally starts off focused on looting wyrdstone and then moves on to fighting. I like the looting aspects but it's VERY slow. It feels like the first 10-15 minutes are spent picking up rocks.Difficulty is great. I love it for that, same reason I like xcom/darksouls. But difficulty and unfairness are two separate things. When you can't control where you spawn you are rolling the dice to decide whether your game instantly ends after 20 hours of time spent into it. For instance last time I played humans I was on day 16 and started a mission.. one archer spawned completely alone in a hall with an enemy on either side. Another spawned in a corner with a rat ogre pummeling him on round one. Both were guaranteed dead in the first 2 moves(not rounds) of the game. This would ultimately mean I couldn't win the fight - even if you disregard the other 2 units of mine that would also be screwed. So.. yeah. The difficulty is fine, but never choose to play any mission where your units spawn randomly around the map or you are basically asking to lose the game. Not great design in that regard, but if you avoid those missions (which don't convey different content, just spawn points) it's fine. *And choose 'launch and deploy' to choose your spawn locations when applicable. Game never mentioned that as far as I could see, choosing 'launch' auto-assigns spawns.			"

												I recommend this game due to its replayability and challenge. In this game you start with picking one of the six warband races (two of them are DLC). You search the ruins of Mordheim, an old imperial city, for valuable wyrd stones, which have magic effects. During every mission you encounter an enemy warband, which also seeks wyrd stones. Fierce and interactive battles take place in an apocalyptic and authentic scenery. This game has a steep learning curve and it is important to play other players to understand the mechanics of Mordheim: City of the Damned. While the single player missions can be boring, Mordheim: City of the Damned excels in multiplayer. Join one of the PvP leagues on Steam to find matches with other players. Pros:- thrilling, authentic atmosphere- sophisticated skill system and warband development- permadeath and injury system- challenging AI battles and story missions- interesting and tactical PvP battlesCons: - DLCs to access characters and warbands (which are affordable)- matchmaking with other players can be taxing, because players decide on the powerlevel of grown warbands and the rating is not reflective for the power level of a warband- AI matches can feel repetitive on slower deployment types- AI gets stuck on corners and high grounds- small development budget and team- most of the actions are RNG based, which can lead to onesided matches or powerful comebacks in battles- I am not a fan of the veteran system, as it is now (other warbands start with better starting conditions depending on how much you achieved in the game thus far)To sum up: I recommend to buy this game if you are in for a tactical challenge.

								It's too early to say whether this game is good or bad. It shows alot of promise and with some tweeks combat can be made much better. I'd buy it now with 20% as if they implement all the changes they plan to it will be an amazing game. It doesn't have much content at the moment so don't buy it and expect to be amazed. Instead buy it now with 20% and then leave it until January when it will have more content. "

												UPDATE:So Mprdheim, is it good? That's what you want to know right?Yes, and no. If you like turn based, if you like managing a force and watching them grow and develop then yes. If you expect this process to be without loss or finance problems then you should look elsewhere.FIRST POST:This should have been a Demo not an early access. 2 warbands and tutorials. Seems companies have realised that they can release demos calling them early access and make a killing.The game had promise. Looks good, interface seems fine. But the real game is in Warband building. So I can't give it possitve or negative yet.			"

Early Access Review
								For almost daily streams of Mordheim and FAQ dialogue, catch my stream at http://www.twitch.tv/wicket_and_cubMordheim: City of the Damnit will make you break your computer.  Your dice will always fail.  Your best fighter is gonna go down HARD in some of the most gut wrenching ways.  And after you piece the broken parts of your computer together, you will realize just how much you love it!In Mordheim there is not just you and the opponent, there is you, the opponent, and the map.  If you are not careful, the map of Mordheim will slap you around (or help) and put an end to that uber strategy you were just gonna pull off.  The need to improvise, the need to make the best of a worst situation, these elements are actually fun.""But how the hell can losing my characters in defeat be fun?!""  Glad ya asked.  See, if one of your characters goes down in a fight, they don't die, they do an injury check.  They could lose an eye, a leg, they could be rendered useless, or they may even have a ""Near Death Experience"" and gain extra XP!  Also, for every injury, a warrior recieves a negative rating on their overall rating meter that contributes to the strenght of your warband.  Long story short, if your rating meter is lowered on a specific warrior and that warrior does not lose a vital statistic (such as his Intelligence is harmed, meanwhile he is a Strength based warrior), the warrior just made your warband stronger.  Also, some injuries are just fun and they really add flavor and character to your mercenaries.Every mode in the game feels incredibly distinct.  Such as, the random battles which fall underneath the catagories of ""Capture the Flag, Wyrdstone Rush, and Marked for Death"" are fun and exciting fast maps to play (relatively, battles can go upwards of 2 hours.)  Campaing maps are rich in story and objective and feel like a Dungeons and Dragons table top game brought to life.  On-line versus play is constantly being tweaked and perfected and strategy certainly helps.  It is VERY fast paced with options to have count down timers till the turn is ended for each player.  These times can be adjusted to fit your convenience.And to touch on customization, this system is incerdibly deep, from the character progression skill trees to the ability to customize each individual body part skin on nearly every warrior and give custom color sets as well.The amount of progress this game has had since the release of Blood Bowl 2 is staggering.  There are positives, there are negatives, but ultimately, this is a title that will please big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics, X Com, Disgaea, and Total War.I feel like I only scratched the very very tip of the iceberg when talking about this game.  Again, please check out my stream for any and all questions, I love talking about Mordheim!  http://www.twitch.tv/wicket_and_cub "

												Unlike other Games Workshop based games of recent years, this is not an attempt to translate the tabletop game directly into a videogame.  Some people who were hoping for that have been disappointed, but personally I think a direct translation would have been nearly impossible, and in the end probably less fun.  And it is fantastic fun.  Creating and customising a warband is very enjoyable, and the battles themselves are fairly short and sweet, so it's a good game to dip into for half an hour.  Each warrior will progress in both positive and negative ways as they accumulate experience and injuries, the horrors of Mordheim both hardening them and taking their toll on their minds and bodies.  That will mean that your warband will be unique in subtle ways, and you'll get to know each member.The lore and atmosphere of Mordheim are lovingly recreated and you can tell there is a lot of love for the original here.  The cityscapes are absolutely beautiful and although scenery often gets in the way more than providing many strategic options, some maps change things up wonderfully with multi-floored indoor areas being a particular favourite of mine.The game, they warn, is 'hardcore'.  Battles won't always be fair, and losing can have dire consequences.  For the most part this works well, though the sheer number of ways in which a character can be randomly screwed over, often permanently, sometimes makes you want to quit and start over.  Losing a limb, for example can make a character next to useless.  It would be awesome if there were some crazy ways to try and heal such wounds, say with erratic healing spells or mechanical prototypes with chances to add another level of random craziness to battles.It was exciting to be a player of an early access game with regular updates and news, from a team who really listened to player feedback.  There's a lot more that could be added to the game, in fact it seems a waste not to develop further with such a deep and unique framework.  The product as it is is magnificent, but it is absolutely ripe for further add-on content especially additional warbands, as I think 4 is the absolute minimum they could have got away with.  It gives lots of variety as a player, and many strategic options in multiplayer, but it certainly gets repetitive seeing the same few bands of enemies in single player mode.  Perhaps an old-fashioned 'expansion pack' would be a better idea than small pieces of DLC, as lots would be willing to pay to expand the experience with any kind of new content.In short, it's brilliant.  Maybe the best game ever made within the Warhammer universe.			"

												I am totally addicted to this game, but there are a few things you should know before buying it:It is brutal. By that I mean there is no saving and reloading to earlier points (For idiots like me who make stupid mistakes). Your characters that you spent so much time leveling up can be maimed or die from one bad decision. You can ruin your entire party if you are not careful.I ended up creating and recreating warbands (The party) due to silly decisions over and over.  It took me a good 10-15 hours to get the hang of things (see above re:idiot me). You will need to put in a few hours to get the hang of things before it starts to be very enjoyable.Normally I don't like these types of games, but this is different.It's got a fun turn based combat system that I have never seen before. It seems a little convoluted at first, but once I got used to it, there were a lot of different strategies available to me.It is turn based combat.. My first game started with me seeing a rat running towards my leader, and I freaked out a little because I thought maybe I had to click on defend or something. What threw me was that I am so used to seeing hexes in turn based games that the free running rat made me think of Skyrim or the Witcher. I have come to like the perma maiming/death system. I think what helps is that even though your warband may be devestated beyond all repairing, all your kills/looting/wins put points to a global achievement section. When you level up this achievement, you get extra benefits and skills for every new warband. These skills are set on a per warband situation, so you can pick the ones most suited to the warband you have now, knowing that you get to reassign them if you create a new one.Here are a few things I wish I knew before playing:Keep your units close to each other. A lone unit is practically guaranteed to be maimed or killed.ALWAYS ""Launch and Deploy"" - When you start a new combat, you will have the option to ""Launch"" or ""Launch and Deploy"", without any instructions on what they mean. It's as simple as it sounds, ""Launch"": the computer place your units in their starting positions, and these will often be the worst possible positions they can be in. ""Launch and Deploy"" you place your units in the starting positions.Buut sometimes even if you ""Launch and Deploy"" you will not get to deploy your troops. It depends on the mission type and what side you are on.Don't be afraid to skip a day.The enemy will place the same number of troops as you do. So, if you can only muster 4 troops due to injury or training, then deploy them. The enemy will only have 4 too.Do not get too attached to your warband early on. There are a lot of ways to screw it all up, many you will only find later (usually when you start to think you have the hang of it).One last thing: What the hell is up with the dice rolls in this game? I have never seen so many 90+ rolls (Higher is bad in this game). The only good thing is that it seems to affect the AI as much as mine. "

												With tactical gameplay in the battles and numerous options to develop your warriors that you only encounter in the best of RPGs, you will become addicted to a dangerous extent in the enjoyable experience that Mordheim gives. The game would reach perfection with some additions if, for example, enables you to mix creatures from all warbands and creating your own ""dream team"", ideal for online ""high stakes"" conflicts.In the world of Mordheim traps are commonplace and you will encounter them in all your battles. The biggest trap of all is the multiplayer mode. You must have lots of guts to encounter warbands runned by human beings. People do not make stupid moves, will not leave the battle in any way and there is a great chance to know perfectly well the map of the region in which you'll play. At the same time if they happen to have much better equipment than you, your warband is going to be chopped to pieces in a jiffy!To love passionately a video game it must offer you great excitements and Mordheim excels in that area. The ""dice"", i.e. the success rate of every action in the battlefield, is a fleeting ""mistress"" whom some times shows you her favor with a critical success and at the very next minute, turns her back on you with a critical failure, forcing you to curse gods and demons. You will feel great satisfaction watching your fighters to tremendously improve themselves by upgrading their stats while at the same time your treasury fills up with money, equipment and weapons.You can watch my ongoing videos from the game here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAlrmwwKDyU6_2BMpz9qDBQnEQQ40iwTGiannis MoschonasEditor in www.gameworld.gr "

Early Access Review
								This is a mighty good game, with some difficulty problems.  I'm readily impressed with the graphics.  They've really brought the city of Mordheim to life and have added a great deal to it, visually and mechanically (there are various traps throughout).  It is not a direct adaption of the rules, but what they've done is actually quite excellent, with strategy and tactical action points.  This allows you to move/search/set stance (strategy points) and make attacks (tactical points).  They've added stances which are quite interesting.  Each attack reveals a % chance to hit, and I do question how accurate this value actually is.  If I'm told I have an 80% chance to hit, then I expect my warriors to hit 4 out of 5 blows.  In the game, I've seen the reverse, missing 4 out of 5 blows (and I'm not at all discounting how the defense system works, because those are separate 'rolls').  The difficulty of the game is brutal.  I have to abandon my first warband because of a string of serious injuries to my leader prevented me from playing them.  Instead, I had to wait too many days and eventually I've lost out on my first shipment. The question is, is it too difficult?  That's a tricky one.  I'll try to offer my thoughts.  The luck system feels off, as I've mentioned.  There is a massive series of random rolls 'under the hood' and you never quite feel like you're in control.  As I've mentioned, 80% chance to hit ends up feeling more like a coin flip.  As such, the game feels like you're in control of the movment of your warriors, the stances and all the non-luck based actions, but when it comes to the game rolling the dice, you have no ability to affect that.  When you see a string of misses and failed rolls, it gets frustrating.  Very frustrating.  (Suggestion: If you could spend unused actions points to boost your jumps/attacks that would at least feel like you're stacking the odds in your favor).  I've seen some one-sided things that make me feel like the AI has a superior advantage.  I've seen a single AI warrior walk up and demolish one of my own, whereas I've never been able to do he same.  I seem to always require 3-4 warriors to pound away at an enemy to beat them.  In the original game, you receive money immediately after every battle.  Here you must fulfill a shipment and I find that those requirements are set a little high.  You will be struggling to collect wyrdstone to fullfill those shipments and while I get why this was done, I'm not a huge fan of it.    Where I see the problem: the auto collection of wyrdstone after a map is way too low.  The maps are generally too small to collect wyrdstone during the game.  You might have time to collect a few small pieces to bolster yourself but once the fighting starts, you need to commit all your troops to the fight.  The automatic wyrdstone collect after a fight is a paltry amount.  You can make your shipments but only if you don't receive any massive injuries that slow your progress down.  I don't find this part to be fun.    Incidentally, I did manage to get a huge windfall in one session, simply because the enemy didn't fall it's rout check and the last enemy was wandering the map aimlessly.  This allowed my warband to wander around freely and collect a large amount of wyrdstone and that changed the dynamic of the game.  This was a random event and my other warbands are struggling badly with trying to collect enough.  The difficulty of a game like Dark Souls is very hard, but there is skill behind your victories and losses.  That's what makes the difficulty tolerable.  Thsi difficulty here feels like it's randomly generated.  You've little control over many parts of the game.  One final thing about the difficulty: So far, every fight that I can do in the campaign is listed as 'normal' or harder.  Essentially, there appears to be no fights where I can pick on a weaker warband.  Everything appears to be equal or tougher.  I think there should often/always be an option to pick on a weaker warband, if only so you can recover a bit from getting brutalized from a bad situation/poor luck.  So is it too difficult?  I would say yes, just a bit.  I'm doing very well with one of my warbands but as I've mentioned above, that was dude to the AI not routing and allowing me to clean up.  Another of my warbands needs to be disbanded because of how awful the random number generated rolled on my behalf.  Essentially, what this games needs is a come from behind mechanic.  I'm enjoying this game, but find it very frustrating at points.    "

												I really, really wanted to recommend this game, because under it's horrible flaws is hidden the skeleton of something really fun. I even wrote an earlier review to that extent; it didn't post due to an error on Steam. Having played it several days since then, I just can't recommend it now.There are several minor flaws in things like the UI, AI, weird character animations, et cetera, but most of those are fairly trivial. What it comes down to is that the underlying math is horribly implemented to such an extent that the stats of your warband are essentially a lie. No matter how much you level the stats on your party, your odds of accomplishing any task on the battlefield are no better than random chance. What do I mean by this? I understand that a percentage is a probability. So, if you have say, 70% chance to dodge, it isn't a guarantee; you have 70% chance to dodge, and 30% chance to fail dodging. However, * over time *, statistically, you should dodge roughly 70% of the time.Instead, a character will get powned again and again in a round, or even an entire combat, with a statistical average of say 0-10%. This results in ridiculous battles where warbands you should slice through like butter due to your superior party members and gear, and your understanding of the game after having played it for dozens of hours, end up handing you your @$$, even if you manage to kill as many of their party as they kill of yours despite the additional obstacle of poor implementation and hence unfairness. This will happen even on normal difficulty combats - the game for some reason has a separate difficulty for combats in addition to the overall difficulty level of the game. This doesn't make the game ""hard""... it's not a fair challenge that is simply difficult. Its lack of predictability or reliability makes it aggravating to play. There is no way to improve your skill at psuedo-random number generation. Hard, brutal or deadly combats are impossible. You will also frequently face the somewhat humorous, and much more maddening, circumstance of having your butt kicked by a one-armed and/or one-legged enemy.I'm a game developer myself. I remember, several years ago, working on a game at a studio that was shut down; and having an argument with a designer about this very issue. Similar to this game, it was a turn-by-turn tactical combat game originally. He wanted me to implement a system that behaves as Mordheim does not. In other words, if you have 70% chance to accomplish something, * over time *, your successes should average out to roughly that percentage. At the time I was resistant, because I hadn't implemented that kind of system before and I knew it would be time-consuming. Unfortunately, we never got to publish that game since, as I mentioned, the studio failed. However, after playing this game, I understand. I mean, I understood the logic of this a while ago, but now I really * understand *.You will eventually end up in a situtation where you are very far along into the game, and you either have to abandon it because your warband has suffered too many setbacks in the form of defeats and injuries that you cannot recover, or you just become too exhausted to continue playing. I'm at Act II-II and I'm not sure if I'll continue or not.One last thing I'll say is that it's possible, with all the spells being cast, and gear and what-not, that other parties are simply buffing past all of your stats on-the-fly as it were. That doesn't really improve the diagnosis however, as in that case, the game is simply very unbalanced. Any way you cut it, this game is a tragic failure for the design team. Whether that is inherently due to the design, due to an improper implementation by engineering, or some other factor like poor communication or office politics, which all too sadly sometimes cause these sorts of flaws to appear in games, is pure speculation. Ultimately, for the players - the paying customers - the cause is immaterial. Being a software engineer myself, I doubt there is an easy fix for this problem, since it's a flaw deeply embedded in the entire design from top to bottom - and because, if you did fix it, you would essentially be changing the game fundamentally, which wouldn't be fair to players who had invested so much time into the game before the fix.

												The game could've been great, the different factions are varied enough and theres alot of character progression and customization. But it gets so ruined by horrendous RNG and punishing gamemechanics that only affects you. Basically it goes like this: You start a mission, deploy your dudes and start exploring. Eventually you run into the enemy warband all bunched up on top of each other more or less. Theyre all in ambush mode, meaning if you get too close they attack. Unless you charge them. But theres pretty much no way of telling how large their ambush range is compared to your charge, you just have to get closer and closer with babysteps trying to get in charge range and pray their ambush range is shorter. More often than not this ends up with you walking into an ambush and getting devastated. If you manage your way around this and end up in a fight thats fair or even in your favor theres no guarantee you will win. Fights boils down to dice throws, and when your dudes and their dudes are equal level you have a pretty good shot at hitting according to the game, 70-80% hit change, which in reality means roughly 1 in 4 because the number shown to you doesnt factor in some of the things that influence combat (such as melee resistance)... The entire game relies on RNG, and the RNGenerator is a joke among jokes, rolling either 1 or 99 half the time. Luckily, the AI is dumb and buggy and can be outmaneuvered alot of the time giving you a pretty good shot at winning most missions anyway.Long story short, the first issue i have with the game is you get f*cked by RNG alot of the time and your masterfully planned strategy just gets dumpstered by something you have no control over. The second issue is gamedesign. When you lose a mission (or even win but a guy gets knocked out) you roll for injuries. Alot of the time you get away with nothing big, but occassionally you get hit with a big one, like losing an arm on one of your more important characters. Buying a new one is not really an option as you either get a fresh one with♥♥♥♥♥♥stats that gets massacred by anything and everything or you have to pay a small nations yearly budget to get one with some levels to it, which is generally unaffordable. And yes, this doesnt affect the computer at all. I've yet to meet an AI warband that has any (visible) injuries at all and you face new, freshly generated warbands each time. This means the AI can play super aggressive (and it will) with no drawbacks. If it loses, nooooo problem! Just generates another fresh warband with no injuries next time! Basically you play the hardcore difficulty mode while the AI is in sandbox mode, and in the end its all down to RNG anyway.			"

Early Access Review
								Have you looked at this game once, maybe a few times, and thought, ""Hmph...that looks kinda cool, but..."" Are your gaming interests at all like mine, and you just can't get enough of that sweet sweet blend of turn-based strategy, rpg character building and item progression, and fantasy flavor (sci-fi is fun too, of course). Well I'm not kidding: even at this early stage, the foundation of this game is clearly well-built, fun, and has incredible potential to be that pure, addictive blend of all these elements. I read nearly every other reviewer say this similar thing--""Even in early access, it's clear that the developers are doing a great job building this game."" And probably like you, I had my doubts...And then I just decided to pay the piper. A couple clicks: bye bye 31 dollars. Let's see what you've got, Mordheim. Then I worked my way through the tutorial. Then I played my first skirmish, playing around with a bit of fine-tuning the weapons and armor of my warband...Cut to 3 or 4 hours later, and I will be following this game religiously as they add everything that's teased within the game itself right now: further customization; xp progression; other warbands...This game is fun now. If you like turn-based strategy, tabletop wargames, D&D style party combat, fantasy flavor--buy it. I can't wait to see how much better it gets along the way.			"

Early Access Review
								FInally - a developer who understands the proper use of Early Access.   The base game initially provided is playable and fairly stable and provides a solid representation of the direction the developer is going with the product.   Buteven  more importantly - it's already a LOT of fun to play.    The initial treatment appears to be a solid representation of the spirit of Mordheim while making changes to the ruleset to make a more balanced, entertaining video game.   This isn't faithful to the actual rules in the manner that Cyanide's bloodbowl was but it is obvious that the developers have a deep respect for the tabletop game and in the end this respect shines through in a game that really and truly FEELS LIKE MORDHEIM.    And that is the most important point to take away from this - as someone who is a fan of the boardgame for many years, I can honestly say that I couldn't be happier with the direction this game is going and I look forward to a complete, feature rich game set in the city of the damned!

Early Access Review
								This is an awesome port from the Table top game that I loved. Worth every penny, glad I brought it now as I can see myself having hours of fun playing this as it gets more fleshed out. 9/10, with the potential to be a classic.Hopefully over the following weeks the game gets fleshed out a bit more with the options to bu equiptment and customise your warband.The graphics are nice only thing missing from the atmosphere is Skaven chitter chatter that we all no and love; can't beat a good ""Die Die Manthings!"".The combat / action system is easy to master but looks like it could be a lot of fun once more skills are added, at first I was a little lost as to how my mage was meant to cast spells ad then found the space bar.Can't wait for the following releases of content, hopefully all the warbands of old get added as that will take this from Awesome to Legendary.Would also be cool if you could get some passive items like grappling hooks for humans so that jumping / climbing was more likely to be successful; also on th emap the ability to zoom out further.I love the fact that you can run around in the blue circles without losing movement so you can scout out where you want to go / how to path to places.Good luck on the development you have made the start of an awesome game!

Early Access Review
								First off I usually don't buy Early Access because I been burned a couple times by games not being published as promised or even updated, but this is a seasoned publisher.  So this game will actually make it to release, I have faith in that.Two, this game is Alpha phase at the time of this writing, but the have been very specific on what it contains for those that purchase Early Access. This game has loads of potential and the little bit of content they has so far to give you a taste is very satifying.  It delivers the feel of being on the ground in a skirmish while maintaining the tabletop mechanics faithfully.  For those that have played Mordheim, or like me other Games Workshop games, will be very pleased with this game.  The Developer, Rogue Factor, has a very firm grasp on what Mordheim is and how it can be represented in a digital format.So here is your chance to get the game a few dollars cheaper and help them work out the bugs and improve the game for launch.  If you have the patience to wait for the updates as they come, this is a great start and get in on the ground floor of what is shaping up to be a awesome game.			"

Early Access Review
								My brother gave me a Mordheim tabletop starter set for my birthday long ago so I was really excited to see a video game version of it. So far reading about the game and playing a couple of hours of it I find this game manages to capture the spirit of the tabletop game pretty well.- The game has great visuals from the dark Chaos touched ruins of the city, to the look of units and their abilities. The visuals really put you into the world of Mordheim. More variety  of maps would be good but I am sure more will come out with release.- The frustration of your units failing time and time again to hit an opponent while the opponent wails on them! 100% Game Authenticty.- The current Warbands are pretty fun. I love we get female characters and they aren't wearing bikini chainmail. And any game that lets you play as Skaven is an automatic win. One of the biggest things I think will make or break this game is how much will available on release and how much will be DLC later. If they give us a decent selection range, more then 4 just warbands, off the bat the game could be pretty great! Hopefully within each Warband there will be some some diversity to choose from eventually, Clan Pestilens instead of Clan Eshin for Skaven for example.- I am excited they brought the customization of your Warband to this game. I can't wait to have a unique group to despair at as the die off in combat. Have battered veterans with new skills and missing limbs. Not much of this is in the game yet so I will have to hope it delivers what is promised.- Scenario games with plenty of interesting objectives similar to the original game! I haven't delved into these too much yet but I am hopeful that the game will feel less like a bunch of pointless battles with a little bit of lore behind each one.The game is currently glitchy and a little bare bones but that is to be expected for early access. But it is still a fun game to play in its early state so I have high hopes for the game.			"

												TLDR....Atmospheric, dark fantasy combat that gets so much right you will get angry it did not hammer every aspect of the game out of the park.Lingering Issues with Optimization plus slow-pacing can be frustrating to deal with.Full ReviewRatings for this game really seemed to take a hit during the early portion of the early access period. I came late to the EA party and was generally satisfied with what I found. The additions and expansion of the game leading up to the full release yesterday have all been on the positive side.What I like...Tactical CombatFirst person POV - Valkyria Chronicles would be the closest comparision I can think of but I like this aspect even if the camera movement frustarates me4 throughly planned out factions that give a different feel and campaign for single-playerRPG elements are present but do not overshadow the tactical nature of the game at least until you reach rank 6 (up to 10 possible with full release)Atmosphere and artwork where clearly a point of emphasis for this teamHigh amount of customizations abilities/skins availble for each unitContent - Lots of it and the pacing means if you like what you see here your in for a treat because there's more of itChallenge - There is one which is niceAC/DCRNG - Present and accounted forPace - Not necessarily a drawback but early game is slow until you learn the mechanics and certain scenarios were painful to finish because of there size/hiding or hard to reach unitsMultiplayer - Slow as in even by turn-based pvp standards slowDifficulty - More specifically difficulty due to unfamiliar systems and half explained mechanics read up, play tutorials a few times each (thought incomplete still helpful), or learn as you go but not much gets spoon-fedMusic/Sound - I liked it well enough but some sound effects are off and everything gets repetitive a bit too quickWish it were better.....Camera - Nearly rant inducing when I first start playing but some tweaks seem to have improved it a bitCharacter Builds Vanilla Among Same Units - Nice to have customization options but it seems most units are pigeonholed into one or two roles though I may just need more playtimeLoading - Loading - Loading - Loading - LoadingWorld Interaction - My biggest complaint so I'll elaborate a bit - I think due to limitations of the Infinity Engine some tactical features that would have been great have been left out - No FLYING DEATH SMASH from the top rope for example. No Pushing/Pulling to Move Enemy Units into Danger Zones. Danger Zones (exploding barrels, launch pads, or their like) are for the most part absent. Elevation matters for ranged attacks but not melee (kinda meh on whether it should or not but worth noting). The traps are annoying and could be done better or done away to improve the experience.  Wydestone collection comes into play but feels secondary even when it should be your primary focus to advance the campaign. Personally I am a big fan of the universe of Mordheim and I have to say I am impressed with how much fun this game has provided me already. I am well over the 30 hour mark and I have yet to complete a single campaign so the value for investment is defintely there if you enjoy the game.8/10If they can ever optimize this game to cut down on the loading screens (tough to do but some improvment would be nice) I would say this game comes in pretty close to a 9 for me. If I am still playing this game for as long as I think I will be I may be bumpiong it up for that reason as well. Honestly, I almost hate this game for not having world interaction completed to the level I would prefer but I enjoy what's here enough without it. Guess that leaves room for improvement if they ever make a sequel. "

												Ok, now that I have had time to explore the final release of the game, I figured I would update my previous review.First and foremost, if your not patient, have no tolerance for a learning curve, and cant handle getting the snot beat out of you while your learning a game, run. Run far away, and dont ever look back.Now if your still reading, I am assuming your not one of the aforementioned types of gamers. So lets narrow it down again. If your the type of gamer who wants fast paced action, doesnt like turn based fare, and hates RPGs or turn based strategy games, you may want to hit the road as well.Now who's left? Ah, you. Yeah the ruthless adventurers and ambitious meglomaniac tyrants of the gaming world. My kind of people.Mordhiem is a turn based fantasy strategy game with heavy RPG elements. Its set in the Warhammer Fantasy setting, and takes place in a shattered city called Mordheim which was struck some time in the past by a big rock. And you control a motley warband scrambling against other likewise warbands (of which there are four types you can choose from...Mercenary Humans, Skaven (rat people, and I dont mean the band!) Sisters of Sigmar (the ugliest women I have ever seen!) and my personal favorite, the Cult of Chaos!) Who are out to get the rocks for your master, whenever he needs a fix. Wait, no.....They aren't crackheads. These are magic rocks called wyrdstones, which are not really healthy to be around, but since we have to pay the bills, we have to just shut up and deal with it.You start off with an ugly leader, commanding even uglier troops. But the harsh looking characters and enviroments have a flavor that fans of warhammer (like myself) are quite fond of. The game captures the essence of the Warhammer universe perfectly. As you move through the game, you can choose to partake in either story or random battles, which will reward your freaky looking band with exp. and loot. So far, I am sure all this sounds very familiar to fans of the genre.But its distinctively different in some great ways. For example, the realism. Your characters are in constant danger of not only perma-death, but permenant injuries. Not only do these injuries cause debuffs and penalties in combat but actually show on your character! So, lets say, you lose an eye, it shows, lose a limb, it shows. Get your face smashed to hell, yep....It shows. Now this feature is well done and, frankly, badass! No worries though, because every so many days, replacements show up of varied levels looking for work. And sometimes they even bring nice gear you can strip off them hehe! You will also later get ""impressive"" warriors, as they are called, which can be anything from elite warriors to daemons and spawn. And just like the injuries I mentioned earlier, wyrdstone warps some characters in positive ways as well, so when your uglier-then-my mother in law hero grows horns or some such thing, dont panic....Its all normal in Mordhiem....Also, stores have a random and limited stock, forcing you to work with whatever you have the luck of getting in the store or from loot. Not to mention enemies can also loot you! This is actually a great feature as well. And forces you to make decisions your wouldnt normally make. One example would be putting a powerful ""epic"" weapon on a lower ranked character. It will make him more effective, but then you run the risk of losing it.....And as for loot, there is plenty to be found....Weapons....Armor...Helmets....Beer that messes you up and buffs you....( Damn the Bugmans Ale). You can detect loot within buildings and on corpses in the street and so forth with a skill called ""perception"" that every character has by default. Other skills also become available as you level up....From passive skills that let you ambush or charge in a wider range, to activated skills that knock your enemy around like a red headed stepkid....(No, I dont condone knocking around kids, I just wanted to use that saying cuz its catchy) And if for any reason you get lost, scan the skies while perception is activated. A blue light will show your your ""camp"" ( a wagon with which you can store the loot you find) while a red light shows the enemies camp (A wagon where you can jack thier stuff hehe). There are far too many skills to go into detail with, but I have found a moment at this point for ALL of them to be useful. And some ""special"" skills you aquire will even let you move a hero to leader, or a henchmen to hero, boosting there stats significantly and allowing them to learn better skills!Movement is something that takes some getting used to in itself, as unlike many ""grid"" based games, its much more realistic. Yeah, you have a limited range for moving on your turn, but youll be climbing walls, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and occasionally, falling and busting your clumsy♥♥♥♥♥haha (which always gives me a laugh as the damage is usually minimal)Speaking of damage, your going to want to build your dodge and melee resistance, as healing is very hard to come by. There are some healing draughts and poulices, and the Sisters have some healing skills (as does the globabier), but youll have to learn to minimize damage to survive. And never charge one of your guys out as a lone hero or he will get slapped stupid, unless your confident in your characters power, or your using an impressive (spawn rock hehe). Always treat every fight like life or death for your character, because it just might be. No phoenix downs HERE to save the day.The good news....Win or lose, it will give you experiance, some loot, and stat boosts. SO if you get mauled at first, replavce any who are dead or too damaged to push on, and youll eventually start to turn the tables on them.....There are only three complaints I have with the title, but I have high hopes after reading the developers forums that they will be adressed in the near future. And that is the lack of variety in Warbands and Characters (every warband is unique, dont get me wrong...And they all have thier own playstyle. But its not enough of a good thing, but I am positive they intend to address this). The second complaint is that the gear needs to look more varied on characters,and the final complaint is I feel the level cap is too low (because leveling your band is such a blast, its kind of depressing that max is reachable so quickly). Do these things keep the game down? No. They are really not enough to make the game a failure. And they are things that can be, and I think will, be addressed as time goes on. But its still a game worth every penny of its price as it is now. With those issues addressed, no other game would even come close. But its still become one of my favorite TBS games in years. Ive played the genre for about 20 years now, and I dont say this too often. And I have to REALLY like a game to write up a review, because, well, I am a lazy sonova.....HAHA! You know......Mordhiem stays very true to its source material. Fans of the table top game, or strategy/rpg hybrid fans, will love it once they have the hang of it. This is a game that truly rewards patience. I like the DLC as well, but I have pnly tried out one of the two characters, yet now I wonder how I ever got by without him haha! (Tip,if your having trouble with the dificulty, get the globadier, as he is extremely useful)The games not perfect, but they are not done adding to the rich game they have created. And yes, its hard at first, but if you learn to use skills, ambushes, and the terain to your advantage, you will be handing out can-o-whupass in no time.The variety also needs work, but if this is adressed in the future, Mordhiem will go from a fantastic game to probably the best Fantasy TBS game ever made. Yes, it has that much potential!I cant recommend this game highly enough, as long as you heed what I said about patience and the learning curve, Mordhiem will keep you entertained for many, many hours!

Early Access Review
								This is a seriously good game and very addictive, especially if you are a fan of the Warhammer Fantasy Universe.  The controls are easy to pick up and combat / movement both simple and advanced are fully explained in the excellent tutorials. Here comes the inevitable 'but'part.1.  Even though the game is centred around the collection of Wyrdstone there is little opportunity to hsrvest any once you make contact with the enemy.  You simply have to pile all your warriors in to prevent isolated warrkors from getting splattered.  It seems like the only time you can collect any is if you deploy near to a deposit or come across some on your way to link up with your warband.2. The acquisition of loot is impossible once the enemy warband routes. This means that even though you may have put OOA some enemy with really good items that you have no chance to loot them. Also, even if you win the match standing 2 meters away from the huge Wyrdstone deposit you were on your way to you get no chance to collect it and therefore do not benefit from your victory.  Maybe a victorious warband should be given 1 final turn to collect any nearby loot/wyrdstone but made to ignore and be ignored by remaining enemies.3.  At certain times you have no say in the deployment of your warriors and they end up at isolated spawn points.  Then on the very first turn, some enemies can sprint across half the map, home in on them, stun them with their first blow and OOA your warrior with the next 2 hits...and there's nothing you can do about it, you're just a spectator at this point. I dont mind hard games or getting a bashing if I make mistakes, in fact i relish the experience of playing my way back out of difficult situations. However, in my opinion, no game should arbitrarily place you in a position where you literally have no chance to influence (for your benefit or detriment) the outcome of that position.I realise that this game is still early access so my aim here is to inform, not to rant.If you like turn based strategy games and / or the Warhammer Fantasy Universe then buy this game immediately because it's one of the best you will ever play.

												Disappointing and frustrating, but there is still promise.I've been a fan of the Warhammer world for over 20 years, and that alone is enough to keep me playing this game, but I don't know if I can recommend it to others.  The missions and combat are incredibly repetitive, and the RNG and AI get frustrating at times with seeming like they are TRYING to screw you over.Standard, non-story missions all have the same objective:  kill or rout the other warband.  There are optional objectives, but these are usually best ignored.  The problem is that the best strategy in every mission is to lump your people up as tight as possible and advance in a blob like toddlers playing soccer.  Sending warriors off alone or in pairs usually just ends up with them getting ganged up on by superior numbers and killed.  By keeping everyone together, especially in missions with no time limit, you can eventually come across less numerous opponents and gang up on them, killing enough to rout the band.  Also, you really should prioritize either ranged or melee combat for your warband.  Trying a balanced approach has, in my experience, been less effective than ganging up using a single strategy.  Hang back peppering approaching warriors with a warband full of bows, then pulling out melee weapons to finish off the stragglers that reach you, or give everyone a big axe, surround your target, and chop him apart.  More frustrating though are the penalties for failure.  One bad match can cripple your entire band, with the story missions being particularly punishing with a laundry list of mandatory objectives, and demanding you either complete them all or fight to the near last man.  I've played 3 of the story missions, and lost 2 of them thanks to either glitches or frustrating randomized spawning of the literally infinite reinforcements.  Using my Chaos band I fought into a Sigmarite temple to try and defile 11 different holy objects.  Once I'd killed the guards, defiled 10 of the 11, and fortified the entrances to the temple as best I could with my surviving warriors, creating cross-supporting zones of fire and ambush lanes, I sent the hero up to the belfry to get the last object, only to get ambushed on the roof by a randomly generated hero reinforcement, who charged and killed my wounded hero, generating an automatic failure condition.  Goodbye 45 minutes of work, hello injury rolls.  Another Imperial warband did not lose a single match until the story mission, then a glitch indicated I'd found 10 of the powder barrells I needed to use to blow up a location, but could only pick up 7.  I kept looping the map trying to find new barrells or respawn the old, and the infinite reinforcements wore me down until I ultimately lost, and then half my previously undefeated warband suffered permanent, debilitating injuries such as lost hands and arms.  Easier to just start over at that point, but there went all the days of progress.			"

												This is my Favourite game of all time.  Its the most satisfying Turn based strategy game ever.  I have been playing games workshop, and other table top games for over a decade and this game is fun and is probably better than the table top game of the same name.  The background story for the game is very cool, you can pick one of now 5 warbbbands to get into the action with.  In this game your main duty is to pick up wardstone and kick some♥♥♥♥♥while doing it.  Getting wardstone is a rush.  When I see a Cluster it gets my mojo going, and filling my pockets with it is soooo satisfying.  Leveling up is very cool and will keep you coming back for more.  The hours just fly by when I play this game, and the more you play the easyer it gets.  Its got a leveling up system that gives rewards by picking skills that carry over to new war bands.Difficulty level is challenging and one of the best parts of the game is that every move is final you cant take nothing back and theres no re loading to save some ones life.  In this game if you go down (and that can happen on any hit) its permanent.  Henchman can loose arms and legs on any given hit they take.  Which makes this game a bit of a rush while playing.  10 /10 - best game ever. "

												I'm not sure how to start out. Let me get this out of the way first though. I like this game. Alot. Also, if you want the short review, skip to the end.Now, If you've played the tabletop game of Mordheim, you know exactly what you will get. This works pretty much the same. And for me, that's a good thing. If you haven't played the tabletop version, then this is what you're in for.Mordheim lets you control a group of fighters from various factions, out to gather wyrdstone. It's a game of tactical battles, and that is what you will do. You will battle it out on the ruined streets of the city Mordheim. This is also all that you do. Even the battles themselves are usualy the same. You do get different optional objectives to complete for each battle. Usualy gather wyrdstone, or capture the flag, or a bounty hunt on some of the other teams characters. BUT, those objectives are optional. The main thing is always the same. Go in. Kill the opposition. If their will doesn't break, you might have time to gather up some goodies. Or, if you're OP, you might get away with doing the optionals anyhow, but that is imo up to which faction you're playing. Now, that might sound boring, and for some people it will be. The thing with Mordheim however is that regardless if you win or lose the fights, you will get ""rewarded"" with experience. If your characters get knocked out in a battle, they usualy get back up again for the coming fight. Sometimes with missing limbs or eyes, and sometimes making miraculous recoveries and sometimes even come back stronger.So. You will grow your band of warriors, both in numbers and levels, and you will get better gear from the stores, or from looting the city itself. There are also story missions. I've so far played two of them on two different factions. They bring in some different rules on how to win the battles just to spice things up a little. In short:This game is repetetive. It is all about killing the other team.The music gets a little repetetive.It's a fun tactical combat game, set in a dark setting, with some interesting story missions thrown in on occasion.That is what you're getting. If you're after more, don't buy the game. If you like tactical combat games, this might be for you. "

												I totally love this game ! Sad to see how all the negative reviews have less than 50 hours playtime in this game, not even giving themselves a chance to learn how to play it.Yes, it is difficult, it is punishing, sometimes even when you did everything right ! Sometimes you will wonder if the gods of RNG hates you and why they would want your elite soldiers to loose their limbs or life. Yes, this is not a game for the soft hearted or for those with anger managment issues, you might just end up breaking your keyboard or computer screen. But.. once you learn the basics this game is super fun !! My first warband was a skaven (ratmen) warband, But I had a difficult time managing these squishy creatures, so after some hours I moved on, tried the human mercenaries warband. This went a little bit better, still some deaths and injuries but I got by and kept progressing. After some time I decided to try the skaven again, and this time, after learning the basics, it was a completely different story. Sure there were still have some injuries and deaths, but it went a lot better after learning the basics of the game (and how to avoid doing massive mistakes that ends up killing off your troops for certain)This is not farmville, it is not CoD, it is not Command and Conquer. This is Mordheim, city of the damned, a stratergy game that punishes bad stratergies and stupid decisions. Only on very rare occations your troops suffer when it was not your own fault. It has a deep learning curve and takes a bit of time to really get into.Ive played all the warbands to level 10 (max) except sisters of sigmar and cult of the damned. The most enjoyable has been skaven and witch hunters, with the ratmen having a very good all around team and amazing henchmen (warpguard is by far the best henchmen in the game IMO), and the witch hunters having insanely good heroes and leader. In both these warbands you want to go for the optional leader, not the standard one. I dont have a single witch hunter in my witch hunter group, but rather a warrior priest with born leader and a couple of templar knights kicking♥♥♥♥♥ If you are having a hard time with the game try this out, the templars never die, and the warrior priest makes sure to keep them healthy. From my own experience heavy armor and shields with one handed weapons generally works out for the best, accompanied by perks that is useful for people who does many attacks each round, for example ""quick insicion"".Anyway, the game.. it has nice maps that always change up, every time you enter a match the map is different created ""random"", the main story maps are very enjoyable, the skill customizations and how you want to build your group is entirely up to you. PROS:Fun and challenging game!Always a new map. You are in the city of mordheim so the theme of the map is often similar, but in fact the map is always different.Huge character skill and setup customization.Active devs ! Every time I was thinking there was some issue with the game it got patched soon after to fix those issues.CONS:It is difficult in the start, this is definetly not a game for noobs or impatient people. Your troops will die and you have to decide if you want to ragequit or figure out exactly why they died, because 95% of the times things go bad it is not the RNG fault, it is your own fault because you did something stupid, perhaps got too greedy grabbing that far away wyrdstone away from your group, or you tought your archer was standing in a good spot when soon after realizing he gets trapped on that balcony he was standing on and chopped into bits because you put him in overwatch stance. I also wish there was more appearance customizations of all the troops. There is usually plenty of colors to choose from, but not a lot of other customization options in terms of how your troops look.Sometimes the AI go full retard, especially the impressive (huge elite unit), but it has been upgraded/patched and is now a lot better, they rarely do stupid stuff anymore.The game used to have more cons, like very slow loading times and some annoying bugs, but as far as I can see all those are fixed. Every time I encountered a bug in this game it was just after a new release and it got patched in less than 2 weeks every time.-----------------------------This is an amazing game for anyone who wants a challenge and is bored of many of the ""fed with teaspoon"" games made nowadays that holds your hand trough the entire process. Sometimes you sit there for a match or two, sometimes you sit there all night playing and tinkering with your troops, thinking about how you wish to build them. Tons of replay value and tons of fun once you get into it. A very fine stratergy game indeed !			"

												Do you enjoy building a customized party of badass adventurers? Do you enjoy leading that party into glorious turn based battle? Will you realize you are bad at strategy, watch your merry band be ripped to shreds by rat men, and hang your head in shame? If you answered yes to all of these you are a lot like me! I am really bad at this game. But I still really enjoy this game. Just come in expecting to die horribly and enjoy the ride. Thats kind of the overarching theme of Mordheim. It is very fun but stays true to the source material and its insanely high levels of difficulty. Don't say I didn't warn you.			"

												People are complaiming that this game is too hard.  I rarely lose a match (still happens sometimes but hey to one is perfect).  I prefer that there is a challenge.  The game is visually great and a lot of time has gone into making it an enjoyable experience.  Is it a perfect? No but it is getting there.  There is still some bugs that they need to get rid of (loading times, PVP having very few people, impressives getting stuck in buildings) but overall, if you understand the genre and how to play the game, it is a great game.

												The games been on quite a journey, from a very poor early access period through to an entertaining late access period with a lot of promise for things to come when they finally release all of it.Now it's been released, and seems the late access period really was all they had, the only additions to the release were voice-over actors and an intro video. While in early access one can forgive the fact that the AI bugs out in every mission, bugged mechanics, and that it's missing 11 of the official warbands. You can even forgive the fact that a game which is at it's core a multiplayer community game which was almost always played as 1v1v1v1 or more only has 1v1... and you'll almost never see another human to play against (hell it was early access, how many people were playing?).Post release, these things can't just be overlooked. It can still be a fun game, but if you don't bring your own people to play against, don't expect to find them already on there (it's 2 day's after release, I've seen 1 public game all day). You can play single player and bug out the AI all day... but it gets boring.			"

												We've probably all grumbled playing Xcom and missed on things that seems like a given. We've also all probably muttered ""Xcom proves there is no god."" Your only half right. God existed but he was devoured by the old gods of mordheim.  Very steep learning curve on this game because the systems / stats are not clearly explained. But when it clicks, when you've been demoralized so badly you figure it out. You got that sweet spot. Your warband is a legit force to be reckoned with.  That's what makes it worth it. I've never had such a rewarding experience, recently, in gaming that was starting as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cult band to becoming a total monster. There is a lot of customization in terms of stats, abilities and builds that it has tons of replayability. Sure your leader got downed for the first time ever and is permanently dead. Hire a new schlub and get back in there. Personally I love a hardcore strategic game, and this does it. A lot more planning and end game scenarios than other games. My one issue is that some mission types start you at a severe disadvantage, in terms of randomness. A 40k version of this as necromunda? ♥♥♥♥ yes.			"

								Eh....I know its still early release but the price is too high imo. Only 4 teams(which I'm sure will change), only game mode right now is skirmish which is basically a practice mode. You don't earn or get xp/money/injuries/warpstone/loot/etc. It's on the map, but after the match everything resets which makes it kind of bland and repetitive after a while(more teams released would at least offer some more play styles).  I'm also not sure how i feel about them going with hitpoints over wounds (ex my Demon has like 240hp or approx instead of 5 or 7 wounds he'd get on the table top game), the loading time on fantastic settings was pretty bad(but the graphics are good)The magic system could be better. Again, since you dont gain xp, you don't see many spellsThats the negative stuff.The game has a really good Warhammer feel to it, the Dev's definately took with time it.Tons of battlegrounds, all very interesting and fun.The game play is alot of fun, but tricky until you figure out the controls.Lots of potential and upcoming content including a campaign mode(hopefully soon)So overall, I'd say too much $$$ for what it's offering unless your a diehard Warhammer fan. I bought it on sale for around half price i think, which was TOTALLY worth it.			"

												Good game which makes you invest in your characters and really care about them.  Unfortunately, it's also a fairly repetative game without a lot of variability in the settings or missions.  I was warned to skip the ""scattered"" missions which led to them being even more repetative.  It would have been nice if it allowed for character stat respec as I had several that were max level and one stat point away from being able to get certain skills and spells.  I did enjoy the main story missions.  All said, it took me 75hrs to complete the storyline for one faction.  With the difficulty level associated with perma death and lasting injuries, I did play conservatively.  I'll probably take a long break and come back to play through other factions.			"

Early Access Review
								Now that the game has left early access and been out for a month, it's time to update my review.First of all, most bugs have been fixed. There's still some that pop up now and then, but rarely anything that will impact your gameplay in any major way, and they will presumably be worked out too. Now the two major points: RNG and difficulty. A lot of players complain about the RNG. Not because it's broken or rigged, because it's not (several have tested it and confirmed that it's working fine). No, they complain because they either do not understand how RNG works (it's a ""Random Number Generator"", and a big clue is in the ""Random"" part), the gameplay mechanics or do not like it when they lose. First, for those not understanding the gameplay mechanics, here's how an attack works:-you attack a target, and a ""Hit Roll"" is made (based on your Hit chance)-if it's a Miss, you miss-if it's a Hit, your target gets a Dodge/Parry roll (if they are in Dodge/Parry stance)-if they pass their Dodge/Parry roll, they Dodge/Parry the attack and take no damage-if they fail the Dodge/Parry roll, you deal damageSimply put, you need to first Hit, and (if they are in a Dodge/Parry stance) they have to fail their Dodge/Parry roll. That's where a lot of people get confused or frustrated. The hit chance displayed does not take into account Dodge or Parry, only your chance to ""Hit"" (or not Miss) the target. So you'll find a few individuals claiming this makes the Hit chance shown is wrong. Yes, you can potentially miss 3 hits in a row when you have a 95% chance to hit. And yes that can happen in a short span of time. But over the course of 10,000 rolls, a 95% chance to hit is a 95% chance to hit. Conversely, sometimes you'll also manage to hit 3 times in a row with a 5% chance. And it's exactly the same for the AI. I can't stress this enough: the AI has no hidden advantage to it's rolls! Streaks will happen on all sides, both good and bad. If you can't accept that sometimes RNJesus will screw you, then you can't stop reading. You will not enjoy this game, and I highly recommend against buying it. Then there's the difficulty. Is it a hard game? Yes. It's hard in the same sense that Mario Bros. was hard. Make too many mistakes and it's Game Over, start again. But if you look at most of the negative reviews, they are form people with very little time played. Few have more than 50 hours and the majority seem to have less than 20 (even as low as 0.1). And there's a good reason for that: This game takes time to get into properly. It's not a ""Jump in, kill some things, log off and have a biscuit"" game. This game requires a certain amount of patience. You'll most likely fail spectacularly with your first warband. Maybe even your second and third. It really can be a punishing experience at first.But when you start understanding the mechanics and taking some time to plan your warband and unit builds, things suddenly get a hell of a lot easier. Those mobs you needed 3 units to take out first time around, you can suddenly take on 2 at a time with only 1 unit. And the more time you spend planning and choosing your stats, skills and equipment, the better your units get. And then you get screwed by RNG, and your favourite unit dies. And when I say ""dies"", I do mean that the unit is dead and gone. No medical kits. No Revival spell. No Phoenix Downs. Your treasured Hero is lost forever. So you buy a new one and make him even better. That's how the game works. Your units are always replaceable, and you will replace them for better ones. Managing to get to Rank 10 without losing any units (not to mention without injuries) is supposed to be an achievement, not the standard. So in the sense that there's always a chance you'll lose units, or even your entire warband, all while trying to make sure you can fulfill shipping demands, it is indeed a hard game. Personally, I find it a nice change from the way more common mechanic of not actually losing anything if you fail. The Arkham series is a great example of that. Fall to your death? Nope. Automatic Bat-Grapple to a ledge. Get shot or beaten to death? Nope. You simple resurrect at the last Auto-Save. Nothing wrong with that type of mechanic, but it is not what you'll find in Mordheim. There are no backsies here. Consequences are permanent. It's certainly not for everyone, but I like it. Makes things more exciting when you know you can lose something. So, the positive things about Mordheim: CotD.-Warband and unit customization is vast and can keep you occupied for hours and hours. -The 4 warbands play very differently, and themselves be played in very different ways.-Single-Player is large enough to keep you occupied for a long time, with both random missions and 8 Story mission per warband. There is no end to the ranomd missions, so you can keep improving your warband as long as you like. -Multiplayer is really fun and engaging. It offers two different versions, one with consequences (injuries, death, loot gained, etc) and one without (no loot gained and no injuries or death). In both cases the match can be heavily customized to suit your preferences. -4 mission difficulties (Normal, Hard, Brutal, Deadly) let's you choose what kind of risk vs reward you go for.-Random monsters can appear and attack both sides, but are restricted to Brutal missions above rank 5 (so if you don't want to meet them, you don't have to). -Singleplayer and Multiplayer are tied together, so you can rank up your warband vs the AI then go fight other players.-potential for expansions (maps, warbands, etc) is huge. Now for the negative parts. -Multiplayer, while great fun, is lacking. No servers means no rankings, matchmaking or anything. There's only a lobby and inviting others. It can make finding matches a tedious process. -AI is dumb as a brick. As soon as you learn it's behaviour, you can easily beat it. -Visual customization of units is a little lacking. -Singleplayer and Multiplayer are tied together. Yes, it's also a negative, because it limits a lot of tweaks and additions to Singleplayer because it would affect multiplayer too. A ""PvE only"" option where you can Save at any point (or restart macthes), or ""PvP only"" where you can't buff up fighting the AI, are two highly requested features. Overall, I'd recommend this game to those who enjoy strategic and tactical games where you plan ahead, and spend time with warband and unit management, as well as fighting. I would not recommend it to players who want quick-paced action or easy games that don't require much thought. Just be aware that things take time and will not always go your way.			"

								I recommend this game to anybody who likes tactic based strategy games. It's like seeing the tabletop game come to life right before your eyes. The strategy system is rather deep as you can lay ambushes for your enemy to run into, place yourself into a dodge or parry stance giving you a slight advantage in 1 on 1 combat, or block the enemy's path with your units. Winning does feel very rewarding as your units will level up and get stronger, but losing can be just as punishing because you can lose those valuable veteran units if they die.			"

At the moment there isn't any of the special features such as getting damaged and having it remain the next time, gaining skills/experience, or even saving your characters yet.

												MY First impressions: I hate&love the ""thrown in without much explanation"" approach. There are 4 ambiguous choices between which race I you want, which will effect, EVERYTHING. so no pressure. Then, there is something about grabbing all the stones, Killing the other three other choices you didn't choos and then the game throws everything on your plate.It's nice enough to restrict some things you don't need yet but I feel a sense of dread that I already ♥♥♥♥ed something up with the few choices I had, and not enough knowledge of what my actions actually will do. on top of that I don't like being made to spend resources without knowing what the value is cause it implies I might need them later for something better.On the other hand it implies, that none of that really matters and with hope I can pick up on mechanics as they become relevant so fingers crossed for the first mission...Mission overview: got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. two dudes got hurt, and my mage lost his staff so... Restart. If you buy the game, I strongly recomend you look at the controls, cause the game doesn't explain anything. easy enough to learn, but it doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if you are just starting out. it's glove off from start to finish.

												A must have for any fans of Warhammar Fantasy and turn-based RPGs, Mordheim came as a pleasant surprise. The tense feeling of never knowing if the next round will be your last (or even if your next move will be the last) is really making this game worth playing and you really feel satisfied after a perfect mission.Building your own customized warband with different types of units and skills is great.However, the learning curve is quite steep and the RNG is sometimes frustrating, and the so called story missions can be somewhat confusing at times. Not for all gamers. I'm very excited to see what the developers'll do with Necromunda after having done a great job with Mordheim.8/10 "

								If you were to ask me to recommend this to someone, I would say either to grab it on sale if you REALLY like the tabletop Mordheim and or multiplayer. Or keep looking if your not into  rogue like games with permadeath and things where you have to restart numerous times to end up at the same conclusions based heavily on luck.Having said that, this isn't a terrible game. Its in fact very impressive as far as its system implementation and battle system. If you enjoy multiplayer you will like this game. But that is where this game would shine and ONLY would shine is in multiplayer. Me personally I'm not big on multiplayer. I'm giving it a negative as a single player perspective.With all Games Workshop games, in my opinion is based (around 60%) on luck. Other being strategic planning. This game is no different and it doesn't give you a whole lot of options as to how to strategise battles when the enemy AI just seems to bum rush you everytime and then it just becomes a dice rolling game. Some battles won, some battles lost but overall a pretty meh feeling after 10+ of these battles.Coming from someone who dislikes multiplayer in every sense of the word, I have to admit that this should be a multiplayer only game as the enemy AI is just too dumb to do anything but a dice rolling and stat comparing game (which they always have more then you, to make up for its lack of intelligence)I know people enjoy this game and I totally respect that, because in fact it IS very well put together and for a small group of devs its promising. I just can't personally recommend a friend paying for it knowing these faults. I would recommend it to someone into multiplayer games.			"

												Started the game as the Sisters of Sigmar. Didn't have the best start but things were looking up on day 3 as I cornered the enemy leader in the first move, and got a successful charge to chunk him to half health. I decided to cast ""Sigmar's Might"" to make it more likely to finish him off with the next attack... Leader takes 9999 damage from a failed spell cast and instantly dies. My whole warband proceeds with similar luck and wipes without managing to kill anyone. Start again as the Mercenaries, first match is against Skaven and things are going pretty good. I lose my Hero and the Rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steals his halberd, but I chase him down immediately and finish him off with a clean charge which causes them to route... Wait a minute, where's my Halberd? Oh right, after killing the rat I didn't have the movement left to pick up his loot which means even though I won, I still lost my weapon, and the Market doesn't refresh for another 7 missions.I want to like this game, being a warhammer nut, but the consequences for failure are too extreme. I don't mind consequences, I don't even mind Permadeath as long as you are reasonably able to avoid them, but it is nearly impossible to get through the first few days without some crippling loss beyond your control. For me what ultimatley defines a game as trash is whether or not I get unreasonably frustrated/angry while playing it and struggle to find enjoyment, and I have not rage quit a game so quickly since Chrono Cross.With all that said if you're not easily frustrated even by obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics (Not intended as a Jab against Mordheim),  and you catch the game on sale for 70% off or something it's probably worth picking up, but only if you're a fan of Warhammer Fantasy.

								Played the table top with a mate back in my uni days. So far the game is really capturing the feeling of what it was like to play the table top game. I played a few rounds with what is already there and I know the game is in good hands, I don't want to touch it again until full release. Looking forward to the final game!			"

												This game has its problems but it is fun and exciting. You can build your warband and history of it the way you like. The game can be harsh. But there is nothing like having a rough missen and just watching your warband come back and crush the enemy and live. If you don't like games that is high stake probably not for you but if you like the games where you can be the underdog and come back with a knock out then you might enjoy it.			"

								i don t care much for warhammeri don t care much for 3D combati don t care much for multiplayer gamesyet i find this game to be truly awesome and unique(probably isn t but at least it s a rare game)it reminds me, in some ways, of wizardry8, its demanding, things can go wrong very quickly and sometimes, even when things go great, you get a nasty roll that kills you best character, permakilled of courseinstead of writing a wall of text, i simply invite you to check out my steam library, you may find games you respect(some are more casual, i ve got a wife)mordheim is perfect for any serious strategy fan who enjoy playing barbie with their charactersthe best part of mordheim is supposed to be the multiplayer, all i can tell you is that the singleplayer is kind of a dream come true for me; it can be endless(really) always will be balanced(difficulty does not come from ennemies strength but from the random environment, placement, strategy used and optional goals you may decide to go for), permadeath/permawounds is perceived as fresh air and opportunity to get your involvement back uplets give wild meaningless ratings now-for people like me, 9/10, i used to think it was a 7, then i died in a very unfair way and realised my playthrough was not ruined and that actually dying was the best thing that could have happened, it got my interest back up right when i was thinking my OP warband was unstoppable... its a 9!-for warhammers fans: 7,5/10(because they know stuff i don't and are demanding about any thing related to their franchise)-for my wife, understand casual players with a love of drama: 7/10, because your toons die and you get attached to them-for people working in a 20man videogame studio: 8/10, the game is polished, good gameplay, ok graphics, a game to keep in mind when you re trying to make onei ll stop there, the game is at least a 7/10, whatever your tastes might beoh, and the dev team, during EA, usually answered questions in 14 minutes and patched new bugs within 24 hours "

												FOR PEOPLE THAT LOVE CHALLENGING GAMES (Dark Souls for example) this is most likely an interesting game to buy.If you're a Warhammer fan, you have to buy it, what so ever.Very steep learning curve, unforgiving AI (props to the devs). In the beginning I often thought ''well the AI isn't going to punish this, can't be that smart) and then it did exactly that. Probably one of the best AI's I have ever played against, you don't even have to play againt other players. The veteran mechanic where your soldiers can get permanent wounds or even die and get removed from your party makes every single game nerv shattering and very exiting.The 4 DLC heros the devs added are very creative and add new aspects to the game, so if the devs get some more time they will do wonders.Every Race plays differently and even within each race evey warband is different. Extremely high replay value.I have never been addicted to an other game other than Dark Souls, but this one is a gem. "

												I like to think I'm an easy-going person. I've never actually given a game a negative review. But I guess that changes here.To say this game is brutal would be an understatement. This game loves to poke you in the eye and then keep pushing with its finger. Now, I don't mind a challenge. In fact I usually relish it. But this game takes it to a new level of frustration to the point where any semblance of fun goes out the window.After about a dozen battles, I've lost three warband captains. Sure, I can hire new ones no problems, but the enemies I face only get progressively more difficult, meaning the guy who's supposed to be the anchor to my party has to hide in the back and avoid even thinking about direct combat, because if these later enemies even sneeze on him, he'll explode. And captains are mandatory to actually fight.I could forgive the game's lack of polish, the mediocre graphics, the absurdly long load times (upwards of 2-3 minutes to load a skirmish with an i7 and SSD!), the little bugs, the glitchy interface, even the random crashes and framerate drops I keep experiencing. At it's core it's still a fairly fun system.But just when things actually seem to be looking up and I win a few matches, I find it's just a lull of false security. I go to look at the day's available missions. Both are labeled Hard or Deadly in difficulty, and with non-optimal deployment setups (I've found that if you don't start with your warband tightly placed, you WILL get slaughtered). I use some of the few gold I have left to send out scouts and find another mission. Nope, still Brutal difficulty with sub-optimal deployments. Well, maybe I can skip the day and refresh it. But wait, I have a wyrdstone shipment to complete, and if I don't get it sent out the game is gonna shove its finger in my eye again.So I grit my teeth and go to the lowest difficulty mission available. Of course my warband has to be scattered across the map. Of course the computer player actually knows where your guys are, even if you're not in LoS. Of course the weakest of my three teams is almost immediately ambushed before I can group up properly. Of course they're scoring critical hits left and right and of course my guys are largely missing, even with 80% or greater chances of hitting.Which brings me to perhaps my main complaint. This game straight-up cheats. There is NO WAY a properly programmed random number system should JUST HAPPEN to wind up with the overwhelming majority of my attacks and dodges, when my displayed chance of success is 80% or higher, being failed rolls. Sure, even with a 95% chance some attacks are going to miss. But I shouldn't be whiffing six or seven times in a row with those odds.Anyway, I think the breaking point for me was the last fight I was talking about above. I'm getting slaughtered, but grouping up and actually starting to turn it around. Strange how the enemy troops ALWAYS have ""room"" to disengage and flee, but I'm always blocked in. I'm trying to run down one of these guys, I just need to hit him one more time and he should be out. My guy traps him in a room and attacks. 84% chance to hit. It shouldn't be any surprise at this point what the result was. Then the AI guy makes a counter-attack, scores a critical hit of course, which stuns my guy, and next turn he gets two full attacks to kill my guy.In frustration I slam my fist on my desk. My Black Mesa coffee mug, which I've had for over four years, bounces off and shatters on the floor.This game all but literally destroyed my favorite piece of diningware. 0/10(And yes, of course several of my highest-ranked warband members were permanently maimed after the fight)			"

												Alrighty, let me start by saying my quarrels with the game. It is slow. It is unforgiving. It is not unfair like everyone who is writing a bad review says so.It is slow in  how the battles unfold. Almost in a good way, because you do need to strategicly place your units and you have to crunch numbers on your risk/rewards. The beginning of battle usually consists of scattering your units to loot before you need to regroup in preparation of the actual battle.It is unforgiving in which to say YOU NEED MORE THAN YOUR TOP PLAYERS! It is almost like a rogue-like. Anything with permadeath and injuries should be taken that way. So train who you can, in all fields, or you won't easily be forgiven in being stingy.Now here's the class session on how the numbers work, because the misunderstanding is giving a B average game a bad name.-If I roll a d20, each numeral corresponding with 5% (1= 5%, 2=10%, 3=15%, etc.) with an 80% chance to Successfully SWING (Not hit) then all I need to do is roll a 4 or higher. Easy to hit right? No.-Now the opponent rolls to see if the Successfully Dodge (granted I met the swing roll). Let's say they are in dodge stance for a 50% dodge rate. If you successfully swing, the opponent gets to check for an 11 roll or higher. If they do so successfully, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thats how checks work.-Normally in games like this a critical swing is only dodged by a critical roll as well, if at all. So really, an 80% hit chance is a 40%. Or a 42ish% if critical swings bipass dodge rolls all together.Anyways. My point is, don't buy into the ""RNG is broken and unbalanced"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t everyone is complaining about.In terms of strategy: 8/10RPGness: 8/10Difficulty: 9/10Overall: 7/10Only brought down by the otherwise unappreciated slow pace of how the entire game draws out. But if you have patience with it, I'd say its a solid 8. 9 even if they add expansions.			"

												I think I would enjoy this game a great deal more if it was even minutely less 'hardcore.'  Such as allowing saved game files after completed missions, and reloading to those saves after those successful missions.  Or, I don't know, maybe a way to remove the permanent, random, and absolutely brutal injury penalties units receive faster than most people can blink.Being a completionist, I find many of the game mechanics infuriating, not least of which is the steep learning curve with ZERO forgiveness for accidents, mistakes, and inattention.  I play games to relax, and this game.  It is not relaxing.If, however, you like the Fantasy Warhammer setting, and the 'uh-murs-uv' atmosphere it actually manages to achieve, then this game is for you.			"

												I love this game for the fun feel of building up a party. While the perma-death/Ironman feel may turn off some, It feels a bit like a fun little miniatures game down at your local game shop, circa 2001-2007.  Only thing that could have been better is a persistent enemy force, so you could face the same groups over and over, developing rivalries, that ONE jerk you want to put down, etc...As it is, the enemy parties are just random, or static.  Neither gets across the feel of actual consequences to your enemies, only to YOUR team.So, I recommend it.  Wish It was mod friendly or I knew how to code., because that's where so many minor little problems could have been solved.			"

This adaptation of the Table top game has me coming back to the fight just to continue the story of my Scaven Warband led by none other than Master Splinter himself.Mordheim: City of the Damned is not a easy nor forgive game at all.

												After reading many of the reviews, I was very sceptical about Mordheim, having played a lot of the table top Mordheim . In the end I did bought it and --- I was pleasantly surprised by the game.The story line is captivating.The user interface and controls are a bit getting used to, but it works.Warband management is fun.AI is not always very smart, but that's ok.Loading times are quite acceptable.The waiting time when enemy models move can be long. If I have to find an area where the game can be improved it would be this.In short, this is the best game I bought since Skyrim.It is perfect for the casual gamer, who, after a day of hard work and when the kids are asleep, wants to have a good game to play for a couple of hours. Not sure I would recommend this for a die hard gamer who spends 10+ hours of gaming a day.			"

												@eawelcome to mordheim...my hero rat (skaven) lost a leg on his first day... now he have a peg leg...seriously... this isn't a ""wannabe hardcore"" game... this is hardcore.hard to learn, impossible to master.there is tons of stuff to learn, you need hours of hours to skill and equip your warband just to lose them anyway. permadead and permasave ftw.so this is more a warning...you need time... lots of time, to get into this game. however, it is deep and rewarding if you have the patience to read tons of stuff ingame & learn the hard way. if you one of these guys who switch games every week anyway, this is not for you... really it isn't. every battle is intense and you can lose lots of your progress if you fail... for example, if you think darkest dungeon is hardcore, this game will teach you a lesson what hardcore really means. recommended for people, who wants to ""work"" to get into the game... all other should stay out of mordheim... play something where you can save the world and be the overpowerd hero. in mordheim, only death, frustration and insane awaits you...still here and reading ?fine! well, this game is ... amazing. the third person action perspective and running around like an action game is... fresh and innovative for a turn based game. for a ""die hard tatical gamer"" who played games like ja2 or xcom to death on ironman, it's a new perspective and a ""must have"". the handling of the game is fast and easy, but like i said before, there are tons of information and stuff to consider, tactical deepness included.still curious ? give it a try and you will see... mordheim awaits you.@ releasenothing changed, everything is fine.

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is a tactical, turn based strategy game inspired by Game Workshop's tabletop minataure game of the same name. The game itself is beautiful, in as much as any game based in a city torn apart by plague, cthulu-esque dark gods and magic, and skirmishing adventurers can be beautiful. The designs for the maps and the members of each warband are well designed and suit the 'feel' of each unit type. The A.I. whilst at time prone to bugs and occasionally being incredibly derpy is for the most part well rounded and intelligent. Each unit has it's own specific feel and then is reflected in the A.I. with Skaven swarming as much as possible and often retreating incrdibly early. Chaos are glass canons, hitting hard and constantly coming at your band with very little self survival instinct but dying fairly quickly compartively. Mercenarys are from the little I've experienced long range specialists with a good well rounded unit structure and the Sisters of Sigmar are tanky, with large amounts of hit points and heavy armour- charging into battle and hitting like frieght trains, but falling underneath swarm tactics fairly quickly. All in all the difference in unit types, attitudes, playstyles and structure mix in to create a well rounded and appealing game. The mechanics themselves are interesting and certianly appealing, if at times being a little slow to react. But considering the map sizes, the warbands avaliable at the fact the number generator for everything is a true random number generator I can forgive a few misinterprated actions and slow load times here and there. The only advice I would give to anyone considering is buy it, choose a faction based on your specific style and if a skirmish or campaign takes more than 3 minutes to load close the game and restart it.

""uhh that is a lot of cluster wyrdstones, i will sent half of my men in advance just to be sure to get it!"" a few turns later of screams of agony and deaths -> Defeat.One half of your men survives with multiply permanent injuries and looks like they went through a meatgrinder, and the rest is dead. -> Worth it.

I have many table top gaming friends who will not buy this game due to that, as a matter of fact if i knew they would do this i would not have bought it.Look what happened with sword coast legends...held back content in order to sell it to us and ended up with a lackluster product that could have been GREAT.

Early Access Review
								After a very satisfying Early Acess period, Mordheim finally reached the Full Release, so it's time to update this review.""Mordheim:City of the Damned"" is a tactical squad based game with battles set in the dark Warhammer Fantasy setting of the tabletop spinoff called Mordheim. This game builds close to its tabletop foundation and focuses on delivering intense round based tactical battles between mercenary warbands in the streets of a city fallen to chaos. While for our grown casual gaming community this might seem to be plain flavor text someone would write on a box of the store shelf version, the game is not to be taken lightly as it definitely keeps its promises.While any misstep or just plain bad luck could cost you your hard earned equipment, the lives ouf your men or the whole warband the game expects you to handle critical situations like a commander would do, by sticking trough and minimizing losses instead of running away. Loading a different savegame is impossible as this principle is enforced with an automatic savegame system ala Darksouls. Still trying to dodge fate (Alt+F4 or just aborting a mission) will result in punishment for leaving behind your troops on the fields of battle. They return injured and broken, if they ever return. The immersion is further increased by permanent effects that can be aquired by your Troops at the end of battle which are an essential part of the progression system. While XP and resulting Level Ups provide skillpoints and attributes to be spent, permanent Injuries or Mutations span a wide range of effects that will sometimes change the use of a warrior or even render him useless (e.g a Blind Archer). The Missions are played on very open maps that all have random factors that could change between loadouts thus giving the wide range of different city settings even more variety. Outside of missions the game provides a lobby or hideout for your warband, giving a chance to trade and manage your warband as well as play against real players. As PVP goes, it is tied to PVE progression. It is possible to do matches against players as an alternative to playing against AI, but to gain any XP from this for your troops you have to play by the standard PVE rules. Without consequences are only the so called Exhibition matches that give you a chance to try stuff out, but as mentioned they give no XP.Now as someone who started playing almost a year before release my level of optimism towards this game is higher than average and it has been met with over the top amounts of dedication from the devs. I do feel bad for wording criticism but I need to be fair about the amount of masochism required to play this game ... Let me phrase it like that: I doubt you want the game to be keeping its promises. In certain aspects this game is suffocated by its many design choices to value atmosphere over quality of life. It's like the polar oposite of modern AAA+ titles that deliver a fun experience without soul. Most of the things that give Mordheim it's ""soul"" are things that you probably will hate quite a bit.The sometimes long and mortifying battles have to be played in one session, no way of saving and continuing later on even in Singleplayer make it impossible to slowly digest this game and force you to choke it down in bites of undeterminable sizes. You never know how long the next mission will take and there is no way to tell because even the easiest loadout available can become a hell of a nightmare.When already demoralized from sitting trough a loosing battle, you are forced to watch your people die until your warband drops below a certain moral value. There is no way to retreat or disengage, you are locked in a slugfest until one has lost roughly 60% of the warband, no way out. When you are on the receiving end of the beating the game can quickly reach a point of no return, after this you are condemned to patience for the game to end. The only motivation to sit trough this is that the punishments for abandoning the mission will count all your warriors as knocked out while otherwise one or two might be spared before the morale value sinks low enough.After reaching the mission recap, the real headache starts when your units roll for Injuries if wounded. The chances range from miraculous recovery to lost limbs and mental problems. While it can be fun to adapt to changes in your warband, after spending alot of time to train a mercenary loosing him to debilitating injuries that render him useless can be demoralizing. Attachment sooner or later just become frustration. This is true for any efforts you put into the game, as it is very quick to ruin them. That exactly is the real difficutly of Mordheim. It revolves more around how well you can stomach bad news, rather than how well you can solve difficult problems.Maybe you get the feeling the game wants to punish you for loosing games? So there is more to your assumption than you'd think. It's the warband management element. It requires you to pay your mercs after every loadout, pay for their treatments after injuries and fullfill deadlines for certain shipments of wyrdstones, magical stones you plunder while inside the missions. If you should happen to fail several missions in a row you will struggle to pay all those bills. The consequences can be dire enough to stop your campaign progress.Something i wanted to save for last is the terribly clunky interface and HUD. I just got used to playing with an Xbox Controller while still using mouse and keyboard in the menus. The interface did get improved over time going from functional to usable. Warband management is overall impractical without clear look and feel in the menus mixing console and PC designs - failing hard at both - some buttons being unreachable with controller or alternatively being laggy with the mouse. In the missions you notice that over the shoulder perspective is not really practical for gaining insight in the possible layout of the city behind the next cover. The game substitutes this with a birds eye view map screen you can activate to get overall orientation of your units and enemies you might have spotted. Sadly there is no way to gain insight on entrances and exits of building from the map view and you must rely on backtracking while looking for an exit. Especially annoying in PVP, eiter for you with a turn timer or for the opponent without one. Talking HUD, to activate the different abilities of your units you use a circle menu that reminds me of ""Baldurs Gate"" or the first ""Neverwinter Nights"", they feel equally strange to navigate with mouse or controler.But well the UI and HUD are probably not what will make or brake the game for you ... judging by the early acess period I am positive the UI will get improvements sometime soon.To be fair, for me personally all the good and the bad (and the queen) this game does is lost to the fact that I can barely find time to play it. This game requires me to dedicate a whole afternoon to it as I find it impossible to break it down to smaller sessions. Add to this the rather slow progression and many elements that setback your progress makes it take forever to see some improvement with little room for experiments.Still I have alot of fun with this game and do highly recommend atleast trying it out. This might be interesting not only for Warhammer fans but aswell people who know nothing of the franchise, general tactical game enthusiasts, people who want to play something good, slow and different or plain old masochists ... they will love this. As with most games like this one there is a good community surrounding it, many dedicated players (e.g. search for the group ""The Gentlemen of Mordheim"").			"

Early Access Review
								Game is hard. If you hate difficulty, go play dark souls. Its easier. Thats the short version, if that turned you off, stick around there may be a bright side to it. First of all, if you like tactics games, you will like this game. Valkyria chronicles, War of the lions, Fire emblem, XCOM, if you have favorable memories of any of those games then you will know the drill here and have a good time. The game wont be easy, You will be punished for your mistakes, but ristaking leads to the best rewards. The basic concept for most matches boils down to that. Many people will complain that deployments can decide a mission before the game starts, but those same out of position characters are usually the ones who gather your resources. And honestly, if your deployment makes you lose the game your doing it wrong, since you can always turn on the option to personally deploy your forces. And at that point you can either do hammer and anvil scenarios (which will always favor you) or retreat and gather scenarios (where you pull back to a defensible location first before moving back out to collect resources)Also, there is a large degree of verticality to this game that doesnt really have an equilvalent in those other games i mentioned. Mobile factions (or factions that make themselves pseudo mobile) tend to do well simply because they have an easier time navigating the world. Ranged weapons are critical in many of these vertical locations as they allow you to get in damage when your opponent cant. That being said there IS a faction for which only the bravest and manliest among you will play. The sisters of sigmar. My faction of course :p They are the least mobile faction with the worst ability to climb, leap, or generally cover ground.They are the only faction that is completely incapable of using ranged weapons. Sound awesome? Thats because they are also the best faction in straight fights. 1 on 1 they will beat their equivalent in other factions....but if your opponent lets you be 1 on 1, they are doing something wrong :pHope this helps, cheers!

Early Access Review
								After a very satisfying Early Acess period, Mordheim finally reached the Full Release, so it's time to update this review.""Mordheim:City of the Damned"" is a tactical squad based game with battles set in the dark Warhammer Fantasy setting of the tabletop spinoff called Mordheim. This game builds close to its tabletop foundation and focuses on delivering intense round based tactical battles between mercenary warbands in the streets of a city fallen to chaos. While for our grown casual gaming community this might seem to be plain flavor text someone would write on a box of the store shelf version, the game is not to be taken lightly as it definitely keeps its promises.While any misstep or just plain bad luck could cost you your hard earned equipment, the lives ouf your men or the whole warband the game expects you to handle critical situations like a commander would do, by sticking trough and minimizing losses instead of running away. Loading a different savegame is impossible as this principle is enforced with an automatic savegame system ala Darksouls. Still trying to dodge fate (Alt+F4 or just aborting a mission) will result in punishment for leaving behind your troops on the fields of battle. They return injured and broken, if they ever return. The immersion is further increased by permanent effects that can be aquired by your Troops at the end of battle which are an essential part of the progression system. While XP and resulting Level Ups provide skillpoints and attributes to be spent, permanent Injuries or Mutations span a wide range of effects that will sometimes change the use of a warrior or even render him useless (e.g a Blind Archer). The Missions are played on very open maps that all have random factors that could change between loadouts thus giving the wide range of different city settings even more variety. Outside of missions the game provides a lobby or hideout for your warband, giving a chance to trade and manage your warband as well as play against real players. As PVP goes, it is tied to PVE progression. It is possible to do matches against players as an alternative to playing against AI, but to gain any XP from this for your troops you have to play by the standard PVE rules. Without consequences are only the so called Exhibition matches that give you a chance to try stuff out, but as mentioned they give no XP.Now as someone who started playing almost a year before release my level of optimism towards this game is higher than average and it has been met with over the top amounts of dedication from the devs. I do feel bad for wording criticism but I need to be fair about the amount of masochism required to play this game ... Let me phrase it like that: I doubt you want the game to be keeping its promises. In certain aspects this game is suffocated by its many design choices to value atmosphere over quality of life. It's like the polar oposite of modern AAA+ titles that deliver a fun experience without soul. Most of the things that give Mordheim it's ""soul"" are things that you probably will hate quite a bit.The sometimes long and mortifying battles have to be played in one session, no way of saving and continuing later on even in Singleplayer make it impossible to slowly digest this game and force you to choke it down in bites of undeterminable sizes. You never know how long the next mission will take and there is no way to tell because even the easiest loadout available can become a hell of a nightmare.When already demoralized from sitting trough a loosing battle, you are forced to watch your people die until your warband drops below a certain moral value. There is no way to retreat or disengage, you are locked in a slugfest until one has lost roughly 60% of the warband, no way out. When you are on the receiving end of the beating the game can quickly reach a point of no return, after this you are condemned to patience for the game to end. The only motivation to sit trough this is that the punishments for abandoning the mission will count all your warriors as knocked out while otherwise one or two might be spared before the morale value sinks low enough.After reaching the mission recap, the real headache starts when your units roll for Injuries if wounded. The chances range from miraculous recovery to lost limbs and mental problems. While it can be fun to adapt to changes in your warband, after spending alot of time to train a mercenary loosing him to debilitating injuries that render him useless can be demoralizing. Attachment sooner or later just become frustration. This is true for any efforts you put into the game, as it is very quick to ruin them. That exactly is the real difficutly of Mordheim.

												Imagine X-Com, but set in the age of sword and musket.Imagine Blood Bowl, but lacking a ball, played in a ruined urban enviroment and no longer needing an excuse to stomp your enemies into the ground instead of playing the objective.Imagine Valkyria Chronicles with slightly less awkward controls and deeper character customisation.Now imagine that, while all of that is going on, your wizard critically miscasts a Blinding Light, looses concentration, primal forces of Chaos erupt from all his orifices, knocking out the hapless caster, two party members and a nearby enemy ratman, while also attracting a nearby wandering demon to your location.Welcome to Mordheim.

												Been playing this game as it has evolved from a small flame to a great blaze of a game. The game can be overwhelming at first with the difficulty and the amount of information you are given right away. What warband to play, what skills to take and what to do when your favorite warband member gets his arm removed from his torso.With some experience with the game you will develop your own playstyle so don't worry too much about knowing it all at once. The developers managed to translate the experience of a table top game into a video game. It still needed work before this last update that makes for it's official release, but the game has moved in the right direction to keep me coming back again and again.  "

Early Access Review
								Definitely a lot of potential here, a fantastically charcterful and good looking game, but I have some frustrations about it:-Clipping on scenery is a pain. Sometimes it takes an unnecessary amount of walking to get around a corner. I've also had henchmen get inside a building, then not be able to get back out, as there was a slight clipping issue with a piece of scenery (rubble) just inside the door.-Warbands look superficially different, but statistically behave almost identically in battle, there is very little differentiating between the different troop types and playstyles, even having a massive two handed weapon has the same effect as having a weapon in each hand.-AI tends to rout a bit too easily, meaning you dont get to loot their wagon or corpses (although I believe you will be getting access to all the remaining map loot in the full campaign).-Magic and missile weapons are a bit underwhelming, considering the extra effort to use them effectively.Some of these gripes are bugs that will (hopefully) be ironed out by release, but some are game mechanics which make the game less interesting to me. I still think it's a fun game with a lot going for it, and a lot of potential to be even better, and recommend giving it a go.			"

												Mordheim is a game about making the best out of a bad situation, this the first message you receive when you start a new warband and is worth repeating here, at the beginning.TLDR: This is the best squad-level turn based strategy game I have played. It is brutal, your guys will get injuries, they will die; but they are just tools in your warband, replacable when they break or wear out. That is the beauty of this game, there is risk which adds tension and makes the reward actually have value. A battle can be won multiple ways through killing your enemy, objectives, or looting. The best part of this game is the multiplayer, In order to enjoy the multiplayer you have to join the Permaleague, where players only play a given warband in league games, look for ""experimental permaleague"" in steam groups.Full review:The mechanics of the game are an adaptation of a time tested tabletop game by Games Workshop, aka Warhammer franchise. You control a group of warriors from 1 of 6 factions as they adventure into the city of Mordheim (the fantasy version of a post apocalytic metropolis) in order to collect valuable resources scattered throughout. Each of your warriors has a limited pool of action points and offensive points and employ them to accomplish various things such as taking cover, charging, ambushing, fighting stances, and special attacks. At the beginning of the game, these choices are fairly basic but gain complexity as the warriors you control gain experience/skills. This is not to say the game is easy; equipment choice, unit positioning, and balancing the tasks of gathering resources and defending yourself while accomplishing mission objectives takes time to master. When yours or your enemies units are removed from combat by having hp reduced to 0, they must make checks to determine if they were permanently injured, and if so to what extent: warriors can loose arms, legs, eyes, and so much more!Injuries can be painful, and certain injuries warrant sending the warrior 'off to buy the farm'. Other injuries are perfectly managable; after all when you arrive at the grave, what does it matter if your a little busted up! It really depends on the goals you set for yourself, if you want to beat the single player campaign with a faction it doesnt matter if some of your warriors are beat up at the end. If your goal is to create a team to play online, your soldiers are going to get killed, a lot, at the end of the day its about the resources you collect, you can always recruit another Johny Swordsman. Another great thing about this game is you can have a battleground loss and a tactical victory meaning you completed the objective but were routed from the field, or loose both on the battleground and tactically and still feel like you came out ahead because of the resources collected; or because you lucked out and all your injured warriors recovered and you got some experience. There are multiple ways to assess a battle's success.With regards to the single player campaign; starting can be hard and you will not have enough money at the beginning to accomplish everything. Dont worry about training skills on warriors until they have a few levels on them and you have added to your coffers. The story missions can be fun, but can also be frustrating because as its turn based you sometimes have to wade through a whole round of activations in order to get to the one guy that has the objective item.The veteran point system in the game is also great. As you play through the single player campaign you can complete various tasks much like the steam achievement system. However these points can be spent in game to give you some additional perks as you play and carry through into any new warbands that you start. Because they also carry through to multiplayer warbands, this is the first game I have played where I actually care to complete achievements, as they mean slight perks when creating your multiplayer warbands. But its additional motivation to play through all the factions.Which brings me to my final point. The multiplayer in this game is where I've had the most enjoyment. However you wont find anyone in the games public matchmaking system. In order to get a good multiplayer experience you must join the Mordheim Permanent League, (experimental permaleague in steam groups). In this league players create a new warband and exclusively play that warband in league games. This makes it so nearly all the resources you accuire are contested by another player, making those resources actually feel like they have value because of that. The league rules are set up so players match warband experience levels in multiple ways so play is never terribly lopsided.If you enjoy turn based strategy, have the gumption to take one on the chin in a bad situation and keep fighting, are a fan of Warhammer tabletop, or best case scenario all 3, then I can't recommend this game enough!

												i love warhammer in general, and played the table top game (and Warband before it) which is a good time and close to this, but i dont really have much fun with these random number generated pc games anymore.  Just always feels like the ai gets what he needs every time, and i get borked.  also visibility is just a headache and not something that was in the tabletop obviously, and will lead to some disasters that have long term implications that the ai doesnt have to deal with.  I dont mind perma lose, but the feeling of getting forced into it when you shouldnt otherwise was just a bit frustrating for me. game has decent graphics and mechanics otherwise, the missions can be fun, altho if you dont know what the objectives are ahead of time you are going to get hurt which can be particularly painful after doing it perfect, then having to run around looking for an objective for hours then the ai spawns all over the map and wipes out your whole party and kills multiple members for good that have otherwise never made a mistake.I keep trying to get into this game, and just playing through my loses, but when you start feeling jacked and the problem starts compounding because you are now missing a vital element from your team the frustration just increases exponentially for me especially when combined with the problems above.also the object of the game is slightly more confused in this format, and not really digging how they did the dlc's...

												Sadly i found this game to be extremely unbalanced and just downright boring to play since you kept being slaughtered and since your war-band gets negative buffs things only got worse and worse and it feels like the developers are going out of there way  to make the game feel unplayable for  a new audience.  I really tried to get good on this game but when you constantly get surrounded every single game when your war-band gets places randomly across the map and your enemy are all assembled and are going to pick you off one by one ( since the AI does not care about the in game resources). It is not a good kind off balancing when you keep getting screwed over and since there is little to no tutorial you cant know what you are doing wrong so you can learn and therefore get better. What would make this game much better would be a hint page in a corner that tells the player that they for example should aim to get better armor and so on. Right now i would only recommend this game to those players who have a high tolerance for BS and like to learn by losing and get better that way because this game is real gorgeous and feels like a warhammer game.

												Great game TONS of depths! Most of the reviews you see are complaining about difficulty in the game. This game is extremely unforgiving and the AI is smart. I HIGHLY recommend if you're a fan of strategy and tactics then you need to pick up this game just be warned that this game is unforgiving it will punish you extremely hard for making a mistake, like loss of troops *perma death or injury or having to restart your game.*Now with that being said when you buy, I recommend that you look at what warband would be good for your play style and possible pick up that dlc, I prefer the undead/Vampires. Pro:Difficulty :Tactics and strategy :Map layouts and variation of objectives::Tons of different warbands to choose from:Fully customizable troops and heros:Warband management's beyond combat   Cons:DLC DLC DLC:RNGI got the game on sale and when all the DLC were on sale.Over all if you love games like:Xcom with Iron Maiden mode turned on then this game is for you.If you hate games that:Wont hold your hand or tell you what to do or let you turn down the difficulty then this game is NOT for you.

												Full disclosure: I am a huge fan of the tabletop game.As a video game, Mordheim has pretty much everything that I look for. Great setting? Check. Player agency on progression? Check. Turn-based strategy? Check. Customizable characters? Check.As someone who adores 4X games (which this is not one, but there is some crossover) and old-school RPGs, Mordheim is awesome. My only complaint is the lack of warbands. Hopefully that will be remedied over time. Carnival of Chaos is a must-have addition.			"

Early Access Review
								Really, really, really wanted to enjoy this game, but there is just way too much RNG, everything is RNG. I love the fact your characters can get injured and you have to manage your warband, not just throw them into repeated combat and I don't mind having rolls on my attacks, my dodges, my spells, the things that I understand mordheim and games like it are all about but in a game where having a small advantage will win you the game having character placement down to RNG is just insane. Start the game with a character a little too far away or a little too close to multiple enemies and you've immediately lost before you've even started, sure you can fight, try to group up but the point is that tiny bit of RNG completely influences the rest of the game. It feels as if any choice I make is overall irrelevent because the match started with me a player down. The RNG on routing also drove me crazy, multiple games I have played now where when it comes down to it I was the obvious winner, but my team surrendered because a random henchman in no tactical position at all who I pretty much sacrificed to ensure me the overall victory died. I've had teams rout when they're still a player up, 3v2 with higher health and better equipment than their opposition. Theres just far too many RNG influences in the game that take the overall result away from the players control, it feels as if no matter how good or bad you play the result is mostly decided from the initial starting positions, if I get the jump on the enemy I'll win, if I don't I'll lose. That wouldn't be so bad if ""getting the jump"" involved pulling them into an ambush but it doesn't, it involves getting lucky enough to start in useful positions. TLDR: If you're the kind of person who doesn't get frustrated by losing a game down to a couple of bad rolls in the first few minutes of gameplay then this game is probably going to be enjoyable for you.

There is a learning curve and the game can be brutally unforgiving while you're learning the mechanics, but  definitely worth it for any Warhammer fan. The progression and customisation system for the warbands is great, but be prepared for permanent injuries including missing limbs...			"

												Terrible UI. I cannot stress this enough. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥iest UI i have ever seen. It is so♥♥♥♥♥♥that playing RTS games on a console would be enjoyable compared to this♥♥♥♥♥♥Then there is the arbitrary looting system. You have to loot stuff while you are in combat because when your enemy is defeated your team decides to go home. Oh hey we have killed everyone that opposes us, better not loot anything. It is crap to enforce a system like this to impose feigned difficulty when it makes no sense. You have to leave enough enemies alive to loot their dead comrades. Makes. Perfect. Sense.The AI cheats. Big whoop: 6 misses in a row on an 80% chance to hit? No problem! Said enemy then goes to succeed ""all alone check"" and kills two guys. Oh and this is not a one time thing. It happens pretty much every second mission. The AI also always knows exactly where you are at all times.The game is also glitchy. Full of nonsenseical ""mechanics"" that really seem more like bugs than features. The collision detection is bullcrap, you get constantly stuck on edges. The camera glitches out of view. I could go on...Did i mention that the RNG is crap? Have i said that the UI is the equivalent of playing a driving game with only a mouse? Have i said that the game masquerades as ""hard"" by having really ♥♥♥♥♥ty design?There is one more thing. You are stuck in third person mode, you can check the map but the third person view handicaps you severely, you cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game would actually be better if they scrapped the graphics and you only played from the top down map.Do not pay money for this DLC cashgrab ridden pice of crap.

												This is a.... weird game. After more than ten hours of play I still can't decide if I really like it or not. Party management is a lot of fun and quite compelling, but the actual combat in missions (which is what's going to take up most of your time) is kind of boring. Especially in the early game combat is just a slugfest to see how the RNG likes more, once you start getting skills and spells it changes a little, but it essentially still boils down to a melee slugfest 99% of the time. The races don't feel distinct enough, they have a short list of 6 unique skills (3 active, 3 passive), their own spell list (none of which will make you go WOW LOOK AT THAT MAGIC!), and skaven and sisters have a few unique weapons. Other than that though all races share basically everything, I think the devs missed a huge opportunity by deciding that every race should have a warband of exactly the same size, which is one of the biggest deviations from the tabletop game. Only having four races too gets boring to play against.So I think in the end I don't know if I can reccomend this unless you're a big fan of the old tabletop game and are willing to give up some concessions to have a video game that's fairly similar to it. Someone looking for a deep tactical game would probably be better served looking elsewhere at something like Valkyria chronicles as the RNG is the sole determinant in combat and it can be INCREDIBLY swingy.  The party management is great, and if you're super into that kind of thing you might like this game, but it does feel very, very grindy at times.			"

												Short version? it's fun, and a definite buy with friends to play it with.Long version, Mordheim is a game that really tears me up, on one hand, the emotional side of me gets attached to each character, you can customize each one with a flurry of options and even write your own biography for them.  On the other hand, if you actually use them and they are put out of combat (happens pretty often by the way, even if you're experienced a bad RNG for a match can still ruin your day.)  then they could get brain damage, lose a limb, an eye, get a permanent wound, or even straight up die, which really breaks my heart when I spent so much time making them into a real character and then firing them because they got hit so hard they don't even remember where they are in the next battle.So, if you like emotional heartbreak and aren't afraid to use a little imagination, definitely a game for you.While the RNG can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, its usually fairly balanced and you'll get an extremely good game for each extremely bad one.  The game plays A LOT like XCOM, just in a very different setting.  To make things even more fun, it plays like XCOM does on ironman mode, with autosaves aplenty and no save scumming (or at least minimal) so what you do actually means something.So, if you like XCOM, and want a challenge, go for it.But maybe you really hate the fact that there's no progression in XCOM, that every game means you lose all your previous progress, well well well,  Mordheim's got you covered.  They put in a ""Veteran System"", which basically means the more you play, the better each new warband you make gets, crazy stuff right? So if you like progression throughout an entire game and also through each one of the warbands you create. you know what to do.You like choices?  Well, there's a few.  Sure, four warbands may not be a ton of choices, but like the rest of the choices in game, they actually matter.  Each different warband actually has an entirely different storyline, that's baller!  I mean, that makes the game like, 4 times more replayable, at least!  Not to mention each warband looks and plays distinctly differently.  You may play your sisters of sigmar like tanks, and your skaven like rogues, or you could do it the other way around, I don't judge.So if you like choices, yup, this game is the way to go.Maybe you hate difficult games, well then this is tough for me to recommend, but I'll do it anyway!  In fact, you should recommend it too!  Grab a friend, name a warband ""The Salvation Army"" and feed your friends to your heart's content!  Easy mode has never been so, well, easy!Want something easy? Yeah, mordheim even has that.Or maybe you wanna show off the greatest warband that has ever existed.  Can't get enough of rubbing it in your friends faces that you wreck everything, but don't want all your grade A units to come back from a battle beaten and bruised? Oh man, guess what?  Yeah, morheim's got you.  In exhibition mode you can crush your friends warband without actually destroying it for real, proving you're the king of the city of the damned (for whatever that title is worth.)Like to brag?  Do it.I guess it wouldn't be a review without a bad section though, I'd like to see coop 2v2 warband matches, I think that'd be cool.  Then you could mix up your strategies and build warbands around support, I'd love to see some straight healers supporting another warband, it would bring a whole new perspective to the game.  The item interface is mildly annoying, the fact that you can't drop items and cant get rid of anything unless you put it in a chest is really inconvenient, especially on missions where you have to pick up certain items, but I suppose you could always just consider it another resource management tactical choice ""should I pick up this nice item? or use this character to go get the quest items?"" Finally, impressive units are insane, I have to push my whole team on one to even attempt to fight it, and if its friends are nearby they wreck me.  It's not even about luck at that point, they are just entirely too good at both offense and defence.  My whole team can barely take one out (relatively early game) and then they get to have 3 swings on my characters?  It's like the game is trying to wound my warband.So, get this game, and also, if you don't have friends, just add me, I'm game to feed you whenever.			"

												Mordheim is a great game with a few shortcomings. 


YouTube™ Video: Mordheim City of the Damned - Ep 1 - Company of Wolves - Let's Play Campaign 

			Views: 1,370		

			Mordheim City of the Damned - Ep 1 - We start a new warband of human mercenaries and join the treasure hunt in the city of Mordheim. This episode also explains the gameplay mechanics and tutorials.		

 The good thing about Mordheim is the atmosphere, graphics, dynamic feeling turn based combat, customization of your warband and RPG elements. The bad things are the clunky UI, poor AI and horrible long loading times. However, if you like games like Xcom and other squad based games don't miss out on Mordheim - It's still a great game!			"
