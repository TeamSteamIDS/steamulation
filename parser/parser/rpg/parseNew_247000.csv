												TL;DR:  Ignore the meta-critic score; ignorant reviewers shouldn't be allowed to review games.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Talisman: Digital Edition is an amazing adaptation of the original boardgame. I could write several pages about why this game is enjoyable to play, but there are a million reviews that can give you that.  Instead, let me explain why all of the negative reveiwers are wrong:1 - Most of the negative reviewers can't read.  I don't know how to put this politely, but it seems that 9/10 of the negative reviews I see about this game come down to the fact that the reviewer didn't understand how a certain card or area worked.  For example, they'll say things like, ""I couldn't use my Psionic Blast card in the middle of combat????"""" ... when the card clearly states when you can use it.  I'm sorry, but if you can't even read, you shouldn't be reviewing games.2 - Many of the negative reviewers are 'hung up' on the game's randomness; in their minds, this means that the game does not ""require any skill"".  Several reviews talk about the random nature of the dice rolls and card draws--you even have YouTube personalities getting uptight over the randomness--and they all try to make the same, idiotic argument:  that the game isnt' as ""good"" as, say, Dota 2, or League of Legends (where skill is required).  Of course, what they are trying to say is that, in their estimation,  the game lacks strategic depth.  This is, of course, entirely false.  While the game may be easy to play (not requiring much skill), Talisman has layers upon layers of strategic depth, in that the entire game is built around choice-based risk management and knowledge of the game.  You see, these YouTubers who have NO FAMILIARITY WHATSOEVER with the game--and thus no strategic understanding of what they should be doing--and are just throwing dice and drawing cards, at random, and then simply pronouncing the game ""dumb"", ""dull"", or ""without merit""--they're all just talking out of their asses.  They're like chimpanzees poking at a keyboard, as they make one bad decision after another.  And because the game isn't, say, League of Legends, they simply pass it off as crap.  Meanwhile, they raise up games like Hearthstone, etc.,  even though they are equally abstract and are driven by a similar kind of randomness.  3 - Talisman is difficult for many reviewers to even classify, much less actually review well, and for a very specific reason.  On the surface, the game is ""abstract"", much in the same way that other boardgames, like Monopoly, are abstract.  The game board is an abstract ""construct"" that you move around by random dice rolls.  At the same time, you are playing a discreet character, in an almost RPG fashion, with spells, abilities, statistics, inventory, followers, etc.  These two aspects of the game, when combined, seem to confuse many reviewers who are simply incapable of appreciating the game as a whole.  They tend to focus on one of the game's aspects, while ignoring the other (or getting confused by it), and then lay all kinds of criticisms without looking at the whole game.  These are reviewers who simply cannot ""pair"" the RPG aspect with the abstract, boardgame aspect, so they simply trash the game without a second thought.  I'm sorry, but if you're too stupid to understand a game's overall design, you shouldn't be allowed to review it.Don't even get me started on the negative reviewers/monkeys who can't figure out the UI.  I mean ... really?  The game can be played on an iPad, but you can't figure out how to use the UI?  If nothing else, that tells you what kind of reviewer you're dealing with.4 - The base game has its flaws, but with DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a really great game.  Some reviewers complain about the game's standard ending--and, I would have to admit, the standard ending, in its own way, is rather lacking, and it can certainly take a while for the game to conclude.  There are options to make the game end faster, but of course the negative reviewers again fail to mention (or even see) this.  More than anything, though, it's worth noting that, the game's ample amount of DLC provides a metric ton of content, from 20+ new characters to play, additional game boards/regions, NPC's, hundreds of new cards, items, etc.--as well as dozens of new endings, both revealed and unrevealed.  And more are coming, as Nomad works to ""finish"" and/or round out the rest of the game, so that it matches the full boardgame (with all expansions) developed by Fantasy Flight Games.To judge Talisman WITHOUT the DLC--which EVERYONE knew was coming--is just a huge disservice to the game.  I understand that reviewers are tasked with reviewing the base game on its own merit, but really anyone who is familiar with the board game will tell you that to review the base game alone is just a waste of a review.  With DLC, Talisman: Digital Edition is a great, very enjoyable, game, and any reviwer who ""trashed"" the base game--knowing that it was basically ""unfinished"", in a sense--is just ignorant, in my opinion.  They could at least mention the fact that DLC changes the base game completely.  Of course, none of these negative reviewers ever come back to re-review the game, with all of the DLC.  Like every good tabloid ""writer"", they're simply happy to skewer an easy target, and just move on.  It's shameful, really.  Anyway ....If you are a boardgame fan and are thinking about getting Talisman, and are ""on the fence"" because of all of the negative reviews:  Don't worrry.  Don't listen to them.  Just get the game.  And get the DLC as well.  It's well worth it.  The negative reviews are largely written by people who can't read, who only played the base game, and are so used to playing FPS games, MOBA's, etc., that they don't even know what to make of Talisman.  Their reviews are crap.			"

												Good old Talisman.. a board game, which could go on over days and in my childhood rarely found a real winner, ´cause we mostly killed each other, before anyone could reach the crown over and over again ;)So you need some time and patience if you wanted to play a session and this is in some ways is also true for the pc game.For once the game is still under constand improvement/development, as new characters and add-ons are released on a steady base, so the devs are also constantly working on bugs as well as gameplay improvements.The conversion from boardgame to pc is actually quite good and at the current state (including the Reaper, Frostmarch, Dungeon expansions) there is enough diversity to do several games, without always having the same characters/events.While especially with the AI, there are still quite a few bugs (no wonder, due to the wide possibility of actions one can take) it is working well enough, as is the multiplayer part which offers quite some possibilities, which rules the host will allow (and hopefully will soon get a save game function, as these games can have quite some duration, just like the board game).The graphics are well done, the sound is ok.So in the end i´m looking forward to the things still to come and enjoy the one or other session of Talisman (but would strongly suggest to wait on a sale for the Season pass, which brings some much needed variety).

												This game is the proof that Artificial Intelligence will never thrive on the human mind. We are resilient, we are focused, we keep on playing the objective instead of mindlessly hoarding items for the rest of our days. But Talisman isn't meant to be played against the AI.It's an incredibly fun game if you have at least two friends to play with. Please buy this game so I can pretend I have friends. It has huge replay value, a wide variety of characters and game modes, and even more if you buy the DLC, which isn't necessary, but I've done it anyways, because who gives a damn, it's my money, bro, don't tell me what to do.It's a lot like Game of Thrones, not in the sense that you can have sex with your siblings, but more like you can furtively ruin the game for other players out of nowhere, like it's Wedding day. You can also do that thing Bran does, but instead of becoming a cool dire wolf, you become a frog. You can still beat the game as a frog. God, I love this game.			"

												Another Dice and Board game that bring me back many years....When I first moved from china to canada 20 years ago.. 4 Games catched my attension instantly.1. Dungeon and Dragons. 2. Vampire the Masquerade3.  Magic the Garthering4. Talisman...Those games didn't need you sit infront of a Console or Computer.. Just grab a bunch of friends and start playing. They can go on for hours and hours without tiring and great test of your interlect and luck.I learned a lot of english from those games and without them.. I would have much bigger trouble blend in to english speaking society in school and in community.Sadly years has past.. The only game I still play out of the 4 is Magic the garthering and I can only do it with a few friends whenever I go back to canada.Today my passion is in computer games. And I been collecting and playing more games then ever before...Imaging my surprise that I see Talisman for sell on steam! The day i brought this game.. is the same day that i brought season pass. This game plays exactly like how it was 20 years ago and suck up an insane amount of time each game...6 player.. 1 board.. May the Dice God Smile upon you!9/10 for perfect adeptation, wonderful music and even OP characters and cards!			"

Do you love:   *board games?   *fantasy settings?   *roleplaying Games?If you answered ""yes"" to more than one of the above, go ahead and buy this game while it's on sale. You'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. To everyone else, I must say...Talisman is a hard game to recommend. My partner and I enjoy playing and we laugh hard at the antics which play out over the board, but there are still way too many things not working as intended, too many bugs, too many instances where the user interface doesn't do what you may want it to do.They're charging a lot of money for content that isn't even created yet, and the stuff that is already there often does not work as advertised. I've had a lot of fun with this game, but as yet it still acts way too much like a beta version for Nomad to be charging full price.I can recommend this game only to hardcore fans of the genre like myself. For everyone else, I'd have to say... wait for them to finish the game and maybe get it on sale at a deep discount.			"

												I grew up playing Talisman the boardgame, so it is a real piece of family nostalgia. I'd heard about the digital edition quite a while ago, when it first entered the Steam greenlight process (originally as Prologue, the single player edition). I've followed the progress up to the point where it was released though Steam Early Access and then jumped at the chance to get it. I've had a real blast playing both the Digital Edition (just against AI opponents at the moment) and playing the Prologue (single player variant game). My wife also expressed interest in playing it again (either Board version or Digital edition) so we gave local multiplayer a try using Steam Big Picture on her laptop, hooked up to our TV, and passing a mouse between us. It was a lot of funIf you've ever played the boardgame, then I highly recommend the digital version. The game is faithful to the original in virtually every respect, with the addition of the Prologue single player edition which makes for a very enjoyable single player experience. There's no online multiplayer in the early access version yet, but it is coming in time for the full release of the game.If you've never played the boardgame, but are interested in fantasy themed adventure boardgames, then track down the Demo of Talisman Prologue (http://www.talisman-game.com/prologuedemo/) and give it a try.

												I have only played the Video game version, I never even heard of Talisman as a kid probably because we were all into Dungeons and Dragons original paper and dice game. I have played extensively on This Digital Deluxe version of Talisman now and can render the following Analysis:Keeping in mind that it IS still in Pre-release stage overall it is an enjoyable gaming experience one can play with the whole family (Up to 4 players). Pros: 1.) Simple to learn and play2.) Ease of use - the game is entirely mouse driven. One can play with the keyboard sitting on the desk, feet kicked up ... using only the mouse as you relax in your favorite chair.3.) In-game voice chat which can be muted by individual player4.) Fantasy based ... always a plus :)5.) Family Friendly - as long as you are not overly religious (Devils, demons, angels, undead etc are contained within) 6.) A Mandatory Random setting!!! The host can set the game to Classic mode where no perks (Runes) can be used and all class choices are random, this is an option missing from other games (DoTP needs this badly) Cons:1.) Glitches up terribly in Multi-player if someone leaves the game normally locking it up. (SP w/Bots works fine)2.) Game glitches if you alt/tab out to do something else3.) Re-playability isn't that good. It takes a couple of games to see all the spells and Adventure cards but once you have run through them once or twice, things tend to get repetative. They definitely need a wider range of spells and adventure cards.4.) Class balance isn't that good. Some classes are very noticeably more powerful than other classes and have abilities that give much greater advantages over other players (Prophetess and assassin come to mind)5.) Using AI's in Multi-player runs the risk of hanging the game up. Bots usually get hung up in the City at the alchemist and they go into an infinite loop and the game cannot progress from there but as of 1-7-2014 using all humans in MP games hasn't botched up unless someone rages quits .... which is common if the game is not going their way.Overall I would recommend this game as I expect all these problems to be worked out before its final release version.

												The short and sweet:  If you like Talisman, you'll very likely enjoy the Digital Edition.This game is exceptional when it comes to reviews - it's not actually a video game as such, but a digitalized board game.  So, you'll find that the majority of negative reviews are from people who don't like Talisman.  Well duh.  That's not to say all negative reviews are irrellevant.  You just can't trust the meta score for a title like this and people playing a game they already know they'll hate makes for some pretty biased reviews.  The Steam ratings and reviews are generally more reasonable, though you do still see this happening.So, are you new to Talisman?  New to board games in general?  No problem, simple way to see if you might enjoy it.  Youtube.  Go watch gameplay of the actual board game and/or the digital version.  If you find yourself wanting to take one of the seats and play - then this game is for you.  If it looks boring and you lose interest fast (as many people do with board games) then look elsewhere.  Lastly, I'm sure there are outliers.  People who like the board game but hate the digital version.  But, again - that should become obvious to you as you watch it played.I think Nomad has done an excellent job translating the game.  And as someone who has moved half-way across the world from their board game friends, it's a great way to keep in touch and get my fix.  Happy gaming!			"

												Digital edition of classic fantasy RPG board game, Talisman. If you know the board game and like it, think no more, you need this...what if you don't know Talisman? I still recommend it! Heed this, though: old school board games tend to have different sensibilities than modern digital games and it may be bit too random for your taste. If you can't stomach being on top of the world only for your game to be turned into ashes in your mouth because of no fault of your own or genius of your opponents, but rather pure chance of bad dice rolls... This may not be for you.That being said, people tend to look overly superficially and claim the game requires no skill. It's not true. Knowing what you're doing is half the battle. Yes the base rules are relatively straightforward, but there are many intricate synergies between your character and what's happening on the board, and seizing opportunities for such synergies is crucial to survival. More experienced or intelligent players *will* have enormous advantage over others.But yeah, the other half of the battle is pure random rolls and there's always a small chance your next card will be something like a basilisk that rolls a double and you just simply die there and then, on the spot, game over. Or if someone makes grim reaper pay you a visit and you roll 1, pay fate to reroll, and still roll 1... Amygdala deeply rustled and cortisol city, you can get enraged and it is not pretty.Anyway...It is quite a boon that there exist multiplayer scene for this game. Maybe not 24/7, but in reasonable European or American hours, it's not that hard to find a game. If you love the board game but have nobody to play with, digital version comes to the rescue and helps you to relive all those painful childhood memories ;) And all you need is base game; if any of the players who join your game have expansions, the host can turn them on, which is very nice. If your connection drops, AI plays for you until you rejoin but yes, you can rejoin, which is nice, too (though AI is only as smart as it has been programmed to be, if you know what I mean - live players can easily outsmart it but also make some stupid mistakes)The bad things? Very occasionally the game crashes unrecoverably for some reason (even if you rejoin it will crash again), but I guess it's no better than rolling a double on a basilisk or double 1s on grim reaper so I wouldn't worry too much about it and there's always hope it will be fixed. If you're a salty person, the game is generally not for you, as mentioned earlier.UI sometimes is not intuitive e.g. you can be quite puzzled when and how to cast a spell like Weaken or Freeze, or get confused and reroll a die when you actually wanted to pick one of the two outcomes in some situations.. only experience can help you here and hopefully fellow players if you ask nicelySee you on the Crown of Command, adventurer			"

												I've been playing Talisman since the original came out in the early 1980's. While my preference - out of comfortable familiarity - is the original, the modern streamlined version is just as good and certainly removes the hours of rules conflicts that inevitably arise.The computer version does this one better by enforcing a standardized ruleset, making games last (usually) less than an hour and a half. The computer's turns can be sped up, too, improving game speed even more. Purists will enjoy the classic rules while people who find the basic rules too hard can improve their characters through progressive upgrades. Numerous achievements also offer arbitrary if fun goals along the way.			"

												Genre - Games Workshop Boardgame conversionThe aim is simple be the first of four characters to get to the centre so you can slowly drain your opponents life, whilst trying to stop the other players doing the same. You can play against AI, local humans or online covering all bases. Items need to be found and kept hold of to get past certain points adding strategy. Battle is based on a strength or craft stat with a roll of the dice, winning battles can earn you stat increases. Character abilities are varied enough to tip situations to your advantage meaning you will want try different classes out. It is fun to go up against the AI and they offer a reasonable challenge without being perfect players! I have played two full games losing the first against three random(?) thieves but winning the second against a more varied group as the warrior (as always a recommended starter class!). You will gain runestones to give you a small advantage in later games (you can buy these but I would suggest earning them instead). I have now invested in the first expansion as the prices and playability seem fair even without a sale. Basically if you like Board Games with a Fantasy setting then get it!			"

												If you enjoy the boardgame this will appeal to you, but:I can not recommend to buy it.At the moment (Oct. 2014):- Gamebreaking bugs (Targeting of spells, followers who refuse to use their skill correctly, game Mechanics/activated abilities repeating endlessly instead of working only one time)- AI slow to move- UI that hinders more than it is helping- online quits destabilize the gameIf they fix this, it might become close to the real boardgame.But so far the developers seem more interested in producing DLC even while the main game is riddled with bugs.Read a little in the bugforum!Might give you a broader view of the game.

												Talisman: Digital Edition is an interesting game, utilizing a combination of gaming boards and cards, similar to hearthstone. It can be played as a single player with up to 3 opponents, or as a multiplayer game of up to 4 players. Having not played the actual boardgame I am unfamiliar with any differences in rules; However, as a digital board game, Talisman feels very much like a board game I would have grown up playing. I'm actually feeling nostalgic while I play it, perhaps I'll go break out my old magick deck and have a go later. Visually, Talisman: Digital Edition looks as one would expect a digital board game to look, but the detail is nice. I had fun playing this and for someone who enjoys board games, even digital ones I recommend trying this one out. I should point out you can play as one of many different classes, some of which you need to purchase to unlock, just fyi.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. I have only played the board game once before, but it is great to have a online version of the game.However, I have never been able to get through an entire online game without someone's client crashing, booting players from the game and having them replaced by AI with no way to return. This is extremely frustrating when you are 30+ minutes into a game, and you have to start over.For this, I do not recommend this game until this issue is fixed.In the meantime, the local mode does allow people to play in the same room, in a hot seat style.

												I feel compelled to write this review after reading a bunch of negative reviews on here. This game is fantastic! Simply put. 10/10 for a recreation of the board game. With many expansions, characters to choose, rules that can be turned on/off, and  many, many different endings/conditions for winning, Talisman is a new game each time you play. Some of the reviews are "" just roll a die and decide to go left or right..durrrr""... I wouldn't expect that traveller to ever reach the crown. There is heavy strategy that you can implement to put you atop the crown, or in the best position to do so. You can also not care about strategy at all and just have fun playing the game and the RnG of it all. However, if you are playing with seasoned players, be sure to try to make good decisions, calculate carefully, and take your opponents tendencies into consideration as well in order to succeed. Overall, this is a wonderful game of skill, luck, and fantasy all mixed into one. I hope you find this review helpful and I hope to see you in the quest for the Crown!			"

												One of the best boardgame-to-PC adaptations I've seen in years! I would happily recommend this to anyone, regardless of whether one was a fan of the original tabletop Talisman.Talisman: Digital Edition has HUGE replay value, owing to the random nature and variety of card draws, and the large assortment of character classes available. Each class allows (and often requires) you to approach the game in a different way. You can also customize various game rules before starting up a new game, which adds to the variety and replayability.The DLC is also strongly recommended. Each expansion adds a massive number of new enemies, events, items, classes, and additional rules. The DLC in this game is very definitely worth every penny! "

												To  buy or not to buy. If you have ever played Talisman the board game before you already know the answer. However if you havn't and you like fairly long games that have a progressive character turn base style, then you will like this game. I have played the board game for going on 20 years now and have all the boards and expansions from the version 2 line and love them. Many a roleplayer has played this game and in my opinion is one of the best and detailed board games out there.			"

												If you like Talisman, this is a great adaption of the board game!  The appeal of this game as a digital copy of the board game is twofold:  The computer manages all the fidely cards and components (plus no clean up or set up), and this digital edition is WAY cheaper than than the physical game.  Playing games with AI can be great too if you have no friends.If you have no idea what Talisman is but are intrested in this game, let me lay it out for you:  Talisman is a RPG in a box.  You pick one of a million characters with unique abilites and attributes and race against other characters to reach the 'crown of command', a game space that slowly kills all the other players.  If you kill everyone else, you win.  The thing about the crown is that its locked away in an inhosptable wasteland that your weak character will not be able to reach right away.  As a result, you gotta level up, fighting monsters, encountering events, and PVPing other players.  Awesome stuff.This game is not without its faults though.  This game is extremely RNG based.  Everything is based on dice rolls.  There is strategy in the game, sure, but alot of the time so many random things you can't control are happpening that you kind of have to just roll with it.  This is essentially the heart and soul of the game, so if this is unappealing to you, this game might not be for you.  Now personally, normally I hate games that are overly based on luck, but Talisman is great because it never pigeon holes you into situations.  Every turn you have a choice on which direction to go, where on the board(s) to travel, who to interact with, etc and these choices give you an illusion of freedom and often a way to blame yourself for your bad luck.  Went into a cave and got ♥♥♥♥ed by a dragon at level one?  Should have gone to town, your opponent would have got the dragon instead.  Now, this game does have a 'fate' system that lets you reroll dice, giving you some control over your luck, but it can be hard sometimes to know when is best to reroll and sometimes you can just reroll bad rolls again(dice rolls are seeded at the begining of the game, so reloading doesnt work).This game does a great job of always giving you something to do and work towards, and the various expansions give lots of variety and alternative scenarios.  If you get this game I highly recommend some of the expansions (get the season pass on sale to get all future expansions cheap), specifically the reaper and the corner boards. Before rounding out this review I just want to provide a shout out to the company that made this digital adaption, nomad games.  Originally I thought this company was just porting this game from the ios and wouldn't care for the quality of the game post release.  How wrong I was.  Not only do they participate on the forums frequently and respond to posters, but they have even developed and distributed free content based on customer critisism.  This is very rare these days and exremely praiseworthy.Objectively Talisman isn't the greatest game ever made, but I seriously love this game regardless.  It may be luck heavy but the experience of travelling around the board, collecting loot and getting stronger before racing to the end against other players is great.  Laugh at your friends as the dice ♥♥♥♥ them, then cry out in amazement as they get the luckiest card draws, but most of all enjoy the ride and the emerging narrative that the game provides.			"

												Pretty good implementation of the board game. If you are a fan of the original and crave some old school RNG-ridden and nostalgia-coloured Talisman action, this game will provide a satisfying experience, especially since you can play solo (with bots). AI is ok, although uneven - sometimes surprisingly competent, sometimes disappointingly dumb. Digital version is obviously only a shadow of the social tabletop experience, but certainly beats the cardboard version when it comes to game setup time. ;)About the only thing I do not like is the reactionary spellcasting system (casting spells as reaction to certain events), which is rather clunky - although I have no idea how it could be done better and not bog the game down.

												This game was a blast and provides a fun way to play the board game without the hassle of trying to get all the equipment together to setup, and then breaking it down again after the game.  Very entertaining versus the AIs, and even more so with devious, thinking individuals at the helm.  I enjoyed the heck out of the game.  I wouldnt be playing 24/7 but its a nice switchup for a bit of fun with some of my other friends that also enjoyed playing this game table top.Updated after purchasing all XPACs.Recently with the additions of all of the expansion packs, I have experienced NUMEROUS errors/glitches/and bugs playing the game. Considering that the game can run upwards of 4 to 5 hours for a group of 4 that are enjoying themselves, to have the game screw up (client/server crashes for one or all players, yes both have happened to me and my friends) and be unrecoverable is inexcusable seeing as you lose all your experience for the game. At times, spells do not function as stated, Objects do not work properly (as stated on the card), etc.  Sadly, I am changing my recommendation to NO until the developers address the issues.  I am hoping a developer will read this and address the bugs.Update the the newest xpac:Warhorse STILL does not function properly although I do enjoy the new content.  Again...until SIMPLE game mechanics are corrected, then I refuse a thumbs up.			"

												I absolutely love this game! I played the original board game for years whenever I could get enough people together to sit down and play, which wasn't often. The Digital Edition compares to the original very well. You can play whenever you have the time, and if friends aren't available, you can always play against the computer. The house rules allow you to add certain elements to the game those of us who have played the board game have been using for years. Although runestones were not a part of the original game, they are fun, and if for some reason you don't like using them, they are completely optional.This game is my favorate download from Steam.

												Just as amazing as the physical board game, if not better because there's no fighting over rules or diving into the manual of a rulebook. This gamei s a great way to play with friends new and old, perhaps your gaming group can't make it to the table as often as you'd like? Or you're just looking for something small and light hearted to play in a night, this is the game for you. The core game alone is replayable time and time again, but if that's not enough for you then Workshop games has announced they are going to be bringing all of the physical expansions into this digital edition, so you will never run out of new stuff to play with.

												The AI is woefully inadequate to the point of making the game totally irrelevant.  An AI player had 15 strength, 12 Craft and 3 talisma in its inventory and never attempted to even enter the central ring.  This was while I was at the crown of command.  Speaking of which, I spent more than 1.5 hours at the crown of command before finally dropping the final AI player.  This is the same AI troll with 15 strength, 12 craft, 13 followers and 15 items (after robbing the corpses of the other dead players), and all it did was go back and forth to healers.  I've played the original and we've always had trouble finishing a game in under 4 hours, and I've come to decide that it might not be us that is the problem.  Unless you are only going to play this against human opponents, give this one a miss.			"

												I have a really soft spot for Talisman, just like everyone who spent their childhood playing the older edition. The board game part still holds up, it's fun to play with your friends, taking stabs at each other while racing for the crown of command. Unfortunately that fun is hamstrung by poorly designed UI. Everything about it is clunky and irritating to the point where I can't be bothered to play this anymore. Here's a short rundown of the biggest offenders:* Looking around the map is awkward. You can't quickly zoom in on a location, see it's text or quickly browse the cards that are there. Of course you can do all of that, but it's not intuitive or snappy.* Timers are awkward on spells that have to be cast during certain phases. There's a mechanic where you mark a spell to fire when the trigger is available, but it can sometimes work differently than expected making you target the wrong player. Can be avoided by playing more carefully but it's easy to make a mistake.* Planning your turn while your oponnents are playing is nearly impossible. The camera will constantly snap back to the current player showing them move. You will also be presented with the reverses of cards every time they're making a decision effectively blocking your screen because why not. You can't basically do anything useful while it's not your turn. It plays like a online enabled hot seat game. This leads to a lot of downtime and makes the games drag on unnecessarily.* In-game handling of people dropping out of game for whatever reason is♥♥♥♥♥♥ The AI automatically takes over for anyone who loses connection so unless you react quickly enough and save they will lose their turn to AI doing some dumb stuff. Also there is no way for a player to rejoin without reloading the whole game. To top it all off the game handles reloading a saved multiplayer game automatically without you ever seing any menus (like say 'chose a saved game to load'). It usually works fine but can (and has) lead to losing your savegame. It makes me really sad to recommend meeting for the board game version or playing on tabletop simulator over this version. "

												Excellent game, a perfect port for it's tabletop version where you end up forgetting to move the Reaper! Nomad games is atm still stuggling to fix all the bugs, but as they stand they are somewhat tolerable. Cons: -Very frustrating game. Make plans for when your plans fail out of pure misfortune. Not to the faint of heart.-Spell system is clunky-Requires DLCs to be playable (The standard ""crown of command"" victory condition is UTTERLY HORRIBLE. Notice how many negative reviews complain about it, while not having played any DLC?)Pros:-Will teach you to grow a pair of balls and deal with your frustration. Stop being whiny and keep trying. Builds character.-Vengeance is sweet (Game actually has an achievement for when you take revenge). Just be mindful that your own plans of revenge may grow too time-consuming! Would you rather eliminate a player or win the game?-EXCELLENT DLCs. Really, they are worth every penny atm, as long as nomad doesn't screw up in a future update.-You can be a jester.All in all, a thumbs up!Edit: Grammar.			"

												This game isnt bad for a little casual game. Though I heavily recommend playing it with friends otherwise it could be boring with just AI. But dont get me wrong! It can still be fun alone, but more fun with friends.I like the network ability to play with friends, however you can also do local multiplayer which is nice (Same computer). My favorite is how nicely this works on my Windows 8.1 tablet. Works flawlessly with touch controls (I think the game was designed with touch in mind it works that well).If you're not a fan of what basically is a turn-based fantasy boardgame / cardgame, this game isnt for you. If you like that stuff, I recommend checking this out.			"

												First off I hate Games Workshop and their unscrupulous buisness practices over the past few years. However not knowing they aquired Talisman IP when I purchased it, I do not regret that purchase. They know how to make excellent functioning video games. Dawn of war was great, blood bowl as well, and now Talisman. A faithful conversion from Board game to Video Game, its better in many ways to the board game in that turns fly by without needing to restack the deck you all knocked over or losing cards to the floor. It streamlines everything that needed streamlining and was faithful to everything needing to be faithful. They did good.			"

												I've played the boardgame once before. I've played this version once or twice now. Here's the pros and cons for PC. Personally, I love and I'd recommend it. I actually made a game sort of like this when I was in school, before I knew this existed. Pros -> No lost pieces.> No questionable owner / source of rules if pieces or books are missing. Even comes with a ""house rules"" setting if demanded or the sake of extra fun or defense of some paradigm.> No potential mess, lack of space, or damaged cards and pieces.> Easy tracking of statistics and view.> Easy access to other players.Cons -> Cost: Now you and your friends need to each own a copy, both the game and the DLC. HOWEVER, there is a local multiplayer so this could be ignored if everyone treats it like a ""party game"".> No Freedom: If you wanted to make your own game mode or something of that nature, this isn't a table top simulator; this is actually the game so you would actually be playing the standard iteration.

So I found this digital version, and I gotta say I was extremly satisfied with it and had a lot of fun, both in single player (friends in the same computer) and of course online.

												A terrific game plagued with negative reviews because of the shakey multiplayer connections. As a single player game, Talisman: Digital Edition is a wonderful and addictive experience. The combination of RPG + board game + card game sounds like a lot of convoluted chaos, but instead, you are presented with a *very* easy to learn masterpiece of a game. The art style of the cards is very professional, every interface is beautifully polished and simplistic so you don't get overwhelmed with information. When you first begin a game, you are presented with an assortment of helpful tutorial tips which explain basically all you need to know, while being able to grasp the rest yourself. There are so many characters to choose from, each with differing and very intriguing special abilities. As far as multiplayer goes, I haven't had any issues playing online with my fiance in the same room, but playing with someone in a different part of the world, that's when I began to have problems. If your main concern is playing online with real people, then perhaps you want to keep your money, unless it's local (hot seat type play) LAN type network. For singleplayer, I 100% recommend this game, it is beautiful with only minor glitches, and you will really wonder where the time went. I'm not normally someone who can sit and play the same game for more than 30 - 60 mins at a time, and I've already sunk over 8 hours into this game in the last three days. I certainly look forward to playing more!			"

												If you like the boardgame this is a very good implementation of the board game.  Do be sure to snag all of hte expansions if you have a chance; they're worth what they charge for them.  If you don't like the board game or don't like board games (or board games with a fair amount of luck in them) then you won't enjoy this game.  A few minor rule changes had to be made for this version, and there are a few cards that are different from the base expansions.  IMO the character packs aren't worth the money if you buy the expansions, since the new characters aren't well-balanced and the expansions have plenty of other charactrs to play.  The AI is weak, although it has improved since launch.  I win nearly all of the time against 3 AI players (you can have up to six players total), but collectively they usually give me a run for my money.  Of course, if you have someone to play this with, that's even better because setting up the board game and its expansions is a chore that the digital edition let's you ignore.  Some interesting house rules are included as options.  Overall, if I wasn't into Talisman: The Board Game I probably wouldn't buy this unless it's offered at a really steep discount.  If you're into the board game, then it's well worth the money, especially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												This game is fun to play, but in my oppinion - and for me personally - I bought the digital version to play when I'm alone. For playing with others, I got the board game, irl-edition.But the AI is messed up. In general tactics, they are great, but it seems the AI is entirely unaware of their ultimate goal in this game. The AI-players don't even try to win, they get around and buff up until they are invincible, but what then they do with their talisman is using the alchemy spell to turn it into one piece of gold. So that's why I do not recommend it. It's hard to enjoy a game of competition when there is none.			"

												I remember begging my older brothers to play Talisman with me back in the '80ies. They rarely did (jerks). If only I could have had AI players back then!A very well done video game version of a classic fantasy board game. In fact, I prefer this version over the actual board game for three reasons:1) No set up or take down (which was very time consuming with the board game).2) You don't need to beg people to play with you.3) You can save it, so you don't have to play for six hour straight (if you don't want to).The only bug I can see, (and maybe it is just me) is that it seems that if you fate a roll you have a 95% chance to get equal or less-than your previous die roll. I once got seven 1's in a row using fate to reroll. (I charged back up at the graveyard.) It didn't matter if it was for movement or combat.Other than that, it has a TON of DLC which makes for a huge amount of replay value. The expansions always follow the same expansion with the board game so if you are familiar with the rules there there is no learning curve.Online multiplayer is a little buggy sometimes if someone has a poor connection, but that is probably universal. And the Steam achievements are pretty hard/fun to accomplish!I have no idea why Metacritic has this game at 51/100, it deserved a much high rating.			"

												Wow. At first i was just browsing around steam for some board games because i've always wanted a digital board game, then saw talisman on sale and caught my attention. At first when i played it i noticed it was very simple and easy to get into, doesnt take much learning for you to get started. The basic principal is just to walk around the board and get stronger until youre powerful enough to get into the middle and win, and along the way you fight monsters and also other a.i/players, its not as complicated as it looks. I managed to get my best friend to buy the game and bamm just like that we were addicted to it and stayed up playing till 3-4am. Bare in mind that a single game from start to finish can take a whiiiiiiilllle. Our average game lasted about 3-4 hours, but u can always save and come back to it later.So far on my end(windows 8.1) i have not encountered any problems whatsoever. But my friend on his Mac kept having crashing issues, such as crashing when i would invite him to play, and also he would he ALWAYS crashes when the game is over, stopping him from getting any experience points.I highly recommend this game if you're slightly interested. Just buy the base game, and if youre wanting for more you can always buy an expansion pack here and there. But if your sure youre gonna like this after watching a few lets plays, then i recomend just getting Season pass, you'll save money in the long run as there are a few more expansion that have not been released yet.and btw, if you end up getting addicted like me, get the app on  your phone. so u can talisman while taking a sh*t!

												Incredibly glitchy.This game would be fun to play with friends if it worked on any concievable level. It crashes randomly for the whole group, and you cannot rejoin if you get dropped. If even one player drops, the game glitches for everyone and won't move forward. Commands will randomly not respond. Sometimes for minutes at a time. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It is, functionally, single player only.			"

												After a decent amount of playtime on this I can say that this is a fairly good adaption of an excellent board game.Talisman is an original luck based adventure game that is immensely fun to play with friends. Even though it is very luck based, there is skill involved. Mainly in the choices you make and the risks you take. But even with the amount of skill you may have in this game you can always still lose from a bad dice roll. While this might seem unfair, you should know that you cannot take this game seriously. It's meant to be fun and it really, really is.However, if you don't like dice in board games, this isn't for you.The amount of online players is slim but it's still possible to get a game as there are many long time players. That said, it's always best to pick a fourpack of this game and play with friends for the best experience.The two current expansions, The Reaper and Frostmarch are worth the extra £8, though I wouldn't pick up the character packs for £1.50 which only give you one bonus character unless they're on sale. [EDIT: Most of the large expansions, such as the Highland and the Dungeon are also completely worth the full price, though I'd still wait as this game goes on sale all the time.]			"

												This game is so... so long. It never ends folks. Imagine it like this. Imagine you are going to see the lord of the rings trilogy, extended edition, for the first time ever. You are so hyped. You pay real money for it. You sit through hours and hours and hours, and you are getting antsy and you need to get up but you really want to hang in there. So you come to the end, and frodo is walking into the volcano with the ring, only to find Toad there, who says ""Sorry Frodo, your princess is in another castle!"". This game is best played later at night, with friends, high, or drunk, so you can mystery science theatre it. Otherwise don't purchase.			"

												This game is SO ADDICTING! I have never played a table-top game (yes i know commence the eye-rolling or jaw dropping)....anyways this game is really fun to play with friends, it's still fun to play with just you and AI but honestly this game was made for 4 player co-op and not single player.This works exaclty like what you would see in a table top game. This game also features the ability to not only play as the various classes each one akind to their own set of playstyles  but also having your own set of rules and regulations for the game. Depending upon how well you set up your game a whole game can go on for hours without end.If you like table top games, having fun with friends, and having time pass by. Get. This. Game. Or at least wishlist it till the game pads out some of it's issues But i still recommend it! "

												Great conversion of a great board game. Some of the characters are broken (I am looking at YOU, Dark Cultist!), and some optional mechnanics are a bit hard to follow, but it's faithful to the origninal. Gameplay is just the right mix of complex and fast, with a lot of variety available once you add in the expansions with their new ending cards, extra mechanics and map zones.The DLC is both completely optional, and very reasonably priced. If you are just now buying it looks intimidating to get them all, but if you wait for a sale they can be had for 50-75% off which makes it more bearable. It's worthwhile getting all of them, especially the expansions. While the individual characters might seem like something you will never play, playing against them as NPCs still adds replay value to the game as a whole.			"

												Talisman is a solid board game that's great for party night.  You can also play it against AI, though it's a bit awkward at times.  And perhaps the biggest plus for me, you can heavily customize your experience as well, choosing victory conditions, house rules, etc.With lots of characters and customizable rules to choose from, it's definitely worth a look, if you like these sorts of games.

Got all the expansions and I am a keen gamer and poster on FFG Talisman forum with all the other Talisman nutters. The DE is great for playing against other free minded gamers. My only gripe is the rules are a little different to the boardgame itself - like the Limited Resoures Rule. But with custom game options and a good lot of gaming friends the multi-player rocks. Got to hand it to Nomad to take the leap and create this fantastic boardgame into a digital format. Bring on the expansions I say and let the Talisman flow. But remember I bags the Leprechaun.			"

Cross platform play has not yet been finished and I am looking forward to the ability to combine the two player bases. Prices on Steam should also be lowered to match Mobile version as they both are the same core game along with all the same expansion packs. The only con to most people would be that this is a ""Build a game"" with all of their expansions, the base game is good but not that engrossing. One major redeaming fact is that if the host has the expansions then all players will be able to play the expansions that are enabled by the host.			"

I have spent several hours playing this hotseat style with friends. I think that everyone should have a chance to enjoy this game.However, I cannot with good conscience recommend it with the online multiplayer in its current state. I have played with several different groups of people and without exception experienced massive issues in every game. Slowdowns, random bugs such as cards not being played or abilities not triggering, people being dropped from the game, the game freezing entirely, and more.The bottom line: Should you buy this game?NO - Unless you're planning on playing exclusively off-line multiplayer or by yourself, in which case it's the best digital tabletop game you can acquire on Steam.

												Monopoly-labelled-RPG.You don't have to think in this game, you just roll some dice and roll some more dice. You fight monsters and gain stats along the way(Just like Monopoly, THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO BUY THE PROPERTY- a.k.a fight the monster). This was one of the worst boardgames I've played, as it is linear, without any tactical sense or strategy required, and being 95% luck based clearly does not help.This is coming from a huge boardgame fan - having played quite a huge number of them (Descent, Arkham Horror, War of the Ring, Cosmic Encounter- to name a few). My Gameplay Session - Played a warrior, not knowing the rules, rolls some dice. Rolls more dice, arrives at the center early because it seems to be the goal- doesn't have to spend a brainwave to think. Realized that I can't get to the middle without an item, attacked an AI and got the Talisman. Arrived middle, then a 30 minute snooze-fest of rolling dice while the enemies heal up and die so very very slowly. I'm not saying that a good game needs to have some degree of complexity. I've enjoyed simple games like Ticket to Ride or Cleopatra, that at least its not a boring snooze fest. There is no immersion, I don't feel like a warrior, its just a label and gimmick, at the end of the days, Classes are just player modification that does very little to differentiate you from one another- you don't have to be smart about it, you just need to have half a brain and huge amounts of luck to do well in this game.I don't understand why this game has the ""Strategy"" or the ""RPG"" tag with it. It should instead be replaced with the ""Casual"" Tag. This game reminds me with many of the App games and certainly does not belong in these categories.3/10 "

Almost everything works fine, there are only few minor bugs with some cards. Definitively a MUST for those how know the board game and love it.

												I love big, complex board games. Until I don’t. I’ve played a lot of board games where I start out with a big group of friends and a lot of excitement to play. Four hours later, I wonder – will this game ever end? Talisman: Digital Edition is a very faithful port of the classic board game and allows you to play either online with friends or against AI opponents.I’ve played a lot of this since I bought it, partially because it doesn’t require that much attention. It’s turn-based so I can play while watching an episode of some tv show, or I can tab out to do other things. I really like when board games are digitized. Not having to keep track of a tabletop full of life tokens and counters and spells, or put them away at the end, is a big plus for me.If you like the Talisman boardgame, you’ll probably like this. It's well done and very faithful to the original.			"

												Firstly, this game stays true to the letter to its paper counterpart while adding several newly created characters into the mix. The game allows for several optional house-rules to modify the game, like you would do yourself, if you had the paper game.Secondly, the connoisseurs who dabbled in Talisman before will be pampered by the exquisite taste of this digital remake. The board game enthusiasts will surely find this cultic game to their liking before getting hooked for life.The nay-sayers who keep looking for patterns in dice rolls will build a tall strawman in front of them and get a migraine.And lastly, some will complain about the UI, some won't like the balance this game brings (or doesn't), some will go as far as to say the game is rigged against them, their loved ones and the Gods themselves when playing against AI who apparently cheats 5 times out of 4. But at the end of day you just laugh at those people and steal their Flail/Spellbook before casting a Misfortune on their Reaper roll.This game saves a great deal of physical space, many bags of gold and is still terrific.P.S. Wait for a 50% off sale and get the Season Pass. Money well spent.			"

												My journey in Talisman.Start game as Elf, and begin traveling. My Elf soon discovers that he has a nack for lifting, so he begins to Lift all across the land. He soon becomes the strongest Elf, to the point that Dragons immediately burn up and die by simply being in his presence. The Elf soon becomes known as Bicelf, master the bicep and all things body building. The Elf then notices that a stream of protein powder has appeared in a forest, along with a stream of life in a another forest. Enraptured by its beauty he rushes to the first stream with great passion ,and proceeds to travel back and fourth between the streams, mixing them into the ultimate protein shake, till there was not a drop left.However, while Bicelf the great was busy mixing his poretin shake, a Dwarf born of a noble lineage, decends into a pit of dispair in the tavern as he drinks his life away. Soon contracting every dicease, virus or cancer, from STD's to the common cold, as he performs many questionable acts within the tavern.However, as time passed he came across a ball, the ball of which whispers to him of darkness. This strange combination of ball and disease soon beings to manifest as a being of pure death, with anything the Dwarf touches dying soon after. However, the Dwarfs toxic powers cannot be contained with his small body, and begisn to leak out, poisoning the entire land, slowly draining the life from anything it touches, with nothing able to stop this cloud of death, and when I say nothing I mean nothing no healer, no magican not even a angel could heal him.Bicelf hearing of this taint on the land travels to meet it, and hope to end it. But the STD riddled Dwarf is a slippery one, eluding him at every turn, constantly keeping just out of reach. Unable to catch the Dwarf, the Dwarf proceeds to devour all who live, with the elf in hot pursuit. The Dwraf of whom chases after a strange ninja who, having lost all his honor has decended into killing innocent animals in the forest. Even becoming so desperate at one point, that he tried to turn his sword into gold. However, it failed him, leaving himself a sword that was one part sword and one part of what remained, but no one was interested in buying. My Elf in pursuit of the Dwarf of death, continues to turn dragons to dust under his gaze, and vanquishing all evil he finds. But, is still unable to catch the Dwarf despite his efforts. Seeing how much of the land is now currupted, and no other option Bicelf turns to the crown of power, deciding the only option is to wipe the world clean, cleansing the world of the Dwarfs curruption, who has now widely called, The Destoryer of Worlds.Bicelf begins his journey entering the inner region, melting the sentinal with a simple flex of his sweet pecks. Now, with his vast quantitys of mule's, a unicorn, the ring of power, the legendary crown of soloman, a battle axe, a mecernary who has follows Bicelf in the hopes of avenging his family, a alchemist (The same one who turned the ninjas sword to gold), some provisions, armour and most importantly the fabled talisman.Ready to go, Bicelf begins his journey into the wasteland. Back in the outer region, the Dwarfs power grows, gaining strength from the lives he consumes. He finally catches the ninja, devouring his strength and stealing everything the ninja had left. Taking a fancy to the ninjas armor. After a short journey my Elf reaches the doors to the great desert and begins his journey, in its harsh and unforgiving wastland. Soon after entering the wasteland, he runs into the Reaper, former lord of death (Second to the Dwarf). Death who, despite becoming second to the Dwarf still thinks himself the strongest. Hearing this, Bicelf is overcome with a masculine rage, declaring that nothing is stronger than he, and begins to beat the ever living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of death. The battle lasts for a few minutes, before Bicelf gains the upper hand, body slamming death into the ground, and crushing him between his sweet solid biceps. Having beaten Death to death, and having done a exceedingly good job at it, our hero continues his journey to the crown. However, he is soon met along the journey a pack of wolves, which with a simple flex of his masculine and perfect gluteus maximus, he turns into smears by the shear shockwave of raw power his gluts create. Now, with the crown in sight, and with a end to his journey in sight, he stands before the crown taking a moment to savor this achivement, thinking about the moment he'll purge the destroyer of worlds, and finally free the world. But, for a second he wonders if this is the right thing, since after all this will kill everyone not just the Dwarf. But, if he doesn't do it, the Dwarf destroy the world anyway. After a moment, and a quick workout (He does his best thinking while he bulks), he realises he has to do this, grasping the crow and placing it atop his head, so beginning the purge of the Dwarf era. The Dwarf however, whose power has grown beyond comprehension at this point, begins to feel the purge take hold, draining his life force. So, without a moments hestitation, he rushes to enter the inner region. However, as he comes upon the sentinal, he is struck down as the crowns affects have begun to weaken him. The ninja having been begging for money on a dirt path nearby, and seeing this opportunity, runs out and uses a magic spell he learnt back in his old dojo, destroying all the items the Dwarf had.As the items begin to fade into the infinite void, the ninja began to hear a faint whisper, telling him of the power of the dark ball the Dwarf possessed. But, despite the ninja's situation, his mind, though devoid of all honor still retains its strength, and he is able to resist the orb as it is finally over come by the void, and banished to its deapths. The Dwarf unable to reconsitute himself, thanks to the loss of his orb of power, and the purge draining his life force, begins to slip into the void with the orb, pulling his corruption with it. The Elf still wearing the crown, finishes the purge, cleansing the world of all life, including the ninja who was able to die with a shred of honor. Bicelf however, now being to the sole being in existance, begins to perform a righteous workout, bulking up to a godly level, and from his sweat life was born anew. Bicelf, no longer able to live among the world of mortals, writes down the events that have transpired, so that the future generations of this world could read of their creation. However, Bicelf could not stay for long as his muscles were so perfect and well toned, that he can no longer reside with the likes of mortals, since all who gaze on his perfect body would be overwelhemed by their shear power. Ascending to the relm of the gods instead, where he could become the god of lifting, inspiring a new generations of body builders.Good game 10/10, would purge the world of life to stop a insideous STD riddled Dwarf again.Play with friends if you want a good time.

												After a handful of plays, I've decided not to recommend this game. While it's vaguely interesting, it's massively dominated by luck rather than strategy, and plays at a snail's pace once you know what's going on.The default Crown of Command victory mechanic harshly punishes any player trying to win, effectively removing them from the game and having them roll a die every turn to see if they get closer to winning. During this time, other players can interrupt the lead player or heal themselves, build up their strength, reset the lead player's advantage, and then walk in and win an hour later. Luckily there are houserules that deal with this (instantly winning or disabling healing when someone reaches the Crown).They try to keep it interesting with the runes, which you earn by playing a lot. All the runes do is give you a minor, but unfair, advantage. Additionally, custom classes and cards which were easy to incorporate in physical editions are sold in relatively expensive DLC packs, leaving the core game feeling sparse.It could be fun as a lighthearted game with friends every once in a while.

												I loved this game on my ipad so i wanted to play on my bigger screen on my PC...lol... Only problem is the thing crashes ... ALL THE TIME!!!!... does this happen to anyone else?... i'll recommend it cuz i love this game, but i sent the crash dump reports to the developer, hopefully they can fix it, cuz like i said, every time i launch it, it crashes and locks up my machine and i have to restart...I'm adding this because i discovered the crashing problem was due to my old monitor and now that i have a beautiful HD 24 inch LED monitor with HDMI 1080p, this game runs beautifully and no crashes!!!... And with all the DLC, this game is just fantastic!!!.. I'm a hradcore gamer so i have a huge collection of physical boardgames, and i always wanted the REAL version of this game, but the cost for ithe game and all the expansions would be in the hundreds of dollars as opposed to the small cost of this, and the experience is the same and so much fun... again, highly recommended!!!

												Talisman is a fantastic card based board game with almost unlimited replayablity. You can chose either the standard ending or if you have any of the expansion packs you can select an alternate ending. You can even chose a pool of endings for the game to randomnly draw from if there is a particular ending you don't like, then you can exclude it. There is online multiplayer enabled but I don't tend to play in the public games so I can't really comment about that. The developers work tirelessly to correct any bugs and to improve the AI to provide more a challenge. The season pass that gives you access to all current expansions and characters also includes all future content so it's well worth the money. I love this game and cannot wait to see what further updates can offer.			"

												Despite the antics of that fiendish troll and the feuding of the foppish wizard and foolish druid I quickly ascended the ladder of chaos to become the undisputed superpower... for a time. Having played dice with Death, and won, I was quickly on my way to true dominance. The Crown, so near my grasp... was snatched away in an instant. The troll who had tried so long to surpass me, always failing, clearly made devilish deals with that prancing imbecile of a wizard. I was blindsided by a curse and I had to choose between the total loss of my considerable physical strength, or another roll of the dice. I rolled, and I was made a toad. For three long rounds. I could no longer carry my dazzling array of mystical arms and armor or my enchanted trinkets. My followers abandoned me, thinking likely I was simply a toad now and would remain that way. I was forced to enter the Werewolf Den, and there I was brutally beaten back to Death's Door. Then I was shoved back to the Crypts where, weak and confused, I was banished from the inner-realm back to that hell-hole of a city. Gathering myself, freed from the toady curse which had ailed me, I prepared to ascend the ladder of chaos and ambition once more. The damage however had been done; despite defeating the Sentinel in my weakened state and  battling my way back into the inner-realms, I was ultimately undone by the coniving treacheries of that damnable troll. He slew me there, having claimed all that I had lost. Only the ladder is real.TL;DR 10/10 - Would climb again.			"

												I've never played Talisman before and would probably never get a chance in my country, so digital versions do come in handy. I've played a few matches and although game is complex (great), rich and detailed (excellent) and full of amazing details and additional content (nice, nice, supernice), I've always had a feeling I am being cheated out of dice rolls. Even compared to Chainsaw Warrior, card game that really snuffs out the players 9 out of 10 times, this game always felt way too artificial under the colorful hood.Well now... I've uninstalled the game and reinstalled it today when I saw there's a Humble Bundle package with some additional content available for a low price. I was just about to buy and indulge in playing muted Talisman and listening to audiobook again when a buddy of mine made me read a shocking post by a developer himself. That post is available at Steam's community hub for Talisman: Digital Edition and it explains in detail the horrid decision of game devs that I really don't understand at all.The most important part is this one and no, it's not taken out of context:""At the start of a new game, a huge list of random numbers between 1 and 6 is generated. That list of numbers is used for the whole game, in the order that they are determined at this point.""I understand it this way - in the game based on factor of random dice rolls, you get a predetermined row of numbers which influence your moves. There are no true random dice rolls, no luck. Only a rigging generator.This decision truly crushes my enthusiasm to play this game any longer and to buy any new content. I am sorry, but I don't see any point of dice rolling when my game is (almost completely) predetermined. When I buy a game that relies on dice rolls, I want random dice rolls. There's no excuse for this sad state of affairs and although I never do this, I urge you all to vote this review up so people prove to the devs changes have to be made to make a great game - great.

												If I could tell you only one thing about Talisman, it's this: the first two hours or so were spent exploring the board, tussling with the other players, defeating monsters, stockpiling resources. The last two hours consisted of me rolling a die, hoping for a 50-50 chance result to come up a number of times. Every turn. Flip a coin. Next. It took me more than EIGHTY turns to finally grind everyone's HP down to zero. Max HP any one opponent held at any time? Seven. EIGHTY turns. I'd like a word with the playtester who signed off on that.This is a digital adaptation of a boardgame and as I understand it, it's quite a faithful one. I've never played the tabletop version, so I can't make any statements to that effect, but I'm happy to believe that it is. It certainly feels like a board game. Specifically, it feels like a board game from the eighties, and that's not much of an endorsement.Don't get me wrong, I want to like this game. I appreciate the idea of turning an RPG into a boardgame, but this is a very flawed attempt. The first part, where you're stocking up on resources (items, health, combat stats), the GOOD part, is still a tedious grind, due to the extreme randomness. Roll the die, move exactly that many squares, hope for a decent encounter, hope you'll pass that encounter, eventually advance a little bit, then hope the others don't gang up on you once you get ahead a little. Rinse, repeat.""But it's a dice game, of course there's randomness!"" Quite right. But that's not a get out of jail free card. Go have a look at Elder Sign to see dice randomness done right. The board is a significant component of the game experience, but in essence it's no more sophisticated than the board in Trivial Pursuit. The difference is that TP isn't about exploring the board, so it can get away with it. If you want to make the game about exploring the board, have a look at Legends of Andor and learn how to get a much more satifying experience in a lot less time.As someone who has played a lot of board (and card, and dice) games and a lot of role playing games, I can see the potential and the appeal of the concept, but I really can't recommend the actual product. I see reviews stating that it gets a lot better with this-or-that DLC, but my experiece with the base game doesn't make me want to spend more money on something that was thoroughly unenjoyable.Eighty bloody coin flips...

												Plays very faithfully to the current edition of the venerable board game, and makes a nice, inexpensive alternative for those unable to get up a group of gamers around the kitchen table. It's my first Steam purchase, and I'm glad I got it.That said, if you have never played it before, see if you can find someone who does own it either this or the physical board game.

												This is a review from a person who has collected and played the Talisman board game since its 2nd edition (Steam uses 4th ed).Talisman, the board game, is a game of funstration.  It is enjoyable enough to play, but you cannot take it too seriously.  It will delight you as many times as it will break you.  Talisman:  Digital Edition emulates this experience precisely.  I know some people have an issue with the RNG of this game, but when it comes to simulating the physical board game, I can say that it is spot on.  You will rarely roll the number you need to survive and you will often draw the worst possible card at any given time - just like the real board game!My advice to anyone playing this game is to play without the expectation of winning.  Play it as if it's a rogue-like, choose-your-own-adventure fantasy story represented by a board, some cards, and miniatures.  I guarantee that once you lighten your expectations, your playing experience will be much more enjoyable.  It is the very same mindset that my friends and I discovered when playing the physical board game.			"

												So I wrote a review of this game yesterday and did not reccomend it. My ultimate gripe was how tedious the ending could be. Flash forward less than 24 hours and the developer showed me that there is a setting that greatly fixes that aspect and also there are some other neat functions to switch up the experience. This is FANTASTIC. If you are playing the game on your own there is no limit to how you change the experience but when playing a video game you can only really do what you are allowed to short of modding it yourself. Letting players switch up the play to what they like is so fantastic.Super fun game and I really reccomend it, just be sure you check out the house rules!!			"

												I like Cardboards and I like Fantasy Settings. This game seems like a pretty good choice.But it has its flaws. Much unnecessary clicking, many delays. Games turn out to be very slow.Some people like to click for rolling the dice, but personally if no choices are left other than roll the dice.Roll dice -> choose destination (necessary) -> Survey the field (take cards) -> Fight the monster -> roll the dice for fight the monster. If only one step in this chain is necessary why not skip the other to speed up the game. I have no other choice to fight this monster so why do I have to tell the game I want to fight it and after that actually fight it with rolling the dice?There are many Animations (e.g. dice rolling, moving, game effects, battle) and no way to skip them. Try to play a game with AI enemies and after half an hour you get frustrated. You don't want to see them roll the dice. You wait so long for your turn and most of what the AI actions will not even concern you.But what drives me off most is the game mechanic. Chances for positive Events are not very high, its hard for your character to accumulate progress. And when you finally found items, compagnions you can have bad luck and loose everything by turning into a frog when rolling a bad number in the city. Or an enemy just casts a spell on you to reset your strength to the starting value so you cannot fight most of the monsters anymore.Of course every game has to have some negativ value to emphasize the positiv values. Its ok to loose an item, healthpoint or to wait one turn. But taking away so much from a player will make you rage. You can be at the very top and in the next moment you loose everything.This game is far from balanced and although I really like the setting this game is so unforgiving for any awful roles.I would not recommend it, though the real life version would be possible playable because of its faster pace.This game annoyed me like no other.

												Talisman is a great fantasy-genre board game! There's nearly an infinite variety of things which can happen in it, and lots of replayability! My only complaint is that on re-rolls, when you use fate, it seems like 80% of the time you'll roll the exact same number (out of a 1 in 6 chance)! It just seems highly improbable! Otherwise it's totally worth spending a few bucks for the game to see if you enjoy it, knowing that there's a ton of DLC to enhance it later if you like it.			"

												You need to roll a 2 to win, you'll roll a 1You need a 3 to win, you'll roll a 2, you reroll then you'll get a 1 or a 2 again.Meanwhile the AI continues stomping.It's just me being a sore loser? Nope my flatmate experienced the same when he was casting the command spell. Every other AI player was magically finding heals & protection spells left, right & centre. Once the wizard made it to battle his pirate in the centre, the wizard was working magic on the shield. The pirate was way above the wizard, but the wizard kept rolling 5's & 6's on shield protection for several turns in a row making him invincible. Buying enough time for that pesky Ghoul to turn up at the foot of the stairs.The execution of the board game to digital is great but the Die in this game is worthy of an online Casino. It really isn't random.Please fix. I've never rolled so many 1's & 2's in my entire life.			"

												I am a huge fan of the real world version of this game, but it is often difficult to get a large group of people together that are wanting to play.  This digital version is a great replacement.  It not only makes it easier to get groups together via the online play options, but even when no one else wants to play, the single player version is fun and challenging.  I bought a Season Pass for both myself and my wife, We were a little concerned about the issue with the Shaman character, but after emailing Nomad, they provided a perfectly reasonable explanation of both the limitations that Steam places on how they could do what they were trying to do with the charity drive, and why they had to do things as they had.  After speaking with them, we will not only be continuing to support this product, but also buying the Shaman character as well.			"

												Good game but it has a few issues that it could resolve to become great.The first: Allow players to examine the board. It's annoying having to wait until your turn to be able to do this. It becomes worse when there are adventure cards on the tile and you can't see what they do to plan ahead. It makes turns slower, which is unfortunately a bad thing in a game that already takes hours to finish.The second: Allow saving of games in multiplayer mode. Not being able to continue a game from where you left off is a huge minus when compared to the Tabletop Simulator version, especially considering how long these games can last.The third: maybe lower the price of the expansions/season pass a bit. I know it's cheaper if you buy it from the official site, instead of on Steam, but most probably won't check there.The fourth: Reduce the overall clunkiness/unfriendliness of the UI. Having to click a portrait to reveal the silhouette with a ?, then right click that, followed by another click on the portait in this context menu just to read a player's character sheet is annoying. The unbought DLC being similarly displayed as the purchased DLC isn't a huge deal, but it could certainly benefit from being made clearer. The same applies to spell casting. Making it more obvious that a spell is queued, or that double clicking the spell casts it without confirming it, would all go to improving the UI.Still a good game though. Pretty cheap if you only go for one or two expansions and the base game. Around £5 for the base game and an expansion or two is amazing value.			"

												I have Talisman 2nd ed. and all the addons to it and was very excited to see Talisman go digital! The little bit I've played the digital version, it's awesome! It's nice not having to set up all the boards and the game play is just as fun as the board game version. I look forward to more addons and playing this game with friends!! I highly recomend this game if you like a simplified role playing style game.			"

So much fun I went out and added Talisman the Board Game, along with those expansions, to my board game library. If you are new and want to get up to speed before jumping in, get the Talisman Prologue first. In any case, the full game of Talisman receives my highest possible recommendation			"

												Fantastic streamlined adaptation of the boardgame without all the fiddly physical set-up. Very addictive and lends itself to some pretty hilarious RNG comedy.Half the fun is working out all the neat little combos and map interaction between the different characters. The other half is praying to the dice gods for good rolls while wishing ill luck upon your hapless opponents. Play with a light-hearted non-serious mindset for the best experience!			"

												I am a huge fan of the real world version of this game, but it is often difficult to get a large group of people together that are wanting to play.  This digital version is a great replacement.  It not only makes it easier to get groups together via the online play options, but even when no one else wants to play, the single player version is fun and challenging.  I bought a Season Pass for both myself and my wife, We were a little concerned about the issue with the Shaman character, but after emailing Nomad, they provided a perfectly reasonable explanation of both the limitations that Steam places on how they could do what they were trying to do with the charity drive, and why they had to do things as they had.  After speaking with them, we will not only be continuing to support this product, but also buying the Shaman character as well.			"

												Talisman is mostly luck based, there isn't really any deep strategy involved but there is a reason why it's still remembered as a classic after 30 years. It's just fun (at least for a while).Unfortunately, there are some issues with this ""digital version"". It's glitchy and you have to fight the user interface more often than not: managing to cast spells at the right time so that they'll do what they are supposed to requires trial and error. Also the AI mostly runs around randomly looking for ways to commit suicide.Overall I give it a very cautious recommendation. If like me you're nostalgic of this game and probably won't get the chance to play the actual board game again, then it's worth it if you can be forgiving of the many little annoyances. "

												Like I said in my review of Talisman - Prologue: ""the game is like Game of Life, only you kill ogres and get cast spells instead of knocking up your crazy girlfriend from college and have a loveless marriage."" It isn't the most deep and well designed board game, it's a bit too based on luck and while it's easy and can take more time to learn than most modern euro board games. That said, Talisman is a fun game to play with friends and socialize. This adaptation in particular is really good and faithful to the original, with a lot of controls to create and enforce house rules, and there are many expansions packs for you to pick and them to release. Bots play well but they don't play to win and so single player can be a bit frustrating, so get your friends together or make new ones online.			"

												OK so first with the positive. Let me explain why, the game itself is fun and good. It is more monopoly and chance related than your choices but it is fun to play with four people. It is the board game, so if you enjoyed the board game it you'll enjoy this. Only buy it on sale though, because... the board game is around $40 and you can just split that four ways with friends if you want.Now to the negative.My problem is the game needs to be fixed. The spell casting is wonky, two DIFFERENT people with me accidently casted Immobilize on themselves because there is no Confirmation in some instances. When you play you'll get it, it is quite difficult to explain. There is also no Cancel button to take back and attacks or spells you use. This to me, is part of the fun with the game to scare/intimidate your opponent. Also, sometimes people misclick!Alright so I'll try to explain the spell casting. I have a spell called Psychic blast and it adds my craft to my strength for the fight. Except you for some reason can't activate it during combat? Unless it was qued up before? When it's qued any thing that triggers a fight will cast it, and sometimes you don't remember that it was qued and it goes off on something you didn't want. This is the same issue with Coutner Spell which is extremely frustrating. I counter spelled myself ) :If this element is fixed the game will be much more enjoyable.			"

												I am a big fan of the boardgame ever since I was a kid. I wanted this video game for a long time.I like the game but it has flaws. Here are some of them-It is way more stable then when it was early accsess, but there are still plenty of glitches to around especsially with spells and new characters. -There are alot of characters that I recognize and there are alot of overpowered munchkin characters that brake the game. It is good that you have the option to only allow core characters, but I would like if there would be an option to disallow certain characters like the Martyr, Black Witch etc.-I would like a workshop, so people could make custom boards, cards, characters etc. Even tough there is alot of content released, I would enjoy for example a mod where you can replace the art with the original oldschol art.-Even tough the game is a skill based game, there is alot of luck involved. At times it feels like you are playing the odds at poker. I like it but some might not.At the end tough this is a solid boardgame adaptions, with some flaws, but its fun overall. If you are a fan of Fantasy themed board games like Hero Quest or Descent give this one a go.			"

												Despite quite enjoying playing this game with friends if you're against the AI or random people online this game is the most frustrating thing on the planet... To win the game your character must stand at the Crown of Command where you get a chance to roll a dice, if you get 4, 5 or 6 every other player losses 1 life. I've just been stuck in a game for hours upon hours while a character with 8 life and a runeblade (Lets him heal 1 life whenever he kills something) stumbled around the board killing hoards of wolves, bears, bandits and anything else that he came across. Inevitably healing him up higher than the ""game ending"" spell could ever damage him. Utterly ridiculous, boring and frustrating.			"

												This game is a good representation of board game, but unless you're playing locally with friends, it's just not worth it.  I have a perpetual game going with one other AI player.  I'm sitting at the crown of command, where you need to roll a 4,5, or 6 to deal 1 point of damage to all other players.  The goal is to finish off the other players either before they reach the crown or just to finish the game.  The problem is that even when you happen to roll high enough to deal damage, the AI runs around the outside of the board and finds ways to heal themselves.  The AI has no interest in progressing to the crown and unless the ""random"" number generator allows me to roll high enough times in a row, this game will NEVER end.			"

												I had this misfortune of playing a short game of this with my friends who got it on the Steam sale. I have played a lot of Talisman and it already isn't a game I'm very fond of. Almost the entire game is luck. What you roll to move, what cards you draw, whether you complete combat, it's all a coin flip. The main test of skill is knowing when you've acquired enough random loot to try the inner layers of the board. It's a very light game mechanically. It's rare that other players' turns have effects on you, so there's a lot of downtime. It's a social game.The port is kind of a mess. Not only is the interface generally clunky requiring what feel like unnecessary taps to get to the information you want, but it's ported from the mobile version and clearly optimized for a touch screen, not a computer. For example, all of the controls are on the left and right edges of the screen where your thumbs would be on a tablet. It's a clunky version of an okay, very random board game.			"

A Tough Talisman to SellAs AAA games come out left and right, there are times when a simple board game with friends can bring just as much enjoyment as any multi-million dollar project.  Talisman: Digital Edition brings to the plate the concept of sitting down with three friends and experiencing the thrill of telling a character’s story through each roll of the die.  Though Talisman does bring a lot to the plate in terms of accessibility and content, frustrating mechanics and game-breaking bugs riddle what could be an above-average title.Talisman pits a chosen character against three players, human or A.I., in a quest to retrieve the Crown of Command.  To do so, one must obtain the coveted Talisman to cross the Valley of Fire.  Getting to the Valley of Fire is no simple feat, as one has to train their characters to withstand the demons, monsters, spirits, and other characters out to end their journey.  Each character comes with five stats: Strength, Craft, Lives, Fate, and Gold.  Strength determines how much damage you can do against strength monsters.  Craft shows how much damage you can deal to craft-based monsters, as well as your stat to how many magic spells you can hold.  Lives are your total life counter, when you hit zero, you drop all your items and go back to base stats.  Fate is your re-roll counter, use a Fate counter to re-roll for a better number.  Gold allows you to buy certain items from vendors, as well as bargain with certain monsters.The goal in Talisman is to beef up a character, retrieve a Talisman through either completing a quest or through prayer, and reaching the Crown of Command.  Doing so is no easy or short task, with most games taking easily over an hour to complete, depending on dice rolls and which cards appear.  Though the allotted time spent on one game may put off players, getting three friends in the mix most certainly makes the time much more enjoyable.  The accomplishment of getting a character to ludicrous levels and auto-killing dragons makes the long journey well worth it, especially when a character can auto-kill a friend’s character; the fear one can put onto people is wicked fun.But where Talisman shines with its cooperative play, there are many design decisions that can frequently darken the experience, mainly how luck-based Talisman proves to be.  Almost every move one does in Talisman is based off the luck of the die: movement, combat, everything on the path to victory relies on something completely out of control.  Items and objects can help the strain of progressing through the map, but there are spots on the board where one unfortunate roll can wipe away almost an hour’s worth of progress.  It’s almost as if Talisman does not want the player to win, opting more to continue progressing characters to no discernable end, something a game should never do.The most disappointing factor in Talisman is its abundance of game-breaking bugs and issues that plague aspects of the game.  Through the 11 hours I played, at least once every two games would freeze or lock into a game-breaking screen.  Whether it was being stuck in an item screen, the “roll dice” button refusing to work, or being stuck perpetually casting a spell, it’s a hard pill to swallow letting a game go one to two hours only to have to exit the game with no accomplishment or satisfaction for the time spent.  Talisman also has one unbelievably laughable issue with its Warlock Quests; Warlock Quests are specific quests, like visiting an NPC on the board, or acquiring armor, that fulfilling the quest will grant you a Talisman and get you on the path to victory.  If a player happens to acquire a Talisman and not finish their Warlock Quest, the path to get to the final section of the board will be blocked off until the quest is complete, regardless of if the character already has the prize at hand.  What’s even more baffling is there’s no way to remove a Warlock Quest unless the character dies completely, this is almost game breaking when a Warlock Quest like “Slay a Dragon” is in possession, leaving one to hope that they can find one to two specific cards in a 100+ card deck amongst three other players.  Situations like this become more common than they should be, and it’s a really sad ordeal to see a game come to an abrupt end after one can get so enveloped into their game.Talisman has every right to be a popular, fun, and engaging game to experience with friends and players online.  Each character plays a different role and each game plays out different than the last.  It’s just a shame to see such a bright experience be crippled by frequent crashes, freezes, bugs, and some laughable design choices that do nothing but encumber the experience.  As much as I want to recommend Talisman, I just can’t in the state it’s in and with the decisions it’s made.			"

												There are constant problems.  Timing of spells is the biggest one offhand.  You often need to play a spell at the start of the affected character's turn but, at least when playing against the computer there is often no delay between after one character has moved (signifying the end of the start of it's turn) and the turn ending meaning.  The queue system is very clunky and it is very easy to cast a spell/use an item too early, too late, or even at the completely wrong time due to it being playable at the wrong place in combat.Also you cannot look at the board outside of your turn causing you to waste time doing it on your own turn if you missed something.  In singleplayer you can look at the board outside of your turn but it pauses the game.  There is no sort of event log or even way to view the discard piles (that I am aware of) so often things will flip by and you'll have no idea what transpired and no way to look.  As mentioned in the comments there is an event log and it seems to have some good options for filtering.In multiplayer there are often problems where one or more person will be disconnected and you get to rewatch the computer play the same turn(s) over.  This seems to happen more often later in the game and w/ the city expansion but that's just my experience from 2-3 games.  Frequent crashes and glitches can cause players to miss the end of game meaning they get no in game credit or achievements for anything they would have earned there for potentially several hours of effort.There was a recent patch addressing many outstanding issues with the game.  End of game crashes most notably were addressed and I haven't seen that happen in the few games I've played since.  I haven't seen any midgame crashes either, but I have not tried playing with the city expansion again.One upside is the Season Pass actually comes with all the dlc with the exception of one which contributes to charity.If most of these problems were addressed I would absolutely recommend this game especially to fans of the physical game.

												Unfortuantely this reminds me why I never liked the table top version of the game. Any game is near endless and far too time consuming just to make it to the second layer. In real life you had companionship and beer to offset the downside of the game mechanics. You don't have that with this one. I thought they might streamline it, but they kept the cumbersome system. Unless you're real nostalgic for the old card game, skip this.			"

												UPDATE June 1, 2015: Pretty much all of my complaints below have been addressed. Very worthy version of the game, and well-supported.Perfect for getting the ""fix"" for a good deep board game. Currently (Dec 2013), there are still some bugs, but re-loading the game is quick and easy enough. Turn speeds with AI can be annoyingly long; animations cannot be sped up at all, etc. But, I cannot wait for further refinement and addition of the expansions. Good fun here.My only real complaint is around the core ruleset (rather than this presentation of it); I always felt Talisman had balance/refinement issues (i.e. too dependent on luck in general), but I suppose that's part of the charm. Some ""House Rules"" setting options would be amazing. Moreso would be opening this up to Steam Workshop... THAT would be truly incredible.			"

												I never played the original board game but I do play a lot of other GW games. Anyway I purchased this so that my wife and I could play on the local setting and I had already read a review from another player who games with his wife. One or two minor snags but I must admit we do have great fun playing this game and we are both totally hooked. We purchased it for a second laptop and now play online opposite each other on the dinning room table and must say we have never enjoyed a game so much.Very simplistic in its style and a lot of chance with dice rolls in the game, but with so many charactors to choose from this is great fun. My 13 y.o. has a laptop as well which unfortunately is being repaired at the moment but as soon as its back I am sure he will join so its great fun for all ages.Just a word of warning that games can go on to late in the evening, so if your looking for an easy to get into game that never plays the same way twice then this is a must have.

The game is a little buggy at times, but this is a beta game, and the devs work very hard at bug-squishing!I would like AI players in muliplayer games just to fill spots, but that currently isn't a possiblity.At the current stage in development, I give it a 7.5/10.

												As a longtime fan of the Talisman franchise, I will recommend the Digital Edition.  But not without qualification.  While an ably faithful translation of the boardgame experience, the AI is simply not challenging enough for veteran players of the game.  It's not that the AI will never win against a seasoned player.  It can.  But things have to go extremely right for the AI, and extremely wrong for the player, for this to happen.   Even with the wonky AI, I still find myself enjying the game.  And I believe most folks familiar with the game will, as well.If you've never played Talisman, the AI is actually a benefit, as it keeps the game from being too punishing to neophyte players.  It's not that Talisman is an overly complex game.  But there is a lot of information to absorb.  The starter set alone boasts over a dozen playable characters, all of whom have multiple special abilities and differing alignments; there are five attributes for each character; there are nearly one hundred event cards, spells, etc.  So you get the idea.  There's a bit to learn and the AI allows games to extend the learning curve.If reviews were given on a scoring basis as opposed to a simple recommend/not recommend, I would score Talisman: Digital Edition a solid 8.  In spite of the AI, the overall gameplay experience is fun for those who like board games or fantasy settings and there is a lot of replayability to be had. "

												I have been waiting for years for someone to finally release a PC version of this game, and I am not disappointed. Even though it is still in early access, it actually plays quite well with few bugs, and hopefully they will release the expansions that those of us that have played the original board game all know and love.

												I originally got this game because I watch D&D Stories- the youtube channel of TtheWriter- and he reviewed Talisman the physical board game. If you think of this as an adaptation that's easier to play with [due to no setup, no space needs, and you can give copies of the game to your friends] then this game... well, is amazing!There's a lot to take in, at first. Empty board spaces means random encounters, means fights with monsters or loot, or spaces that permanently will help or hinder whoever next lands there. You have many characters with special abilities to choose from-- or set everyone to random characters!The goal of course, is get a Talisman card while improving your character's stats through encounters and finding items. Best challenges like crossing a river, going through a portal, fighting demons, rolling dice with Death Itself... there is just so much inside this board game! Many paths to take, different ways to beat challenges.... You must survive the trials, and the other players- to make your way to the center crown... To hopefully kill the other players until you are the last man standing.That last part is essentially a 50/50 chance each turn, but there's an option to house rule it to make it finish easier-- such as making players unable to heal if someone is in the center, or just straight up make it a race to the finish.Did I mention that there's not a huge penalty with dying? Apart from other characters stealing your stuff- if you have a rough time you can totally respawn and bounce back--- unless of course, it's the endgame, and someone controls the Crown at the center of the board.In short, although there's no take-back option if you select the wrong spot to go to--- or Queue the wrong spell and say, accidentally alchemize your Talisman card as soon as you get it--- This game is phenomenal once you understand what's going on, what strategies you can use.... and definently playing more than the Warrior will lead you to realize there' a lot going on in this board game adaptation!You can quit single vs Ai games any time and return to them later. Doesn't work in multiplayer--- and the one big constraint is time. This game is amazing-- but you do need a free evening, my first match literally took 90 minutes. But TtheWriter mentioned the physical game did that too, so I was somewhat prepared--- most steam games I believe aren't this massive.I'm the sort of gamer who absolutely adores replay value. I've got 188 hours in The Binding of Isaac, and I can't even record a Let's Play of that. This though- Talisman can be recorded if you set Fraps to record the Aero desktop and then set'er in fullscreen.Anyway, this game is amazing if you have the patience to figure it out, and the background of a D&D enthusiast to appreciate the combat system and lengthy quest.

												Great start to a great classic game. I've been an owner of multiple versions of Talisman over the years and was very exicted to see this being worked on. While it has some bugs and annoyances, overall I think it's a great start. I'll go over some of the issues first.1) Random crashes. Yeah , they happen. Hopefully they clear up before it goes live as this completely ruins a live game.2) Bad network connectivity. People randomly just disconnect. Whats worse, is there is no way to re-join a game (that I am aware of) to continue. AI takes over.3) Spell casting is not intuitive. I played for over a month until i realized I can queue up a spell to automatically cast on the next players start of turn. Casting counter spell at the right time seems rough. The general responsiveness of double clicking spells is bad. Sometimes you have to click 20 times for it to actually work.4) No way to stop zooming into the board. This might be good for most people are a new to the game, but veterans dont need to read the board every time and would rather keep an overall look of the board. They need to make this an option.Other than these three issues, the game is great. The rules are handled very well, I have only found one or two issues I have had to report on rules. The animations dont overbear the game. The speed of turns is just right, with included features like auto-kill when there is no need to roll opposing dice.One feature i'd like to see is allowing AI to play your turn for you while you take a bathroom break :)			"

												Is it perfect? No. Is there a learning curve? Yes. Is it all ""RNG""? No. This game reminds me of a Rougelike, in that everything comes down to how you manage your resources, how you spend your turns, and, and what your opponents are doing. I've seen a Barmaid dominate the game and watched a warrior flounder. Some characters the AI is better at than others to be sure. It actually seems to do better with characters that are more multifaceted, as it doesn't get hung up just grinding out objects or spells or something.I'm not worried about public matchmaking... I'll either play solo or with friends. Worth getting the base game at least for $2.50 right now. I like the extra areas, so the City, Cliffs, and Dungeon are also to me worth it. The rest I would say are dependent on if you want more variety or not. I think I got the season pass on sale, so perhaps wait for that if you're concerned about the $$.			"

												I don't typically write reviews but I almost felt compelled to write one for Talisman after seeing the review Metascore gave it (a 51)...  I can tell you, as a longtime follower of the franchise, that this rendition of the game plays extremely well and is identical to the board game.  I love it!!  My main issue with the board game was that I couldn't always get together with friends to play.  Now I don't have to!  Whether it be single player or multiplayer in this game the experience is excellent!  I'll leave it at that.  Now for the pros and cons:Pros:1.  Graphics (As good as can be expected for a board game rendition).2.  Replayability3.  New updates and expansions showing the creators/publishers have faith and are loyal to the product4.  Just like the board game!!Cons:1.  ????If you like the board game, give this a shot.  I don't think you'll be dissappionted.  I wasn't!			"

												Finally, a digital version of this game!  Lots of fun, the additional playable characters and the expansions really add to the experience as well.  The UI is simple and intuitive, and I have yet to run into a card that is bugged.  The AI is a bit stupid, and will very rarely make a play for the crown.  There is no difficulty slider to make them better.However, if you buy this you should realize you are buying it baiscally for vs. AI play or hotseat play at home.  The online servers are absolutely rubbish.  95% of the time online games will crash at launch.  On the rare 5% occasion an online game actually starts, it will crash or lag out in the first couple turns (if not during character selection!) 95% of /those/ times.  Should you actually manage to get off the ground with an online game, odds are good that something unfortunate will happen to someone and that person will ragequit, which invariably crashes the game as well.I say, without exaggerating, that I have actually managed to complete 3 online games out of about 200 attempted.  It baffles me that the game can be so very good and the online technical bits can be so unbearably useless.Conclusion - If you are a longtime talisman fan, and you have real-life friends to play with, hook this up to your tele and get a wireless mouse to pass for a fun evening.  Or, if you don't mind playing against AIs slightly less intelligent than your average cocker spaniel, pick this up.  If, however, you are looking to use primarily or exclusively the online play function, SAVE YOUR MONEY, this is worthless to you.			"

												As a fan of the original board game (having played - and lost - many many games back in the 80's) this digital version is an excellent recreation of the board game.  Given prices of the original game and it's expansions are bordering on extortionate these days (and I would dearly love to own the proper games again) i'd almost go so far as to say that this version is preferable.

Finding players to sit around a table for hours playing the boardgame is quite difficult, so at least with this video game I can do so; even if it is with the AI or actual players, and thank goodness for the save game feature. I'm looking foreward to other expansions for this game and hopefully it wont be too long of a wait.			"

												I've had this for a while, but since it is now a daily deal, I thought I should write my thoughts on it.  When it was first released under early access, I was very disapointed in the AI, but I decided to give it another try now that it is officialy released, and I was impressed enough to pick up the expansions (Reaper, Frostmarch, and a couple of the character packs), and those make it an even better game.  If you enjoy the board game version, it is worth getting, but do so knowing that it may be quite a while til all the expansions are out and that the digital version is limited to 4 players max.  A few of the specific character AI's such as a the elf sometimes still do strange stuff, but overall the AI is at least competant enough for a single player vs AI game to be satisfying to me.If you have not played the board game and are on the fence, but you do like board games that involve a bit of luck, then I still recomend giving it a try, but probably best to not pay full price if you are on the fence. (I paid full when it came out and still consider it worth it, but this is a game with a lot of childhood nostalgia for me, so I'm highly biased)If you do get it, getting at least one of the expansions (Reader or Frostmarch) is highly recomended, because they basically double the size of the adventure deck and give you a few more characters to play with which adds a lot to the replayability.

												Wow. This game is fun. This definately isn't a coffee break game, be prepared to sit down, and roll lots of virtual dice. I have to admit I never had a chance to play the original board game - but if you had friends to play this with you, I could definately understand why you would sink Hundreds of dollars into this game. I guess I should be happy getting this for under $6.Since this is a video-game however, you still have something to get out of playing A.I. opponents. My first match took just over 2 hours, getting to know the game, and complaining to my computer enemies. All the random elements definately add a lot of spice to the flow of gameplay. If you like anything with long term strategy or long-term luck, then give Talisman a chance!			"

												This is an excellent board game that's easy to learn. The main goal of the game is to build up your character by travelling around the board, gaining Strength and Craft by events, killing monsters, and sometimes, luck. There are three ""sections"" of the realm, and once you get to the inner most area with a Talisman, you attempt to kill the other players off by casting the ""command spell"", which has a 50% chance of all players losing one life. This is the only way to win the game, as killing the players before someone is at the center just results in that player gaining a new character.I recommend getting the Gold Pack, as the expansions make the game that much more fun to play, and the benefit of more character choices makes the strategy more varied.

												Well, after playing this game both online and off, I can honestly say we have a classic here folks, well two actually(Prologue version being the other one) in this you get more characters then in the prologue, more spells, and  runes,(If you buy them), along with a Grim reaper expansion, all of which make this version a little more interesting, course it also does not hurt that it is online/offline multiplayer either with other people, or the computer, and this game has a save feature, (Though to save a online game, you have to be friends with the other players via steam, one thing I will knock this version about, and I do give Prologue something of the advantage on, is there are no other quests really other then getting the crown(Well okay there is the alchemist quest, but I mean more like a side quest type deal like Prologue version, it would have been interesting if you could have done such quests for boosts to your stats, of course it would have made the game longer, perhaps, but more interesting in my opnion.) But this game is still fantastic, and the expansions and huge number of characters and special abilities make up for it. Especially if you get all the expansions. (There is the reaper expansion which adds 4 characters, various spells, and enemies, new events, and places, and all new treasures, The Runestone expansion deck, which is a deck of cards used to power up your characters quickly, and apparently can be carried over from game to game, and 5 new character packs, that juat add new characters in the game, such as the Genie, etc.) and the ability to make houserules, as well as possibly choose  the character you play, all adds new quirks to the game as well as the much feared Reaper, who at the whim of a player could out right kill you, with a bad roll of the die. The quest for the crown of control has never been more wrought with danger, and intrigue. If you are a fan of the classic board game, or a fan of the adventure board game in general you'll want it all, and the prologue version of this too. Oh and this version, has steam achievements. (Unlike Prologue)Overall Numbers:Graphics: The game board looks good, and the cards and characters look spectacular, a definate step up from the prologue edition of this game. 10/10Controls: Easy Peasy , fast and responsive, easy to master. 10/10Achievements: This game has got them, and they are fun to get too. No score for this but well worth mentioning if you like that stuff.Fun Factor: Get the whole package and it is awesome, you'll love this game, it's not perfect, but it is really good. 8/10Notes:Use the Zoom In button on the side of the screen to look and see who is at what space, as well as what card is on that space.Make sure to become friends with who you play with, you never know when you might get an extended game and need to save.

												I bought this game during my board gaming phase, and hoped I could capture some of the charm of playing a board game with friends.It stays perfectly faithful to the original, and in many ways that is a problem. The visuals are functional but do not give you a sense of satisfaction. The movement feels awkward and clunky and you can never seem to get a view of the board that you really want.Like the original game it ends up being a lot more luck and very little strategy. It falls into the same trap or you can eventually just almost start a game over completely from scratch just due to bad rolls or you will have 10 to 15 turns where nothing actually happens.This was a missed opportunity to update the game modernize it and make it more fun such as adding simple mechanics that could have sped up gameplay. Instead you are treated to a game does exactly the same as it was 40 years ago, and even then there was criticism that it simply dragged on too long. Possibly worth five dollars if it was on sale, but 15 is not worth the value of this game.			"

												I've been playing the 2nd-edition board game for many years. This is a faithful adaptation with actually some of the rules improved (though maybe these were also fixed in later editions of the board game, which I haven't played). While I still love tabletop board games, this is perfect for starting in the late evening, since there's no setup, you can save the game, and you always know whose turn it is and what you need to do next!

												This game is a great idea, but they have several rather serious issues, any one of which makes the game stupid.  As I said, the idea is great, so I'm saddened by the glaring flaws.First, and probably most importantly, this game is very nearly entirely luck.  Yes, you get to make 2 choices about where you land each turn.  2 choices.  If you use spells, you can decide who to cast them on.  But you don't get to decide what spells you have, or when you get them.  This game would be a bazillion times more fun if they added a speed stat that let you move any number of spaces less than or equal to your speed, instead of rolling the die.  One of my favorite cards is a follower that ""curses"" you by making you only move 1 space each turn.  It gives me a unique sense of control in the game that I consider a major advantage.Secondly, there are a lot of ways to (randomly and unexpectedly) lose that don't make any sense.  For example, if you ever, ever get turned into a toad, you've basically lost.  ""But you haven't lost, yet.""  Sure, sure, I can continue playing for the hour or so the game might continue in hopes of some shocking recovery... but honestly, why make a player randomly turn into a toad?  To my knowledge, there is no option to turn toads off.  Third, the game can last quite a while, and if you die early, the AI will slowly (even at max AI speed) complete each phase of each turn, dragging the game on far longer than any reasonably sane person would care to sit and watch the AI play.I have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong.  But most of the time, I'm having fun thinking about what the game COULD be, rather than what it really is.  It pains me to have to say this, but I cannot recommend the game.			"

												Recommeded with issues.I bought this game based on playing the boardgame version in 1983 with hardcore gamers.  What made  the game fun was playing with other people face to face so that Diplomacy-like dynamics gave the game another level.  Thus  It became a ""beer-and-pretzels"" game for kicking back at the end of a long day of serious gaming.  It helped to be heavily medicated.  It was fun and relatively mindless.That is missing in single-player and even multiplayer when not face to face.  However it would be a fun game for lightweight gamers and young gamers and I can recommend it for that. Three games in, single-player, I wish I had not bought the game.  I could have bought a number of games I would have enjoyed more with the $15.  If it had been available at GOG.com I would have bought it there with their 30 day guarantee and would be returning it tonight, the same day I bought it.   I would readily give it up for $10.  Now, after I try it online multiplayer,  it will likely go in a special folder for  mindless day games when I am sick and medicated and bored with HULU but unable to function in a game that requires too much thinking.That said, it was well done, attractive with a good interface and plays faster than the boardgame version.  Not for me but definitely a good game for some.  Hard core gamers will probably be disappointed.   The die rolls bring too much luck into the game and not much skill...but Monopoly (which I got bored with at 8 yrs old) has been wildly successful for almost a century.  This could be a good family gaming night entry.One final comment.  After an online multiplayer game starts, there appears to be no way to communicate with others in the game to, for example, agree to stop until ""tomorrow at 1pm"". So it will probably be necessary to use a voice chat and wear headphones.  Otherwise people will be unable to warn you that they are dropping out or lost their connection.  Sorry, Corpse.__________________After playing a bit longer.  Interface not as good as origionally thought.  It is easy to accidentally lose cards because of similar moves in different parts of the game.  It can be very ambiguous at times.Further, at Level 8 character, I am trapped in a loop that lookis like the AI will repeat forever while I am trapped in the center Casting Command Spell repeatedly and unable to leave.  Since the AI has a poltergeist it repeats it's move over and over...because each time it IS the best move for the AI.  After playing up 8 levels with my troll I have no way out without starting a new game and losing all progress.  Now I really do not want to waste my time playing TALISMAN unless they remove this bug.  There are places in the game that will just hang you up in a loop with no escape.

												So I have the boardgame of Talisman and thought with the current sale to give the E-Version a try. With a 4-pack deal it should be fun, right? Wrong!The main problem with this game that it's slow and takes forever. The usabillity is kinda messed up and pressing all the buttons to confirm your decisions takes the fun out of a game tghat usually feels alreaddy an hour too long.Furthermore - as a person who owns the board game with expensions (which offer lots of fun stuff) - the prices for dlc packs are highly ridiculous!Online Version with friends works fine, but it's still very slow. It's another very bad port of a board game, where you have real interaction with your friends. So far, the only good port I've seen is ""Ticket to Ride"".Being aware that the E-Version of this game is still cheaper than the board game version, I'd say, if you're interested, rather spring for the ""real"" version of the game. Meet some people, drink some beers and have some fun. It doesn't really work on the computer.**after a bit of online play - the game is buggy as all heck, so that's another problem**			"

												I like what the game tries to do, but actual execution is poor.A couple of things:1: A lot of the game is cruel. Progress to a certain point, only to be knocked all the way back. I won't go into too many details so as to not ruin anyone's first playthrough, but the game unnecessarily takes longer than it should.2: Buggy! We encountered the following bugs in the original & frostmarch expansion:Bug 1: Player is unable to finish their turn because they can't perform an action, i.e. discarding a card.Bug 2: If you quit the game (such as to clear out the error in Bug 1) and then rehost, the AI encounters a bug where it will not perform its turn until the timer completely winds down. The only way to prevent this from completely ruining your game is setting the timeout for each player's turn at 30 seconds, then at least you only wait 30 seconds.Bug 3: Finishing quests. There are some items that are INCREDIBLY picky as to the order you complete them, so much so that it won't always be apparent. i.e. if you pick up the false grail, you are required to visit the Castle to discard it. However, you can only discard it during a certain action while visiting the castle. It's easier to see in action than it is to explain, but let's chalk up to poor game mechanics.3: Sometimes awfully boring, depending on what class you pick. A lot of these classes (i.e. the ones that don't draw spells) are highly dependent on landing on tiles that have associated actions that they can complete. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. This game seems to highly favor the spellcasters, because the spells allow you to overcome or encounter things that being a melee-focused character would not. This is unfortunate.Overall, would not recommend. Played through it twice, and we all found each session very obnoxious at a certain point. It was always one of the three items above, though.			"

Despite a dodgy UI.The big issue comes with the AI. waiting for 30min while the AI refuses to go after the player in the center, justy moving back and forther between the same squares is infuriating.Also a numbrer of bugs came up for me playing with a friend as the AI had it's turn. They kept saying an object was missing and kicking me from the game. The host had to let the AI have its turn, exit the game, srat it up again and invite me. This happened 8 times. Very very buggy game.			"

												I really like the board version of Talisman, so I snatched up this version on a Humble Bundle.  The game is fun, online or offline (but still better with friends).  If you like the board game, you'll probably like this version, as they did a good job getting the basic Talisman experience in here.  The UI can feel kind of awkward sometimes because of weird button placement and the need to click more times than necessary to do certain tasks, but it's possible to get used to and then it stops detracting from the game at all.  The game also has some advantages over the original such as not having to shuffle decks and manage pieces, and letting the computer do the combat math and automatically enforce the rules prevents any player from losing an encounter because they forgot to add an extra strength point from a follower that they lost in their inventory.   It's a more convenient way to play, in several regards.That's why it's such a shame that the game is so buggy.  Sometimes the game breaks the rules in frustrating ways (spells targeting untargetable opponents, characters being unable to use abilities when they should be able to, cards that should only be used a limited number of times never disappearing from the board, etc.)  So far, every game I've played has had at least one bug that breached the rules.  They can be mildly amusing at best but game-breaking at worst.  The frequency of these bugs is the problem, as they wouldn't be much of an issue if it was just occasional.  But so far it's been every single game.The bottom line is this: if you like Talisman, this is a pretty good version of it.  It gets all the content even if it lacks some of the streamlining it could have.  However, the frequent bugs are frustrating and having a bug break your game 90 minutes in is enough to make you not want to play again.  If the developers could take care of the bugs, I would definitely recommend getting this game.  Unfortunately, I'd now only recommend getting it on sale.			"

												I want to like this game, and I'm trying. I had the boardgame version of Talisman and several of its expansions years ago, and played it a lot. The biggest problem I've encountered with this version is the usability. Spell casting, for example, is kind of dreadful. Several times I have tried to cast spells--even after learning the system of queueing spells--and had them not cast; I have accidentally cast spells when I simply wanted to read the text to see what they do, wasting them; and I have tried casting spells at the times that are indicated in the text, only to find out, nope, that was not the right time to cast it.Important information text from the game is ill placed at the top of the screen in a box that is not prominent and doesn't stand out. There are an awful lot of confirmation clicks as well--too many in some cases. Also, sometimes the confirmation text is not the best. For example, when you're learning the game and you view your followers, the ""Dismiss"" option can leave you wondering, Wait, will that dismiss my follower? Dismiss is a term in gaming that, in my experience, has always been used to get rid of followers. A better term for getting rid of message windows is simply ""Close."" I hope there are improvements to the game design. I find myself more often frustrated than having fun when I play it currently.			"

												I love the Talisman boardgame but the digital edition is a pure stinker! The spell casting mechanic is truly busted. I understand the devs wanted to make sure the game was fast paced when spell casting and that it would not cause people to start guessing when someone wished to cast a spell but the whole mechanic is awful. Here's why:The only way to cast spells as a reaction is to queue them at which point they will automatically go off regardless if the spell is needed or not. For instance if you have a spell that would give you an edge before a combat roll and you've queued it up, it will automatically be cast at the next combat instance you're in which is a terrible mechanic. And as far as I know you can only queue 1 spell so any other spells you have are worthless if you would normally be able to cast them in a situation that would be helpful.My recommendation: Stay away from the digital version and buy the actual boardgame.

												I didn't really have any fun with this game. It mostly consists of a lot of random dice rolls, lots of redundant clicking, and obfuscated information.The overall gameplay feels like being on the cusp of winning a game of trivial pursuit, but you can't role the exact dice roll needed to land in the center of board. Or perhaps like a game of Chutes & Ladders where you never know whether you're going to go up or down.The physical board game is probably much more fun. This game is probably also more fun if you're playing with some friends.The game is a ""traditional American"" board game, where most of the gameplay is determined by random events, with very little choice left up to the player for how the game progresses. Random events can completely make or break the game for you.There is some player interaction in the way of being able to cast counter spells during another player's turn, but the UI and digital game mechanics here are a bit wonky. The overall UI in fact is a bit wonky, in that it takes 5 clicks to complete every action or view any piece of information.I think I picked this game up while on sale for 99 cents, and I'm glad I didn't pay any more for it. If you like the random dice role and random card drawing type of game, and are willing to tolerate the cumbersome UI, then you might want to give it a go, but I still don't recommend paying more than a couple dollars for it.

So far, the only good port I've seen is ""Ticket to Ride"".Being aware that the E-Version of this game is still cheaper than the board game version, I'd say, if you're interested, rather spring for the ""real"" version of the game. Meet some people, drink some beers and have some fun. It doesn't really work on the computer.**after a bit of online play - the game is buggy as all heck, so that's another problem**			"

												Fun game, but currently it seems impossible to play multiplayer because of the horde of bugs plaguing the game.  My first 3 out of 3 games all crashed at different points.  I'm getting very discouraged as the game is fun to play, but after playing for an hour it's aggravating to have it crash and then not be able to have everyone reconnect.  Please fix the bugs and provide a more stable multi-player platform.  This has great potential, but at the moment I'm regretting the purchase and cannot honestly recommend it.			"

												I really like the board version of Talisman, so I snatched up this version on a Humble Bundle.  The game is fun, online or offline (but still better with friends).  If you like the board game, you'll probably like this version, as they did a good job getting the basic Talisman experience in here.  The UI can feel kind of awkward sometimes because of weird button placement and the need to click more times than necessary to do certain tasks, but it's possible to get used to and then it stops detracting from the game at all.  The game also has some advantages over the original such as not having to shuffle decks and manage pieces, and letting the computer do the combat math and automatically enforce the rules prevents any player from losing an encounter because they forgot to add an extra strength point from a follower that they lost in their inventory.   It's a more convenient way to play, in several regards.That's why it's such a shame that the game is so buggy.  Sometimes the game breaks the rules in frustrating ways (spells targeting untargetable opponents, characters being unable to use abilities when they should be able to, cards that should only be used a limited number of times never disappearing from the board, etc.)  So far, every game I've played has had at least one bug that breached the rules.  They can be mildly amusing at best but game-breaking at worst.  The frequency of these bugs is the problem, as they wouldn't be much of an issue if it was just occasional.  But so far it's been every single game.The bottom line is this: if you like Talisman, this is a pretty good version of it.  It gets all the content even if it lacks some of the streamlining it could have.  However, the frequent bugs are frustrating and having a bug break your game 90 minutes in is enough to make you not want to play again.  If the developers could take care of the bugs, I would definitely recommend getting this game.  Unfortunately, I'd now only recommend getting it on sale.			"

												If you desire a single- or local-player experience with a faithful and loyal recreation of one of the most treasured board games Games Workshop ever created, are interested in digital versions of board games for their ease of accessibility and how versatile they can be when playing with others/with yourself and some AI's, or even if you just want a good time-killer that you can come back to at any time when you wish to resume a game (a feature not currently available for the actual board game, I might add, without manual note-taking!) then I cannot recommend this enough.I expect a lot are asking ""Then why are you not recommending this game?"" It is a fair question: It is a very enjoyable board game, and a faithful recreation of the original source material. The gameplay is everything you would expect: Easy to pick up and play, harder to master, and the randomness of the card draws, the dice rolls and the shape of the board presence after about 50 turns in (and you will be playing more than this locally) means that no two games are ever the same in any playthrough, and victory is never certain: A risk-taking AI or one that gets better luck with their dice rolls could always be one step ahead of you, but there's always some way or another for the AI to be betrayed or lose their advantage, given the numerous random events that can transpire in the course of a game.Why can I not recommend this game? Most who've played the board game or those who know how board games work in general know that it's better to play with friends. Unless you're willing to pass a laptop around - or play hot potato with the seat where your desktop is hiding out - the ability to play with friends since the 25th or so has nosedived. A quick look at the bug reporting section of the forums gives all the confirmation you may need: The change to the back-end of their online component has a lot of issues following a shift from a Steam-dependent component. I don't know why this change wasn't tested out before releasing it to the public (assuming that development costs aren't an issue) but it doesn't change the current state of the online component right now: A broken, unstable mess.Having played several games online with the friends I also bought the game for, I got to experience some of these issues first-hand: Gameplay freezes after casting certain spells, the AI refuses to move in a timely manner in online games, starting up online games can sometimes be problematic to the point that you have to recreate the room (I always made mine private, but I would imagine this issue becomes worse for public rooms) and I've even experienced a crash in the 15-ish hours I've played this game online - or at least attempted to without any of these problems arising. Out of seven games, I only managed to have two completed: One was a two-player game, another a three-player that the other two players were forced to drop out of because they ended up having issues.So to reiterate: In it's current state, this game is not completable online, in some cases it might not even be playable online. If you just want to play with your friends around the party table on a laptop or want to kill some time by yourself playing against some AI's, then this is a faithful recreation of the board game that you will get plenty of hours of enjoyment from (and given how the other 15 hours have been single-player and without any issues at all, I have no doubt of this). If you are, however, looking to play with friends over an online connection or have any desire to use the online component at all, then I have to recommend that you hold off until the issue is resolved with it's online component, as it is not in any fit state to be worth your time or your money.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Card Board game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to change the Sound volume by 10 everytime.You are able to change the Music Volume by 10 everytime.There are some Different languages available.You can play fullscreen, You have to press that ""Expand button in the options""You can play Local or against he AI. There is online mode. (with a small group of people playing.) (You can make private or online lobbies and no port forward required).Able to make different save and you can rename this.About the game.There are different characters. Each character has their own powers. You are able to choose Random too. There is a tutorial ingame. The object of the game is that you have to reach the middle of the board and kick other players out of this. Each character has their own set of Health/fighting power/Gold/Fate/craft and abilities. Some even could have an alignment to be Neutral/Evil and good. You have to fight enemies and get followers.There are cards to make things better or worse for you. You have to make your character powerful in order to defeat the bridge boss (unless you have found another way to enter inside the middle area).  Winning from an enemy character gives you the option to steal 1 item, take gold or let them lose one life point.MANY CHARACTERS,Killing enemies gives you their card and may be used to make yourself powerful if having enough of these cards.You are able to speed up turns from the AI in the ADVANCED OPTIONS menu.Game is sort of addictive.Music soundtrack is good.Calming game.There is a pause button.Other things.This game gives me the ""jumanji"" Feelings from the movie.The game at the bottom will glow yellow whenever it is your turn.Random AI like to choose the same characters in a game.Game feel sometimes rigged and could give you a nice disadvantage.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												This game is a great idea, but they have several rather serious issues, any one of which makes the game stupid.  As I said, the idea is great, so I'm saddened by the glaring flaws.First, and probably most importantly, this game is very nearly entirely luck.  Yes, you get to make 2 choices about where you land each turn.  2 choices.  If you use spells, you can decide who to cast them on.  But you don't get to decide what spells you have, or when you get them.  This game would be a bazillion times more fun if they added a speed stat that let you move any number of spaces less than or equal to your speed, instead of rolling the die.  One of my favorite cards is a follower that ""curses"" you by making you only move 1 space each turn.  It gives me a unique sense of control in the game that I consider a major advantage.Secondly, there are a lot of ways to (randomly and unexpectedly) lose that don't make any sense.  For example, if you ever, ever get turned into a toad, you've basically lost.  ""But you haven't lost, yet.""  Sure, sure, I can continue playing for the hour or so the game might continue in hopes of some shocking recovery... but honestly, why make a player randomly turn into a toad?  To my knowledge, there is no option to turn toads off.  Third, the game can last quite a while, and if you die early, the AI will slowly (even at max AI speed) complete each phase of each turn, dragging the game on far longer than any reasonably sane person would care to sit and watch the AI play.I have fun playing this game, don't get me wrong.  But most of the time, I'm having fun thinking about what the game COULD be, rather than what it really is.  It pains me to have to say this, but I cannot recommend the game.			"

												I bought this game during my board gaming phase, and hoped I could capture some of the charm of playing a board game with friends.It stays perfectly faithful to the original, and in many ways that is a problem. The visuals are functional but do not give you a sense of satisfaction. The movement feels awkward and clunky and you can never seem to get a view of the board that you really want.Like the original game it ends up being a lot more luck and very little strategy. It falls into the same trap or you can eventually just almost start a game over completely from scratch just due to bad rolls or you will have 10 to 15 turns where nothing actually happens.This was a missed opportunity to update the game modernize it and make it more fun such as adding simple mechanics that could have sped up gameplay. Instead you are treated to a game does exactly the same as it was 40 years ago, and even then there was criticism that it simply dragged on too long. Possibly worth five dollars if it was on sale, but 15 is not worth the value of this game.			"

												EDIT: The online multiplayer is much better now. At least you can continue a game after getting disconnected.I can't recommend this game yet, unless you want to buy it for offline play. The online multiplayer is buggy. Connection issues and game crashes are common enough to avoid you from finishing a game. Even though a host can still resume the game after crashing, he or she can't invite friends to join again. The ""resume game"" feature is pretty much useless for online play. I doubt the fix will come soon since the devs seem to want to release DLCs first before fixing the game.			"

I cannot compare to the board game itself, but I have honestly spent more hours playing just against the AI than I thought I would, and despite what some of the other reviews say about it being full of bugs, I've only had it ""freeze"" during mid-turn on me once through the whole time I've played it. That being said, it is a literal re-creation of a board game, so if you're not into that, don't get it.For me though, it was fun enough that I actually sought out the real life board game and bought it so that my friends and I have another fun option during our game nights!

												10 plus stars on a scale of 1 - 10 ---- And I dont post reviews for many games just if they are a ripoff are a super hit.This game and Rogue Legacy are my two fav games now on steam and I have right at 100.This game is simply awesome - I wish more classic board games would come to Steam- Like D@D Board Games.Keeps you thinking, massive rules which I like, I wanna think when I play and Tailsman has that strategy game aspect perfected, also easy to find multiplayer so far. But keep in mind Tailsman is a long game so a multi[player game could take 2 hours but rules can be adjusted to speed game up -- I am having plenty of fun just playing AI and gaining experience to get runestones. Also AI games can be saved and started right back up if you don't wanna play through all at once.Get the season pass I would of in retrospect gives you access to all DLC and with new characters  and expansions and more planned for soon release I would of saved more. Also unlike a lot of Steam games I encounter the creators of this game actually update and expand.I hate new games you play once and developers take theri money and run with no concern for customers----Tailsman Does not do this--- my guess is because the physical board game Tailsman has a huge following like Axis and Allies and that they truly care.The only downside is I think the graphics could be a little crisper or HD like  I guess but I understand need to stay true to game.10 out of 10 for me. Thanks Talisman Digital Team and please keep up updates and expansions and you will get my thx and dollars.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. First of all it is an alright adaptation of the game and it's as much fun to play as the board game, but there are a few bad points about it. 1) you cant see the board. only a crooked perspective that is far away or a zoom on one single field so it is really annoyingly hard to check out the board and the cards on it. 2) there are a lot of bugs and the game crashes sometimes when you use magic 3) the controls are bad. Often players do stuff they dont want to do because of that. It could be so simple, but they chose to make it complicated. 4) there is no punishment for leaving a game (like 30 min ban or so) so players ALWAYS leave when they draw a bad card, role a 1 or think they lose or have a bad character and so on. You will hardly ever finish a game online without players leaving.			"

												What a fantastic surprise! I've never heard of our played Talisman tabletop, but this turned out to be a BLAST for my wife and I.

You pick your class, which offers different advantages per which class you choose, roll dice, move about the board, and do as the spaces require.

They're favored for the AI and against you. They will often roll exactly what they need, and you'll roll exactly what you didn't want. This gets aggravating. I don't understand why the dice couldn't have been completely random? Otherwise, the game is a blast, especially with others. "

												A fun dungeon-crawl simulator. Explore the land, fight monsters, get loot, and kill your friends. After 10 minutes of poking at the interface and taking turns, my friends and I had a pretty good grasp on the basic rules. Our game lasted two hours and ended with the priest dead at the hands of a lion, the ninja struggling to finish the warlock's quest, and my troll holding the crown of command. We had a great time.

												A must have for any true board game fan. Its also great fun and probally without this game's idea's you could forget most of those great warhammer games, skyrim, baldurs gate and kiss them all goodbye.Update: 23 September 2014.Considering the games time of release, the frequent bugs, latency issues and eagerness to release downloadable content (individual character cards which are not actually offical board game game cards. Whilst not addressing bug issues first, has resulted in compounding errors/crashes due to adding cards from introduced cards from the expansions that have not been coded properly to new merge abilties for example with older ones.Update 2/12/2014Since the Dungeon Expansion...I recommend this game now on the basis the decks are a lot better, the new board and characters are amazing. A lot of bugs have been fixed (still a few kicking around). House rules implimented including the ""standard character"" rule for true fans who do not wish for the overpriced $2 dlc cards pay to win implimented. Another great feature is now you can add and remove players while in lobby instead of totally rehosting. Not only to mention that players who only have the base game can join any game and still use all the dlc so long as the host has provided them. This paves way for those who really like the game and encourages those not sure to buy the base first and not feel being ripped off so bad.I would recommend buying this, and make sure the dungeon is on!

												I love the physical boardgame and the digital edition is just as nice. It's a good solution if people can't come to your place to play and people don't fight over the rulebook or tell you ""you can't do that"". It's not completely finished and there are bugs here and there but it's still alot of fun and worth the money. The bots will sometimes do less smart things and it's possible for more than 1 player to play the same character but that can easily be overlooked.			"

												This is the basic game (I believe).  I discovered there are lots of expansions and even additional characters you can buy to enhance your gameplay.  But let me just say, I was a fan of the board game and played it probably 25 years ago.  I was excited to see it brought to life online and buying it did NOT disappoint.  If you played the board game and loved it, you'll love this!  If you've never played the board game, give it a try.  It's a charming fantasy world set game with twists and turns unlike any game.  Just when you think you're dominating your opponents, you can draw a card that changes everything.  Likewise for your opponents as well.  :)			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. First of all it is an alright adaptation of the game and it's as much fun to play as the board game, but there are a few bad points about it. 1) you cant see the board. only a crooked perspective that is far away or a zoom on one single field so it is really annoyingly hard to check out the board and the cards on it. 2) there are a lot of bugs and the game crashes sometimes when you use magic 3) the controls are bad. Often players do stuff they dont want to do because of that. It could be so simple, but they chose to make it complicated. 4) there is no punishment for leaving a game (like 30 min ban or so) so players ALWAYS leave when they draw a bad card, role a 1 or think they lose or have a bad character and so on. You will hardly ever finish a game online without players leaving.			"

No dice to lose, no cards to shuffle, no minis to step on. So over all, worth it for me. However if you don't like boardgames you may want to give it a pass.			"

												Having never played the original board game, I actually just purchased this on a whim.  SOOOOOO glad I did.  My friends and I have a blast playing (I got a four pack) and I absolutely love the myriad of characters/classes.  Playing on random character choice is fun, though the AI has a thing for picking the Exorcist and excelling at it.  I once played a game where I eventually dispatched his Exorcist, forcing him to choose from 3 new classes, but he pratically gave up on his next choice (lasting a total of 3 turns) and the one after that!  His third set of classes included... yep, you guessed it: another Exorcist.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had snatched up all the Talismans, he might have won, garnering a large amount of strength, but after busting through and snatching a talisman from me, he lost his last two lives in the Vampire's lair.  Positioned strongly with a Marter with a massive amount of strength, I destroyed the Ice Queen and finally finished the game.The computer AI in this game is great, but it seems a little cheap sometimes.  I'd like the ability to tweek the AI (unless I'm missing a portion in the options where you can) and a more stable online multiplayer (I've only had it mess up once for me, but I hear others complaining) but this game was worth every penny, and then some.  I got the Season Pass; all the extra content is great.  I highly recommend this for board game entusiasts or anyone looking for a great game to play, online or against AI.  Don't miss out on getting the season pass, either.  There are a TON of extras included, and it's not even halfway finished with it's ""season"" (you get every DLC that comes past, present, and future).  With the Highlands coming out (a new region, making a total of two additional regions (dungeon and highlands) on top of the basic board, you won't want to miss out on the extra adventure and danger!  Also, any DLC the host presents in their game, you'll be able to access (this includes characters and extra regions/cards) in their game.  If you plan on hosting games with your friends, DLC is a must have!  Trust me, the game is worth your money, and it's gotten me interested in getting the physical version for pure collection reasons!EDITS: Grammer (I'm sure there's still some mistakes) and reviews on DLC info.

												I have long played the boardgame, and I like it very much, so here is my take on the digital version.- Even with accelerated AI waiting for the bots to play is boring- There is no obvious mechanism to backpedal when you make a mistake and are, for example, about to cast a hostile spell on yourself- I thought I had won after I defeated the troll above the crown of commandment, but his loot on the ground (axe, etc) actually prevented me from accessing the crown. I could not move back in the Inner Region to drop some loot either, so I had to quit the game.The game is recent and these problems can be fixed later on, of course.			"

												Ok. I have played Talisman the boardgame since 1st edition and all the further editions (3th was the worse). I have the new version and I can asure that the digital edition is exactly as the board game (some small changes but nothing that afect the overall game).the first impresion I have of the digial version of the game was spot on as what I wanted, as close as posible to the board game, no issues with rules or mistakes made by other players. I like the dinamic of the game, sure the graphics could be better or at least some efect when making combat or magic but that is like superfluos to the game (that is what imagination is used).the AI could be better or if you could select the level will be better (novice, normal, hard, insane). maybe for more options of players, but is ok with 4 as it can be a little bothersome or tedius to wait for other players to make their move.To any boardgame player I highly recomend it, with just one exeption, there is a lot of bugs and there is no rulebook, so sometimes you get a card to make you do someting (I had an orbe to let me change the action card if the first I get was not so good, I could not figure out how to activate it, so I did not use it). and the bigest complain I have right now is that the AI is freezed ""thinking"" and could not continue the game, and were are all in the crown area fighting for it... and I am  the strongest, better armed abd with more lives that the others AI !!!!! so is an almost win esenario but cant finish it, or began another game w/o losing this one. So I recomend to buy it, with discount, and I really hope the developers correct all the bugs soon.P.S. sorry the mispellings (english not my first lenguaje) and the long rant but belive me this game (and hero quest) were the first board games I played and I am really happy with the digital version, but disapointed that is not well defined and buged.

												A great adaptation of the physical board game, and then some.Additional house rules available, plenty of character variety, true-to-the-original game play, and adequate production values make it a great digital version of the physical game.I find overall its somewhat expensive, with extra characters costing 2 dollars each and mini-expansions 6.  The season pass is 60 bucks and is supposed to offer a savings so, that gives you an idea of the price of DLC.I LOATHE the spell system though, it needed to be done differently. More often than not any 'questionable' spells (ie ones that play during others turns or counterspells) often result in mistakes or missed opportunities.  I definitely consider this a con.Overprices and terrible spell system aside, any fan of the board game should be nothing short of pleased with the digital version.  Though, perhaps finding it on sale would be wise.I'd give it a 7/10.  Its true talisman. But its also games workshop, hence its over priced.			"

I'm used to playing highly competitive shooters and the like, so if I can enjoy it, almost anyone can.

												First, let me say that I've only played this solo and know nothing about the multiplayer functionality.There seems to be something really wrong with the random number generator in this game. When making choices, you often have to consider the odds of an awful thing happening. Yet, even when the ONLY way something bad can happen is if I roll two 1's in a row, that's what WILL happen... and it doesn't happen infrequently. It happens over and over and over again. I've only EVER been able to get into the middle track once and no matter what character I play, the computer controlled players get nearly all good luck and I get nearly all bad luck. Frankly, it doesn't even feel like luck. It feels like the computer is actively controlling the dice rolls so it can hose me. For example, the dice rolls are always causing me to lose everything, yet I've never seen a computer controlled player lose their belongings. Immediately after losing everything, one of the computer controlled players WILL roll exactly what they need to land on that square and collect everything I lost.While the boardgame is recreated decently, with a colorful board and characters, the result is stagnant, lifeless, and uninspired. There is a lot that could have been done to graphically enhance the game for a computer via animated cards and board and combat, but the developers chose not to do anything but reproduce the board and the cards exactly as they would appear when playing around a table.  Why they didn't enhance the computer version with effects and animation is a mystery. It's like the developers had no imagination. Since it is so exacting the better choice is to buy the boardgame. The only thing the 'Digital Edition"" offers that is different from the original is the ability to play Talisman with people who aren't in the same room. The user interface is simply horrible. Every moment of every turn is stretched out into a laborious sequence of moving and clicking. The game control elements are spread out all over the screen, so you have to move the mouse from one end of the screen to the other whenever an option is presented, rather than keeping the interface elements near one another so they are easy to use.Others have reported a plethora of bugs. I can't say I've really encountered any, but then I've never actually played much beyond the beginning of any game. My 'luck' is SO bad that I can barely get started before I'm so far behind that catching up is impossible. It isn't much fun to continue playing when losing is a foregone conclusion, so I end up quitting to play something that is actually entertaining.			"

												Talisman is a classic fantasy-themed board game that's been around since before most people had computers.  It has something of a cult-like status among fans but tends to polarise opinion in board game circles, with the main critisism being that it's overly dependent on luck at the expense of strategy.  I like to refer to it as fantasy Monopoly, where instead of property you go around collecting objects and followers (and battle enemy monsters and players) until you're powerful enough to win the game.Despite its detractors, Talisman maintains a passionate, loyal and extremely devoted following.  Like Monopoly, its appeal lies in its simple, light-hearted and accessible nature.  It isn't too complicated, difficult or overly strategic.  That's not to say there aren't strategic elements however and new players wiil struggle when playing against seasoned pros.  But it's still a game you can wistfullly play while the hours pass by (and I do mean hours) without having to think too hard.Talisman benefits enormously from the digital transition, which has been implemented quite well.  The main critisism is that AI players are fairly weak and never pose much of a threat.  It used to be that the AI would often make incredibly stupid decisions, however this has improved somewhat.  If you prefer a challenge, there's a robust online community of players who provide far greater competition.  I was pleasently surprised by the friendliness in the Talisman community.It should be noted that the base game is a little bare and Talisman benefits when played with some, if not all the currently available expansions.  The season pass is a little pricey, but well worth it if you can get it on sale.  Given the number of characters and expansions I can't recommend buying them separetely, you really have to go all in and get the season pass if you want the extra content.In summary, if you appreciate light-hearted and fun games that anyone can pick up, or enjoy board games with great artwork on the board and cards then I can highly recommend Talisman.  I have over 200 hours logged so far as evidence that it's a fun and addictive distraction and great to take your mind off things.			"

												Awesome recreation of the board game!  I would really like to see the City expasnsion and Woodlands.  Lots of fun without the time to set up.  I have the actual BG and this is great for passing the time.  If you have not played this game and love quest games this is the one!Cons: the spell casting can get confusing when you have to cast before another characters turn or at a certain moment ie before combat.

												I really enjoy this game.  Bought it on a whim (and because it was on sale) when I was looking for a new board-type game.  It satisfies the RPG-lite AND board game void for me very well.  The expansions while technically not neccessary add a LOT to the game experience.  Literally the depth goes up dramatically with each expansion area (and characters).  Excellent game to play by yourself or online.Pros:Great light RPG game.Great board game.Lots of variety.Cons:I currently can't play a ""home"" game after the latest update.  Crashes on start.  However, online gaming is no problem.Speaking of online play, the game is still great but be prepared for rage quitters.			"

												I find it hard to either recommend or not recommend this game, because:Pros:1. Brilliant conversion of a board game to digital form. Very polished.2. Fun to play, especially suits a mood where you want to chill out.3. Excellent if you have a group of friends to play with.  Not only is it always more fun to play with people you know, but it avoids the problem of players disconnecting (a group of friends will rarely abandon the game they start, whereas the opposite cannot be said).Cons:1. After the first 30 minutes approximately, I always get bored. Every single time. I just feel like quitting and going and doing something else. Exception is where my real-life friends are in the game.2. Rolling one die each turn for movement can be very annoying.  Often you are very eager to land on a particular square, and you need to go through a painful, painful, grind to roll the number you need. To be fair, you can choose to move in either direction, but still it is a slow and painful grind to arrive where you want to. Very frustrating.			"

												10 plus stars on a scale of 1 - 10 ---- And I dont post reviews for many games just if they are a ripoff are a super hit.This game and Rogue Legacy are my two fav games now on steam and I have right at 100.This game is simply awesome - I wish more classic board games would come to Steam- Like D@D Board Games.Keeps you thinking, massive rules which I like, I wanna think when I play and Tailsman has that strategy game aspect perfected, also easy to find multiplayer so far. But keep in mind Tailsman is a long game so a multi[player game could take 2 hours but rules can be adjusted to speed game up -- I am having plenty of fun just playing AI and gaining experience to get runestones. Also AI games can be saved and started right back up if you don't wanna play through all at once.Get the season pass I would of in retrospect gives you access to all DLC and with new characters  and expansions and more planned for soon release I would of saved more. Also unlike a lot of Steam games I encounter the creators of this game actually update and expand.I hate new games you play once and developers take theri money and run with no concern for customers----Tailsman Does not do this--- my guess is because the physical board game Tailsman has a huge following like Axis and Allies and that they truly care.The only downside is I think the graphics could be a little crisper or HD like  I guess but I understand need to stay true to game.10 out of 10 for me. Thanks Talisman Digital Team and please keep up updates and expansions and you will get my thx and dollars.			"

												I'd never played the original Talisman, but the premise of it looks very very nice. It's a great game for getting your friends together for an old-school dice-rollin', card drawing good time, and there -is- some strategy involved or you're going to get quickly left in the dust. This still needs to be polished (the AI especially, is -real- dumb) and as of this writing the multiplayer is buggy as hell, dropping people and lagging out. However I'm willing to keep playing, I have faith in this game based on what I've seen and over time I'm sure the bugs will be squished and this will turn out to be a VERY enjoyable game with friends.

Its not a fast and win game but if you like chess,family night,fantasy,strategy or If you have ever played games like hero quest back in the day then this game is for you! I think they did a wonderful job rebuilding a gem that..... 1. it dont cost as much  2. you dont have to put up or tear down! 3. you have A.I so you can play by yourself. 4. you can take the game online to play with others. 5. you or anyone playing cant cheat even If you wanted to?  and 6.

												A great game with great bugs. We play with friends through Steam, hit the break, then we try to continue after two days, and we either can't connect or have other issues, like after joining game, players can't control their heroes or get disconnected.And I waited patiently for like 5 months, thinking, ""hey, a lot of people bought this game to play online with friends, I am sure someone will fix this"". 5 months passed, the issue persists, devs just don't care. I don't care anymore, I only whish I had not bought DLCs and filled their pockets, as I got nothing in return. If someone was manufacturing cars that don't run properly, they'd be sued and had to recompensate. Looks like we, gamers are second-grade customers. That's sad.EDIT: December 2015, still random crashes, bugs, but they launch another add-on. Whitout fixingactual game. Money-grabbers.			"

												I love boardgames. I really do. I've never played Talisman, though. And this might be one of the reasons I absolutely hated playing this game.  Being a rulesmonger, I usually read all rules before playing a game. Twice. Maybe even 3 times. And this might very well be the 2nd reason I hated playing this game.The game does an extremely poor job of telling you the rules and give you any sort of insight as to what might happen on the different tiles on the board. I was left with playing blind and ended up just walking away, since the computer controlled characters decided they all wanted to bash on me, so I kept loosing turn after turn, effectively turning the ""game"" into a slideshow.I trust the game will work out to be a lot more fun if you already know what it's all about, but I have no way to tell. My recommendation is therefor this: If you don't know the game, stay away from it. I just doesn't work as a stand-alone product.			"

Even in encounters when there are plenty of players. It feels like their RNG is artificially weighted to just RUIN the human players. In several games, I've felt the overwhelming desire to ragequit simply because the game forces me into losing STUPID, nearly impossible to lose fights, even after spending points of Fate to reroll once. For the amount they're asking, not really worth it. I got it a Humble Bundle for like...15 cents. But yeah, not really that great of a board game title. Get Ticket to Ride instead.			"

												Fans of the boardgame cannot go wrong here! While there are a few places where the game interface can improve, the ""feel"" of the game is true to the original (4th edition). I look forward to continued improvement as the game continues to evolve.WARNING: This is probably not a great game for people who are not familiar with the board game. It DOES NOT meet the typical requirements that modern computer / console gamers look for in a game. But that is not what the game is trying to do. It maintains a trueness to the board game... and it feels like a computerized version of the boardgame. It does not have animations for combat... or cool 3D rendering of graphics. If that is the kind of thing you are looking for... keep on looking. If you are looking for a good boardgame experience... stop on by!			"

												Fans of the boardgame cannot go wrong here! While there are a few places where the game interface can improve, the ""feel"" of the game is true to the original (4th edition). I look forward to continued improvement as the game continues to evolve.WARNING: This is probably not a great game for people who are not familiar with the board game. It DOES NOT meet the typical requirements that modern computer / console gamers look for in a game. But that is not what the game is trying to do. It maintains a trueness to the board game... and it feels like a computerized version of the boardgame. It does not have animations for combat... or cool 3D rendering of graphics. If that is the kind of thing you are looking for... keep on looking. If you are looking for a good boardgame experience... stop on by!			"

												It's astonishing how boring and badly designed Talisman is. I've played the tabletop version of Talisman before and always thought it was an awful game. I love board games, have dozens of them, but Talisman... It takes the features of games like Monopoly and other trail games and try to entice you with a mildly interesting (though generic) fantasy setting, but the truth is it remains as boring, flawed and outdated as Monopoly itself. The game may drag for hours and hours without an ending in sight and everything is about randomness. There's no skill involved playing in Talisman, all you can do push your luck in a general direction and hope for the best. I understand why a game like this would be popular 20 or 30 years ago, but today we have plenty of better board (and digital) games to play. Maybe *huge* fans of Mario Party would enjoy playing digital Talisman, but I just can't recommend it to anyone else. You want to play ""digital board games"" on Steam? Grab ""Small World 2"", ""Ticket to Ride"" or anything else, but stay away from Talisman.			"

												A pretty bad game, all in all. Whilst the theme is strong, the mechanics are so heavily luck based that there's next to no ability to control whether you win or not. There's pretty much no strategy - it's nearly played as well by the best AI as by the best humans.The theming is great, but in the end it just comes down to roll well and win, roll badly and lose.

												A great game with great bugs. We play with friends through Steam, hit the break, then we try to continue after two days, and we either can't connect or have other issues, like after joining game, players can't control their heroes or get disconnected.And I waited patiently for like 5 months, thinking, ""hey, a lot of people bought this game to play online with friends, I am sure someone will fix this"". 5 months passed, the issue persists, devs just don't care. I don't care anymore, I only whish I had not bought DLCs and filled their pockets, as I got nothing in return. If someone was manufacturing cars that don't run properly, they'd be sued and had to recompensate. Looks like we, gamers are second-grade customers. That's sad.EDIT: December 2015, still random crashes, bugs, but they launch another add-on. Whitout fixingactual game. Money-grabbers.			"

												Talisman's first edition, with many of its expansions, ate up a lot of my time as a regular board game. This digital edition includes both classic rules and new edition rules, plus many more expansions are coming out. They're ironing out details of the main game now, the Reaper expansion is out, and many characters are available to play. This game can be played single player against one or several computer opponents, or it can be played online. I haven't tried the online play because I'm too chicken and get interrupted a lot, but it looks like a lot of time and effort is being put in by the developers to polish it up. The game itself is pretty, simple to control, and all the fun I remember, except for smack talk when dealing with AI opponents.			"

												Adventure board game relying strongly on luck. Clunky UI makes playing a harsh experience. Others mentioned that this was a mobile port and it shows. Settings are limited and it will reset some of the options every time you restart the game. Some features, like speeding up or skipping animations are not available, which tends to drag games even longer than required.Has some technical issues. With nearly 10 hours gametime, there has been couple crashes. Also, one friend kept having connection issues for unknown reason. Luckily, the session can be restored but it still requires extra time. Cashing on too many DLCs and extra junk that could have been easily bundled in bigger packages. Luckily, only the server has to buy them so that others can play with additional content. Some of the characters are much stronger than others which brings balancing issues.Core game mechanic relies too heavily on dice, especially in the early game. As most of the actions are ruled by the dice, one can find hero facing only dragons, giants and ogres with their two point strength weakling. This results in frustration as the player cannot really do anything except pray for better luck. Situation becomes ever worse with the DLCs as they bring even more monsters which makes encounters even more random. Core game could use separate decks for outer and middle regions. This way outer region could give more certain, but slow, early progress and middle region faster but more risky way.Usually some of the players get lucky in the early game and snowball out of control. When hero gets enough resources, they start to win battles automatically which makes them even stronger. Single game can easily last two hours as the early winning players makes certain that they are unbeatable until finishing the game.Summary: technically shoddy and somewhat lacking playing experience. Can be fun with friends. Recommended only for Talisman fanatics. Others should avoid or enjoy the life as a toad.			"

												Talisman.  A staple board game of most RPG players.  This digital adaption is fun to play and seems to be as faithful to the board game as you can be.  However, my group of friends and I have never been able to complete a game.  30-60 minutes in some bug rears its head and forces us to exit.  Sometimes, you cannot roll the dice, end the turn, or activate an ability/card.  Other times, someone just falls out of the game and the AI pickes up the spot.  If the devs could solve this problem, I see a great game becoming better.			"

												The digital edition is pretty buggy and requires some serious patching. I recently played a game with my partner against 2 bots (a Minstrel & Druid) and we clearly dispatched one of the bots (Read: 0 life) . It was very disturbing to see the ""undead"" Minstrel ""respawn"" with full life on it's next turn and continue to roam the board to wreak havoc. We also noticed that the bots have an uncanny preference of keeping talismans in their stash (Read: 3 numbers) and ignoring the other better gears like the Solomon's crown, Belt of Strength, etc upon winning a player encounter. Please fix the AI of the bots to make this a better game.			"

												I've been playing the table top version of this game for about 24 years and it has always been one of my favorites.  The Digital Edition is an exceptional recreation of the board game.  Great graphics and sound.  The board and art on the cards is excellent.  The miniatures are painted beautifully.  The interface is nice and very easy to work with.  There is nothing I don't love about this game and now with multiplayer, you can play with those friends that no longer live close enough to start up a game with.  One reason I have always liked this game is that it is very approachable.  No complicated rules or in depth manuals etc.  Anyone can play this for the first time and enjoy every minute of it with little to no learning curve.  REAPER EXPANSION:  20+ years ago they had different expansions than today and I was originally disappointed that they were gone and new ones had been made.  My disappointment was for nothing.  The Reaper Expansion is an excellent addition to the original game that you can toggle on and off as you like.  It adds new characters, events, spells, etc. to the game not to mention the Grim Reaper that can make or break your day if you encounter him.  I played the expansion for the first time today and I didn't think it possible to make Talisman better but this expansion most definitely does.  Table top gamers are notoriously picky about their beloved games and don't want them butchered or poorly recreated.  I have been hopeful that this would be a faithful recreation of the board game and Nomad Games has not let me down.  Out of the massive amount of money I have spent on Steam, this stands out as one of my favorite and most fun games in my library.  Young or old, new to Talisman or an old pro I can not recommend this game high enough.  To me, this is an absolute must have for anyone's Steam library.Game Play: 10/10Sound: 9/10Mechanics and Interface: 8/10Art and Graphics: 10/10Overall Experience: 10/10			"

												I bought this game as a fan of both warhammer and GW products.Sadly, it really sucks. I know its a faithful recreation of a timeless board game, and it hits that spot on. As a huge board gamer myself though... the game is really imbalanced, the systems are poorly explained and convoluted, and its kind of stupid to have to get to the middle of the board which then kills everyone else (only on a roll of 4+) which turns the game SUPER boring at the end... I think I sat there for about 30 minutes hoping to roll a 4+ and kill everyone, while all the AI's kept healing and leveling up. I cannot recommend this game at all to anyone who values their time or avid board game enthusiasts. The game is unfair, boring, and a huge waste of time. No offense to the company who made this, they did a great job of recreating the board game how its played! But to me rolling dice and hoping I win does not make a game fun.Multiple users have commented on my review so I'll add a caveat: supposedly some of the xpacs fix the misgivings of the base game. But to me, I shouldn't have to buy xpacs to fix a game being unfun. If you play this, I would recommend making your mind up about it within the first 2 hours!			"

Soo many wasted seconds of my life...So far I'm still playing my first game, but it seems to be locked since 45 minutes: I'm standing in the center, casting the command spell every turn (reduces life for the opponents if I roll 4-5-6), while the only AI player left is hanging around and healing himself time to time by visiting the corresponding tiles. I think like 5-6 times I was already one life away from winning, but I'm tending exit and forget about this unpolished beauty.The positive side: nice idea, good graphics, fine music. If the testers might have warned the developers about the glitches this game could be a 8/10 (now it is 4/10).			"

												I will not recommend this game it's overly bugged and impossible to play a single game online.If you want a solo game experience it's probably not as bugged as multiplayer, but I have played 5 games so far with friends and it crashed after 10min to 1½ hour of gameplay and you have to start a new game. There is a lot of different bugs also and so far all of them have made it impossible to continue playing.If this game gets a lot of updates and bugfixes it might be playable but at the moment I don't recommend that people even try. If you planning to buy it too play multiplayer with friends atleast wait until it has become fixed cause this is just a waste of money at the moment.			"

												Talisman Digital Edition is a fantastic take on the multiplayer boardgame.  The rules are implemented well, with only minor glitches here and there.  Nomad is quick to bring out bug fixes and updates.  Fans of the game will find a lot to love, and newcomers will have fun learning all the quirks.  With all the planned expansions, the future looks bright for Talisman.			"

When they say Alpha they mean it. If you want to help fix and polish this game before release have at it. If you only want to play a game without filling out a bug report then wait a few months.			"

												It does replicate the boardgame, it does have AI - but it's very prone to crashes and lockups. I have only tried playing it twice, first one crashed out before a turn had passed, second one locked up during a battle close to the endgame. Feels like it's not really worth the time to try again.			"

												A great board game without the hassle! Who has the time or wants to spend time setting up, cleaning up, and fighting over the rules of a traditional board game? Talisman does all that for you. No lost pieces, no penny markers, and no fuss! Great roleplaying elements and charachter diversity will no doubt lead to endless replayability, especially with the huge amount of updates promised. I only wish it could be played more players, but i have not read up at all, such may be planned. Definately great family fun for years to come!			"

												Got it gifted by one of my steam friends I've been playing games with for years. I stepped into this game blindly with 3 expierenced/veteran Talisman players while myself having never played anything of Talisman. I was rather confused at the start but to my surprise, you get into this game really easily and fast.It's a great game, there can be some mind blowing difficulties every now and then that could use some fixing, but overall I'm enjoying this game. Great expansions as well.Against AI it's okay, but as usual, playing games with friends is more enjoyable than playing alone against AI's.			"

												After having played the physical board game with friends, this version is swell for getting my Talisman fix. Originally playing with AI characters was kind of a nightmare, but the updates have improved their ""decision"" making skills, gameplay is still best with friends though. If you're not already a fan of table tops then this could become boring for anyone, since it takes a while for someone to win. However, having the expansions, thanks to a season pass, makes it most enjoyable. When I had the basic version it was limiting and I lost interest, fortunately sales come around often providing a great time to grab it. The pass is a good deal; the artwork and variety of characters definitely improve with each new package. I also like the idea of being able to play anytime, anywhere without worrying about finding space and set up.			"

												A good port of the Games Workshop classic, Talisman: Digital Edition is an adapted board game that is pretty simple and fun to play. It is definately best to play with friends, preferably with a total of 3 or more players, as this makes for far more interesting dynamics than the fairly linear two-player game. Although it may not be the most tactically deep board game of all time, this does not detract from the experience; it merely makes it accessible. There are also some definite strategies involved. Whilst I don't play this a lot, it is refreshing and very fun to play once in while with some friends, and marvellously captures the feel of a questing adventurer striving to out-competent his/her rivals.

												I'm beyond frustrated with this game.  I feel ripped off and onlly spent a few cents on it.  If you play it enough to learn it you'll see the game is broken.  The card rules don't work correctly, AI characters got stuck, and the full game feels like a demo with the full game/options only available via multiple DLC. It's insulting... 14.99 for a demo (79.99 to purchase it all) and the game will remind you of abandonware from 1999.			"

												Talisman is a game of adventure, excitement, and challenge; a game where you the player are the ones who build the cross the AI nails you to. Dying from a gut seeping wound might be more enjoyable. If you reach the crown before the AI, you better expect to choke hard and roll absolutely abysmal. If you think the AI is doing something stupid? It's because the AI has decided to give you this illusion before three turns later it's suddenly twice as strong wielding magic faster than a video game player can blame a computer for his failings. This game is not your friend. This game hates you. This game lives off of your suffering. Any achievement is to lull you into a false sense of security. All hail your new dark gods, the AI.10/10 Would forsake my first born child to actually roll what I need when I need it.P.S. SHODAN is more merciful than this game.			"

												Talisman is a faithful digital re-creation of the board game I played and loved as a teen. However, as with most board game conversions, it really loses somthing when playing on a computer. It's just not much fun without a crowd of friends huddled around the table.Recommended for fans of the original who want to relive the past, but not for new players. If you've never played Talisman, I recommend the board game, but not the computer version.			"

												This is a game I literally waited years for them to finish. It looks really good, the gameplay is as faithful to the boardgame as possible. The real trouble and the dealbreaker is when you try playing with AI players. They nearly always win - they play like cutthroats, and the mechanics of the game seem very biased towards them winning. I don't know who decided to do it this way, but it absolutely killed the game for me.			"

												I really want to like this game, because board games rule, but wow the game this is based on is absolutely garbage.  This plays like monopoly with an RPG element.  It's ridiculously random - a ton of the locations give huge awards for rolling 4-6 and huge penalties for rolling 1-3.  Movement itself is largely based on rolls (unless you, again, are lucky and find a teleport spell/event) so you can't even move around with strategy.  You just go where it tells you, deal with whatever good/bad thing that happens, then wait for your next turn.Not only is the gameplay horrendous, but it's littered with reminders to purchase tons of overpriced DLC.  Base game for $1, DLC for $30?  No thanks.  Don't buy this.			"

												7/10 - Lovers of fantasy board games, buy. Others pass...Pros- Lots of Characters- Lots of Cards, Spells, & Events- Easy to play while multi-tasking (TV, other games, ect.)- Online multiplayer content.Cons- Too much DLC- I swear dice are rigged vs AI- Graphics could be better.- Repetative music.- Many mechanics to learn & employ.So, I'm not big on board games. I got this in a Humble Bundle & decided to try it out. For a board game, it's pretty entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7/10 & a thumbs up. If it weren't a board game, I'd give it a 4/10. The game flow is pretty boring & the DLC is somewhat frustrating.It's great that they want to keep the game up-to-date, & I don't expect them to work for free. However there's a bit of a pay-to-win feel, when you're looking at some of the newer content. It's not just new event cards, or ""Alternative Ending Cards"". It's new characters with OP abilities, or OP ""Runes"" (upgrades to base stats).I also wish there was more flash & awe while playing the game. I mean, you pick up a ""blizzard"" card; you expect to see the board covered in a wash of hail! You have tons of spells, but nothing beyond the card's artwork to help you imagine the effect! The game falls a bit flat when it comes to graphic possibilites.The same goes for the music. It's not bad, but it rarely changes. It's so monotonous. With so many events & the dynamic of ""who's winning"", alignments, what board section your in, ect. you'd think there'd me more variety.I complained about the game's loaded dice vs AI. I rolled a ""1"" 5 times in a row on the same square. This happened twice in one game, then once again in the following game. While it's not impossible to do, it's highly improbable. If the dice aren't loaded, maybe I should play the lottery...There's some strategy, but for the most part the strategy is overriden by the RNG of the dice rolls. Personally, I'd be more entertained with a game of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. You have a greater feeling of control, knowing what's in your hand & in your deck. In Talisman: Digital Edition, nothing is guarenteed. You can have 8 godly items one moment; nothing the next. There's nothing you can do about it, & it just makes you feel like the game is a big waste of time.Lastly, there are a lot of quirks with regard to when & how you do things. I had a ""Siphon Strength"" card that I tried using for 10 turns. Suddenly it worked on an opponent that I never selected nor was he near me; just a random event. You need to learn which items are consumed on use, and which arn't. Or maybe you got turned into a toad. Is it worth it for you to land on that spot that gives you +1 Strength? Apparently not.If you like board games, then perhaps you'd be willing to learn all the quirks of this game. Personally, I'd rather play something more intuitve & gratifying. I may play this on occation if I'm stuck watching TV with the kids, but there are many other games that can fill the time with a better sense of achievement.			"

The game ofcourse suffers some minor bugs, the most common ones I've encountered relating to connectivity issues when playing with a friend of mine however, if you overlook these issues you will no doubt see just how much of a good find this game is.My first game as a pirate resulted in multiple kidnappings and hilarity ensued. 10/10 would kidnap again.

												I got a copy of the boardgame back in the 80s and I loved it.  Now this is a true representation of the game complete with identical adventure cards (etc) - although Fate's a new one on me.  I also picked up the Dungeon expansion to make my nostalgia complete.  So why the bad review?  It's clunky mess with the interface not being all that intuitive.  Forever clicking the mouse button to speed up some animation only to pause the game.  It just doesn't gel which is a real shame. If you're a fan of the boardgame and can sit through a clunky UI then it's a non-brainer; if you've never played the boardgame don't go near this unless you know you're going to be online with friends.

It is a game that plays EXACTLY like the board game, sped up. you can play at your own pace, pause-able, save-able and ability to play on line! i got this for 5 bucks during 2014 Steam sale and it is the most played game i got the entire sale, i played one game than baught all the expantions.... if you love board-games or fantasy anything Get it...get it now....

												I used to play the tabletop version of this many moons ago when I was a wee lad. I don't know if you can still buy them, but back then you could get, like, a dozen expansions that came with additional game boards like a dungeon and one that allowed you to travel through space. My brother and I liked playing the expansions more than the vanilla game because every expansion added these wicked overpowered new characters and objects and instead of the usual gameplay strat of ""just travel around the outer region for a half an hour to level up before going towards the middle"" it became ""bum rush the space lanes to get the laser rifle and the anti-grav belt and spend the next fifteen minutes griefing the other players until they get mad and give up"".Dad says: If you like this kind of nerd♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's a pretty good buy at $5, but bear in mind that the vanilla game will get old after a couple of hours once you're familliar with all the cards and/or you don't have actual people to play with on mumble. You'll be wanting to get some of the expansions if you enjoy it and those will cost like $5 each, but they should mix up the game enough that you'll find lots of added enjoyment. I really can't recommend paying full price for everything unless you're one of those board game spergs.			"

												In the end, Talisman: Digital Edition is a faithful recreation of the classic board game, from what I've heard.  If you’ve played Talisman on a board or are a fan of tabletop RPGs, odds are you’ll have a blast playing with people from all over the world (or the AI) and I easily recommend purchasing it.  If you aren’t a fan of tabletop or haven’t played it, be aware that Talisman: Digital Edition is not like your typical videogame.  It’s more akin to a board game, and therefore is a sort of niche title.  I’d recommend at least trying it through Steam’s Family Share if possible, or watch extended gameplay trailers to get an idea of what to expect.  I've never played the original board game, so I can't really compare the two.  But for the most part, I found this to be a really enjoyable game.  Even more so as I am an avid boardgamer as well, so now I'll have to find a copy of the physical version later on.As an added bonus, what makes this version of the game stand out against its real-life counterpart is the player progression scheme.  After you beat the game (or even lose it), you earn experience points based on your performance and are rewarded with Runestones and Steam Achievements.  There are fifty achievements on Steam and you can equip your next hero with up to three Runestones which can affect everything from starting lives to not missing a turn when your hero drinks too much in the tavern!  This progression will keep you coming back for more play sessions as you try to accomplish something you didn’t earn in your last play-through.A really great game if you're into these types of games.

												This game is surprisingly fun. Played with a friend or two could be the longest most fun game you have ever played. Alternatively it could be the shortest game ever.. For instance. My friend and I were playing with the reaper and expansions. Five minutes into the game, I managed to get the reaper on top of him and he rolls a 1. Then re-rolls to beat the reaper. Then on my turn I roll into a basalisk and get frozen to death. He wins.			"

It's definetly more fun with friends in person, but if life dictates otherwise, and you want to play a casual game online with friends, pick this up. Perhaps one of the best non-DND tabletops I've played. The digital copy is well done, and you don't have to worry about anyone bumping the table, and throwing off the positions of the cards.8/10, grab it if your a fan of tabletops, a must-grab during a sale.

												I am a board game enthusiast.  I can say with high level of certainty this is the WORST balanced board game I have ever played.  The game design is terrible and mind boggling.  I honestly wonder if they had any playtesting before release.  In addition to the terrible balance issues, the online versions UI is abysmal.  Trying to full screen either gives me a black screen half the time or freezes up.  Casting spells that require any type of timing is almost impossible.  There is no undue button and many commands do not have confirm request.  Do not play this game if you value your time in any way.			"

You will return to this game every time despite the infuriating misfortunes that you will no doubt encounter throughout your endeavours. The game ofcourse suffers some minor bugs, the most common ones I've encountered relating to connectivity issues when playing with a friend of mine however, if you overlook these issues you will no doubt see just how much of a good find this game is.My first game as a pirate resulted in multiple kidnappings and hilarity ensued. 10/10 would kidnap again.

												I got a copy of the boardgame back in the 80s and I loved it.  Now this is a true representation of the game complete with identical adventure cards (etc) - although Fate's a new one on me.  I also picked up the Dungeon expansion to make my nostalgia complete.  So why the bad review?  It's clunky mess with the interface not being all that intuitive.  Forever clicking the mouse button to speed up some animation only to pause the game.  It just doesn't gel which is a real shame. If you're a fan of the boardgame and can sit through a clunky UI then it's a non-brainer; if you've never played the boardgame don't go near this unless you know you're going to be online with friends.

												First off, let me say that the actual gameplay is pretty fun, especially when playing with friends online. The game can get very cut-throat and you will enjoy lots of laughs at the expese of other player's misfortune. The expansions make the game even more enjoyable and there are different game rules available that can make the game more exciting. If I was recommending this on the gameplay alone, I would definitely give it a great review.That being said, this game is TERRIBLE when it comes to programming. It is full of game-stopping glitches that should have been weeded out during development. Nothing is more frustrating than to be two hours into a highly competitive and exciting game, only to have it RUINED by a glitch that will not allow the game to contine. The matchmaking is shotty at best, and the lack of a save feature to save and resume multiple games outside of the single automatic game save really gets on your nerves. This game is not worth buying unless GW fixes the bugs that are killing this game.			"

												Fun with friends. It feels kinda sluggish on PC though, the controls are sometimes confusing. Especially when you need to cast counter spells or simple do something quick. The UI and the game behavious makes it really quite difficult.But it's good old Talisman, be prepared for 10 hour long sessions with lots of praying to RNGod...There's a lot of DLC, consider getting some (Dungeon, Highlands are nice) - they add a lot to the game, as the core game can get boring fast. THe system makes it so that only one person in the lobby needs to own the DLC for it to be active, so if you got a group of friends you can each buy some so split the cost.OR chip in and get the season pass and voila.

												This game isn't for everyone: I'll be the first to admit that! BUT, for those of us who have the patience to sit through a L-O-N-G game, and/or people who remember the actual board game this is based on, this game is FANTASTIC! The Digital Edition is an excellent translation of the board game, although I kinda wish it had been based on the First Edition version of the original: Just think how fun it would be to be able to run through this game as a Space Marine, or the Chainsaw Warrior, or a Dark Eldar!All in all, Talisman: Digital Edition is a worthy successor to the original tabletop boardgame, and buying the Season Pass, while a bit on the pricy side, is MORE than worth it! When they say that you'll get ALL the DLC, they mean it! And there's a LOT more coming!PS: To the reviewer who was hesitant when they learned that Games Workshop held the license for Talisman, I should probably tell you something: Talisman was ALWAYS A Games Workshop game! They were the company who originally developed and released the tabletop version of this game. They've always owned it, just like Warhammer and Blood Bowl!			"

												I'm a longtime fan of this game, as I've had the actual boardgame itself for years. This digital version gives me a great way to play with buddies who I'm not physically around anymore, which is great. I played through one game already and it seems to work fine. There does seem to be one bug with the thief, though: when at the crown of command with another character, he still had the opportunity to steal, despite his character card saying he needed to LAND on the character's space in order to steal from them. Not sure if that was an interpretation thing, an error, or some kind of bug in the code, but thought it was worth mentioning. overall, though, just like the boardgame. Definitely a recommendation for anyone who has friends long distances away that they like playing talisman with, as well as anyone who just loves boardgame type games period.			"

Posted: December 30, 2014
												Upon first impression, I -like- Talisman.  It feels unique and like a 1980s fantasy story/movie as a Roguelike board game.  My Steam recommendation comes with a big HOWEVER:  Ahem.  However, there are two main sets of deterrents from this digitized Talisman game, mechanical and technical.Note that this was my first time EVER playing Talisman in any form!Mechanics-wise, the digital version seems to be an accurate port of the tabletop game. This means, for good and for ill, whatever the tabletop game is, the digital game is too. I enjoyed the ability for each person to have a personal adventure on the same game board while competing for resources and, ultimately, victory. I liked how it was, effectively, a board game version of Dokapon Kingdom (Wii), similar to the card game Munchkin for its randomness and occasional hilarity, and that it was a board game Rogue-lite. Also, props for having a cadre of possible followers, and spells that were rare and powerful!What did I dislike about the mechanics? There is simply TOO MUCH ROLLING! Want to move somewhere? You must roll and get the exact number you need to proceed! Rolling at locations (board spaces), such as to determine whether at a bar you gain or lose money while gambling, or if you start a bar fight, is more sensical and generally should be kept. Rolling was much less of an issue early game and for me as a newbie since I didn't know what I was doing and was not a stickler on trying to win my first game - at least at this phase. I understood ""Be an Assassin, go around killing stuff, level up, and try to win,"" and I wound up close to winning.A simple fix would be to allow movement of any number of spaces no more than the rolled number. Did you roll a 3? You can move 1, 2, or 3 spaces instead of just 3.A second major issue is the need to farm.  Yes, you need to farm in a tabletop game originally released in the 1980s - before the release of video games like Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior that made farming in RPGs popular.  Why?  Because you simply -need- higher stats, more money, and more treasure to survive random encounters and other players in this game!  As a warning to Talisman newbies:  You may reach the center area of the board (and achieving this feels quite random), but you NEED a Talisman to complete the game (found at the top left of the inner rectangle) AND enough Strength or Craft to get through the Mines or Crypt respectively.  This means boosting these stats via fights (randomly generated) or finding the right items to boost your stats (randomly placed).Perhaps it was because we used the Grim Reaper expansion, but the victory condition of, ""All other players must be dead for you to win, even if you're at the Crown of Command,"" made the game take -entirely- too long! Since even dying once is effectively enough to eliminate one person forever, saying, ""Death is permanent,"" would have been enough to expedite the game tremendously! (Currently, a dead player character respawns on at the start of his next turn at his starting space with no gear, no level up bonuses, no followers, and possibly no spells. If this happens at the late game, this dead PC may as well be out of the game.)  My workaround?  A player at the Crown of Command needs to remain in this space for 3 consecutive turns.  If another player reaches the Crown of Command, this timer resets.  This way, the game does not take 60+ minutes to declare a victor with someone already at the Crown of Command, but allows people to get close and perhaps win.We had some technical problems, too. The game, in general, worked. However, one of our players was repeatedly removed from the game due to connection problems, and we had to restart Talisman about 4 times within 20 minutes to get the game running with all of us again. (To do so, the host should go to Online Game >> Private Game while the others should go to Online Game >> Resume Game once the game is up. This will resume a game from the last auto-saved spot.)In addition, the UI is confusing to new players. In the tabletop version of this game, playing a spell card is as easy as declaring you're playing it, then playing it. In the digital version, each player needs to queue spells to go off at the right time. (I accidentally cast Sleep on myself because I assumed it would go off on the next person's turn.) I also felt unsure of what things did until I did them - like gaining followers or fighting things or trying to use the Portal. Sometimes, this was no big deal (like fighting), but sometimes (like using the Portal), I wish I would have known and understood the important bits before I went through with my actions.Is Talisman worth playing?  That depends.  I liked it because I also liked Munchkin and Dokapon Kingdom and feel they capture the essence of this game better.  Munchkin bypasses the board entirely and go straight for the random danger/delight/treasure in a similar fashion to Talisman, with less die rolling. (As an aside, there is a Munchkin Quest board game which I've not played.)  Dokapon Kingdom's interface is generally better than Talisman's, but it suffers from ""too long to play this game casually in a group setting"" syndrome.  Dokapon can be enjoyed in short bursts among friends, but is not at all meant to be completed in a single sitting.  (According to GameFAQs, Dokapon Kingdom's full game length, from start to finish, is around 60 hours!)  Talisman seemingly -is- meant to be completed in a single session, but around 4 hours for a digital version of a board game made me want to add the aforementioned house rules just to change that to 30-60 minutes.  If you can deal with the tremendous randomness, and have supportive friends who enjoy playing Talisman with you, Talisman is a worthwhile game.Talisman, in its current form, is somewhere between a tabletop board game and a tabletop RPG.  It's more complicated than Monopoly, but less complicated than D&D 3.5.  A full game of Talimsan (an estimated 3.5 to 5.5 hours) is around the estimated session time of a tabletop RPG, like D&D.Talisman is something to experience once or on occasion, but it requires a dedicated group to enjoy it perpetually.IN SUMMARY:+Competitive fantasy RPG-lite and Rogue-lite adventuring.+Fun to play, unique in its design, and created and maintained as a passion project.+Assassin, Ghoul, and Dark Cultist classes are likely to get you a win.+Less setup and hassle than many tabletop RPG campaigns.-Way too long.-Way too random.-Way too confusing without someone first telling you a lot of the game (how to win, what classes to play, what stats do, the good and bad options).

												Seems to rely on loaded dice to provide a challenge as opposed to any sort of competent and forward thinking AI.  But if you don't mind that, it's not a bad game.  Believe the devs when they say the dice don't cheat?  You cannot convince me.  Here is just one tale of one game I played:Yes, I have read that they claim all dice rolls are generated before the game even starts and the order doesn't change, ie no cheating dice.  I call BS.  Pushed my way to the crown and suddenly of the 3 AI players, 2 start doing everything they can to help/save the 4th.  The fourth starts making amazing rolls and I realize I'm only getting above a 3 one in seven rolls.  Amazing given it should be roughly 50/50 chance.  But for 40 rolls I only get 6 above a 3.  Because the other 2 AI were even using their healing spells on the 4th that means it was down to me and that 4th AI.  He bounces around the board always managing to land any time I get manage to get his health down by 2, collect 7 followers, 7 items, crazy stats, and heads for the portal that's been up since the start of the game.  About this time I get him down to 1 health and think, ""Surely, this must be almost over.""  Two rounds later he gets to the portal and of course rolls a 6 putting him in the Plains near the end.  Three rounds later he has rolled a 1 at the vampire and a 1 at the Pitfiends.  He's still at 1 health and I've now rolled 7 times less than a 4.  He keeps coming and I keep failing to roll above a 3.  Right before he gets to the crown I manage to roll a 6 and take him out.  The game sustained a 1 in 7 chance of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 on a six sided die for an hour.  Just me clicking ""next"" cause once you get to the crown there's nothing else you can do.  Exciting.  That was just one game.  Will not play again.  Do not recommend.			"

												Buggy as hell.Have the board game for this, picked up this version in the humble bundle and had a game with two other friends online.So many bugs.  Turns getting stuck, getting kicked out with odd error messages,  multiple disconnections.  Each time you can get back in, but the AI will have taken a turn or two for you.  Happened to everyone playing.  Basically, imagine playinga  board game where you might be told you have to go outside and come back in before taking a turn at random, and when you do the board might not be the same as when you left it.The board game is excellent, stick with that and skip this.

												The interface is counterintutive and possibly buggy. You can cast a spell and then be left wondering why the moves you're trying to make are invalid. There's no feedback. For example, I just spent about an hour playing through a game and then cast a spell that let me to eliminate any face up encounter card. I clicked on literally every single card on the board. Nothing happened. I have no idea what the game wanted from me, but I was left with no way to progress and no way to cancel the action. I just had to quit. All that time was wasted.The game itself, well, it's Talisman. Classic Ameritrash with absolutely no strategy. For the most part, things just happen.ETA: Played more to be fair and encountered AI entering infinite loops. I stand by my review.			"

												Well I wasn't expecting something awesome, but after half hour my interest changed into bitterness. A lots of classes is what I really liked about this game. A different options of game style can keep you even in most boring games for a long period of time. But after I discovered how the dice works the fate of this game was forever sealed for me. You will mostly get 1 to 3 on normal rolls and when you roll 1 next roll will be 4. When you roll 2 next roll wil be 5 and same with 3 and 6. The problem is that mostly your opponent gets those good rolls and until you use fate you are screwed. Besides of the evil dice you get a lot of bugs like getting stuck after spell failure because you press some key on the keyboard and there is nothing you can do except for quiting the game. Your raft won't work, your items and so on ... and I experienced this in about 2 hours ... so you can make a picture.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It is definitely best played with a group of friends which you can converse with. To be entirely honest, it is not that great if you play against the AI. The AI has this ability to screw themselves in ways that are entirely possible to avoid with a little bit of thought. For instance, the AI will use an axe to get across the river only to cross back to the outer area the next turn.I would highly recommend this to people which enjoy tabletop games which contain both an element of strategy and an element of luck. There is a lot in this game which requires luck, but once you have played a few games, you can get a feel of what the better spaces and strategies are. Playing with random characters also forces you to get used to new ways of playing the game, making each game much different from the last.Keep in mind, a single string of bad luck can pretty much end your run in the game or force you to play catch up for the remainder of the game if everyone else is doing well.

												I like board games. Talisman is a decent board game. And while this game models the board game fairly well, there is one critical issue and several other annoyances.The critical issue is that the dice roll is not randomised. To demonstrate, perform a turn to see how the die rolls, exit, reload, and then re-do your turn to see the dice roll the exact same way. I've performed different actions and even seen the AI players get the dice rolls I would have got. It's ridiculous. The whole point of rolling a dice is to be random. Not random = not a dice roll.The annoyances are as previously alerted to in prior reviews, mostly to do with poor AI, but I could have lived with that had the dice rolls actually been pseudo-random, you know, ceiling(math.rand()*6) or something.

												Do not pay full purchase for this game.I havn't played Talisman before, so take that in mind.The interface is slow and clumsy. It takes 3 seconds for anything you click to work. Looking at an inventory can be a challenge in itself.You can't look at the spaces outside of your turns, and when you do, it takes ages again. You can't just scroll over it, you have to right-click it, wait, right-click it again, wait and then right-click a card you might want to check on it.The timing of spell cards and everything is thrown out the window, because the clicking responses are very, very slow.And that isn't getting to the bugs.Out for the 4 games I have played so far, each single one has been wrecked because of the terrible interface and bugs.Game one, I choose an apprentice wizard. Get to one life, and look at one of my spells waiting for my turn.Turn comes up, the spell casts itself. And I die to a miscast.Game two, I get a courtesan. I go to flirt with an orc, and take his useful follower, giving me a massive lead. Instead, after looking at his inventory, as I back out, it decided to take me backing out of his inventory as a challenge to combat. Instead of taking something, I then enter physical combat, whith my 2 against his 5 bonus. I lose. He then takes my magical bag of holding, a bag that says on the card 'This card can not be taken in combat', which contained every single bit of my loot.I'm just happy I got this with Humble Bundle, but I won't get my 5 hours back.That said, I now want to play the physical board game. Since that is more social, faster (yes, this game is faster to play physically) and has no bugs.			"

												I'm actually old enough to own the original board game, which, I absolutely love! I spent many, many hours as a kid beating... I mean, ""questing"" with my friends. We'd all be sitting on the carpet in the living room, game pieces scattered thither, huddled around the game board as if we were spying into one our dads' Playboy magazines trying not to get caught. Tensions ran high as we traversed the outer ring of the board (or Outer Earth as we called it) in search of glorious adventure and immense wealth. Eventually, one friend would amusingly decide to try to kill off another; starting a great fued betwixt families, and a furious battle would ensue. With every roll of the dice, the once trusting and playful comrades, would try to land on each others spaces to chip off yet another foe's life. All in the hopes of being the last warrior standing... until of coarse... the final blow was struck... the fallen combatant, silent in his shame, with head hung low, would sit and let the anger of defeat fester like a boil. As the heckling and laughter of his friends grew louder, ringing in his ears, becoming too much to bear, the conquered warrior would growl in rage! Leaping up from the game and running away like the wind. Totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ He'd jump upon his iron steed, and peddle off into the night, cursing us. Claiming he would never play with us... ever... again.But... we knew he'd be back. Now that I'm a grown-up (or at least supposed to be), this digital version still lets me enjoy beating... I mean ""questing"" with my friends, even though we're scattered across the globe. It's awesome. And. it's a perfect game for hanging out with the guys online, having a few beers, and sharing a few laughs.It's a great port of the board game. It's challenging, and the DLC is great. Totally worth the money!			"

												I am a board game enthusiast.  I can say with high level of certainty this is the WORST balanced board game I have ever played.  The game design is terrible and mind boggling.  I honestly wonder if they had any playtesting before release.  In addition to the terrible balance issues, the online versions UI is abysmal.  Trying to full screen either gives me a black screen half the time or freezes up.  Casting spells that require any type of timing is almost impossible.  There is no undue button and many commands do not have confirm request.  Do not play this game if you value your time in any way.			"

												this game was a whole lot of fun right up until i ran into a game feature that i consider a bug. it involved a character having an item that only allowed them to move one space at a time with a healer one space away from her. in short it meant that even though i had reached the end and should have been able to experience victory, due to the enemy AI's consistent choice to heal itself, i was stuck in a loop of taking some of her life only to watch her heal it back again....this was the most irritating ""feature"" i have seen in a long time. esspecially since it robbed me of the opportunity to experience victory. but this is just my opinion, feel free to try for yourselves since it is free this weekend.

												If you enjoy the board game, chances are you'll enjoy this. It's essentially just the board game in video game form, which I personally view as a positive. Now, if you can't get a group of friends together to play, you have the option to play against AI or other players online.  Much like the board game, expansions are purchased separately, so keep that in mind.  But the game does come with options for some popular house rules.  My only complaints are that the interface is a little hard to navigate at first and the game only supports up to 4 players instead of 6, but they aren't huge problems that really hamper the game.  In short, I'd recommend to any Talisman fans out there!			"

												Review for owners of the physical version of Talisman:This is an awesome digital version of the game, and plays in a fraction of the time since all the rules and book-keeping are done for you.  Spell casting is a little quirky but if you read the tutorial closely and play a few times it's not a problem.Review for people who have never heard of this game:Talisman is a fantasy, D&D-esque themed game.  You are racing/battling your opponents to get to the center of the board to trigger the end game (which could be several different scenarios depending on what expansions you have).Be warned, however. You are playing against the game as much as you are your opponents.  While this game does not lack meaningful decision making, there is a heafty dose of RNG as well.    "

												Despite it's bugs and somewhat sluggish play, it's still Talisman- you can't just beat that. There are always people playing it (at least in Europe), the community is nice, even if there is a problem the devs help- not many games out there you can say something like that about. Yes, the expansions are pretty expensive, and the game itself is 4.5 ed (which is a shame, since the series became so stripped and partitioned compared to the 1st edition), but it hasn't lost it's magic in any way.10/10 would become a toad again.

I would hate to think how long it would take to play a game if it were humans instead of AIs that I had to wait for.			"

												Well I wasn't expecting something awesome, but after half hour my interest changed into bitterness. A lots of classes is what I really liked about this game. A different options of game style can keep you even in most boring games for a long period of time. But after I discovered how the dice works the fate of this game was forever sealed for me. You will mostly get 1 to 3 on normal rolls and when you roll 1 next roll will be 4. When you roll 2 next roll wil be 5 and same with 3 and 6. The problem is that mostly your opponent gets those good rolls and until you use fate you are screwed. Besides of the evil dice you get a lot of bugs like getting stuck after spell failure because you press some key on the keyboard and there is nothing you can do except for quiting the game. Your raft won't work, your items and so on ... and I experienced this in about 2 hours ... so you can make a picture.			"

												Do you love boardgames? Do you own boardgames? Do you play them with your friends (hopefully!)? Than this game CAN definatly be for you. But it also depends on how much nostalgia you feel for Talisman. Us boardgamers in general probably wont like this game, it takes a lot of time (can take up to 3 hours), your actions are ALMOST completley random thanks to dicerolling. And you also lose the feeling of moving components around on a board which is a huge part of the enjoyment for this game. If you're a not a boardgamer I would recomend that you stay away from this game. It probably wont meet up with any (if any) of your expectations. This game can be fun with a few friends but you will probably end up only playing a single game of it before moving on to some other game or you know... any other REAL boardgame. Talisman in general is sadly not a great boardgame nomatter how much nostalgia you feel for it. It's basicly a more nerdy version of Monopoly which is the worst... boardgame... ever. Instead of getting this get the game for your pads so that you can play it on long trips on a buss, train, car (unless you're driving) and plane. But make sure you have some people to play with even then./ Nurgleprobe "

												I used to play this game often with my old roomates twenty years ago. This is an amazing adaptation. The graphics are awesome and faithfully reproduce the board. It would really be nice if other board games could make the digital transition like this one. My only real complaint is that the AI seemed like it was cheating since it would regularily get the rolls it needed to win some unlikely battles or land on a coveted card. I found myself using an exploit to get around the questionable rolls but recently it was updated and the exploit no longer works. The new update seems to generate a dice table the same way many other digital dice games do. I got the season pass for this one also and have been loving all the DLC. The Dungeon is pretty cool. If you liked the original board game then this one is a must. Its easy to loose many hours here.			"

												Review for owners of the physical version of Talisman:This is an awesome digital version of the game, and plays in a fraction of the time since all the rules and book-keeping are done for you.  Spell casting is a little quirky but if you read the tutorial closely and play a few times it's not a problem.Review for people who have never heard of this game:Talisman is a fantasy, D&D-esque themed game.  You are racing/battling your opponents to get to the center of the board to trigger the end game (which could be several different scenarios depending on what expansions you have).Be warned, however. You are playing against the game as much as you are your opponents.  While this game does not lack meaningful decision making, there is a heafty dose of RNG as well.    "

												After other players managed to convince me the constant crashes are due to a recent expansion and the Devs are usually on top of it with fixes, I realised that it was the hand of fate that made me start this game in the middle of utter chaos.Thus, on the basis of the game alone, I give it my thumbs up(changed from negative).Yes, the game itself, when not crashing, is fun. Well, for people with stamina and patience and time for a bit of commitment it is fun,for people that like the intimacy of boardgames it is fun, I do not recommend it for impatient kids that can't sit still for 15 minutes, because fun will not be had.Is it worth the money the expansion sets cost? That is something everyone needs to decide for themselves, in comparison I'd say it's not too steep (although I'm tight enough to have weighed these words before typing them).All in all, (and I'm liking it more every time I play a game without crashing), I give the game a careful 6.7 out of 10.Please take my playing time into account, which isn't very long, check the reviews of those who have been playing it for longer, or you know, take the plunge!Greetings fellow travellores and connaisseurs of Trollplaying games (TPG's) "

												Despite it's bugs and somewhat sluggish play, it's still Talisman- you can't just beat that. There are always people playing it (at least in Europe), the community is nice, even if there is a problem the devs help- not many games out there you can say something like that about. Yes, the expansions are pretty expensive, and the game itself is 4.5 ed (which is a shame, since the series became so stripped and partitioned compared to the 1st edition), but it hasn't lost it's magic in any way.10/10 would become a toad again.

												Awesome game board.  Each tile can be an adventure onto itself, huge variety of cards in the draw deck.  Excellent conversion of boardgame to computer.  Handles excellently with context-aware menus.  Unfortunately, it's all in the service of a frankly boring King of the Hill scenario.  Infinite respawn until someone reaches the center square, permadeath afterwards.  50% chance that if there's only one character in the center square, all other characters take damage.  If there's more  than one character in the center square then the damage-to-all-else effect turns off while they battle it out.  Considering how easy it is to gain life...If Nomad Games Limited had any other games then I would highly recommend checking them out considering the amount of depth and quality shown here - but they don't seem to have any available.

												I want to enjoy this game, I really do, but there are 3 problems:1.  This game is unbalanced, with some characters being clearly better than other characters.  2.  The interface is terrible.  Spells are incredibly difficult to cast correctly with no ability to decide whether you cast the spell or not based on the presumed result.  Once you click the button, a cavalcade of unintended consequences occur just because you cast it in the wrong phase.  3.  You have very little control over the course of the game.  It is a long game of fantasy Monopoly.  You roll die that determine your fate entirely.  It clearly was created at a time where quantity in a game was more important than quality or balance.			"

I love my board games, but not being able to finish a game is incredibly frustrating. Would not recommend people pay money until the game is fixed. How do they have so many expansions out without even making sure the base game works.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition은 1~6인용 보드게임 Talisman 4판을 Nomad Games Limited에서 PC 및 휴대기기용으로 제작한 1~4인용 게임입니다. 일전에 이에 앞서 유료데모로 내놓는 만행을 벌였던 Talisman: Prologue에 대해서 리뷰( http://etude87.tistory.com/97 )한 적이 있는데 그것의 완성판으로 2014년 2월 26일에 출시되었습니다.PC 이식 및 네트워크 멀티플레이를 지원한다는 장점이 있으나 멍청한 A.I와 기본 구조적 한계 그리고 각종 멀티플레이를 저어하게 만드는 요소들로 인해 Talisman: Digital Edition은 싹수부터 노랗다는 것을 다시 한번 증명했습니다. 타인에게 썩 추천하고 싶지 않습니다만 비교적 저렴한 가격과 휴대용 기기용으로도 많이 나왔으니 친구들과 모여서 보드게임 하고 싶을 때 실물 대신 사용하는 정도로는 쓸모가 있을 것입니다. 더 자세한 내용은 블로그 포스트( http://etude87.tistory.com/179 )를 참고.ps. 최근 시즌패스 내용물 관련해서 차후 추가될 모든 컨텐츠 제공이란 문구를 수정하고 열번째 캐릭터팩을 시즌패스 적용외 물품으로 내놓으면서 커뮤니티 허브에서도 말이 많아진 상태입니다.

												Incredibly fun and infuriating at the same time.  Requires more than 1 play through for you to really appreciate the game, and while the game is heavily luck dependant, there is strategy in managing your resources and coming up with plans to try and succeed from almost all points of the game.  You could be 2 turns from being the winner and then fnd yourself turned toad if youve wasted all your resources getting to where you are.  Two good bonuses to the already good game are that1) The bots are very well made and provide an excellent alternative for when you dont have friends to play with or cant find an open game online2) With the exception of the specific character DLC, as long as the host of a game owns a content DLC, players without the DLC can still join and play with the content (they still wont be able to use the DLC characters however)			"

												My hours in the digital version are small, but don't let that waver your opinion of my opinion of this unforgiving mistress of a game.I went out and bought the physical edition, and have accumulated several expansions because of how much I absolutely adore the abuse this game deals out (aka: I've dropped over $200 on this series alone).The gamestyle is a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of Dungeons&Dragons, and Munchkin.  You each have your own character with their own special attributes and abilities... and often try to screw each other over as much as possible to try and reach the Crown of Command.Expansion packs will add different endings to the game.  One being a Black Hole type card, where if you reveal it, you disappear into the void and the game ends for you.  She's a ♥♥♥♥♥, and I love her.Other endings can reward players depending on if you have the most gold by the end, a certain amount of trophies, etc.  Other endings are revealed at the beginning of the game; one expansion has a setting where all of the characters are by default good, and you're working towards a similiar cause.Expansions also bring different playstyles to the game.  Grim Reaper has already been introduced, who you can send after other players if you happen to roll a 1.""Blood Moon"" will introduce a werewolf, who moves when a 6 is rolled, and is a mirror of old Grimmy.City, Highlands, Dungeon, and Wildlands are all corner expansions which adds to the map itself.The digital version isn't without error.  There are occasional cards, that when played, will crash the game.  This is usually per them being a target card being played when there was nothing to target.  I wish there was a verify system before setting something into play.The Gold Pack is definitely worth it if you're looking into playing the game for a long time, as it includes every expansion available - and they will be released as they're finished by Nomad.  This also includes side character DLC!The way it works (since I couldn't find an answer to this when I bought the game), is that the person with the gold bundle should be hosting.  That way all of the people who join will have access to the content.  BUT, they will not be able to select any of the DLC characters.  They can, however, select random, and have a chance of drawing one (or three depending on house rules).An average game lasts anywhere from 2-5 hours from our experience.			"

												This is a nice digital rendition of the original boardgame. It is however somewhat limited in how you play cards, and there should really be an option when you cue a card to be played where you get a question if you want to play it or not when a situation triggers where the card can be played. Currently you have to time certain cards very precisely and you'll end up targeting yourself with bad spells and throw away other cards simply because the game is programmed so that if you cue a card you mindlessly play it on whatever is a legal target. Ruins a lot of the fun unfortunately. If they patch this the game will be close to perfect in it's resemblance of the original boardgame.			"

												This game is a giant waste of time. It could have been great but with brain dead AI and the game actively cheating to make you lose to make up for the unimaginably stupid AI it boils down to an extremely boring slog. I even reached the center only for the game to drag on for another two hours as the AI was too dumb to reach the center and fight me while I rolled less than 4 several times in a row interspaced by one or two times rolling high enough to do damage only for the enemy to miraculously roll the exact number to land on a healing spot over and over and over again. The only reason I won is because they managed to damage themselves to the point where I could kill them with 1 lucky roll. I should be paid for having to suffer through that crap. My recommendation stay away setting the money that could be spent on this game on fire would be a more worthwhile investment and this game.			"

												This is a game that plays you. It's a dated digital boardgame. I could see how a lot of people like it, especially if they grew up playing it - that whole nostalgia factor, but it is incredibly long between turns and there is no reason to pay attention to what other players are doing. Due to the completely random nature of the game there is no skill needed to play it or become good. After 30 or 40 rounds I was easily the most powerful player and well on my way to winning, but I found myself extremely bored. I even tried to get myself killed, and succeeded, hoping that the game would be over. That just wasn't the case, and I found myself reset at the same point in the game - grinding to get more powerful to further advance inward. I increasingly found myself stepping away from the computer between turns after a couple of rounds. This just isn't for me. It might be more fun with other people, chatting over mics while doing something else more brain intensive. I'd honestly rather just play a better game with friends.			"

												Most buggy game I have ever played. And I have DOSBox.Top 5 bugs and interface fails:1) The spell ""Twist of Fate"" which should let you choose the outcome of a reroll fails to do anything because the game is ambiguous about when it should be cast.2)  If you have the bag that lets you carry 4 items, you have to reuse it every time you want to add/remove an item!3) No sound indicating it's your turn. You have to stare at the screen for 5 hours because the game's too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to let you know it's your turn to act.4) The game throws you out of screens that you're looking at, making it a manic rush to click on your counterspell when an opponent tries to turn you into a toad.5) When a player leaves (ragequits over the terrible interface), the game rewinds about 2 actions. You can choose to follow the previous path (and get the exact same outcome, suggesting that draws and rolls are predetermined), or a new path, in case the old one didn't end up being very lucrative....

												The game premise is pretty good and I think I would enjoy the actual board game, but as it stands the digital version of the game is somewhat poorly made. I've had numerous glitches occur, and some aspects of the interface are rather annoying. My biggest complaint so far is having played a game as a Ninja the victory condition made it impossible to win. I was required to obtain 2 followers and then discard them in order to complete a Warlock Quest. Ninjas can not have followers. Therefore  I couldn't win. I got a cursed item that made me lose all of my quests, which I used to get rid of that quest and go take a different Warlock quest, to which the game made me take the same quest again, with no roll or anything even though the spot said to roll for it. I did have some irratations with the interface, but those could be avoided once a player becomes familiar with the game. The games been out long enough that really big glitches like this should probably have been patched out. Theres also very squirly things with the NPC players where they will often drag on their turns for a while picking up every single item on a square, and then put every item back down because they lack inventory space, even though they won't take any of the actual items. I could go on, but I got the game for a steal so I can't complain too much. Thinking im going to go buy the board game now though. I rather like the actual game.			"

												Having played this game a few times now, I've so far encountered: an idiotic AI that doesn't attempt to reach the crown of command, required to win the game, despite having near-max stats.  An AI that will move a single space every turn due to a poltergeist, healing each turn and therefore causing a stalemate, causing me to lose out on XP and achievement progress.  And most recently, an AI that on the brink of a loss decides to constantly check his inventory on an infinite loop, disallowing me my final turn like the worst of poor losers.  Having experienced all this with just 4.7 hours on record shows what a terrible game this is, in terms of AI, bugs, and problems with the game system in general.May still try the online mode as friends have bought the game, but if playing against the AI just give up now.  Either you won't be allowed to win, or it will be a hollow victory.			"

Turns take far to long even at speed 10.Horrible Networking, I couldn't see games and had to have my friends invite me. We played for a while and then one of us couldn't do anything and it just sat there, so we reloaded and now only I could see the network games and had to invite everyone else. Also the method of resuming an online game is... an afterthought.Buggy, we ran into many crashes , cards would not cast at the end of your turn like they said even though they were qued, amoung many other incorrect spell castings.Dissapointing end game, just standing on the crown rolling 1 die every round with no option of leaving or backtracking, not sure who thought that up but it was bad. Players could just sit there and pelt you with spells build up there stats  and then kill you.Total dissapointment.The Music was uninspired.The price, $79.99 for the complete version, I won't ever play this again even if its free.

And this isnt first and last game breaking bug sometimes game forces you to do something because it jams every other option.-Sometimes gameplay is super slow,like when you cast spells it takes far too longIf they fix the bugs ill give this port 9/10 (9 cause it could look more pretty) and recommend it but until then 4/10 cause of the bugs in this game.

												Ok, first of all there is no decent tutorial and the link to the rules leads you to an  extensive site full of text. First play I stayed completely lost in the game for several turns, the cards were showing up too fast and I had no idea of what was going on.After understanding a little of what was going on I tryed to play with random AI characters. I lost 3 encounters in a row on the first 3 tutns and died, while the AI got several followers and Items. Just a bad experience, ok I rage quit and restart.Second go: Oponent first turns rolls to other side of the river, flips 3 cards gets 7 gold. My first turn Dragon. Another bad experience, ok...Third try I realized I could set AI speed, I realized I could pause the game and check on the cards, but I still dont know where the buffs and debuffs are coming from, I loose battle even though I win battles, a guy fights me with 2 strenght and suddenly he has 8 strenght. I lost 3 turns in a row, frogged, one of my oponents has talisman, belt of strenght, solomons crown and a unicorn, I died once, got lost in cave and lost all my gold gambling.Long story short, I played the game times, never drew an equipment,the only follower i had was a hag and I died several times, while having no tooltips hints or decent tutorial, it took me an hour to realize my re-rolls were consuming fate counters and I couldn't understanding why it was not working anymore. I rage quit all of the games I started.Some my say it was just a bad luck or the game is hard, I see it as a very very bad experience that was worsen by the fact that the game leaves you in the dark.I still don't know what trophies are for, ehat happens when you fight a player, what's the point of capturing a wolf as follower and what or where is the chasm.[UPDATE]Just found out the dice rolls are rigged, no matter how many times I load the game on the same save spot, the dice results for ALL the rolls are the same, even the fate re-rolls are the sam. This was the most frustrating discovery so far. I don't know if there is a reason for that, or they just couldn't design an easy and simple dice roll algorithm.			"

												I simply love how you can either play this game offline with 3 AIs or play with your friends. Its a great transition from the board game and I can't wait to see what they come out with as DLC. Though I would warn you now, playing with all of the DLC makes for a rather confusing game.			"

												Talisman is a faithful digital re-creation of the board game I played and loved as a teen. However, as with most board game conversions, it really loses somthing when playing on a computer. It's just not much fun without a crowd of friends huddled around the table.Recommended for fans of the original who want to relive the past, but not for new players. If you've never played Talisman, I recommend the board game, but not the computer version.			"

												The game has an interesting premise and reminds me of the old fanished adventure board games you would sit around and play with friends. It has a lot of potential but sadly squanders it.Most of the game is simply rolling a die and leaving it up to chance, personal choice and interaction with the game is fairly minimal which takes away from the sense of adventure. It will also generally lack much interesting challenges or encounters for certain spans of time, where the game basically becomes circle around the map until you draw something good.It allows up to four players to take turns on the same computer though, so that's a plus.

												I have been playing this game for about 6 months now, and I've finally had it with this game. This game is FULL of bugs. The game will routinely change the rules on you and outright cheat to help the AI and screw over players. That isn't even the part that bothers me though. The game has had a problem with crashing and lost connections since I started playing, but it is now to a point where I can't go more than 2 minutes without getting kicked from a game. Even if I rejoin the game each time, the program will eventually crash and I am forced to close the game. This is not just my experience - all of my friends experience the same thing, and a quick search online shows that many people are fed up with these same problems. Do not even waste your time buying this game, the devs don't care about fixing the MASSIVE issues that make this game wholly unplayable. For how long this game has been on the market, there is no excuse for this. The devs should be ashamed and either FIX THE PROBLEMS or get this game off the market.			"

Other bugs: At times players are unable to target or deselect target, incorrect sums with dice rolls and modifiers, some card/game mechanics just not working as they should 100 percent of the time. I am loving this game and wish there were not so many game breaking bugs. If these issues were fixed I would recommend this game.			"

												For those who can't get to an actual table often (or at all) this is a great alternative to play Talisman.  Don't know what it is?  Think Fantasy Monopoly and you sort of have the idea, only instead of buying properties and gathering cash and boning your friends, you're fighting monsters, gathering treasure, gambling money, and... well, boning your friends.  It's an all-time classic board game.Only downside is they charge about the same amount for the DLC as they do for the real game's expansions, so if you actually can get a good regular gaming group together, getting the actual game is probably a much better course of action for you.Note: as of this writing, the DLC list has shrunk down to three, so the above comment may no longer be valid, but during the Early Access, you could see listed all the expansions for the physical game at the same price.  This may turn up later.EDIT: Don't know why my play counter is 0.  I've definitely played this a helluvalot more than that.			"

												7/10 - Lovers of fantasy board games, buy. Others pass...Pros- Lots of Characters- Lots of Cards, Spells, & Events- Easy to play while multi-tasking (TV, other games, ect.)- Online multiplayer content.Cons- Too much DLC- I swear dice are rigged vs AI- Graphics could be better.- Repetative music.- Many mechanics to learn & employ.So, I'm not big on board games. I got this in a Humble Bundle & decided to try it out. For a board game, it's pretty entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7/10 & a thumbs up. If it weren't a board game, I'd give it a 4/10. The game flow is pretty boring & the DLC is somewhat frustrating.It's great that they want to keep the game up-to-date, & I don't expect them to work for free. However there's a bit of a pay-to-win feel, when you're looking at some of the newer content. It's not just new event cards, or ""Alternative Ending Cards"". It's new characters with OP abilities, or OP ""Runes"" (upgrades to base stats).I also wish there was more flash & awe while playing the game. I mean, you pick up a ""blizzard"" card; you expect to see the board covered in a wash of hail! You have tons of spells, but nothing beyond the card's artwork to help you imagine the effect! The game falls a bit flat when it comes to graphic possibilites.The same goes for the music. It's not bad, but it rarely changes. It's so monotonous. With so many events & the dynamic of ""who's winning"", alignments, what board section your in, ect. you'd think there'd me more variety.I complained about the game's loaded dice vs AI. I rolled a ""1"" 5 times in a row on the same square. This happened twice in one game, then once again in the following game. While it's not impossible to do, it's highly improbable. If the dice aren't loaded, maybe I should play the lottery...There's some strategy, but for the most part the strategy is overriden by the RNG of the dice rolls. Personally, I'd be more entertained with a game of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. You have a greater feeling of control, knowing what's in your hand & in your deck. In Talisman: Digital Edition, nothing is guarenteed. You can have 8 godly items one moment; nothing the next. There's nothing you can do about it, & it just makes you feel like the game is a big waste of time.Lastly, there are a lot of quirks with regard to when & how you do things. I had a ""Siphon Strength"" card that I tried using for 10 turns. Suddenly it worked on an opponent that I never selected nor was he near me; just a random event. You need to learn which items are consumed on use, and which arn't. Or maybe you got turned into a toad. Is it worth it for you to land on that spot that gives you +1 Strength? Apparently not.If you like board games, then perhaps you'd be willing to learn all the quirks of this game. Personally, I'd rather play something more intuitve & gratifying. I may play this on occation if I'm stuck watching TV with the kids, but there are many other games that can fill the time with a better sense of achievement.			"

												One of the best board games of a long past era, Talisman evokes the core of 1980s RNG heavy dice rolling board games. For those of us who lived in that time, before Germany came along and showed the world how great board games can be, this is a well realized throwback nostalgia title. That's not to say Talisman is a great board game. It's really not. It's exceptionally RNG heavy and can be frustrating at times. But, it's also pretty fun. Particularly when playing with a group of friends over Skype, Mumble, etc. The game itself is very easy to learn. Roll a die. Move. Do what's on the board. Try to improve your character enough to get to the center, defeat the challenge, and win the game.The software implementation of Talisman by Nomad is pretty good. The animations and sounds are good, the graphics are pretty, and it plays the way you would expect. We've only run into a few bugs, one game-breaking, over a bunch of sessions. One of the really nice things Nomad did was allow the host's version of Talisman to be played. I have the full season pack, and a bunch of my friends have the core game only. I host, and we can play with all of the expansions.There are 3 expansions out so far. The best one at the moment is The Dungeon, which adds a large board segment to one of the corners. I'm very much looking forward to when all of the expansions are out and you can play a big mega game.Game time can run a bit long. While this is faster than the tabletop version, budget about one hour per player per game. I recommend, but this definitely isn't for everyone. I sunk about 100 hours into Talisman Prologue (which was their single-player ""Beta"" version of this and about a dozen hours so far for the full release. This is a fun one to pull out once in a while with friends, like any good board game.			"

												About 2 years ago (mid-2013), Talisman Prologue introduced me to Talisman on Android, and i thoroughly enjoyed it. When Talisman came out, i did not hesitate to get it and have not stopped playing it since. i only got Steam Talisman working in a Windows VM today, so Steam still rates me as a Noobite, but i've got well over 200 Talisman sessions behind me on Android. It is a near-perfect rendition of the board game (which i have also bought since becoming a fan). Many consider it to be too random, but the fact is that it holds a lot of strategy (part of which is dealing with the randomness). Talisman is _easily_ my most-played Android game, and now that Steam works on my desktop machine (via a Windows VM), it will certainly become my most-played non-Android/non-Linux game as well.If any notable degree of randomness just makes you angry, don't try Talisman, but if you're looking for a lighthearted beer-and-pretzels style fantasy romp, Talisman might just fit the bill in epic form.Tip for new players: PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LEARN THE GAME IN SOLO MODE BEFORE PLAYING ONLINE!!!! Few things are more frustrating in online play than having to wait for new players to read every single card and every single square every single turn. So please, for the love of your fellow players, play it solo _AT LEAST 50 TIMES_ before playing online. Learn 90%+ of the cards and board spaces by heart. Your fellow players will appreciate it and will stop dropping out of games which you cause to drag on for 2 hours longer than necessary because you didn't do your homework before playing. Please. Thank you.			"

												This is a very good way to test Talisman out and see if you like it before purchasing it as a board game. The physical game is more expensive, especially if you end up buying all the other characters and expansions, so I would definitely suggest buying everything on steam and testing it all out to see what you like and don't like. It is also makes the rules very clear opposed to the physical copy, which makes you guess at some rules because of wording. All in all, I would suggest getting this game if you are at all interested in buying the physcal version. You may even like this version more, as you can always join tables online if you want to play but your friends are unavailable. It is sometimes buggy and won't load characters the first time you start it up and friends join, but that problem goes away the second time you start the game. I own both the physcial and PC version of this game, and though I prefer the physcial board game, I do enjoy this thoroughly.			"

												After putting +100 hours in this game, i decided to write my first review, to hopefully raise awareness to this amazing tabletop. Talisman is great for fantasy lovers and offers lots of diferent heros with different abilities to play as, which is one of my favourite features in a game. All the heros are fun, some more powerful than others, but every one of them can win if you manage to use its abilities to its full potential. Although there is some skill involved in this game, most of the player's performance is driven by luck. Preety much all actions (movement, combat, encounters) are defined/influenced by the dice rolls. This means that no matter how experienced you are, you can get destroyed by a noob who installed the game 10 minutes prier, which can be frustrating at times. Another thing worth noting is that there are lots of possibilities for turning the tide in the middle of the game. This means that even if you're losing completely and the other players have much better stats than you, theres always a chance one of them will suddenly turn into a toad (and therefore leaving all objects/followers available to pickup) and allowing you to get all his stuff. Or maybe someone is about to enter the Crown of Comand (the place you need to reach to win the game) and you cast a spell on them and force him to loose his Talisman, the one object that allows them to get there. This triggers a lot of people, but i personally think it adds a lot to the game, and even though this stuff has happened to me numerous times, i end up having a laugh about it because at the end of the day, the game is fun. Just note that there's never a guaranteed win/loss, and you can always hope for a comeback or fear your demise! Expansions make the game a whole lot better, and the more you have, the more varied the game becomes and the more ways there are to make your way up to the top!Pros: -Lots of fun with friends -Wide variety of heros -Playable on a toaster -Great to play at work (Tab in when it's your turn) -Unpredictable -Amazing when you have access to expansions -You dont have to purchase all the expansions in order to enjoy them provided that you play online with a player that owns them!Cons: -Very luck driven -Games are super long -Not as enjoyable if you dont have access to expansions -AI can be really dumb			"

												This game is the perfect example of emergent gameplay done right. In one game, that forest might be the home of a friendly fairy that grants wishes to the forces of light, while in another, it might be the lair of a terrifying dragon. Using multiple decks of cards with different effects and uses, you can craft the story of an evil leprachaun, who loses all his money and ends up in jail after a night of drunken revelry, or the tale of a lone bounty hunter with an enchanted flail, on the trail of a powerful sorcereress who stole his magic shield and destroyed the academy that trained his superhuman fighting skills, finally clashing at the highest peaks of the world. In another of my games, my Bard character managed to ensnare a fire breathing dragon with his music. In another, my alchemist discovered a bag that always had an extra gold piece inside whenever you ran out of money, with his abilities, I managed to turn this unlimited supply of gold into unlimited magical power. If you immerse yourself into the experience and roleplay it, stories build themselves right in front of your eyes. Every game is different, and with every expansion adding new locations, decks, characters and everything else, It can only get better.The AI isn't too bad either, I've seen characters doing crazy stuff like casting the offensive wind blast spell on themselves to fling across the map so that they're closer to where they need to be.If I could change one thing, it'd be the introduction of a way to turn off the victory conditions of the game, sometimes you want these random storied worlds of yours to live on longer.

												7/10 - Lovers of fantasy board games, buy. Others pass...Pros- Lots of Characters- Lots of Cards, Spells, & Events- Easy to play while multi-tasking (TV, other games, ect.)- Online multiplayer content.Cons- Too much DLC- I swear dice are rigged vs AI- Graphics could be better.- Repetative music.- Many mechanics to learn & employ.So, I'm not big on board games. I got this in a Humble Bundle & decided to try it out. For a board game, it's pretty entertaining. That's why I gave it a 7/10 & a thumbs up. If it weren't a board game, I'd give it a 4/10. The game flow is pretty boring & the DLC is somewhat frustrating.It's great that they want to keep the game up-to-date, & I don't expect them to work for free. However there's a bit of a pay-to-win feel, when you're looking at some of the newer content. It's not just new event cards, or ""Alternative Ending Cards"". It's new characters with OP abilities, or OP ""Runes"" (upgrades to base stats).I also wish there was more flash & awe while playing the game. I mean, you pick up a ""blizzard"" card; you expect to see the board covered in a wash of hail! You have tons of spells, but nothing beyond the card's artwork to help you imagine the effect! The game falls a bit flat when it comes to graphic possibilites.The same goes for the music. It's not bad, but it rarely changes. It's so monotonous. With so many events & the dynamic of ""who's winning"", alignments, what board section your in, ect. you'd think there'd me more variety.I complained about the game's loaded dice vs AI. I rolled a ""1"" 5 times in a row on the same square. This happened twice in one game, then once again in the following game. While it's not impossible to do, it's highly improbable. If the dice aren't loaded, maybe I should play the lottery...There's some strategy, but for the most part the strategy is overriden by the RNG of the dice rolls. Personally, I'd be more entertained with a game of Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. You have a greater feeling of control, knowing what's in your hand & in your deck. In Talisman: Digital Edition, nothing is guarenteed. You can have 8 godly items one moment; nothing the next. There's nothing you can do about it, & it just makes you feel like the game is a big waste of time.Lastly, there are a lot of quirks with regard to when & how you do things. I had a ""Siphon Strength"" card that I tried using for 10 turns. Suddenly it worked on an opponent that I never selected nor was he near me; just a random event. You need to learn which items are consumed on use, and which arn't. Or maybe you got turned into a toad. Is it worth it for you to land on that spot that gives you +1 Strength? Apparently not.If you like board games, then perhaps you'd be willing to learn all the quirks of this game. Personally, I'd rather play something more intuitve & gratifying. I may play this on occation if I'm stuck watching TV with the kids, but there are many other games that can fill the time with a better sense of achievement.			"

												Talisman has the potential to be an excellent game but I cannot in good conscience recommend it at the moment due to the dozens of game breaking bugs that keep sprouting up.

 Pro vs Contra Updated 7.8.16Just a few lines, the day one version (Bloodmooon) was buggy and many people including me encountered a broken game that just crashed the mp game after hours, then we where forced to upload a 600+MB crash dumb file.Its just a joke a company that isnt even able to select the right file to upload and need more space on your device then the game itself. The hompage is broken since days and not providing a link to Bloodmoon, not a single link to the new rules and the bugs, people seems to be happy, but Nomad isnt able to deliver a bug free game.Ifi wouldnt love the table top game, i would remove this game from my account. Pro*Digital version of the classic GW board game.*You can now play with up to 6 players in one game.* Cross plattform gaming.*Added 3 free copies to give away for every Gold buyer*If you play online with friends/familiy you can/will get your fun (if your game will not disconnected or crash).*Nice artwork*If you are a Talisman fan, then this is your way to buy it and i suggest you just ignore the contra points. Contra*Slow development (3-5 months for a new DLC is a long time, i paid the full season price more then 2 years ago and i only can say that the development is slowing down with every new DLC, there is no ETA when the final game will be released)*Massiv bugs, dont get me wrong bugs get fixed (from time to time), but this often ends in new bugs, before i released my last review i was a long time beta tester (and naming the issues of support and constant fails with updates was the reason why .i was removed from Nomoad) that helped for free to lure the bugs. Well iam sure that i have to point out that  9/10 of all my latest games shows bugs (some game breaking some minors ones).*MP (public games) is most of the time a place for leavers and quitters.*The ai is improved compared with the one years ago, but still not worth to buy this game for a single player. You only can cheat the game (you add runestones to the ai and give them a big advantage)*They changed there Season Pass conduct, and released one DLC (The Shaman) without giving it for free to the former buyers.* A constant dropping number of people playing online on Steam Finally i have to note that ca 400 of my hours where used for beta gaming,  and as a long time supported and as a former member of most of the groups and even the founder of the german group. Iam disappointed of Nomads behavior, they deliver game breaking bug after game breaking issue, to many to name them, and when you get upset and rage about it, they blame you and say you cost them money.....

												Short review: Yeah... No. Don't get this.Long review: I tried playing it on a free weekend with friends, and it became so ♥♥♥♥ing tedious we wanted to kill ourselves. The game drags on and on and on with no foreseen end to it, and the fact that almost everything is a huge gamble that can ruin your day with just a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rolls does not help it. The fact that it is so random ruins the potential for strategy, and it dragging so long makes the randomness frustrating. Not to mention, the UI is very unpolished and the expansions are very expensive.Buy it during a very high sale, and only if you can cope with very long games in which your worst enemy won't be the other players, but the Random Number God.

												I didn't have any experience with the board game before playing this, but I think they did a decent job explaining it. Don't get me wrong, it was lots that they didn't explain, but simply playing it and reading the tips they show is enough for you to get started and learn the rest on the way. The game itself had good variety with lots of different cards, enemies, playable characters etc. to make it fun even in the long run. Good graphics, decent background music and so many different even/object/spell cards that even if you have a good solid plan for then run, your opponent ""the monk"" still beats the crap out of your warrior and steals your great orb card, ruining the run for you. But it's a...good kind of rage :)7.3/10			"

												I made the mistake of playing this, being a board game aficionado of sorts. I like to think I ""play"" a ""decent amount"" of ""board games"".I chose poorly here. Talisman is as follows: Roll dice. Go to space. Draw card. See what happens.That's it. There is no planning, no strategy, no thought. Roll dice. Highest wins. I rolled more dice in 2 hours last night than I remember rolling at a lot of longer sessions of Dungeons and Dragons, and yet no a single one of the dice I rolled during the game of Talisman really meant anything. The content is repetitive and the game is a chore to play, as several points are designed to arbtrarily lengthen the game simply based on a die roll, teleporting you back to previous portions of the map, or lowering your stats (forcing you to grind more adventure card sto 'level up' again), or simply kill you outright (the vampire rolls a 6. Lose 6 life. You died. Back to start.)And then, oh god, once you get to the end, you have a 50% chance of doing one damage per turn. I have never so fervently hoped for the dice to roll high so that I could die and the game could end, but the sweet, soothing release of death did not come. At the end, I watched a Wizard AI waltz up and slay the Fighter AI player who had gotten there mile sbefore him, nad had be simply rolled a 4, a 5, or a 6 at any point during the 9 turns he was on the Crown of Command, would have won the game. But he did not, and so Wizards win over martial classes once again. Thanks Wizards.In its defense: This seems to be a well done translation of the board game. The automation works well and outside a few quibbles like trying to figure out how to queue spells, the game worked well and both players realized how to do everything (aside from trade in trophieS: I looked at  aSteam guide for that) within a few rounds. But unfortunately, in this case, it's not really a plus: We figured it out so quickly, because there's just not that much to DO. So as a technical translation of a boardgame, it's very good. I am sure avid fans of Tlaisman will garner a greta amount of fun from the game, though I'm not sure I'd want to be there with them.You might as well roll a 1d6 before the game starts, and highest winner places themselves on the cente rof the board and wins, because that's about what Talisman boils down to. ""More content"" unfortunately would not fix what is an un-fun game to the core. At least Risk mitigates its dice rolling with the ability to actually choose and think over whta you do before you fling plastic cubes about.			"

												I just spent $70 on the gold pack. That gives you the ""season pass"" (all current and future DLC + 5 licenses to give away as gifts).I thought it would be a great holiday present for my brother and 2 nephews.First off, it seems that only the purchaser (me) gets all the expansions. Everyone else gets the base game. This was not even close to clear in the listing on Steam.Secondly, the game is wildly unstable. It crashes nearly every time I launch it. Once you've crashed in a multiplayer game, Resume Game options simply don't work.I am on a MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM, so I have more than enough horsepower for this game.This is not even close to production quality. I love the board game, but this is a big disappointment. As far as I can tell, there is no way on Steam to submit a support request, so I can't even tell if the people I've gifted to have what they are supposed to have. Terrible, terrible support.I can't in good conscience recommend this game.			"

It is extremely tedious, as the board game experience doesn't translate well to the greater capabilities of computers - you spend most of your time waiting for other people to have their turns. This would be OK if you had anything to think about while waiting, but the fact is that this game is complete luck. This could be forgiven if the game only lasted 2 minutes, but the fact is that some complete game will take 2 hours.This game is frustrating to play, takes too long, and has no strategy to it.

												There are alot of things done good in this game: They didn't change the rules or the cards, the graphics is good, the AI's play reasonably good. This is a good didgital rendering of a fantastic board-game.The problem is the pace.In Real-life board game your opponents are human. You have fun sitting around the table passing time and gaming. But when playing against AIs waiting isn't fun. It's annoying and tiresome.And the AI in this game thinks SLOWLY. VERY VERY SLOWLY. Even on maximum speed.And the graphics. Oh the graphics. It's good. Really. But SLOW. SO SO SLOW. The well intended animation of everything from rolling a die to the turn shifting to the next player makes the turns unbearably long. So long infact I got up made popcorn, and came back to find it's still isn't my turn.So slow I find myself incapable of playing the game without doing atleast one more thing.This game would have been a 9/10 if you had a ""No animation"" option. Without it the pace of the game is so slow I'm compeled to give it a 3/10 - Nice try.			"

												For the $15 dollar asking price of the base game I find the content to be severly lacking. The games length and nature can cause random grueling sections (I once spent 30 turns fighting a player on the end game tile, where he kept hitting my armor and my attack was too low to kill him), It could be possible that with all the DLC the game would have enough content to be fun, however i'm not willing to put in $60 bucks for a truck load of DLC that may or may not create a satisfying experience, not to mention that $75 for a digital board game feels, and is a fairly crazy asking price.

												I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game. Whilst I have many fond memories of Talisman from my childhood, this is a terrible implementation of a game that has long past exceeded its best-by date.Talisman itself is sadly lacking in the current era of boardgames, with little to no strategy or choice left to the player. It is dictated far more by the random roll of the die, than any particular desire of the player. Even Monopoly provides more strategy, and choice of action. This is a faithful implementation of the original, for what little that is worth.The main issue is the interface, which is an abomination. Trying to play with friends rapidly becomes an excercise in extreme frustration, wherein you battle the shoddy controls - instead of battling your friends. Laggy, unresponsive and unintuitive are the nicest words I have to say about it. I wish I could refund it, and I feel terrible for gifting it to several of my friends who now all have a much poorer opinion of me.If you have any fondness for Talisman, any decent memories of the game - leave them as that, memories. Playing this game will leave only a bitter taste in your mouth of ashes and defeat. Nomad Games has my money - please dont give them yours.			"

												You'll have already read what the game is: a faithful recreation of a board-game classic with high fidelity to the original, a somewhat sketchy interface, a few bugs, and the same glacial pacing as if you were playing around a table, minus the board setup.AI is one of the keys to transition between in-person and computer-based play. The programmers haven't solved that problem well at all. Computer opponents don't have much strategy besides accumulating stats and items. They perform like mediocre bots in the single-player training missions of an online FPS. A human player would wipe the table with them every time, except the AI appears to get a boost via favorable die rolls and card draws, likely to disguise its lack of real strategy. The first few games this doesn't matter much, but after dozens of games it sucks the enjoyment out of it.If you have 3 friends willing to play the game with you, I'd buy this game in a heartbeat. If you're going to fill in with computer players--and especially if you just want to play single-player--this is probably a pass. For that reason--plus constant problems connecting with servers resulting in interrupted games--I have to give this game a no vote even though I generally like it. It's not a horrible purchase, just know what you're getting into.			"

Івенти, дайси, рок-н-ролл!Майже кожен з нас у дитинстві бавився в настольні ігри: монополія, ""сходи"" тощо. Кидай собі кубик, совай фішки і гати бізнес/опонентів. Тема більш серйозних настолок в пост радянському просторі розкрита слабо. По-перше, це дуже специфічна забава: деякі настольні ігри (особливо за редакцією правил D&D) настільки складні, що для розуміння найбанальніших аспектів потрібно витратити чимало часу на ознайомлення з правилами. По-друге, коло фанів та гравців хоч і розширюється, проте недостатньо швидко: знайти компанію для гри в реалі доволі тяжко. Проте розробники Talisman - комп'ютерного аналогу одноіменної фентезійної настольної гри від Games Workshop взяли курс на широкі маси.Та незручна мить, коли параметр ""Удача"" прокачаний на 1Суть гри на перший погляд виглядає доволі тривіально: ось тобі карта, ось тобі персонаж. Мета: ""всіх гепну і буду царювати"". Тут варто зробити уточнення, що сценаріїв є достобіса, але всі вони доступні лише в додатковому контенті... Проте відривати кревно зароблені гроші не обов'язково: стандартна карта доволі реіграбельна - велика кількість унікальних персонажів, що доступні зі старту, дозволить розбавити ігровий процес. Рухаємось ми по карті кидаючи ігрові кості (""дайси""). Якщо результат нам не дуже підходить, використавши один бал долі можна перекинути дайс. Також ця особливість стосується і певних локацій на карті (відьма, чаклун, цвинтар тощо). Особливо недитячий накал пристрастей і бурління емоцій викликають моменти, коли, в надії перекинути на що-небудь, окрім того що було, гравець отримує те саме значення на дайсі. 99% ragequit'ів і пригорілих штанів припадають на ситуації, коли вдруге випадає єдина нейприйнятна подія з шести можливих.Пересунувшись на певне поле, ми тягнемо карту з колоди подій. Події можуть бути різними: від дракона до того самого Талісману, який дозволить нам пройти до фінального рівня карти і, подолавши усі перешкоди, почати робити масовий абзац менш везучим опонентам.В процесі екстермінатусу ворогів нам допомогатимуть шмотки, супутники і навіть нейтрали (заваливши певну кількість істот можна прокачати магічну або фізичну силу персонажу). Проте, хоча багато чого і залежить від удачі і випадковості, не варто сліпо на неї покладатись, адже карти з закляттями і купа різного спорядження існує не просто так. Мудрі рішення - запорука перемоги. Для тих, хто любить очима Графомани можуть йти лісом, дивитись тут немає на що. Все гарно промальовано, але не більше. 2D інтерфейс доволі зрозумілий: якщо на карті стоять хрести, то це кладовище, якщо стоїть храм...

												I tried, I really tried. I love the board game, I thought for sure this would be a great addition to my Steam library. But I've tried to play a dozen online games with friends, and every single one had to be abandoned when the game glitched. Either it would just lock up and refuse to go to the next turn, or someone would suddenly be dropped from the game and when they tried to rejoin the game would freeze up in some in-between-turns state. I tried, Talisman, but now you're getting uninstalled.What a sad waste of potential.			"

												DnD the board game. Really fun board game that is entirely based on dice rolls, no skill involved what-so-ever. Cannot recommend this game without the dlc, the additions to the board and extra characters are a must have, the base game will not keep you entertained for more than a few hours but with all the trimmings its endless fun. I cannot recommend this game sadly because it crashes very frequently and has no saving or drop-in/drop-out feature for multiplayer which means you can play for HOURS AND HOURS and then all progress is lost. Amazing game, IF it worked.			"

												I own the boardgame in its original form for at least 20 years now and I absolutely love it.When this software version of the game was announced I was really intrigued about how well it would turn out.Here is my advice vor players of the original boardgame:AVOID AND DONT BUY THIS F*CKING BAD CONVERSION OF A ONCE GREAT GAME AS YOU WOULD ALSO NATURALLY AVOID THE GAMES WORKSHOP VERSION OF THE GAME !!!And here is why:- Not all characters are included, you will have to buy them seperately like in the games workshop version- Fullscreen doesn't work properly on all setups. You will have to minimize the steam window else the game will always turn to windowed mode at startup- the boardgames original graphics on the board itself are way (and I mean WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY) more detailed than the blurry♥♥♥♥♥♥they serve you in this conversion here (though I have to admit I don't own the games the Games Workshop version of the boardgame, so it may be they are poorly done and do suck nowadays too.)- Some rules can be changed (what is good) but why can't i for eg say let's have ""N"" numbers of randomly chosen characters to select from in the beginning?- The descriptions on the single fields on the board don't include the inscriptions (and they wouldn't have been able to be read either if impelemented in the same blurry way like the background graphics), you have to click on them first to see it, and it must be your turn to be able to do so. WHY THE HECK? Include a tooltip you d*mb*ss programmers ... how old are you?- ...You know what? I don't have the time and / or the mood to write more about this as it turns out to be more and more to be a list of easyliy implementable ideas others get paid for. So if you wanna know how to do this game ""pixelperfect"" to it's true original form than contact me if you are one of the devs.One more thing:You wanna know the moment I rage quited the game?Here it is all about it:I played an elv. I found a wizards staff and got myself a spell. I wanted to use the spell the next round because I disliked the one I got and wanted to get a new one (by using the staff again). The spell was the one that blocks another player or enemy for one turn. As I should select one character to cast the spell on I selected a figure of another player on the board. This didn't work. Then I thought, ok click on the charakters Icon and I clicked on myself to test if it works and you know what? It did work. It showed my card AND another button where I could choose to do cast the spell. BUT NO ""GO BACK"" BUTTON?WTF?!?!?!?As I said, contact me if you want to overdo this game to a GOOD game that is worth the big name it's released under, but don't expect to get more infos or ideas for free ... Or is it free to get all the characters THAT FOR ALL TIME WHERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BOARDGAME in this software version?...And now everyone please hate me for this review and vote me down ...*lol*@ngel			"

												There is a lot to be said about the charm of nostelgia... but not enough to deflect the idea that time can be cruel and that some things, like Talisman, do not age well.This game is quite a nice digital version of a boardgame from long ago, but as such it does not have the benefits granted from all the game development that would come after it.That is not meant to be a cruel jab, if anything is is an apology for why I can't find much positive to say.All you really need to know is that this game is an excercise in being given a very small set (usually 2) of options each turn based on the roll of a die. those options are then resolved throught the roll of another die... and then that loop is repeated for about an hour or more with plenty of long pauses taken at random intervals.Your input into this game is so small, and the luck so great that it is hard to truely feel that this game needs you to be present, or that any sucess or failure is yours to claim.The translation from cardboard to digital is well done and smooth in most places, but does have a few flaws, (there is no option to hide all of the A.I.'s desicion making if you are playing with bots, and it can only be sped up so much in the options... meaning that your already drawn out experiance is now stretched further and thinner.)It can be applauded for being such a faithful replication of a board game, but as to wether that excersice is, itself, worthwhile, my feelings lead towards: No.If you are an old board gamer who maybe missed out on this little bit of gaming history and wanted to experiance it, this is a good way to do so, but if you are anyone else, there are better digital board games, much better non-digital board games, and infinitely better digital adventure simulators.Try any of them before this.

												I would love to give this game a recommendation to purchase as it should be a fantastic game.  However, if you are thinking of buying this game, do not waste your money until the game bugs are all fixed.  The fun in this game should be the online gameplay. I've started well over ten games now and have not been able to finish one - every game has crashed! The game always crashes, and this really should have been sorted out before releasing the game.  Quite frankly, steam should refund all purchases as the game is completely unplayable and unfit for purpose (if it were any other product it would be breaching trading laws).  How the company can contine to sell expansion packs is beyond me - the original game needs massive improvement first.  You will waste your money if you purchase this as it will lead to no end of frustration in the online mode and  will be no enjoyment at all.			"

												A little bit too complex for its own good.   A game took me a good two hours with myself and three AI's, and you couldn't speed the AI turns up enough for my liking.  The second game was broken by an elf who spent the entire game teleporting between two forests, increasing their stats endlessley.  I would like to try the board game though.I played two more games to completion with 2 AI's, and the game is just way too random.  The frog mechanic can move a character from first to last place instantly, and sometimes there's nothing you can do to prevent it.  Getting the rolls you need to win is incredibly difficult, and once someone gets to the Crown of Power they almost always win.			"

												This game is full of bugs. The worst one even doesn't let you start the multiplayer match in 4 out of 5 tries, when the option ""Character selection"" (out of 3 Chars) is enabled, which usually is enabed for fair play. When this happens, the first player doesn't get a hero to choose from and so the room needs to be rehosted. More than that, the game crashes randomly or you just disconnect from the server, with sometimes beeing unable to rejoin the game. I've made a 4 player match where one player left the game at the beginning. Not a big deal, it happens often and the KI took over and the remaining three players continued to play for three hours. Then the player who left returned, which caused a crash to the other three players, while one was already at the crown and the game would have ended 10 minutes later. Great, three hours played for noting than frustration. The commentary of the returning player: ""Oh, I made it back right in time"". D o u c h e b a g -.-Singleplayer works fine, KI is ok, but since you normally want to play against other humans and not against the KI, this game sucks more often than it makes fun.			"

												Unless you're a huge fan of the original board game you might want to give this a pass.On the surface it's fine. There's a board. There are cards, characters and a die. Great. Unfortunately once you actually start to play you realize pretty quickly that you're dealing with a tablet port that's had oodles of time put into it on the dlc-front, but not so much on  the optimizing-for-pc front. There's the base game, then several expansions, then I don't even know how many characters for a buck or three apiece, and there ain't a thing wrong with any of that assuming the game plays well and stable on the average pc.That's where things begin to break down. There's a very long-standing and unresolved bug affecting a lot of people wherein if you afk from the game for anything more than about 60 seconds or so you'll return to a frozen screen, which you can only ""fix"" by force-closing the game in Task Manager and restarting. There's thread after thread after report after report on the Discussions page, and each says the same thing: ""File a bug report and email it to us w/a log"" and that's about it. There's been no solution to date, one year on, but boy oh boy have there been dlc galore in that time.The game interface itself is, to be charitable, minimal. There's very little in the way of options in the settings menu, in the main game UI you'll be left to pretty much figure things out on your own since there's no tutorial of any kind, and no game manual that I've ever been able to find that outlines basic rules, etc. I played the game for months before realizing that I could click on the bar at the top of the screen that shows the current turn, and that that would show me details about turn events like card text, who rolled what, and so on.In the same vein there are very, very few input options. You may use your mouse, and... that's almost it. Again, I played for months before discovering that clicking the spacebar = selecting whatever option is at the top right on your screen, be it ""encounter space"" or ""move here"" or whatever. There are no keys that do anything else whatsoever that I've seen. Again this is something that's been requested for a year on the forums, the ability to map some keys to common actions, and from what I can see the response has been the same every time: ""Because it would take a lot of time to code for different OS's, the game is kept basically in a tablet state to make it simpler on us devs"". Again, that constraint hasn't stopped them pumping out character and expansion dlc. That's the gist of it, anyway, so ask yourself if you want to pay 15 bucks for a tablet game on your pc.Game bugs: no shortage of 'em. Spell queueing is hit and miss, at best. Sometimes they work as you expect, other times they don't fire off at all or they do but not where you intended. There are cards that don't work at all in certain situations and cards that work in unexpected ways in others. Multiplayer games freeze and/or disconnect a random person, in addition to the aforementioned single player freeze. There is little to no hovertext, which in a game where you're forced to play with your mouse almost exclusively leads to a LOT of clicking. If you want to remind yourself what stipulations exist on a certain game square, for instance, you must click that square. This is fine unless you accidentally double-click, which is easy enough to do, at which point your character *moves* to that square whether you're finished reading its text or not. The same goes for many cards like spells or potions. Be careful clicking on them if you're simply trying to read them. One extra click and poof! there goes that spell you totally didn't intend to cast yet.I could go on but there's not much point. It *is* a game, and it *is* playable, but it isn't all that enjoyable to me to the point I'd recommend it to anyone, and the reason I go so far as to give it a thumbs down is simple: after months of waiting, pleading, begging the devs to show a little love to the pc community (whose money they seem to love enough, alright) their response was to post a new thread announcing an upcoming new Talisman game they're working on. Presumably we were all meant to shout ""Yay! Take my money!"", but to me it felt like someone who'd just mugged me asking if I'd like to buy my wallet back.Again, if you're a hardcore fan of the original, this will probably fulfill your digital desire to play, but it ain't gonna be a bug-free or hassle-free experience. If you're new to the gamel I'd recommend giving it a pass, unless the devs decide to pay it the attention they should've been paying from the start.			"

												Talisman is the classic adventure board game of powerful magic and ferocious creatures. Play as one of many classic fantasy archetypes such as an elf, wizard, monk, thief (and many more!) as you gain experience, powerful items/weapons, followers, spells and so on. Adventure around the board until you're ready to tackle the dreaded inner region, reach the Crown of Command, and claim victory! If you like gameplay that is all about playing the odds, you'll probably enjoy yourself in Talisman. At first glance it seems like a simple roll-and-move game where the player has little control over what happens to them during any given turn, but it's actually very involved as winning requires understanding how to create good odds for yourself. It's also a game where you need to understand that bad things WILL happen and there's nothing you could've done about it; or even if you lost a fight you shoulda won - it's ok because 80% odds in your favor means you'll still lose 20% of the time. Talisman is a very interesting mix of a laid back casual game (because of how simple any given turn is) and also a very cutthroat game. Players will clash in many PvP battles over the course of a game and powerful items will switch hands as players take them from each other through force or other means. You'll need to always take into account the other players, knowing which ones you should target and which ones will target you.So if you like fantasy adventure and gameplay that's all about navigating the wims of random luck, I highly recommend Talisman. It's a light game that manages to capture that feeling of going on an epic quest and overcoming great challenges. There's a reason this game is still around despite many bigger and more involved adventure board games being released since the 80s, so play this digital adaptation and find out what makes Talisman so special.

Do not buy unless it is on sale for $1.Talisman is one of the best board games that have ever come out. However, I am talking about the original board game, not the digital edition. I am not going to describe the single player feature as it is very poor and AI does not demand any thinking from the player, making the single player game easy, boring and discouraging. Therefore, I will concetrate on the multiplayer feature since it is the only feature worth looking at.The rules are very simple: roll a dice, move that many spaces, draw a card or cards, read them and d what the instruction tells you to do. Simple isn't it? Well, for developers it is not simple. The game is full of bugs and developers insist on working on new addons instead of correcting existing bugs. In other words - the game is not finished and really rushed and I need to point out it was released a long time ago. Too long for such issues to happen. The game can freeze or crash just after loading it. I experienced game freeze on the main menu several times - solution, do not leave the game on the title screen or it will stop responding. You will be forced to start the game again and/or start Steam again, and/or reboot your system.The game was not properly tested before release and it is more than obvious.  A lot of cards do not work as they are supposed to. Many card effects lead to a dead end as you will not be able to do anything (I see that problem with many spells while casted on other players). Example: after casting for example, Misfortune spell on the opponent, the game stopped responding and did not give any player any opportunity to make their moves, the game stops, the timeout counter freezes and you or any other player is forced to leave the game in order to make it move on. Connection issues occur every game. Some players are kicked out of the server for no reason. Sometimes you cannot go back to the game you were playing.  After joining the server and starting or looking for a game, your game can stop responding, forcing you to reboot your game and ocassionally your Steam and/or your system. Who put Quit button in the Settings? Standing ovation for the analysts/architects/developers and anyone responsible for this sensible chuckle design. I laughed, my friends laughed. Good comedy. There is no way to speed up the game play. It goes very long and I played some games for such a long time that I do not recall any actual board games to last that long (and I played with 7 people at a time!). You have to wait for every action even if no action is available at the moment. For example: even though you have only one choice, the system does not automatically go with the only choice but waits for you to select it. Bad idea. There is a number cards that do not work properly or do not work at all and when it comes tot he interaction betwen some cards, majority of such situations lead to a glitch, mostly forcing you to rejoin the game or restarting it. Each new addon comes with a new set of bugs. Beware. Random Number Generator is really poor and developers should think before they do something rigged as this. There is a chance that you will throw ""1"" for about 5-10 times in a row which is impossible if you were really rolling dice. This NEEDS to be fixed. I remember rolling the same set of numbers several times in a row. Bad development. There is no explanation for such bad execution of dice roll simulation. You can be kicked out of the game without any chance (yes!) for coming back. The game tends to bug out and nothing can be done to go back to it. Progress is lost. The most disappointing. Inviting your Steam friends is very buggy. I have never successfully invited anyone without a crash, so I do not use that feature.TL;DR - If you want to play the great game which is Talisman - go and buy the original board game, you will never have to reboot anything, wait for anything to happen, look at bugs, being surprised that nothing what the card described happened. Digital edition is faw away from being a good product. It is fair for now, but it is closer and closer to being bad if noone takes care of basics like card working. Less development on new addons, more at bug fixing, please.I paid $1 for the game and that's how much it is worth Pros:- Classic Talisman game!- Many addons and characters that make games more interesting- You do not need addons to actually play them, only one person in the game needs them- Very good music- The cards are taken straight from the board game version!Cons:- The game is not finished- Bugs ruin the game experience- Connection issues that seem to go worse with time- No way to join the game that is currently in progress - in the board version that's what makes this game so attractive, no matter how many people are currently playing, you can always join- Bad mutliplayer and overall game issues force players to leave the game early (ruining the game)- Less and less players (20 average) playing the game online (which is very sad)Do not get me wrong = the game is fun but the way it was developed forces you to abandon the idea of playing. Board games are not supposed to be that frustrating when it comes to gameplay. This game would be better if not rushed so much. If developers concetrated on the Basis of the game instead of looking for easy cash selling characters or addons - I would recommend it 100%. Sadly, I cannot do that and reasons for it are mentioned above.These issues are serious as I see less and less players online. "

												There's no satisfaction in winning or losing as the entire game (except for the spells aspect) is based 100% on luck. I'd never thought I'd find a game based more on luck than Monopoly, but here it is. If you like to strategize then this game is not for you, your ability to reach the end and win is purely determined by dice rolls and luck of draw cards (all dice rolls are pre-calculated before the game starts). No strategy will overcome events like being turned into a toad 7 times within 8 turns (yes this did happen) or losing a fight with a 60/50 chance of winning 13 times in a row (yes this happened too). Talisman is really just a dice simulator with music and ren fair style graphics, and just ended up in my uninstall pile.			"

												Talisman is a very poor board game to begin with. Main game mechanic is frustrating the player. A dice game that goes on for 3-8 hours. The Digital edition is a bad port of the board game. It forces you to watch hundreds of die-roll animations every game. It's bug-ridden and you can not expect anything to work at any time - it will just not function, at random critical moments. Interaction with the game is often non-intuitive and cluncky. You can forget multiplayer as it crashes at random roughly 9 of 10 games. Talisman Digital Edition runs a DLC greed-scheme, where they offer you the game piecemeal for an insane price. This is as bad as it gets.			"

												2 Words: DLC marketplace. Its one thing when you have dlc in your game, its another when the minute I try to create a game I'm slammed in the face for not having 90% of the content available. This is most evident in the player selection where it shows you the 6 heroes you own and the 50+ that you do not in a hodgepodge of little icons with no labels.Look, I can understand having DLC as a part of the game, but DLC constitutes almost 4 times what the base game has to offer. And if you really want to enjoy this game, its basically mandatory. Avoid this marketing strategy and avoid this company. A 14.99 game should not feel like an incomplete experience and have dlc content that is pushed this heavily on its players. Expansions are fair, but DLC should not be required to enjoy the game nor be pushed as heavy handedly.			"

												A little bit too complex for its own good.   A game took me a good two hours with myself and three AI's, and you couldn't speed the AI turns up enough for my liking.  The second game was broken by an elf who spent the entire game teleporting between two forests, increasing their stats endlessley.  I would like to try the board game though.I played two more games to completion with 2 AI's, and the game is just way too random.  The frog mechanic can move a character from first to last place instantly, and sometimes there's nothing you can do to prevent it.  Getting the rolls you need to win is incredibly difficult, and once someone gets to the Crown of Power they almost always win.			"

												Not recommended for single player.Played the demo through several games. Did not play multi-player only played single player.Ran into game breaking problems with the AI in single player:1.) AI is dumb as a rock. All it had to do was move foward to the command square and crush me. It was way overpowered from running around the board collecting loot/kill trophies but instead of attacking it continues to run around like a headless chicken. I sit at the crown square and roll one dice (d6, 1-3 no damage, 4-6 1 damage to all enemy) over and over and over and over....bleh Can't move out and I'm using a melee character so only option was rolling every round. I was actually hoping the AI would crush me to put me out of my missery but quit game and started another. 2.) There was a healer card on the board at the forest during one game. All other AI's dead from attrition by d6 crowning them. The elf can teleport from woods to woods so there I am rolling d6 at the crown square and the elf just keeps warping from woods to woods back and forth healing. That's it. It's a stalemate, unbreakable loop. I can't move, attack, nothing while the elf just teleports from the woods with healer to another woodland square than back again. Well played AI, you have defeated me with boredom.Shut the game off and decided not to purchase after playing demo.			"

Coding in a SIMPLE RNG routine for each roll is NOT that hard and actually would use less resources than storing up a predetermined roll chart. I know this because I AM a developer. You wanted to prevent people from reloading a game and possibly rolling a better RANDOM roll? **WRONG** The same principle can be used by that same person because they know what the next roll is going to be and they just reload and choose a different course or action.

												This is not a computer game. It's a board game on a computer, which is perfectly legitimate.But how does it stack up as a board game? Even there its basic design fails.Don't get me wrong. There are some great things about this board game, especially the replayability and variety of interesting scenarios (for a board game), if you're willing to fork over money for a lot of DLC. However, where the game fundamentally fails in two areas:1) You have very little ability to control where your character goes and what it does, which means you can spend long portions of the game just wondering around, rolling dice and seeing what happens (or doesn't happen, as the case may be). This makes the game very luck based, but worse than that, it becomes pretty tedious, especially when the board becomes filled with cards that effectively don't do anything.2) It's really hard to end the game; partially because the game requires you luck out on a series of dice rolls just to get to the point where the game starts to end; partially because the game doesn't really penalize you at all for trying to power up indefinitely before heading to the end game; and partially because the first character to get to the end of the game gets the dubious honor of being forced to sit there doing nothing but rolling one die to see if maybe they'll do 1 point of damage to the other characters.With some of the above problems fixed, Talisman could become a fun board game/computer game, but as it is, you spend most of your time waiting for your turn in the hope that you'll get to do something interesting.

												Plays really slow. Compared to Talisman: Prologue, I would say just buy whichever is on sale. Both have slow interfaces and annoying control methods. The actual board game is legendarily slow to play and these two games take the physical slowness out of the equation, but insert slowness and clunky controls where you feel like virtuality would lend itself to smoothness.Sometimes you need to click the board to do a thing and the game will interpret your click as something else, and you'll mess up your turn. Sometimes the game's controls will screw you. All I can recommend is to be as careful as you can.If you're a big fan of Talisman but you don't have friends who want to play the game on Steam with you, just buy the real board game. And if your friends want to play the Steam version with you, know that it will be annoying.			"

Priestess = OP  same with the other classes that cycle spells.  Quick note about the AI, if you let them get to the vampire's Tower get ready for the AI to get stuck in a loop for hours.  They can't decide which follower is worth getting rid of.  Best fix I've found is restart the game until the AI decides to go away from the Tower.Collecting Runes does provide some replayability.

												I love the board game.  However, the board game is, frankly, a bit flawed.  Talisman, in a nutshell, is: roll a die, 1,2,3 bad, 4,5,6 good.  Repeat. and repeat... and repeat... and... well, keep going for two hours.  If you like Talisman, then get this bit of nostagia (yes, there are new versions of Talisman out, but really, the first edition was the best fun).  I don't like all the add on packs for such a primitive game.  I also do not recomend multi player for this game (it deserves to be played on a table).  Not for anyone who does not have experience with the board game.			"

												I'm a lifelong board game fan, and bought Talisman: Digital Edition to see if I would like it well enough to purchase a tabletop copy for my collection.  Unfortunately, this digital edition has bugs and glitches that have kept me from finishing a game, primarily with AI getting stuck - unable to make a decision, and unable to force the AI to continue.  What I learned is that Talisman relies almost entirely on luck - rolling dice and drawing cards for everything.  Not enough strategy for my tastes.  And this digital edition still seems to have serious issues that make me not want to play, despite decent art and music.  If you like the fantasy theme, stick to the tabletop version, or try Descent: Journeys in the Dark instead.			"

												My first gameplay...Picked the Gambler.Rolled low, went to Tavern. Got drunk, lost a turn.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Dragon with 7 strength that rolled a 6. Lost a life.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Craft 5 creature that rolled high. Lost a life.My next turn.. Rolled low, drew a Pig with 1 strength.OMG.. I'm going to beat it. Pig rolled a 5. Beat me by one point. Lost a life.Lost the game.Beat by bacon. 10/10 Would lose to bacon again.---------------------UPDATE: The game can be fun.. but after finding out that all dice are predetermined at the beginning of the game I will not be recommending this and giving it a thumbs DOWN now. This is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mechanic and development choice for any developer. Why give people the illusion they are rolling a dice for random rolls if they are not truly random when thrown? Those times I'm feeling lucky and end up with those craptastic one's make me feel cheated since I now know they were picked when I started the game. Coding in a SIMPLE RNG routine for each roll is NOT that hard and actually would use less resources than storing up a predetermined roll chart. I know this because I AM a developer. You wanted to prevent people from reloading a game and possibly rolling a better RANDOM roll? **WRONG** The same principle can be used by that same person because they know what the next roll is going to be and they just reload and choose a different course or action. You haven't foiled their attempt to get ahead.			"

												This is not a computer game. It's a board game on a computer, which is perfectly legitimate.But how does it stack up as a board game? Even there its basic design fails.Don't get me wrong. There are some great things about this board game, especially the replayability and variety of interesting scenarios (for a board game), if you're willing to fork over money for a lot of DLC. However, where the game fundamentally fails in two areas:1) You have very little ability to control where your character goes and what it does, which means you can spend long portions of the game just wondering around, rolling dice and seeing what happens (or doesn't happen, as the case may be). This makes the game very luck based, but worse than that, it becomes pretty tedious, especially when the board becomes filled with cards that effectively don't do anything.2) It's really hard to end the game; partially because the game requires you luck out on a series of dice rolls just to get to the point where the game starts to end; partially because the game doesn't really penalize you at all for trying to power up indefinitely before heading to the end game; and partially because the first character to get to the end of the game gets the dubious honor of being forced to sit there doing nothing but rolling one die to see if maybe they'll do 1 point of damage to the other characters.With some of the above problems fixed, Talisman could become a fun board game/computer game, but as it is, you spend most of your time waiting for your turn in the hope that you'll get to do something interesting.

												Gets redundant and repetitive after a while. Cards lack diversity  a bit. Certain characters such as troll and assassin are clearly overpowered compared to others making whoever has them will have a significantly greater chance of winning.Not a very balanced game for $10USD (if u buy the 6pack). You could do better.			"

												Love it. I first played this board game when it came out in the 80's and loved it. I have played it several times since with various expansions and seeing it come to life digitally brought back so many memories.It is practically identical to the original board game, and does have a few annoying bugs (mostly around spells not quite activating the way they should) but outside of that this is a really well done port of the original.It is just as unbalanced as the original board game but the runestones go a small way to helping that out, bringing the weaker characters into the mix nicely.Recommended and looking forward to all the future expansions. Bring on the dungeon!			"

												This game is a joke, I've never seen a game with so many bugs. It's just unplayable in multiplayer. The game ALWAYS crashes for some reason, when it's not network connection being lost. I played it when it came out, bugs. It stopped playing for 4 months and gave it another chance, as buggy as ever. You play for one or two hours, and then bang! game freezes. The only reason why people are still playing it is that it's a cult game, and actually a great game and fun to play when you're a fan. It's sad because this game had so much potential.			"

												Talisman: Digital edition is a game I had never heard of before this free weekend.  I immediately liked the game.  This Talisman: DE is a digital Board game, literally.  You play as a variety of classes trying to buff your stats and make it to the center of the board before anyone else gets there.  The game relies heavily on RNG type randomness, Most actions involve dice rolls, and most ""encounters"" rely on the way the deck is ""shuffled"".  Another thing to note, I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but this game is long, I have been in the same game for about 4 hours now. no one has come very close to winning yet. I don't know how long the average game against the ai lasts, but mine are always terribly long.   Overall though I like the gameplay and art a lot. The art reminds me of classic Dungeons and Dragons art, and less grimdark games workshop art. I recommend this to anyone still interested after all that. I dont know  what kind of player will like it most really. If you get it, I hope you have fun!			"

												The interface is an absolute MESS. It's too easy to cancel a card effect when you think you're just selecting a different target. You can't read the board during other players' turns. You CAN look at their inventory, but when you right-click on someone's card to see its details it doesn't zoom in on that card, but rather opens up a sort of ""card carousel"" that you have to shuffle through to find the card that YOU ALREADY CLICKED ON. Keeping track of everything feels like an unfun version of Papers Please.I get that Talisman is an old board game that is unapologetically ""Ameritrash"", but the fact that the game is so clunky made it that much more important to streamline the digital version.

												I don't understand how the metascore was so low... then again, i don't use the metascore as a solid guide anyways.  I would recommend this game to folks who are in to fantasty board games. i thought the game was fairly simple and it only took me about two games to fully understand the concept and what the characters do.  i have had a grand time with friends who also purchased this game.  i would not necessarily recommend the game to individuals who want to play by themselves.  some of the matches can last up to 3 or 4 hours and playing by yourself is just not my cup of placenta.  talisman is fair in the sense that it is chance; your battles are similar to that of risk, however you build on your attributes such as strength and craft (magic).  some characters have neat perks to assist you in acquiring the talisman to reach the center of the board.  the characters provide you with a bit of variety and the adventure cards and item cards you get to draw are numerous.  i find the game both amusing and entertaining.  i would recommend this game if you like old school board games i.e. dungeon (from gary gygax in 1980.) hope you cats have fun too! <3			"

												Spend your time with RNG.Also, crash a lot in multiplayer.A lot.Granted it IS a fairly done rendition of the board game, but lack of added features combined with difficulty of certain things in-game that are easy to do in real life (like just taking a closer look at a particular area) make this less than a stellar pick.  As a recreation of the board game, not the worst.  But as a computer game overall, not good.I don't regret the money I spent on this, but I *really* cannot recommend this unless you're a fan of the board game. If you are a fan of the board game, pick it up; you can typically find a game at least on Europe server (and you can easily see different servers for different areas of the world and switch between them), though you will crash, you *can* rejoin so it's not the end of the world.

												I don't understand how the metascore was so low... then again, i don't use the metascore as a solid guide anyways.  I would recommend this game to folks who are in to fantasty board games. i thought the game was fairly simple and it only took me about two games to fully understand the concept and what the characters do.  i have had a grand time with friends who also purchased this game.  i would not necessarily recommend the game to individuals who want to play by themselves.  some of the matches can last up to 3 or 4 hours and playing by yourself is just not my cup of placenta.  talisman is fair in the sense that it is chance; your battles are similar to that of risk, however you build on your attributes such as strength and craft (magic).  some characters have neat perks to assist you in acquiring the talisman to reach the center of the board.  the characters provide you with a bit of variety and the adventure cards and item cards you get to draw are numerous.  i find the game both amusing and entertaining.  i would recommend this game if you like old school board games i.e. dungeon (from gary gygax in 1980.) hope you cats have fun too! <3			"

												A beautiful, well-designed, well-engineered video game adaptation of an absolutely godawful board game.Talisman is one of those games that people keep playing not on its own merits (it's about as strategic as Crazy Eights and takes HOURS for a game) but because of the nostalgia filter.If you have fond memories of this game from your childhood or early gaming days, then this is an excellent way to play online with added computer opponents. If you don't, then I recommend grabbing a deck of cards and playing War. At least it's over faster.			"

The interface is completely unintuitive, graphics remind me of early 2000s, and the whole design doesn't even deserve a free hand-out. This game should rot in oblivion until someone decides to make the actual digital Talisman game.

												Not a very fun game unless you enjoy praying to RNGesus. I played my first and last game against the AI to learn how the game works. Got to the crown around turn 60, then spent another 60 turns sitting on that space doing nothing. Once you get to the center you're stuck rolling until you get booted or you kill everyone. Meanwhile, the AI jerked around in the outer ring of tiles healing up at least as must damage I was dealing from the crown.While sitting through this mind-numbing experience I found that you can set ""house rules"" to end the game when someone reaches the crown, or to stop healing when someone is at the crown, but the fact that there are such glaring design flaws in the base game is pretty unforgivable.

												I love board games, and I like a lot of digital versions of board games. This is NOT a good one. If you loooove Talisman and know the rules and cards very well, you may like it. If not...the game is very slow (even at highest speed), clunky, and boring. I only played a couple hours and it literally consisted of clicking dice roll, and then moving that many spaces. This is just not a game that works well without friends present.Additionally  the layout of the game is just plain confusing. There were so many times I was trying to click on cards to read them, then accidentally moved there, or did something else. The interface is not intuitive at all.			"

												Buy the board game, and walk away quickly from this digital debauchery.Each of the cards at least seems to work exactly like the board game, though the interface leaves a ton to be desired. Game may crash after finishing a round, stays in windowed mode at all times, ignores most key presses, no help dialogue, and on and on.The game likes to automate SOME the things that are player choices (like using the Orb of Knowledge) and other times make you click Continue way too many times. The worst part about it is  the inconsistency. There are actually times where your turn is finished for you, even if the timer doesn't run out. Another issue there: there's a mandatory timer! Shortest timer is 30 seconds, longest is 2 min.Overall, this version taught me some things that were a little confusing in the tabletop version, but via teeth-pulling.

												Awesome game. Truly one of the best board to digital game i've ever had the opportunity to play. The add-ons are completely worth it as well.  Now for the bad news. There have been multiple instances when playing with my group of friends where someone or multiple people will drop connection. SOMETIMES, you can resume game (which is a cool feature) but othertimes it just will not work. It gets really funky. Now, to me, there is nothing worse than spending 2.5 hours on a game with 3 other people and right as it's getting good the multiplayer takes a dump all over and we can't finish the game. The support is also non-existant (thanks Nomad) so don't believe this will change any time soon, but if enough people are buying and playing maybe that will change (I highly doubt it. Wishful thinking maybe). TL;DR: Solo play is worth it at sale price, but mulitplayer is a big risk although it is insanely fun.			"

												There is a marathon game of talisman with each players having a one of the unquie characters each and I suggest a pull of a barrell draw with first the correct amount of players being enough but no more for each player to have one character of each type. The  method of which each player must outlay the total sum of money to the amount of supposing one dollar per character in total , Roughly 50-60 $ or around abouts , Then each of the 50-60 players approximately the exact amount of the full number of characters that the talisman game and all supplements included for one dollar each , Then the barrell draw for first player who receive no money but first choice of the character selection un-inhibited then the next barell draw is a players that receive a choice of characters , without the previous character chosen by the first player and also receive one dollar back for each number that lessen the characters being chosen by dollar of increment for the players  one after the next until last person to receive the only character left with all but one dollar return so what the last player wagered is the same as every player but they all received the increment according to how they were picked in the cue and their was less choice of character but more initial return for their lessened choice of characters ,So first out of the barrell gets no money back but chooses first from all the characters  where the opposite gets  all money bar one dollar and the last characters left , all leaves a amount that can be from expenditure range from first mentioned to previous mentioned and the in between through the incremental prize pool where once these are ready then a sum of the entire pool minus 10% for handling the the game by administration and the rest of this prize pool going too the winner(s).

												Brilliant digitial port of this classical adventure boardgame!  If you liked playing the original boardgame you cannot go wrong buying this.  With the added bonus of no taxing setup and no errant pets/children suddenly destroying the game position as well as the ability to simply exit from your game and then resume it at a later date (works with both single and online gameplay) with no hassle.  Excellent online community allows lots of replayability once you've mastered the AIs efforts.  With the game getting constant further expansions and updates this game can only get better. "

												As the Germans would say, ""Na Ja"". Games like this shows the flaws in the Steam review system. I'm going to have to give it a recommendation, simply because it did entertain me for a couple of hours, but however much fun with the family a board game like allows at Christmas, playing on a screen is just boring. For the uninitiated let me explain.For the first couple of hours I was enthralled. Learning all the rules, all the magical cards and their powers, all the items and followers. I thought I found something really deep to get my teeth stuck into. YAY! 4 hours in, I come to the damning and sad realisation. I am playing monopoly, in a D&D setting... but it's still monopoly. Aka, roll a dice over and over until you win or lose. The lack of strategy and the high percentage of luck mean that the hour long games that are needed to complete Talisman feel like little more than flipping a coin over and over to see who gets more tails than the other. So 5/10 from me... but if you see this for a buck and want a few hours novelty, it could be worth it!			"

												A  fun and entertaining game, however the AI is complete and utter, bull. I can not stress this idea enough. I spent half an hour trying to kill the only remaining Swashbuckler in a 1 vs. 5 AI game. He would not simply die. What i mean by this, is that he would honestly get down to 1 life point remaining and then miraculously roll the die into the perfect number to land on a square in which he could heal. It did not also help that he had a card that gave him a minimum of 1 gold at all times. The game finally ended when the AI moved him into the most inner ring where he had no methods of self healing.  Overall it's a great game and lives up to the experiences i've had through the actual irl gameboard. However this game requires a lot of patience. I don't reccommend this game if you don't like waiting forever to end the game. (If the turns are slow, you can fix that in the advaced settings.)			"

												I got this game as a gift from Aione, one of my female friends. Wasn't really interested into Dice games before, mainly due to the lack of multiplayer. But first game I played with two friends went freaking brutal. This game gives no ♥♥♥♥♥ about how well your doing... you start doing well is only a sign that something is about to royally f* you over.Which makes this game highly entertaining to me :DTalisman the base game, is exactly like the board game. Everything is up to chance, and it is your mission to conquer the board. Digital Edition offers progression as you win or loose games. With the multiple expansions to this game, the season pass is WELL WORTH IT!If you like RPG Dice Based board games or simply want to keep in touch with people across the country with game nights. This game is right for you.			"

												Talisman: Digital edition is a game I had never heard of before this free weekend.  I immediately liked the game.  This Talisman: DE is a digital Board game, literally.  You play as a variety of classes trying to buff your stats and make it to the center of the board before anyone else gets there.  The game relies heavily on RNG type randomness, Most actions involve dice rolls, and most ""encounters"" rely on the way the deck is ""shuffled"".  Another thing to note, I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but this game is long, I have been in the same game for about 4 hours now. no one has come very close to winning yet. I don't know how long the average game against the ai lasts, but mine are always terribly long.   Overall though I like the gameplay and art a lot. The art reminds me of classic Dungeons and Dragons art, and less grimdark games workshop art. I recommend this to anyone still interested after all that. I dont know  what kind of player will like it most really. If you get it, I hope you have fun!			"

												At first the RPG element of this game is fun. And truly I bought it because I enjoyed playing this board game when it first came out and I was hoping that the game would move along faster. Unfortunately, though some elements of the game are fun, most of the time it is boring and completed a game takes a LONG time. In fact, it took me about 60 turns to reach the end and then it took another 30 turns to kill everyone else with the Command spell. [which was really dull since I did nothing but try to roll 4, 5, or 6 for those turns). I ended up cranking the AI speed to 11 just to get it over with as fast as possible, I ended up not caring or paying attention to what the other players were doing.			"

												The AI is as dumb as a bag of elbows. Combined with the ridiculous amount of bugs and terrible programming, I'd say pass on this. Only playable with human opponents...locally...who can laugh with you at the bugs and failure.  Don't expect to play through a game of this without it crashing 5+ times.  Don't expect all spells and items to work.  This thing screams ""Outsourced programming to the lowest bidder"" loudly.  Unacceptable in a released product, especially one with DLC already out.  Potential to be great, but cannot recommend in its current state.			"

While the main mechanics of the game were OK, there were so few choices as opposed to dice rolls that it seemed to never really explore the RPG element. The end game was less than satisfactory.			"

I have been on the crown of command for two hours now trying to kill one char who can not ever come close cause he has a warlock quest he cannot complete and he just keeps healing himself and I don't hit the 50% chance roll often enough so gay. So the game is great overall so awesome, except that one gay bit...			"

												I love a great boardgame but let's face it, these ""cardboard children"" - to borrow a line from RPS - can take a LOT of table real estate to play. Talisman is a massive game in its ""analog form"" and with all of the expansions and four players, the setup is considerable and games can be marathons. But that's all good as boardgamers expect that. That said, Talisman Digital Edition fots nicely on my PC, requires mere minutes at most of setup an most importantly, captures the sheer fun of Talisman, Isn't that why we play games, for fun?A few negative reviews commented on the woeful AI. But, perhaps these folk are playing the prelude titled Talisman: Prologue. I have found the AI to be pretty good. And let's not forget that Talisman is largely a luck based game. All of the so-called tactics I have seen and heard about the game must still bow to the capriciousness of the deity known as RNG; even an AI like Deep Blue cannot predict the vagaries of dice rolls.There are a few issues that linger. One of the most annoying is when an AI opponent draws an event card. Unless you are a speed reader or you know every Talisman card by rote - and with all of the expansions in the physical boardgame there is an insane number of cards, you won't have time to read what the event is. You have to zoom in on the board section where the event is. The same holds true for other non-spell cards. This has been brought up to the devs but as yet there has been no fix for this.The digital version allows you to earn runes which grant advatages in gameplay. [AI also collects these as well]. I like the mechanic as it lends a sort of leveling up feeling.The Dungeon Expansion is next up and I cannot wait for its release! If it is as faithful as the physical version of the game, it's going to be a blast.I think that Talisman Digital Edition is a wonderful introduction to the fun world of tabletop boardgaming and it scratches the itch of tabletop boardgamers who want to play without the crazy setup and rather forced solo variants for the physical game found round the interwebz.This is a STEAL at the price and I would advise buyers to spend a little extra dosh and get The Reaper and Frostmarch expansions as they add considerably to the game.I hope that more boardgames experience a digital conversion. Are you listening Games Workshop and Fantasy Flight?EDIT: 18 November. The Dungeon expansion really ramps this game up considerably. The AI can be quite nasty and that's good as Talisman is a cut throat game. I am hopeful that the devs will release Blood Moon and The Dragon next. These two expansions literally change the game, adding a bit more unpredictability to a game that can punch you in the face already and have you smiling about it.UPDATE January 15: Ya gota love this developer. With the latest update there are two new free characters. These two are not even present in the physical boardgame but were last seen in the 1986(!) version of Talisman. More achievements plus what seems to be a hint that the Highland expansion is next! This is very cool as it is a one of the big corner expansions!!			"

It's a delightful board game to frustrate and encourage slight meadering. This digital version on the other, is awful-the graphics don't even make up for the annoying controls. If you want to play this game and lack the group to do so, save your money here and just travel down to your local comic book shop on a gaming night-playing with total stangers and risking a possible over abundance of B.O. is still better than taking a whack at this piece of garbage.

Pretty much everything is like the original board game. Pro's: Beautiful cards etcFantastic musicChoose how fast the AI thinks and camera speedHouse rules avaliableFINALLY I CAN PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT FUMBLING WITH CARDS! :DCon'sThe interface is not very intuitive, before you learn how the system ""thinks"" you'll probably accidentally cast a spell on yourself or something stupid like that.. I sure did ;)There are unfortunately a few bugs, I walked into a game breaking situation because of it. You can get stuck in loops where the AI just walks around in circles, there's no way to break the loop since you are entirely helpless when the AI is taking its turn.It's a bit slow sometimes.All an all tho, its super fun!!And the expansions are worth the money, AT LEAST the ones where you actually get a new region and not just cards.

												Steam really needs a thumb sideways for games like this.On one hand the game seems to be a faithful adaptation to the board game (from what people say. Ive never played it) The game is realativly fun and it has an online option.The other hand though.... I encountered a slew of bugs/glitches which ended in some actions not being counted or moves being skipped. The AI is horrible. They refuse to go into the inner section until they are around 13 in their stat and they make a lot of stupid moves. A mectric ton of dlc that kind of feels like its to much when the base game has very little to offer in terms of chracters/boards/and cards.If you like the board game and want to play it then im sure you'll have a decent time with it. For everyone else though, I would avoid buying this unless its very cheap or on a humble bundle.			"

												As a little boy I was always curious about the Talisman boardgame. Now it came to Steam and on a sale I took my chances. Pros: + Great art & figures just like the boardgame.+ Long game time (depends how you look at it)+ Various characters to choose from, each with their own special skill(s)+ Some interessing items, followers & spells to get or sites to visitCons:- To much depends on the lucky dice rolls- Because of the dice rolls, the game can drag on and on, even if you have the Staff of Command- Long game time (depends how you look at it)- Imbalances on character front. A thief has 100% chance to Steal from you, even if you are the most powerful character on the board. It would be more interessing and more fair that the victim is able to save and hurt the thief when caught. Same for a sorceress with Beguile.- Did I already say it depends to much on the lucky dice rolls?Personally, I enjoyed it first but later on the myriad of (un)lucky dice rolls, character imbalances & to long game times diminished my enjoyment rapidly. I would rather spend my time on other games where I have much more controle at the games progress - and I have to blame my own stupidity - than on the sheer luck of a dice roll.If they do some tweaking to give your chosen character a fairer chance/saving roll against some odds, I might take another look at it and change my mind about it . . .

												Talisman the board game! From what I've seen, this is basically 99.9% of the original boxed board game in digital format. My only gripe with it is the character cards from the baord game are not all included in the purchase, game includes a msall hadfull of characters and then you need to purchase the rest. Otherwise, considering it's less than 1/3 of the price of the board game, it's not a bad deal.			"

												Although I never played the board game, I can easily attest to the fact that this game brings the worst out in yourself and your friends, which in itself leads to hilarious and memorable moments. That, coupled with the random nature of the game, is in my opinion its greatest strength, as it allows everybody to compete on an even level. The randomness might get frustrating in single player though and I clearly recommend that you band together and buy the four pack, so you have somebody to play with, because the social aspect of the game is half the experience.On the downside, the technical aspect of multiplayer matches does have some hiccups. I have experienced sync issues and game crashes a couple of times, which is aggravating when you are about to wrap up a game session, which easily runs in at about two hours. This shouldn’t keep you from buying the game if you have some friends around to play it with though.			"

												Almost identcal to playing the board game with a few major exceptions. the most important being speed. A real life Talisman game can usually take up 6hrs. With the turn speed for the PC ramped up to 10 I finished my first game in 3hrs.  This is not a problem as playing well in games causes you to level up unlocking new stuff. Quite what I'm not yet sure as it will take more than one game to level up. The other major difference is price. A full set of Talisman with the expnasion will srt you back nearly £100 for the physical version.I do love my physichal set and this does lack the atmosphere of having some like minded mates round for a good boardgames session. But as an introduction to the game or as a way of killing the hours over the summer while your mates are on holiday this is highly recomended. Also if you have friends who play but dont live locally it is also possible to set up an online game over the web.			"

												Faithful recreation of a classic board game.  TERRIBLE UI  As much as I love talisman and like having a digital version, something MUST be done about the god awful UI.  Casting spells makes magic users a pita to play, can't look around the boardto inspect thigns unless it's your turn, and unforgiving timelimits make this a hard sell.  I def. enjoy it but can only barely reccomend it.  Saving is a straight up nightmare in multiplayer conditions.  That said updates seem frequent and the devs. do seem to be listening to the torrent of complaints from loyal fans who are putting up with the current conditions.   Great with friends but more of a hassle than a joy to play.  It basically jsut makes me want to break out my physical copy instead.  6/10			"

												After taking 2 hours to learn the game with a couple playthroughs, we set up for a final game of the night. Rolling Thief, a few drinks in, I decide to fully immerse myself for this playthrough and give it an honest try. The adventure began, and McStickyfingers was unleashed upon the world. Turn one, McStickyfingers immediately heads to town and run into the Black Market. What a perfect way to get a head start, he thought, and jumps at the opportunity to pay 1 gold for a full suit of plate mail. Being the most obnoxious and unsubtle Thief in the land, McSticky is caught and hauled off to Jail to reflect on his life choices. Seven turns in, the world around him is passing by, with another filthy bandit behind bars. A wanted poster for anti-thievery is picked up by a travelling Pirate, passing through town. Ironically, the Pirate ceases his own mischief and pledges to ensure McSticky remains off the streets. ""There is only room for one bandit, here!"" - He thought. McStickyfingers is finally released from Jail on the eighth turn. Has he changed? Did he learn his lesson? You may ask him. In turn he would respond to you with a question, ""Are you kidding?"" Upon release, McStickyfingers immediately runs into the Pirate and steals the wanted poster of himself right out of Pirate's hands. The world is surely doomed, now.Many turns go by, which means many items are stolen from anyone and anything. A collection of swords is made within' McStickyfingers' inventory - one from every player leaving each of them unarmed. It isn't long before Death himself is unanimously tasked to put a stop to the McStickyfinger shenanigans. Fumbling around with his shiny swords, McSticky is caught from behind and beheaded with one stroke of the scythe. Was this the end? No. More like ...are you kidding? At the end of Mr. Grim's action, McStickyfingers is revived and immediately re-gathers his belongings before anyone else can act. It seems not even Death can stop the reign of McStickyfingers' mischief. It isn't long before deals are made from the other adventurers to our beloved Thief to spare their inventory from his sticky fingers. Gold is thrown in his direction from every which way.Having never given up on his quest, wanted poster or not, the Pirate is behind the scenes with an anti-theft bag to stash his belongings. Arming to the teeth, a rivalry is born. To be continued...10/10 would go on epic thieving heists again.			"

												I played the Talisman board game with my old gaming group and we would have hours of fun taking us into the wee hours of the morning without even realizing it. This game brings all that fun back, but with the option to save and quit when the sun starts peeking through the windows and you need to hide away for a few hours.However, it does feel like there are still some bugs to work out, such as abilities that can be activated 'at will' don't seem to be available to use when the 'at will' need arises. This may be a bug or I am missing the prompts to give me that opportunity. The only other downside I can see is you are not physically sitting at the table with your friends as you play to toss around the smack talk and make deals on the fly to take a problematic character down.All in all, this is a fantastically fun game to play and all of the expansions are more than worth it for the added content and additional characters. You would be amazed to see a Courtesan beating the heck out of a Dread Knight when things go in your favor.Definitely worth your time and money and everything goes on sale with some frequency. The standalone characters are also worth it if you grab them on sale. Otherwise you'll have plenty of others to play with un til they do.			"

												One of the few digital board games that isn't total garbage.  Talisman is loads of fun and I often compare it to an entire campaign of DnD condensed with PvP to those who have not played it.  My only complaint is that games can take a LONG time to complete sometimes, like 6+ hours... and the multiplayer save system doesn't always work as it should.  A game I would happily add to my sizable physical board game collection.			"

												This game will make you completely distrust computer dice rolls. Also, change the setting to allow swapping out quests on the Warlock's Cave spot (it is disabled by default), otherwise you can get the quest to damage a character, and all the other characters are on the inner row, or at the Crown of Command, and you get to waste a half hour waiting for the dice rolls to kill you. That being said, it was a fun game (albeit a bit long) but they give you the options to minimize some of the pain, and to at least give yourselves a quicker death than the long death the dice promise you.

												It's Talisman, but digital! If you haven't played the board game you are really missing out. However, for all of your board game ports, this is how it should be done. Besides a couple bugs, this game really nails it. Easy for anyone to pick up, and hopefully they fix things like the inability to cancel a spell cast or making spells uncastable sometimes when they should be. I would still recommend to anyone.			"

												Fun board game, if you like that kind of thing.  On the computer, the interface is a little bad.  The other problem is having to purchase downloadable content.  I hate that in games.  Either sell me the game or not at one price, don't ask me for more money later :-(  Still would recomend game if you like board games.			"

												I bought this game because it was dirt cheap and remembered liking the board game the one time I played it a long, long, long time ago. Buying this game was a terrible mistake, because I've had a hard time doing anything else but play it since. Obviously, whether you'll enjoy it depends on how into board games with RPG elements you are (obviousy, they're pretty addictive to me), but as a recreation of the board game it's pretty sweet. The interface could be a little better and the AI could be better, but in the several games I played I didn't notice any noteworthy problems other than I wish the AI were a little more competitive. This is definitely much better played with human players.			"

												This is a very faithful adaptation of the board game. My friends and I put in a lot of hours on the 2nd Ed. game back in the early 90s and this is as close as you're going to get to that experience without having the actual cards and dice. We had two standing house rules back then: Nobody gets to start a new character after 11pm, and KILL THE PROPHETESS if anyone chooses her.  She's one seriously annoying character.			"

												One of the few digital board games that isn't total garbage.  Talisman is loads of fun and I often compare it to an entire campaign of DnD condensed with PvP to those who have not played it.  My only complaint is that games can take a LONG time to complete sometimes, like 6+ hours... and the multiplayer save system doesn't always work as it should.  A game I would happily add to my sizable physical board game collection.			"

The devs did real good bringing the actual board feeling to it.. It's very easy to learn it from scratch.The only problem I had was the lack of interaction with real players as Talisman should be.Talisman get to its sweetspot when you have actual interact with freinds at one table.That said' it shouldn't prevent you from playing the digital edition ' so I would recommend you to try it (probably on good sale)			"

												Talisman is a reat PC tabletop board game. similar to Dungeons&Dragons or Pathfinder in the role playing sence. You choose a character and roll dice to move him around the board collecting items and fighting monsters, until you have high enough stats and you've aquired the ""Talisman"" to get you to the ""Crown of Command"" to win the game. Very fun and entertaining if you have friends to play with you. HIGHLY RECOMEND You get the DLC expansions though!!!!!!! The normal game is kinda lame, but if you have the city, highlands, dungeon, and a few character packs... it sooo much more fun! (best part is, if u have say 3 friends, only 1 needs to buy the expansions.. then he/she hosts the game, and for that game, you have it too! Hope you all have fun :)			"

												Do you have friends to play table top games with, but you don't have place to game/you live far away from each other? Fear no more! Thanks to digitalizing board games, you can play Talisman online! Want to play with family/friends in home but you hate all of the cards everywhere/you're just to lazy to even think about cleaning it up later? Just start that little beast up and have fun! But putting the fun review away, the game is great, it's the same as the board game, instead on computers screen.Only one thing i have to mention that i DON't like, when you play with friends coach style not online, it's really hard to fast swap the mouse from one another to cast spell mid someones move/turn, the time limit for that is just ridiculous (or I am just blind and I don't know how to change it, then please, tell me how)And the AI, it's dumb as hell, don't even play with AI (even for the first time, just get a friend or sister or someone from the street and play!)I highly recommend it!

												What a fantastic translation of the board game!I used to play this over the course of a day with a friend. We would stockpile gold, objects, and stats to rediculous levels, and then go stomping around the Middle and Inner circles.An Assassin with the Runesword is just as much fun to play here as in the cardboard version. ;)EDIT: Well ... drat. I left this review based on single-player play. As indicated everywhere, online play is a disaster. I lost connection to a client in the same room as my computer; I can only imagine the doom that trying to play this over the PSTN would cause.5/5: Single-player gameplay. 2/5: Online play.

												This is a very faithful adaptation of the board game. My friends and I put in a lot of hours on the 2nd Ed. game back in the early 90s and this is as close as you're going to get to that experience without having the actual cards and dice. We had two standing house rules back then: Nobody gets to start a new character after 11pm, and KILL THE PROPHETESS if anyone chooses her.  She's one seriously annoying character.			"

												Excellent conversion of a classic table top board game to a PC game.  Keeps all the elements of the game I love and mixes in a few new options (you can choose to play with the new options or without).  It would have been cool if they could have added some on-screen effects (like snow blowing across the screen when you draw the blizzard card, etc.), as its relatively a plain looking game.  But it stays true to the board game and thats what matters most.  Thanks.			"

												One of the greatest games ever conceived. I've been playing for weeks and have enjoyed most of my time with it, despite only having one other friend that will play this with me. Sadly, he won't anymore.The first game that started that: Within 10 turns death had landed on the last dungeon tile with an AI in control. Targeting my friend that had 6 lives and a talisman, he rolled a 1 on the death. Instant death with no revival.It took him a week to recover from that, I had to egg him on and even let him know I would disable death. He relented and within 10 turns on a Devils' Minion he had to fight a basalisk. Lost, instant death.11/10 because he was the one that bought me and himself the base game with all the DLC. Amazing experience.			"

												Before you fully consider my recommendation, consider the following:-This game is riddled with bugs, everything from annoying to flat out game breaking.-I've had A.I. wait for their timeout before doing their move.-Worse yet, I've had A.I. that STILL won't move after their timeout. This breaks the game and you have no choice but to exit.-A lot of actions don't explain in any way what you need to do.-Once you start casting a spell (even if accidentally) you don't get to change your mine. In real life, you would absolutely get to.-It's too easy to accidentally start casting a spell when you did not intend to.Other than that, this game is extremely fun. ESPECIALLY if you have a friend or two you can play together with while simultanneously skyping.			"

												I would say if you are only planning on playing locally, stick with paper and card. Easier to deal with everything, and you're more invested in interacting rather than just sitting playing on your phone while it's not your turn.If on the otherhand you have friends on steam who you can play online with, go for it. I don't really rely on the players online because you can drop out at any time, but playing an AI/Online game with firends it is a great alternative to the physical game. Get in a Skype/Steam call together an have some fun!			"

												I enjoyed Talisman: Prologue, and this version added the biggest thing it was lacking: MULTIPLAYER. The only downside to this game is that the AI has a tendency to go full retard at times and put itself into an infinite cycle of futility if you're playing against AI opponents (such as wasting turns going into loops of picking up and dropping a pile of items every single turn instead of just ignoring them if it already has an ideal gear set and can't carry any more). But still a fun fantasy hero RPG style board game :-)			"

												A fantasy boardgame turned digital. Very fun with friends, but the UI/engine is a little buggy. Online multiplayer can cause disconnects sometimes, but luckily there's a fast and easy ""retry"" function which automatically remakes the game and starts at the last turn played.Players pick from a pool of characters and take turns traveling around a spiraled board with three regions (four if you have the expansion) where each space on the board has it's own description of an action that affects play. The characters each have their own stats and abilities which makes re-playability very high. It feels a little unbalanced as some characters feel better than others since they can snowball given their unique abilities, where others don't seem to take off until deep into the game. As time in the game progresses players collect monsters as trophies, collect cards, gold, or battle each other to collect stat points. The objective is to get enough stat points to go past the required spaces on the board and get to the center space to claim victory.It's a game of dicerolls, but having more stats or inventory cards will improve your odds by a huge margin. There are weapons that increase your strength or craft, armor that will let you re-roll to save yourself from taking damage, items that give you magic spells, etc... but it still comes down to the luck of the dice. It's very frustrating when you're getting beat down, but very satisfying when you're doing the beating.In short, the game is good fun with friends, but I can't imagine playing it by myself.			"

												Although the charachters look a little bit like they may take your children away from you in the night: my inital impressions were good.The game did keep freezing on me (possibly because I was making this awesome video.... ) which made getting a good feel for it hard. There also did not appear to be a huge amount of depth, but, again, this is just a first impression. A very, very short first impression.

												I used to play the old boardgame in the early 90s, fond memories. I wondered if the digital edition would even be true to the original. I tried it and was not disappointed! We even play it with my son on the living room TV, the excitement passed to the next generation. We can save our game if interrupted for dinner or if it gets too late and continue at another time, which is a bonus compared to the board game.I recommend it to any fans of the board game, you will feel right at home. If this is your first contact with Talisman, you have to see past the average graphics and lack of fancy animations and use your imagination to immerse yourself in the game. If you can do that, you will enjoy hours of solo, hotseat or online fun!			"

												Faithfully recreates the classic board game. Games are dictated by a certain level of rng, like most board games that utilize card draws and dice rolls, but they also contain enough free will choices to have an adequate amount of strategy.The downside is; it is too faithfull to the board game. Matches can take up to an hour or more to complete and are rather boring if no one chats during the game. The game is best played among friends or with people willing to chat and get into the intrigue of attacking each other, forming alliances, and general♥♥♥♥♥♥talking each others bad luck.There are some bugs but the devs are very responsive to the community and activley work on swatting the annoying crashes or disconnects.

												Firstly ignore the metacritic score, I haven't read the reviews and I'm not sure why it's so low, my only thought is there were a lot of bugs when the game first came out which probably impacted the score; but a lot has been improved upon since then.Excellent game. Like boardgames? Then you'll like this. Like the original Talisman boardgame? Then you'll like this. I've played the boardgame several times, and quite enjoy this as it takes out all the hassle of setting the game up. Granted playing the boardgame is still lots of fun.There are the odd bugs but the developers are still active, killing the bugs and adding new things to the game (I haven't played in a while and was greeted with a updated UI during the game which I felt improved it!) Also newly added to the game the ability to play with 6 players, AI, local or online.There's hours of fun to have with th ebase game without the DLC, the DLC adds more depth and variation to the game but isn't needed; unless it's been changed if an online game is played only the host needs to have purchased the DLC meaning if you're lucky you'll get a preview of DLC too.

												Pay no mind to the Metacritic score, those critics reviewed the game when it first came out.  At that time it had a huge number of bugs and other problems, particularly with multiplayer, but those have been entirely rectified.  This is a fantastic adaptation of a great board game.  It takes a long time to play, especially with a lot of players; less time than the actual board game though since you don't have to bother with setting it up or putting it away.  The game itself is quite a lot of fun for any RPG and board game lover.  It's a great value too, especially if you pick it up on sale (and it goes on sale fairly frequently).  The only real downside is that the AI is still terrible, so you're pretty much limited to playing with friends for a worthwhile experience.			"

												Oh talisman how fickle you can be. Sometimes you roll the dice and everything falls perfectly your way.....til your turned into a toad.....or you roll a one with death....... I won't lie I've rage quite many a times but the importance of this game is its local multiplayer. I love being able to bust this game out with all of my nerd friends and race for the crown. I good board game all and all. But this is game is far from perfect, first off you have to buy some of the charaters individual for about two bucks a piece which I find to be annoying as I want to own the whole game!!! But that aside its a great game with plenty of interesting exspansion packs and a solid starter game. Perfect for company and family a like.			"

												An enjoyable version of the well-known game, the only real issue with Talisman is how much the game can drag due to the reliance of dice rolls to do anything.

												My friends and I have been playing this game here and there for almost about 2 weeks and overall its pretty fun. There are still some bugs and sometimes it breaks the game (unplayable at that point in multiplayer), but from what I've played on singleplayer, it has not bugged. Even through the multiplayer sessions where it breaks and people get frustrated, they also had fun and for most games, it is pretty funny.10/10, I've seen spellsword Thief, a strength focused Warlock and a spirit elk of a strength of 1 kill many people amongst many, surprising things.

												This game is more deserving than a meta score of 51. It is simple, yes, but filled with hidden complexities and strategies. My only regret is not picking up the season pass this last winter sale and some copies for some friends. If you ever enjoyed dice boardgames, you will love this. I play this game on an Asus Win Tab and it plays beautifully.			"

												Great Game, so long as your playing with other people.My only three gripes about it would be the AI opponents, Runes, and the online connectivity.The AI is not the greatest. They do some incredibly stupid things, things not even new players would conceivably do. And often with certain characters (Ogre, Necromancer, Ghoul, Minstril to name a few) will not even use the characters abilities at any point in the match. Runes ruin the experience if you use them, and make certain characters blatantly overpowered compared to others. Most people do not use them anyway, so it's not that big an issue, but i just don't see any benefit for them existing.And for online, connections can be a bit shakey at certain times of day, but so far the dev's have been working hard at relieving that issue, and its shown (for me anyway).There are a few other bugs here and there, but they are also being dealth with all the time, and usually don't interfere with a match.A friend of mine has said Hot-Seat Multiplayer also works quite well, so playing with real friends just like you would on the physical version is a plus. If you like board or tabletop games, or decent games to play with friends, pick up Talisman: Digital Edition. The season pass is also worthwhile considering all of the content that is ahead. Overall its one of the better games i've played in the past year or two.			"

												I purchased the game through the Humble Bundle and so far I have been impressed. Online does have some issues. 1 play through online took about 3 hours and we had 3 total disconnects. After each one we were able to reconnect though. The reconnect process really wasn't that bad especailly if everyone is already on Skype, Mumble, etc. I don't want to dive too much into the gameplay as honestly the best method of researching that is YouTube. Anyone interested in the game I would encourage to watch a few lets plays to get the hang of the rules and also to see if this is a game they will be interested in. If you do not have a group of friends to play the game with I would recomend staying away or using Steam or Reddit to find people to play with. The AI leaves much to desire. Anyone who is a fan of board games and have a few friends willing to play with then this game is worth the purchase and with these factors I would give the game a 7/10 in its current form. With more NET improvements and Spell casting changes to make it more intuative I could say my rating going higher.			"

												I just played a couple matches so far against the AI.  The game is enjoyable, but I must admit the end game was quite painful.  I made it to the end then just had to keep hoping to roll a 4-6 to  make the AI lose a life.  I would get him down a couple lives then he would heal back up.  Then I would roll 1-3 a few turns in a row.  Then get him down a life then he heals.....UGH!!!  If the end game was different I would give this 5 stars.  As it is for me it is a 3.5 to 4 star game.  It is probably beter when playing with friends.			"

												The Pros:The game is pretty. The art is pretty much as I remember the board game. The UI while unintuitive does cover most things. Winning can be fun.The Cons:Losing can be really boring. Being stuck on the command crown for endless turns whilst your one remaining opponent wanders the outer regions merely healing when you get the command spell to hit (every 1 in 5 times, and I started that end game approach with 8 fate) is not my idea of going out in a blaze of glory. The AI makes no attempt to get near you once you are down to two players.There are many moments of frustration in the game. Many of them aren't particularly meaningful except as an ""I gotchya"" tweak that the game pulls on you. (Being unable to control when some spells go off, having situations where you are forced to target yourself with abilities or spells because the UI doesn't allow you to back up, losing all your items/gold/followers to bad encounters, rarely ever burning a fate point that actually helps, the list is probably endless.) That said if you are a fan of random, I think this game really hits that spot. Whilst Catan (the online version) is kind of sad for not having multi player options, Talisman does have this.I can't say I think much of the pay to play nickle & dime approach (and what big dimes they are!) but it is nice that you can customize what you get in terms of characters/boards. I haven't done that but I expect those who want to enjoy multi player will eventually get the relevent characters. One thing seems a bit inobvious but is probably true anyway: You are able to win with any of the characters. The key being that you spend the time to learn how that character survives and adapts appropriately. Some might have a steep curve.I am recommending this game with a 6/10. Meaning: ""caveat emptor"" if you have problems with random games. It is fun once you set aside the disappointments and frustrations.			"

												Having grown up on Talisman 2nd Edition, I have grown to appreciate and enjoy 4th Edition. It fixes a lot of issues that were present in 2nd. Starting characters with high craft are no longer at such a steep disadvantage to those of high strength. The inclusion of the fate mechanic can help ever so much with catastrophic dice rolls and, for myself, makes being evil desirable.Digital edition is based off 4th Edition rules and faithfully done so. This game is, as of writing this, still a work in progress, so there are bugs to work out. However, the development team is continuously releasing patches to fix problems and content updates, to include new expansions and characters for those who have bought them.For those who enjoy Talisman, I recommend getting the season pass, which unlocks all content for T:DE in perpetuity. As a fan, it's nice to be able to play without the bothersome setup and clean up (or other players, often).			"

												A real fun game for you and three buds!!!  You have characters to choose from and they all have special abilities that effect game play. The base game has plenty to choose from so don't worry. Each player begins at a character specific start square on the outer ring on the board. The board is made of three rings of space each with location names on them, some of these locations also have special abilities that effect your pawn. You have 2 sums that are used in combat, strength and craft, then life, fate and gold all of which can be leveled up or chipped away at to reduce them lower that starting amounts.You roll a random generated die and move to the tile options you come up with, than you draw an adventure card that may be a monster, loot, item or event to challenge youor the other players. The object is to level up collecting items boosting your stats and fighting the other players, It plays just like a board game- one player after another takeing turns but as the game goes on the difficulty and struggle increases. You want to get to the center of the board crossing through two ""rings"" of board tiles to get to the tower where you take control and cast a spell that slowly kills off the other players to win. After a game is finnished you claim XP and level up to the next level where you can get bonuses to the pawn you pick for the next game.WARNING!! The games seem to take a long time to play through, I've played many- finnished two and both of those took longer than 3 hours to play. Lots of fun! Very replayable, lots of laughs with your friends.If you like tabletop games, GAMES WORKSHOP games you should enjoy this one, I got it for 5 bucks on sale but can say it is worth the full price. The game also has lots of DLC in the form of new player characters- ($1.99) each and several boards or expansions... ($5.99)) and up.-Mr. GrAnD			"

												I like tabletop games, but they are hard to get where I live and really expensive. So after seeing what this looks like purchasing was a no-brainer. This game have maximum of what you can adapt from real, touchable tabletop game into a digitalized version. It almost feel like a real one, especially if you gather your friends in one room (but online play is nice, too). It have even this bitter-sweet rage inducing ""dice-effect"". So, if you looking not just for an adaptation, but a ""simulation"" of tabletop experience, then I personally can't recommend this game enough. Worth every cent.			"

Its not overwhelming to play with a little background reading, on the rules and if most gamers that are willing to give Talisman a fair try they should at least get something out of it. From what I have read it is a pretty true copy of the Talisman board game. If I was to pick on Talisman its that it really needs a way to communicate. Its not a deal breaker as many VoIP services could be of use. As with any digital board game it can't complete with a room full of friends. But look on the bright side there is no need to worry about losing any pieces!			"

												I have always loved the board game, and this digital rendition of it is really good.It's just as much fun as the real thing.For those that don't know Talisman: You all have a character with unique abilities, designed to make others miserable, and fight and cheat your way to the ultimate reward, the crown of power, which allows you to RULE THE WOOOOORLD!

												Отличная настольная игра, чем-то напомнила мне Джуманджи с детства, картонные карты, фишки, кубики)))) Как и в большинстве настольных игр, чем выше значение сумм кубиков, тем лучше. Ходишь по карте и тебе попадаются всякие ништяки, которые помогут победить и преуспеть. Еще есть уникальная штука, как смерть с косой, которая ходит по пятам, когда она меня догнала, у меня была паника: ""Что же это? Все? Гаплык?"", но тут, волшебные кубики, и выпало 7 и черт возьми, смерть меня отпустила))) В общем, если хотите вспомнить старые настольные игры, обязательно скачайте, а еще лучше, с друзьями поиграйте(=			"

												Fun board game that you can waste hours on. Has errors and crashes occasionally which can be annoying but usually able to rejoin or resume a game so that's good. Also like that only one person in an online game needs the dlc for everyone to enjoy it. Has a few problems like the errors and crashes I mentioned and could use some simple features like canceling a spell you didn't mean to cast or being able to get the experience from an online game if you die without having to leave the game open for sometimes hours until it's over, but overall if you like fantasy type boardgames I'd recommend it.

												I can't judge the game against the old board game as I have never played it.  That being said, the game has a great variety characters, gear and encounters to make your e-board game experience feel like and adventure.On the down side, the game can seem to drag on due to alot of unlucky rolls.  It can get so bad, that die rolls don't feel so random.  If this was Yahtzee, I could get bonus yahtzees with 1 rolls all day long on the Crown of Command.  I am guessing they have nerfed some of the game mechanics so players might be more inclined to buy dlc instead of grinding it out.  Perhaps I am being cynical, but I enjoyed the base game at a discounted price, so I will give it a thumbs up.  If I had paid 79.99 for the complete game, I would definately not recommend it.   There is no groundbreaking, earth-shattering, gameplay (in the base game, nor the dlc) that justifies that price.			"

												Ah, nothing like being able to play one of my favorite board games again. Without having to find the missing pieces that is. Anyway, I believe this is a great digitalization of a great board game for the whole family to play; a thrilling adventure every time you play with a competitive/ co-operative nature to each player being exemplified by the actions you choose to take. Unlike most board games made computer games that I've played, this one, with its DLC, holds true to the original in all but the board and table setting. The online play feature is most definately a bonus as now you can play with friends even if you are miles away from eachother. 10/10 in my book,			"

												A real fun game for you and three buds!!!  You have characters to choose from and they all have special abilities that effect game play. The base game has plenty to choose from so don't worry. Each player begins at a character specific start square on the outer ring on the board. The board is made of three rings of space each with location names on them, some of these locations also have special abilities that effect your pawn. You have 2 sums that are used in combat, strength and craft, then life, fate and gold all of which can be leveled up or chipped away at to reduce them lower that starting amounts.You roll a random generated die and move to the tile options you come up with, than you draw an adventure card that may be a monster, loot, item or event to challenge youor the other players. The object is to level up collecting items boosting your stats and fighting the other players, It plays just like a board game- one player after another takeing turns but as the game goes on the difficulty and struggle increases. You want to get to the center of the board crossing through two ""rings"" of board tiles to get to the tower where you take control and cast a spell that slowly kills off the other players to win. After a game is finnished you claim XP and level up to the next level where you can get bonuses to the pawn you pick for the next game.WARNING!! The games seem to take a long time to play through, I've played many- finnished two and both of those took longer than 3 hours to play. Lots of fun! Very replayable, lots of laughs with your friends.If you like tabletop games, GAMES WORKSHOP games you should enjoy this one, I got it for 5 bucks on sale but can say it is worth the full price. The game also has lots of DLC in the form of new player characters- ($1.99) each and several boards or expansions... ($5.99)) and up.-Mr. GrAnD			"

This game have maximum of what you can adapt from real, touchable tabletop game into a digitalized version. It almost feel like a real one, especially if you gather your friends in one room (but online play is nice, too). It have even this bitter-sweet rage inducing ""dice-effect"". So, if you looking not just for an adaptation, but a ""simulation"" of tabletop experience, then I personally can't recommend this game enough. Worth every cent.			"

												This game is probably a bit coloured by nostalgia for me, as it was a fond summer event to meet my cousin that had this game and we had a lot of fun with it, even without any expansions. This game is a very faitfull adaptation, and the expansions have never been more accessible. They are doing hot-seat right with regard to hidden cards. And a great set of houserules avaliable. If you are not familiar with talisman, it is a very laid-back game where the focus is more on experiencing stuff than actually making any big decissions that matter. This newer version include a faith point system that older versions didn't have, that somewhat alievates the otherwise a bit ""snakes and ladders"" feel the game might get when you are used to it. So recomended if you want a easy somewhat competitative game with fantasy theme (the theme is strong with this one). If you want more challenging decissionmaking there are probably better options.

												Talisman is a really fun game that I usually play with a few friends from time to time. We would often try to send the Grim Reaper after each other and see what happenes. There's usually one person in the group who goes into the dungeon area (can't remember the exact name). It has a mixed feelings of D&D, HearthStone, and a board game (best way I can think of to describe it and my feelings about it).I haven't  played this for very long, so I can't give a very good review of the game, but personally, I do find it really interesting to say the least. The game confuses me at time, but wtih people you know, you'll be able to figure the game out in no time. On a side note, it's an enormous amount of fun with a group of friends (or people you know). It's not as fun playing this alone, having done this on a number of occasions. The game isn't for everyone as it may be a bit slow pased. Personally, it's a good time passer when I have some free time on my hands.But what I can say is that, if ever playing with me, please note that playing the game any time past midnight, Terrible decision will be made on my part.

I got a four-pack, so that I could gift a copy to my parents and sister, and I have to say that it is pretty faithful to the original.  There are some minor glitches, made less minor by the fact that some of them can make it impossible to finish a game (making it necessary to start a new one), but it is a fun, semi-relaxed game to play, and provided a nice trip down memory lane for me.

If you're expecting to ever win just one flippin' game from an AL player?!...Good freakin' Luck to ya!!!In the meantime, it's just crazy additive fun...(Even if the air turns blue from swearing at this @#@#ing game for as far as six counties away!) Would I recommend this Jack-Azz game to anyone?! Sure, why the hell not?! I'd really appreciate the company bouncing off the walls in my padded cell!			"

												I grew up playing this board game.  If you liked the board game, then this is a must buy.  I love it because you don't have to spend an hour setting it up.  It can never match the nostalgia of playing the original with friends but it is great to load up and play.  I like to play for 20 minutes here and 20 there and it saves it for you.  A nice game for the price.			"

												After taking 2 hours to learn the game with a couple playthroughs, we set up for a final game of the night. Rolling Thief, a few drinks in, I decide to fully immerse myself for this playthrough and give it an honest try. The adventure began, and McStickyfingers was unleashed upon the world. Turn one, McStickyfingers immediately heads to town and run into the Black Market. What a perfect way to get a head start, he thought, and jumps at the opportunity to pay 1 gold for a full suit of plate mail. Being the most obnoxious and unsubtle Thief in the land, McSticky is caught and hauled off to Jail to reflect on his life choices. Seven turns in, the world around him is passing by, with another filthy bandit behind bars. A wanted poster for anti-thievery is picked up by a travelling Pirate, passing through town. Ironically, the Pirate ceases his own mischief and pledges to ensure McSticky remains off the streets. ""There is only room for one bandit, here!"" - He thought. McStickyfingers is finally released from Jail on the eighth turn. Has he changed? Did he learn his lesson? You may ask him. In turn he would respond to you with a question, ""Are you kidding?"" Upon release, McStickyfingers immediately runs into the Pirate and steals the wanted poster of himself right out of Pirate's hands. The world is surely doomed, now.Many turns go by, which means many items are stolen from anyone and anything. A collection of swords is made within' McStickyfingers' inventory - one from every player leaving each of them unarmed. It isn't long before Death himself is unanimously tasked to put a stop to the McStickyfinger shenanigans. Fumbling around with his shiny swords, McSticky is caught from behind and beheaded with one stroke of the scythe. Was this the end? No. More like ...are you kidding? At the end of Mr. Grim's action, McStickyfingers is revived and immediately re-gathers his belongings before anyone else can act. It seems not even Death can stop the reign of McStickyfingers' mischief. It isn't long before deals are made from the other adventurers to our beloved Thief to spare their inventory from his sticky fingers. Gold is thrown in his direction from every which way.Having never given up on his quest, wanted poster or not, the Pirate is behind the scenes with an anti-theft bag to stash his belongings. Arming to the teeth, a rivalry is born. To be continued...10/10 would go on epic thieving heists again.			"

												Excellent conversion of a classic table top board game to a PC game.  Keeps all the elements of the game I love and mixes in a few new options (you can choose to play with the new options or without).  It would have been cool if they could have added some on-screen effects (like snow blowing across the screen when you draw the blizzard card, etc.), as its relatively a plain looking game.  But it stays true to the board game and thats what matters most.  Thanks.			"

												Overall I would recommend this game.(Pros)Play is like the boardgame, without the hassle of aftergame cleanup or worry over losing/damaging cards.Color Coded background to make you aware of whos turn is in progress and an adjustable inactivity timer before the computer steps in and takes over as a temporary npc are both brilliant features.(Cons)odd spellcasting interface that can result in miscasts (due to que feature) or inability to cast ""on the fly"" before a spells conditionals elapse global conditions and multi-turn effects need a visible countdown showing when they expire (suggestion: numeral in the color of the player whose turn it will expire on)bugs with statistically improbable die rolls becoming persistent (every time an armor roll made same number occurs over a span of 2-3 games on same playerOVERALL beautiful,  a brilliant beta, but praying to all the alignments that patches are forthcoming soon.(shameless plug for a family house rule to become available in options) Death will stop short of his rolled movement to encounter a player in his path. Death becomes the feared force he was meant to be...)			"

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

												Love this game. Love it! I'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG. The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO! Since I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in. So the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.This is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?! Still love the game!!			"

												Although I never played the board game, I can easily attest to the fact that this game brings the worst out in yourself and your friends, which in itself leads to hilarious and memorable moments. That, coupled with the random nature of the game, is in my opinion its greatest strength, as it allows everybody to compete on an even level. The randomness might get frustrating in single player though and I clearly recommend that you band together and buy the four pack, so you have somebody to play with, because the social aspect of the game is half the experience.On the downside, the technical aspect of multiplayer matches does have some hiccups. I have experienced sync issues and game crashes a couple of times, which is aggravating when you are about to wrap up a game session, which easily runs in at about two hours. This shouldn’t keep you from buying the game if you have some friends around to play it with though.			"

												Almost identcal to playing the board game with a few major exceptions. the most important being speed. A real life Talisman game can usually take up 6hrs. With the turn speed for the PC ramped up to 10 I finished my first game in 3hrs.  This is not a problem as playing well in games causes you to level up unlocking new stuff. Quite what I'm not yet sure as it will take more than one game to level up. The other major difference is price. A full set of Talisman with the expnasion will srt you back nearly £100 for the physical version.I do love my physichal set and this does lack the atmosphere of having some like minded mates round for a good boardgames session. But as an introduction to the game or as a way of killing the hours over the summer while your mates are on holiday this is highly recomended. Also if you have friends who play but dont live locally it is also possible to set up an online game over the web.			"

												Great game that deserves a serious look by every RPG, RTS fan. This game is as close to a perfect physical board game to video game as I've seen, and I have played 90% of all the board game ports. I can't recommend this game enough to at least put on your wishlist to wait for a sale if you don't want to buy the original price.Pros: good overall flow of the game, intuitive AI, the best board game port to dateCons: slight to minimal delay in the UI in the main menu/options screen that may turn off some playersI have this same version in the iOS format and both versions are identical to each other, with the PC exception having better animations overall. The game itself plays great and the computer AI really is impressive with the difference of behaviors each character and how they interact with the board. I have never played the board game, but after 50+ hours on the mobile version and purchasing the PC port I will be one day purchase the physical board game from my local hobby shop. One of my favorite things that was added to the video game is a chance to reroll dice that is called Fate. To me its the best mechanic to the game and in my opinion the most important. The game can be played in multiple ways to achieve the victory. It incorporates player vs player feel but games can be won by solely player vs environment while allying with other players (limited pvp encounters and purposedly avoiding other players on the board). Any fans of fantasy, saturday morning 1980s cartoons, dice rolling, and board games in general will appreciate this.			"

												A digital adaptation of the clasic Talisman boardgame (nostalgic T.T)If you are a hardcore boardgame lover, this is definitively for you. A 1 to 4 players game (I would love they increase the number of players, dunno, somehow). Yeah, some bugs here and there, minor issues if you ask me.Some DLC expansions already released, a lot more to be released.BUT if you are a new generation gamer who cares about graphics and speed up gamelay, then, not for you.My rating: 8/10 "

												Great game, recreates the board nicely, constant updates and content i couldnt be happier.  And being multi-platform now it makes playing my friends even easier.  Not seen any bugs in my games and people that are re-porting gameplay bugs Probably haven't been playing that particular game mechanic correctly in the first place and it has caused some tears, ive played the board games and all there expansions extensively and this game has shed new light on things i have been doing wrong within my own games and has generally made me a better player, ofc it doesnt beat the real board but who these days can spare 4-5 hours with friends needed to get a entire game done, this has really come into its own being something i can play with my friends at a drop of a hat.Top work and doesnt break the bank and can be enjoyed across android, mac, pc, and ios users now.

												Games Workshop released a fantasy board game called Talisman in 1983, for 2-6 players. I have an early second edition of the game from 1985. While I generally prefer games that rely more on skill than chance, this was one game that I’ve always really enjoyed, but often cursed the roll of the dice or a card draw. (The hate part of things relates to how long the game can go on for.)A while back, I received a copy of the digital version of the game. This version appears to have the same “board” as the 2nd edition, but I believe it’s based on Fantasy Flight Games “Revised 4th edition“, since the character and card images are the same. (Also, the expansions match.)For those that haven’t played the game (or don’t remember much) here’s a summary:The board layout is three circular regions – Outer, Middle and Inner. Each player selects a character (randomly) that has different starting stats and special abilities. Strength is used for physical combat, Craft for psychic combat. Players have a number of lives, and a bag of gold. In your turn, you roll a dice (d6) and move that many spaces (locations) around the board. Each location represents a place (such as) – plain, forest, wood, shrine, chapel, graveyard, tavern, village, city. Most locations require the drawing of an Adventure card, others have a dice roll to see what happens. The cards may be an enemy or monster to fight, an object that can be kept, a follower who may assist you, etc. Some may allow you to gain Strength, Craft, Life, or Spells. Combat is 1d6 + Strength (or Craft) + item/follower bonuses vs the same roll for the creature. A win means a trophy, else lose a life. Players build up their characters (increasing stats, buying/finding items, etc) and move towards the centre of the board, hopefully gaining a talisman along the way. In the inner region lies the Crown of Command, which is used to drain the life of all other players in order to win the game.My game box states playing time as “1 Hour plus” and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a game take less than two hours. (Playing the digital version with AI opponents is quicker than with real people, but still takes a while!) This is mostly because of the great amount of time required to build up a character to a level that can enter the Inner region and progress (without dying or being pushed back to middle/outer region). This, and the chance of losing nearly everything with a bad dice roll (or unlucky card draw) is the games biggest down-side. The game play is very much one based on chance. The only skill is in good use of items, spells, and special abilities. There is a lot of variety with characters and cards – it’s also a large board – so every game is very different.The two main “changes” that I’ve noted in the digital edition (compared to 2nd) are the Fate stat (which allows re-rolls, FANTASTIC addition!), and the ability to increase Craft by trading in defeated spirits (psychic combat monsters). In 2nd edition, you could only trade “strength using” monsters. (7 Str points of creatures for +1 character Strength)It’s extremely faithful to the board game. The graphics are very well done, and everything runs smoothly. You can play with 2 to 4 players, with those players being AI run, or actual people. The game speed can be adjusted, various “house rules” can be turned on/off, and it saves games. It’s really nice having the game track all your bonuses, and you can click on any board space to get detail on that location, as well as check what cards (objects and followers) any other player holds. It’s got a tutorial mode and good “help”. Overall, I’m very impressed and I can see myself playing a lot of this over the next month.			"

												All nostalgia about this being a faithful recreation of my favorite childhood board game, this is just plain fun. It's also a lot faster, not to mention cheaper, than tracking down a copy of the orginal game. Even the very rare, very costly expansion sets to the board game are available as DLC for the digital version. Simply put: if you like adventure board games, this is for you. Play by yourself against the AI, online, or even hotseat mode with your friends. *SPOILER* The Prophetess got nerfed in the digital version, which anyone familiar with the origanal game would agree was needed, as she was otherwise game-breakingly overpowered.

												If you are new to Talisman (like myself), you will find that it is an easy game to get into.  I haven't even read the instructions but after playing with others online, I am learning pretty quickly how to play this game.  It's a fun fantasy/strategy board game.  It isn't too complex and it's kind of luck-based. There is a low player-base, but I am always able to find a match without waiting too long.  The servers that people seem to play on are USA and Europe.  Another cool thing about this game is that other people can share their characters with you.  By this I mean that if you don't have the DLC, and the HOST of the game does, then the host of the game is able to share their characters with you and the other players in the game.  Also, if you have a bad internet connection and disconnect from the game, you are able to rejoin the match once you re-open the game. I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale for only $4.49 and it was well worth it.  You should definitely buy this if you are into board games.			"

												This is almost a completely straigh electronic version of the table top game. good points- looks good- the charecter pices look almost like real gaming minis! each time you play through its a different game and each of the different charcters play slightly diferently giving it great replay value. not so good points- it lacks the one thing the real version has. this is social interaction. single player is quite dull with out friends to talk to. playing a multiplayer and chatting over skype made this fun. Otherwise it can get quite boring.			"

												I purchased the game through the Humble Bundle and so far I have been impressed. Online does have some issues. 1 play through online took about 3 hours and we had 3 total disconnects. After each one we were able to reconnect though. The reconnect process really wasn't that bad especailly if everyone is already on Skype, Mumble, etc. I don't want to dive too much into the gameplay as honestly the best method of researching that is YouTube. Anyone interested in the game I would encourage to watch a few lets plays to get the hang of the rules and also to see if this is a game they will be interested in. If you do not have a group of friends to play the game with I would recomend staying away or using Steam or Reddit to find people to play with. The AI leaves much to desire. Anyone who is a fan of board games and have a few friends willing to play with then this game is worth the purchase and with these factors I would give the game a 7/10 in its current form. With more NET improvements and Spell casting changes to make it more intuative I could say my rating going higher.			"

												I just played a couple matches so far against the AI.  The game is enjoyable, but I must admit the end game was quite painful.  I made it to the end then just had to keep hoping to roll a 4-6 to  make the AI lose a life.  I would get him down a couple lives then he would heal back up.  Then I would roll 1-3 a few turns in a row.  Then get him down a life then he heals.....UGH!!!  If the end game was different I would give this 5 stars.  As it is for me it is a 3.5 to 4 star game.  It is probably beter when playing with friends.			"

												I used to play the original Talisman board game with my parents when I was a child, so when I saw that it had been remade as an online-capable computer game, I knew I had to try it.  I got a four-pack, so that I could gift a copy to my parents and sister, and I have to say that it is pretty faithful to the original.  There are some minor glitches, made less minor by the fact that some of them can make it impossible to finish a game (making it necessary to start a new one), but it is a fun, semi-relaxed game to play, and provided a nice trip down memory lane for me.

												Game is a lot of fun, but man the bots are stupid.In one game Dwarf-bot, with an 'axe', 'bag of carrying', 'false grail' and 'shield', decided to make a raft 7 times in a row, only to discard it after each turn because he didn't have room to carry it (sorry to anyone not familiar with the game).Anyone who knows the 'bag of carrying' knows they can conceal extra items in there that don't count towards the max amount of items you can carry. Obviously the bots don't know this. Not to mention the fact that he kept discarding the raft, when he had the choice to discard the shield, bag or axe. The biggest issue is that the bots need to be updated so they know how the 'bag of carrying' works (ofc they won't anyway). A difficulty setting would've been a good idea too.Other then this the game is a lot of fun - for any challenge however I'd suggest getting some friends to play with!			"

												I'm not a fan of Games Workshop.  In fact, I don't like Games Workshop at all.  But this review is not about the company, but about this game.  I played Talisman when it first came out.  When I found out it was on Steam, I was intrigued.  When I picked it up with the Humble Bundle, I was interested in giving it a shot.I enjoy the game.  I enjoy running around the board, gathering power, and making a push for the crown, leaving everyone in my dust.  Yes, the game begins fairly random, but there is a strategy to the game, and if you know what you're doing, the game becomes less and less random as you shape your character into the champion (or horror) you want it to be.Some simple tactics:  1)  Get to the Warlock and try to get the Clockwork Owl as quickly as you can.  This turns your die rolls for movement into something you can control (since you can move your die roll or less after this).  2)  Get to the warlock and get the bag of holding.  Having 8 concealable slots to carry your most precious gear in is a good thing.  3)  Go to the warlock and get the orb of prophesy (or be lucky and draw the magic item which does similar).  This allows you to control your encounters.  Along the way you should be getting magic items or followers to pad out your abilities.  But once you have those three items (or heck, even just the first), you're able to control your fate fairly well, and can make the push to get to the middle of the board and win.The introduction of runestones is an interesting twist, as is having fate points.  Those both help to deter getting hosed early in the game, and I think they're a workable addition.  I plan on picking up the expansions.I give the Digital Edition of Talisman 4/5.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a fun time killer if you have nothing to do for a hour or so.  It's convenient if you just want to relax, play a quick single player game and move onto to other things you need to do that afternoon.  There's plemty of expansions and alot of characters to choose from that keeps it interesting.On the downside, however, the game does have its flaws.    Spells not working when casted/que'd. Picking targets for spells sometimes doesn't work properly or is confusing.     Some cards don't work occasionally like, ""Use this card before another players turn"" where you'll try to use it but nothing happens and you just get a ""dismiss"" option only.   And my personal complaint is the computer player almost always rolls a ""6""  and you'll get ten ""1's"" in a row which can be frustrating.Overall, it's still a fun game to play if you look past the flaws.   Catch it on sale.   Highly recommend getting the expansions (Dungeon, Highlands, etc) for it as well as it adds another level to the game.			"

If I have one complaint it does seem like the dice mechanics might not work that well on a re-roll, too often the same number comes up again on a re-roll or could it be the theory of the bread always fall on the floor with the butter side down.

												Played this game over a free preview weekend, and it was actually addicting.  Aside from the numerous choices of characters to play, each with their own strengths and abilities, the game board itself would become a living part of the game by having characters and effects that would alter the spaces on the board in addition to whatever character or effect was already on that space.  It made for a very unique game that was never the same twice, and became quite addicting.			"

												Games Workshop released a fantasy board game called Talisman in 1983, for 2-6 players. I have an early second edition of the game from 1985. While I generally prefer games that rely more on skill than chance, this was one game that I’ve always really enjoyed, but often cursed the roll of the dice or a card draw. (The hate part of things relates to how long the game can go on for.)A while back, I received a copy of the digital version of the game. This version appears to have the same “board” as the 2nd edition, but I believe it’s based on Fantasy Flight Games “Revised 4th edition“, since the character and card images are the same. (Also, the expansions match.)For those that haven’t played the game (or don’t remember much) here’s a summary:The board layout is three circular regions – Outer, Middle and Inner. Each player selects a character (randomly) that has different starting stats and special abilities. Strength is used for physical combat, Craft for psychic combat. Players have a number of lives, and a bag of gold. In your turn, you roll a dice (d6) and move that many spaces (locations) around the board. Each location represents a place (such as) – plain, forest, wood, shrine, chapel, graveyard, tavern, village, city. Most locations require the drawing of an Adventure card, others have a dice roll to see what happens. The cards may be an enemy or monster to fight, an object that can be kept, a follower who may assist you, etc. Some may allow you to gain Strength, Craft, Life, or Spells. Combat is 1d6 + Strength (or Craft) + item/follower bonuses vs the same roll for the creature. A win means a trophy, else lose a life. Players build up their characters (increasing stats, buying/finding items, etc) and move towards the centre of the board, hopefully gaining a talisman along the way. In the inner region lies the Crown of Command, which is used to drain the life of all other players in order to win the game.My game box states playing time as “1 Hour plus” and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a game take less than two hours. (Playing the digital version with AI opponents is quicker than with real people, but still takes a while!) This is mostly because of the great amount of time required to build up a character to a level that can enter the Inner region and progress (without dying or being pushed back to middle/outer region). This, and the chance of losing nearly everything with a bad dice roll (or unlucky card draw) is the games biggest down-side. The game play is very much one based on chance. The only skill is in good use of items, spells, and special abilities. There is a lot of variety with characters and cards – it’s also a large board – so every game is very different.The two main “changes” that I’ve noted in the digital edition (compared to 2nd) are the Fate stat (which allows re-rolls, FANTASTIC addition!), and the ability to increase Craft by trading in defeated spirits (psychic combat monsters). In 2nd edition, you could only trade “strength using” monsters. (7 Str points of creatures for +1 character Strength)It’s extremely faithful to the board game. The graphics are very well done, and everything runs smoothly. You can play with 2 to 4 players, with those players being AI run, or actual people. The game speed can be adjusted, various “house rules” can be turned on/off, and it saves games. It’s really nice having the game track all your bonuses, and you can click on any board space to get detail on that location, as well as check what cards (objects and followers) any other player holds. It’s got a tutorial mode and good “help”. Overall, I’m very impressed and I can see myself playing a lot of this over the next month.			"

												All nostalgia about this being a faithful recreation of my favorite childhood board game, this is just plain fun. It's also a lot faster, not to mention cheaper, than tracking down a copy of the orginal game. Even the very rare, very costly expansion sets to the board game are available as DLC for the digital version. Simply put: if you like adventure board games, this is for you. Play by yourself against the AI, online, or even hotseat mode with your friends. *SPOILER* The Prophetess got nerfed in the digital version, which anyone familiar with the origanal game would agree was needed, as she was otherwise game-breakingly overpowered.

												If you are new to Talisman (like myself), you will find that it is an easy game to get into.  I haven't even read the instructions but after playing with others online, I am learning pretty quickly how to play this game.  It's a fun fantasy/strategy board game.  It isn't too complex and it's kind of luck-based. There is a low player-base, but I am always able to find a match without waiting too long.  The servers that people seem to play on are USA and Europe.  Another cool thing about this game is that other people can share their characters with you.  By this I mean that if you don't have the DLC, and the HOST of the game does, then the host of the game is able to share their characters with you and the other players in the game.  Also, if you have a bad internet connection and disconnect from the game, you are able to rejoin the match once you re-open the game. I bought this game during the Steam Summer Sale for only $4.49 and it was well worth it.  You should definitely buy this if you are into board games.			"

												This is almost a completely straigh electronic version of the table top game. good points- looks good- the charecter pices look almost like real gaming minis! each time you play through its a different game and each of the different charcters play slightly diferently giving it great replay value. not so good points- it lacks the one thing the real version has. this is social interaction. single player is quite dull with out friends to talk to. playing a multiplayer and chatting over skype made this fun. Otherwise it can get quite boring.			"

To that I say HAHAHA! This is the the game where you take what you are given and use it to your advantage, but it does have much chance. Many people got this for online multiplayer, where there is nothing wrong, but they reported large amounts of crashing in this area of the game. clearly something is wrong with these people's computers. This is a VERY long game, so do take your time while playing.10/10			"

												The game does suffer from some minor issues, those being, a clunky UI, clunky and at times counter intuitive controls, some bugs. but i do feel that this is a great digital version of the board game, i love the board game but rarely can get a group together to play it, so this is here to fill the gap! best part i dont need to finish in one sitting it saves my AI game for me. there are some things i wish it had and that was more house rules support, the main one being i like to occasionally add up to 6 players depending on the night, 4 can be restricting, but 6 is fair and doesnt do that much to affect the game, more then that would be too many, 6 players can get pretty cut throat, especially with the reaper and no respawns in effect. i am very happy i waited for the sale to pick this up as there was much more of the DLC packs avaliable to grab whilst cheap then when i first looked at this when in beta. if you like the board game then you will like this.

												Talisman: Digital Edition is a faithful update to the old school Games-Workshop Talisman board game.  The game is actually based on a newer iteration by Fantasy Flight games however much of the original feel is still there.  The digital implementation of the game features an intuitive interface, crisp artwork, and balance improvements that don’t allow a Chaos Warrior to run rampant across your game board and on top of competing players.  The only real downside is that the AI is not very good and doesn’t try to win the game –however the game plays well in multiplayer and is really a blast.  If you want to play an old school early 1990’s board game online, love games workshop, or just want to turn your buddies into a toad and curb stomp them . . . this game is for you!			"

												I personally like this game and I loved the board game version of it and this is a great version of it other than one major problem. The RNG or random number generator, I was just recently playing and this has happened other times but this one stuck out majorly. The AI I was playing with along with nearly every single creature kept rolling 6's every time. I would go and fight something I have equal craft to and roll a 4, it rolled a 6. I also used my lucky charm from the frostmarch expansion pack that I had to get a 6 against a frost drale. It rolled a 6, the AI that I am playing with is the leprechaun and he has gotten now 7 6's in a row. I believe that the rng might need to be fixed slightly as it is hugely unrealistic as that has an insanely low probability of happening, especially as I have not gotten a 6 this entire time.			"

												An excellent board game from ancient times.  It requires patience and cunning.  You gain strength or craft to become strong enough to fight your way to the crown of command.  If you like a meaty 2 hour plus length of game, then this is for you.  The game can be sped up with various options.  It is enhanced with several expansions.  The full table top board is huge with many new classes and adventure cards.  A classic with years of cred.  I would recommend this game to my friends as well as total strangers.   I can't wait to try online version!			"

If you don't know anything about Talisman, its basically a cross between D&D and Monopoly.  If you like RPG board games, then give this a shot.

												One of the greatest games ever conceived. I've been playing for weeks and have enjoyed most of my time with it, despite only having one other friend that will play this with me. Sadly, he won't anymore.The first game that started that: Within 10 turns death had landed on the last dungeon tile with an AI in control. Targeting my friend that had 6 lives and a talisman, he rolled a 1 on the death. Instant death with no revival.It took him a week to recover from that, I had to egg him on and even let him know I would disable death. He relented and within 10 turns on a Devils' Minion he had to fight a basalisk. Lost, instant death.11/10 because he was the one that bought me and himself the base game with all the DLC. Amazing experience.			"

												Before you fully consider my recommendation, consider the following:-This game is riddled with bugs, everything from annoying to flat out game breaking.-I've had A.I. wait for their timeout before doing their move.-Worse yet, I've had A.I. that STILL won't move after their timeout. This breaks the game and you have no choice but to exit.-A lot of actions don't explain in any way what you need to do.-Once you start casting a spell (even if accidentally) you don't get to change your mine. In real life, you would absolutely get to.-It's too easy to accidentally start casting a spell when you did not intend to.Other than that, this game is extremely fun. ESPECIALLY if you have a friend or two you can play together with while simultanneously skyping.			"

												I would say if you are only planning on playing locally, stick with paper and card. Easier to deal with everything, and you're more invested in interacting rather than just sitting playing on your phone while it's not your turn.If on the otherhand you have friends on steam who you can play online with, go for it. I don't really rely on the players online because you can drop out at any time, but playing an AI/Online game with firends it is a great alternative to the physical game. Get in a Skype/Steam call together an have some fun!			"

												I enjoyed Talisman: Prologue, and this version added the biggest thing it was lacking: MULTIPLAYER. The only downside to this game is that the AI has a tendency to go full retard at times and put itself into an infinite cycle of futility if you're playing against AI opponents (such as wasting turns going into loops of picking up and dropping a pile of items every single turn instead of just ignoring them if it already has an ideal gear set and can't carry any more). But still a fun fantasy hero RPG style board game :-)			"

												A fantasy boardgame turned digital. Very fun with friends, but the UI/engine is a little buggy. Online multiplayer can cause disconnects sometimes, but luckily there's a fast and easy ""retry"" function which automatically remakes the game and starts at the last turn played.Players pick from a pool of characters and take turns traveling around a spiraled board with three regions (four if you have the expansion) where each space on the board has it's own description of an action that affects play. The characters each have their own stats and abilities which makes re-playability very high. It feels a little unbalanced as some characters feel better than others since they can snowball given their unique abilities, where others don't seem to take off until deep into the game. As time in the game progresses players collect monsters as trophies, collect cards, gold, or battle each other to collect stat points. The objective is to get enough stat points to go past the required spaces on the board and get to the center space to claim victory.It's a game of dicerolls, but having more stats or inventory cards will improve your odds by a huge margin. There are weapons that increase your strength or craft, armor that will let you re-roll to save yourself from taking damage, items that give you magic spells, etc... but it still comes down to the luck of the dice. It's very frustrating when you're getting beat down, but very satisfying when you're doing the beating.In short, the game is good fun with friends, but I can't imagine playing it by myself.			"

												Okay, right off the bat, this is an awesome game to play! So much fun to level up your character, gaining strength and craft to fight enemies with. The object of the game is to reach ""the crown of command"" in the center of the board. However this is not so simple. You will have to go on different quests throughout the game to gain an object known as a ""Talisman"" to get the various places on the board. You will need one as you travel from the middle region of the board to the center region. However many things could happen between getting one and getting through to the center region. A player could fight you and kill you. A witch, bear or demon could spawn on you and destroy powerful or useful items you're carrying. The worst? Being turned into a toad. This is where all your items are dropped in the space you have turned into the toad. While playing as a toad, other players can pick up your items. It's a very challenging game and extremely time consuming. The 8 hours i have played.. 6 of them is just one full game of talisman, where unfortunately i did not win! I have the actual board game too and the digital version helped me learn it better as it gives you tutorials on your playthrough. Of course these can be turned off! If you are a fan of fantasy, board games and strategy then this one is definately for you! For what it is, i give it an 8/10. The game itself is excellent, but as i say you need a LOT of time spare if you're wanting to finish a game!			"

												If you like board games then this game is great.  You'll want to get DLC at least to Dungeon to make it more replayable.  You do not need humans to play and the AI isn't that bad, except for their use of spells.  Spells aren't utilized very well by AI.  It will take time to learn the ""When can I cast this system.""  Spells do not have a natural or intuitive system for casting.  Even after 10-15 games you can still not cast them at right times always. Lots of options for which DLC to use each game and what parts of each can be used.  Know games can take 30 minutes to 3 hours to win.  What character you play and what cards you and the others get make a huge difference in the time involved.			"

												Love this game. Love it! I'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG. The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest. I also had spells of one Counterspell, one Random, and one Temporal Warp. I was going to use the Temporal Warp when I finally started making my run to the Crown! I made a huge mistake by going into the Village and not realizing it ditched the Poltergiest! OH NO! Since I had 10 STR and 5 CRA, I decided to make a run for it. The Devil's Minion rolled BADLY on quite a few Crown spells. I luckily made my way all the way to the Crown with 11 STR from figting one monster along the way and cashing some in. So the Devil's Minion had 5 lives, I had 4. But I definitely had the upper hand from a mathematical standpoint. So what does the Devil's Minion do when he fights me, he picks STR!! WHAT IN THE. I was afraid it was going to be a race to 0 to see who could roll luck (he COULDN'T beat me in STR 11 vs 5, but he had a chance in CRA 5 vs 6). So I whittled him down to 1 health, and THEN he finally lets loose with a CRA attack and actually wins. I beat him the next turn.This is what I mean by the AI makes some poor decisions. What should have been a nail-biter, ended up being a big WHA? What is he doing?! Still love the game!!			"

												Although I never played the board game, I can easily attest to the fact that this game brings the worst out in yourself and your friends, which in itself leads to hilarious and memorable moments. That, coupled with the random nature of the game, is in my opinion its greatest strength, as it allows everybody to compete on an even level. The randomness might get frustrating in single player though and I clearly recommend that you band together and buy the four pack, so you have somebody to play with, because the social aspect of the game is half the experience.On the downside, the technical aspect of multiplayer matches does have some hiccups. I have experienced sync issues and game crashes a couple of times, which is aggravating when you are about to wrap up a game session, which easily runs in at about two hours. This shouldn’t keep you from buying the game if you have some friends around to play it with though.			"

												Almost identcal to playing the board game with a few major exceptions. the most important being speed. A real life Talisman game can usually take up 6hrs. With the turn speed for the PC ramped up to 10 I finished my first game in 3hrs.  This is not a problem as playing well in games causes you to level up unlocking new stuff. Quite what I'm not yet sure as it will take more than one game to level up. The other major difference is price. A full set of Talisman with the expnasion will srt you back nearly £100 for the physical version.I do love my physichal set and this does lack the atmosphere of having some like minded mates round for a good boardgames session. But as an introduction to the game or as a way of killing the hours over the summer while your mates are on holiday this is highly recomended. Also if you have friends who play but dont live locally it is also possible to set up an online game over the web.			"

												Love this game. Love it! I'm a board game/TTRPG junkie (multi-time Gen Con attendee). There's a ton of content here, and the game is fun and challenging at the same time. It's nice to be able to just jump into the digital edition without setup, and even with some AI that's not TOO bad. It does make a few boneheaded mistakes though.For instance I usually play with random characters against 3 AI. I had the Troll. I killed one of the other characters and forgot to loot ALL the items (my own fault, hit the button to quick) and the Devil's Minion CPU player swooped in and grabbed it all including the follower that reduces the Peril of Plane's requirements by 1 die. OMG. The Devil's Minion made to the the Crown of Command, because he made it there so early he only had 5 STR and 6 CRA. I got EXTREMELY lucky and grabbed the poltergiest as a follower on the right side of the outer region of the board. Along there was ""The healer with 2 free heals "" (thankfully I got turned to Good along the way!) and ""The Shrine"", next to them was the Forest. So since I could only move one space it was great that I could keep moving back and forth between these spaces healing myself and trying to bump up my craft at the Forest.

This game was fun, everyone had a chance to be in the lead, and there was never a point where I felt I wanted to give up.  The balance, interface, and pacing are all very much improved on what was origionally implemented allowing for smoother flow and more fun for all players.  The AI still gives me a lot of trouble, but i'm not complaining as it feels less like a win engine now			"

												If you're a fan of boardgames then this is great. It has a lot of different characters and offers quite a lot of gameplay variety, especially if you have the expansion packs. Best to buy the season pass on sale.Gameplay wise, you pick a character, travel around the map battling monsters and completing quests in order to increase your character's strength or craft (magic) score. Eventually, you'll be able to move into the inner region to reach the crown of command, where, you might complete the generic victory condition or a special victory condition (if you have this feature turned on).It's fun, especially with friends. It does take awhile to play though, and all the extra content might seem a bit jarring. 7/10			"

												4 hours in to a game, one turn away from winning, and you get pulled out of the middle and robbed. 3 hours in to a game and your friend turns you in to a frog and kills you. 2 hours in and you're on your 4th character because nothing will go right. You get Talisman'd a lot in this game... why would anyone want to play this? Cause its a heck of a lot of fun. You spend the game raising your strength and craft, the two stats you use to fight battles. Talisman is one big journey to level your character up enough to go challenge whatever is in the middle of the board. Sometimes you might have to fight a boss to win the game, other times you might have to steal everyone's items, or you might even vote to see if the persons worthy. It's the mix of endings, cards, and characters that make the game interesting.I highly recommend playing with actual people, while the computer has decent decision making skills it is far from perfect.

												If you enjoyed playing the Talisman Board Game in real life and really want to play it again: get this game!Otherwise, do not!This is a pretty good emulation of the board game. HOWEVER, it does suffer from slowness and could really use a few settings to quicken up the game. Additionally there are some problems with crashing every once in a while.If the developers are listening please implement a way to skip through dice rolls in which there is no way for there is no way to win or lose. For example, if my roll of one dice +5, resulted in an 10, then the dice roll of the other person is just a dice roll +2 then there is no need for that dice roll to be rolled...Bottom line, good emulation of game, but suffers from some serious slowness and crashing. Only get if you want to enjoy some Talisman nostalgia.			"

												Talisman, with all the expansion content enabled, is a very fun game with an expansive, adventurous feel that supports a variety of diverse play styles.  Without the expansion content enabled, it's a much more straightforward and less interesting experience.  The UI could also benefit from some adjustments, as it's sometimes difficult to click spells before the game moves past the point where they're legal to play, and at times you're forced to make a decision without the ability to click around to examine details of the game state... issues which can both be largely mitigated by familiarity and careful attentiveness, but which will hopefully be remedied in the future.All of this together makes for a game that's a lot of fun with a bit of investment, but which does not make a good first impression.  I almost asked for a refund, but I'm very glad I didn't.			"

												This is a great game, I never heard of Talisman until i saw my friends playing the steam version, and I now play it almost once a week if not more with them. I would reccommend this game to anyone who just wants to have a good time with friends, but if youre looking for good gameplay on your own... unless you really just want some nostalgia This game isn't for you.Pros---------------Good time waster with friends-nostalgic for you long time Talisman players-interesting interactions-you can laugh at the horrible AICons---------------Horribly buggy at times... many of which are game breaking (for example followers or spells that let you choose what your reroll will be will often reroll your second dice if you have 2 to choose from, or if you visit a shop and dont have enough money for an item the game just doesnt know what to do and breaks)-purely based on RNG very few times is decision making or skill going to win you the game because 90% of this game is pure luck unless you get some crazy powerful items from some of the expansions (cough cough clockwork owl) or if you get characters that can see the top of the deck like sage or spy.-kinda already stated as a pro but the AI is horrible, some might see that as a good thing because they can give you good items for bad ones or engage in battles they clearly cant win or dont use some items because they forget to... but otherwise its kinda stupid-DLC for the game can be pretty pricey, if you buy the game and all expansions (not including the standalone characters) currently available it will go for roughly $45 or you can make it $75 and buy the season pass which includes all current and future DLC except one that was sold for charity.TL;DR: The game is great to hang out with friends especially if you cant get together im person easily (or at all) But if you want everything its gonna be quite the money drop, the game is also horribly buggy and seems to lack some quality of life features like cancel buttons for most actions (shopping or spell casting for example) but if you can get past the bugs and horrible AI, then its a good time with your friends guarenteed!

												This is an Excellent game, I searched this one out after hearing about the game, that originally was played as a table top now recreated as a digital board game. If you played D&D True RPG games from the 60s 70s and 80s then you know about how to use your imagination. If you have an imagination this is a dream to play! This game design wants you to think to learn about its world and believe.. Another great aspect of Talisman Digital is that through game play with AI (computer) the players can learn the rules of the game, this game is like Jumanji the movie that starred Robin Williams, it you imagine your in the fields with a thieif and he is trying to steal your gold or take a life and if your lucky an item from your inventory, it might just feel more real too you than you think.

												Highly Addictive and deceivingly simple. It might take you a little while to get the hang of all the mechanics of the game, especially if you jump into the expansions early, but it's very simple to pick up after a game or two and it will treat you to countless hours of fun with multiple ending goal possibilities as well as different ways to achieve it.The only complaint I may have is that it may sometimes feel too random due to dice rng, but if it didn't have some element of luck then it wouldn't be a board game :).

Granted, it can be a big tricky to get into if you haven't played it before - the game lacks (as far as I know) a tutorial - because you are thrown straight into the action when you first play.Then again, it's not rocket sciense so you will quickly get the hang of it after a few bitter sweet defeats against the super-fast AI or your gloatuing friends. Just follow the options and, ofc, read the cards carefully and you will be takin' that Talisman home soon!twitch.tv/beergrim "

												A great way to kill up to six hours! A faithful representation of the classic board game, even better if you've actually played the real game (tiny cards hard to read). The automation of moves etc in the Digital Edition allows you to sit back and enjoy the role-play aspect, or focus more on long term strategy, than you would be able to managing lots of tiny pieces and 5 friends! This is a great rainy day couch game, invite a few friends, set up the snacks lay some waste with the Black Witch! (my personal favorite)9/10 Would kill friends for fun and bragging rights again.

												I'm sure that this is a really good game 73% of players have said so plus, I would love to pick up some of the DLC that are on sale this week, I just wish I could play it. Unfortunately, it will only run for about 3- 5 turns then it freezes not the whole PC just the game and I have to ctrl-alt-del out. I am well in excess of the recommended PC specs plus, have tried all the available fixes on the forums here and elsewhere and asked many questions.I reported the problem to Nomad Games however, as there is no crash report generated when it freezes they have very little to work on except my PC specs and my list of tried but failed fixes.Apparently I have logged 2.4 hours play, this is NOT actual play but running the program just to try out various ""fixes"" .I have tried every fix I can find on line plus, turning off background process or varying game play combinations that I can think of that could be causing the problem, add my research time to find an answer and I must have spent at least 5 hours on this game without actually playing it.Perhaps with the soon expected patch it will finally work for me.I'm very disappointed so far, especially as I will miss out on the current DLC sale, the only consolation for me is that I bought the base game during a previous sale.Why a thumbs up? Well, I can't really not recommend or criticize it because I haven't played it yet plus, the freezing problem seems to be a very rare occurrence for the majority and it would appear that most of those who had the problem found on line answers that unfortunately did not work for me.I will revise this review if I ever get this game to run.UPDATEI have no idea what has changed but, the game has been running without problems for over an hour. I'm still somewhat confused over parts of the gameplay although the tutorial has helped. I guess i'll just have to read the game manual again as well.It looks like this is going to be a fun game based on my experience so far with an understanding of gameplay around say 75% I would give the game at least 7 out of 10 andf I have the feeling that after more playing that score will increase.I originally bought this as a precursor to buying the board game if I enjoyed it and I have a strong feeling that I will be buying the board game as well.

												Very happy to have this game on pc.  I still own 2 versions of the original board game which I have played countless times.  As such I can confirm the game rules are superbly accurate to the original, making this game a must for all Talisman fans.On occasion, it can be difficult to use an ability or specific card during your turn (within the time limit given) as the game will not remind or encourage you to check your inventory lists, so you need to pay attention.This is a rare occurance, however, dependant on character chosen rather than any particular oversight due to the game design.  There are plenty of new characters to purchase as well as three of the original six expansion packs already released.  Dice roll for me is depressingly unlucky (just as it always was for my board games) so i find the gameplay quite difficult.  Animations are colourful and the addition of runestones and customisable rules keeps the game interesting. You can even save your progress on multiple games and come back to them when you want.I highly recommend this game already and will love it even more when the Timescape expansion is added.			"

												If you want a games night with a few of your friends this is the game for you. If you are looking for a solo experience this game is probably not for you.To get the most out of it i would recommend changing the game from focusing on the Crown of Command, to killing the Lord of Darkness, which will require some DLC, but it is worth it. When the end game is about the Crown of Command it can get very tedious to sit through an entire game in my opinion.Never trust the mountain goat.			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game. especially with the season pass. there are so many more characters and new stuff added in the season pass that it adds almost unlimited replayability. even just the base game has a ton of content to be worth the $15. it takes them a while to put out new DLC in the season pass, but by now, almost all of it has been released. i don't mind how long it takes them to update the game and add the new content because the content that gets added is always worth the wait. tons of endings, tons of ways to play. it's got local multiplayer so you can play with anyone who might be in the room. plus they recently increased the maximum number of players from 4 to 6. depending on what endings you choose and/or how you decide to play the game (what features/options you decide to turn off) can affect the length of the game. some games can be over in less than half an hour and others can take 3 or 4 hours. i've played almost all the characters at this point and i have to say that i'm impressed that they can really change the way you play the game. there's a monk who can add his craft to his strength but can't use weapons. there's a minstrel who can tame animals and add their strength to his. there's a warrior who can use 2 weapons instead of just one. every character feels unique and changes the way you might play the game. it's hard to describe what a typical game will contain as the large number of items, enemies, spells, and characters make every game different. honestly, the biggest problem i have with this game is the dice rolling. all the dice rolls are predetermined the moment you start up the game. for example, if it's your turn and you roll two dice and one is a 4 and one is a 2, then you move and land on a space and draw a monster from the deck and roll a 5 and the monster rolls a 3-then you quit the game and start it up again but just roll 1 dice or use an item/spell to move and get a different monster, all the dice rolls you just had will play out in that exact order. if you get that 4, you'll roll a 2 in the monster battle and the monster will roll a 5 and if you use a fate to reroll, you'll get that 3. it essentially allows you to know the future and what numbers your enemies will get on their turns. i don't know if they can, but i hope they can fix it.Edit:i think what draws me to this game the most is the fact that you can play with the same character against the same enemy characters time and time again and every single game will play out differently. sure, you might win every time, but what you do along the way will be different every time regardless of what characters are in the game.

												tl;dr I didn't like it.Pre-Disclaimer: Please don't comment to tell me I'm wrong, refer to the disclaimer (next).Disclaimer: I'm sure I'll get somewhere > 10% ""people thought this was helpful"" with me for this review... but I have to post it anyways. Reviews are people's opinions. And like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, everyone's got one and they're all♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways. So here I go...I could not get into this game at all. I've never played the board game or heard of the franchise until I started playing. The pop up rules and tips and hints, etc go on and on and on. They do almost nothing to actually help you play the game, so much as they just blather on about this and that and so on and so forth.. kinda like my review..Anyways. the graphics are a board game that's poorly drawn, with hard to see squares (but you figure out that everything is a square, and there is no point in them anyways). The characters are poorly drawn. The animations are basically cards flipping and moving around on the screen and a die (or sometimes two dice) rolling. So that's about a 2/10.The audio consists of fanfare queues and other nonsensical sounds that notify you that something is happening even though nothing really is.. and you get to hear the sound of a die rolling a lot. If I wanted to hear dice rolling a lot I'd sit at my table, alone and roll real dice. so sound is a 1/10.The gameplay is as I stated above, and it's kinda glitchy. I played with AI opponents and they'd get a card, then roll a die or two and then they're in battle, then they roll more die, then draw a card, etc. then it would be my turn and I'd roll a die, land on a square and then end turn. I don't think that's a glitch but when you play every round and each AI is doing 3-4 actions and you get 1 (or maybe 2 if you're really lucky)... it just feels off and/or unfair. Then when you look at turns and actions in general, they're rather uninspired and not fun. there's also no free will in the game (other than an option or two every couple turns) so you could literally set up the game to play 4 AI players and no user and get the same amount of enjoyment from it. Plus it's a luck based game so no matter what you choose, almost nothing is affected. so gameplay is a 0/10. So totaling up our 30 point score here, the game gets a 3. out of 30. 10%.. 1/10. F-------. Yeah this game wasn't for me. Feel free to mark this as not helpful. I've heard that's the ""I disagree"" button, right? whatever.			"

												I am a User Interface Designer by trade. I build and judge interfaces for a living. This game has the worst Interface I have EVER seen up to this date. Im shocked. Im problably gonna cry myself into sleep this night. Its a very literal adaption from a table top game. Unfortunely they did not manage to automate a lot of the nonsense - you actually have to click a button to end your turn, despite the fact that you simply cannot do anything else. Practically every interaction in this game is VERY badly designed. Do not buy this. Its that bad, yes.			"

												Note: This review is subject to change when/if the developers get off their asses and create a stable release schedule.7 Months on, season pass has not been updated.Until the developers get into a proper release schedule, this review will be negative. I love the game itself, however having bought the season pass and expecting releases as promised, they have essentially abandoned this version of the game to focus on ""Horus Heresy"" and their other versions.The next DLC at time of writing should have taken 1-2 months maximum, adding a tiny section and very little else to the board (No new cards, characters, anything other than a new ending) So far it has taken 6-7 months.

												The company is dishonest. Many players bought the seasons pass because its said to contain all future dlcs of the game. One day, they edited the claim and added an optional shaman char and we were told to buy it for charity and its not included in season pass. What happens to all future dlcs?Here the original terms https://web.archive.org/web/20140111132045/http://store.steampowered.com/app/258817/The new terms have changed to chargeable future dlcs. The game is ok, art is beautiful, but controls not fluid. Have to wait for buttons animation to appear everytime u select something. Not responsive due to bad UI and slow loading animations. Makes the game very slow. No controller support.UI designed for mobile platforms.Dice rolls random but are pre seeded.			"

												Game is lots of fun, but absurdly overpriced. The developers took someone else's idea created a buggy digital version of it then jacked up the prices, even higher than a Triple AAA title game release. Buying the base game for the actual worth of the game at 5$ is okay(75% sale). Unfortunately due to the ridiculous amount of DLC the game requires now you will be paying 71$+, THATS ON 50% SALE and only for DLC. Also to make sure that you dont get a good deal, they don't bundle the DLC in hopes to force you to pay more for a season pass.  For the price of the full game, you can buy several games that are top rated and came out within the last year. Not worth it IMO until the people who made this game get off their greedy high horse and just make the game affordable. It is a digital boardgame, not some next gen game with a new engine that needs an amazing PC to play. "

												Loved the Boardgame, hate the incompetent QA on this computer game though.  The UI bugs break the rules of the game.Lots of games have a few bugs here and there.  And there are some bugs that are only slightly annoying - or make you have to perform workarounds - but after just 2 days I'm encountering bugs in *THIS* game that actually cause the game to cheat the player out of their win.  Not in the usual sense, but in the sense that the user interface breaks and fails to let you take the actions the rules say you're supposed to be able to take.For 2 whole months there was a longstanding bug that if any AI player tries to cast the Weakness spell, the UI freezes and gets caught in a loop unable to continue the game so you have to start a new game.  And if you have the Weakness spell in the deck, and are playing against 3 AI players, then the chance of this happening at some point during the game is actually pretty high.  They had this problem reported for over 2 months and didn't fix it until just yesterday.So now I try again.  And run into another rules-cheating bug that stole my shot at winning the game away.  The HERMIT (the guy who gives a talisman to the first player to land on him) appeared in the Plain of Peril.  I open the Portal of Power, which puts me on the Plain of Peril where I'm planning to interact with the Hermit and get that talisman (a necessary item to be allowed to win the game), and the user interface doesn't have a provision for how to let you interact with cards on that space - it doesn't let you.  So the hermit is effectively a dead card when it appears there, which is definitely not how it's supposed to work.  By this point in the game other means of getting talismans were too far away and I wasn't going to be able to get one in time before another AI player would win.  Had I known the game was lying when it said the HERMIT would give a talisman to the first player who landed there, I might have tried a different tactic.  As it was, in this game it was too late.The game was basicaly too buggy and not ready for release yet. "

												Let me say that any faithful copy of an old board game wins my immediate approval.  Tailisman is a faithful copy of the original and is a lot of good clean fun and very retro.  I recommend it to anyone that likes munckin and games workshop.I have issuse with this title for two reasons 1) PriceThis game is overpriced as all hell.  It's an old game with a niche audience, but remastering it should not entail an 80$ item.  If you are going to buy this game, then wait for a very favorable sale.  The DLC is also priced in such a way that it should never be purchased by anyone.2)AI I wasn't able to get my friends together for games and enemy AI is quite poor.			"

												What a pointless game. I've won this game nearly every time I played and I never left with a feeling of satisfaction. The interface of this game is atrocious. You can never make moves efficiently and half the time it is not clear how to use the cards you possess. And pray to the gods that you or your opponents never lose connection temporarily. The worst case scenario- the games takes a dump and everything goes to hell; the best case scenario- the atrocious AI takes over and immediate proceeds to ram as many items as it can into its own eyeballs in an attempt to impress the other players with its edgy suicide performance art. Really this is a terrible video game implementation of a terrible board game. I've yet to play a game that lasted less than 90min and most have lasted at least 3hrs. It takes no skill to win and the game frequently misinterprets spells or just plain bugs out and hamstrings the front-runner. All games tend toward every player colluding to ensure a swift end to the experience. How can anyone love such an RNG heavy, tedious piece of garbage. Even if you want a long-form RPG-style board game experience (and why would you) there are so  many better ones. Buy this game if you are a masochist. Buy this game for your friends if you are human trash.			"

												This is a near perfect recreation of one of my favorite board games ever. I used to play this game all the time IRL, and I LOVE it, but now that a lot of my RL friends have moved away, this allows us all to keep in touch and still play games together.The game's not for everyone, it's god a heafty dose of luck involved in winning, and sometimes the game can be downright cruel. But it's epic, it's involved, it's got plenty of strategy, and absolutely boatloads of replayability. And the online matchmaking seems to be pretty stable most of the time (only ever had an issue just once).So yeah, for 74.98, you're getting every expansion for the game ever (with the exception of the Shaman Character, who's 1.99 and supports charity with purchase), which is a stellar deal considering each expansion is between 24.99 and 39.99 in real life and the base game is 49.99 if I'm not mistaken. And if you can get it on a sale, hell, even better! :D Totally worth the asking price, great game, can't recommend it enough! :D			"

												A neat digital rendition of a Talisman tabletop game. Unlike the ""prologue"" version, which is oriented towards the single-player experience, this one is primarily multiplayer, local or online.In case you have never played the tabletop version, this game is somewhat like an RPG Monopoly. Dice-based, with some strategic decision making, but with few of those qualities that most gamers look for.Not much of a depth to it, but the replay value is quite high. The rules are rather customisable and you may finish a run rather quickly.The game does have occasional bugs (some spells can't be thrown and there are problems with Steam overlay compatibility in Win 7), but seeing as it was published recently, I expect the flaws to be ironed out rather soon.While this is not going to be anyone's GOTY (you should get it during a sale or in a bundle), I recommend it for those chillout evenings with your family and friends.

Players lose 9 out of 10 with things like 'Only way to lose is roll a 1 and the computer a 6' occuring several times in a row...re-reroll get another 1.   It is difficult against monsters in an all-human player game, nearly impossible if NPC players are added in...they are just 'lucky' beyond probability like the monsters.  "

How lame is that?Excellent adaptation of the board game Talisman... even the lengthy part is implemented (games tends to take forever, mainly due to animations (which you should be able to turn off).I still bought the game even though it long... it's a classic board game afterall!Buy it if you liked it in the past as a board game, saves lots of time compared to the board game even though it is still long.You save at least a 100$ if you buy it as a video game instead of a board game! :)			"

												What a worthless, drooling mess of a game.  The interface is incredibly clunky-- often it's confusing or outright lies about what will happen (cancel, dismiss, buying items, etc).  It was never clear how to use certain abilities and we often lost battles because it wouldn't explain how things would add up once we entered combat (we never figured it out).  It frequently disconnected one player and kept reconnecting him as the wrong player before kicking him again; the CPU sold off his items while he tried to get back in.For the 4.5 hours we spent playing, it was a long slog of fighting the interface for not a lot of fun.  Stick with the physical board game, it's actually functional.			"

The artwork is kinda nice but in the world of card games it's really average at best to be honest.  Very nice drag-able window for resizing to your taste, and runs well. Too bad the game is entirely based off luck, which means -you will AlwaysGET ♥♥♥♥EDevery time.not worth the frustration "

												What a worthless, drooling mess of a game.  The interface is incredibly clunky-- often it's confusing or outright lies about what will happen (cancel, dismiss, buying items, etc).  It was never clear how to use certain abilities and we often lost battles because it wouldn't explain how things would add up once we entered combat (we never figured it out).  It frequently disconnected one player and kept reconnecting him as the wrong player before kicking him again; the CPU sold off his items while he tried to get back in.For the 4.5 hours we spent playing, it was a long slog of fighting the interface for not a lot of fun.  Stick with the physical board game, it's actually functional.			"

												great game.  this game is one of the best gaming buys i have ever done.  its a blast when your winning and a blast when your just getting smashed on. this game has me giggling like a little girl at times while playing due to how bad things can go wrong for the players.i could go on and on about why this game is great but just read into it if interested and u will see why!   my opinion is based on mainly playing against other players. if you plan to only play by yourself you may want to wait till u can get some friends to get the game also  but its pretty easy to find people to play with by using forums so if your interested in this game and none of your friends plan on getting you can still make pals to play with.

												The board game is fun, but takes forever.  Even though you don't have to set up and fiddle with small pieces, this video game also takes forever.  The UI is horrible.  It's always slow or unresponsive, and often is buggy or just doesn't work right.  It takes away most of the fun.  It's not worth it.  It's that bad.  Don't get this, get the board game.			"

												I hate Games Workshop mora and more every day. Talisman is literally roll, go to space, see what happens. Certain characters are clearly better than others, and they try to suck you dry with all of this downloadable content. Stay away from anything that has the Games Workshop logo on it unless you enjoy throwing your money away on plastic pieces or waves of DLC.			"

												The random nature of the game is part of its charm. You roll the dice and craziness ensues. Simple, fun, with a little bit of strategy and cost/benefit analysis. Unfortunately, I can't recommend a purchase of the game in its current state.Multiplayer has regular crashing issues. As far as I'm concerned, the only reason to purchase the game is for the multiplayer aspect. So basically the game is unplayable for me in the state that it is in.			"

												Talisman is definitely an acquired taste. A lot of people will find the random element very off-putting. People who enjoy this game have learned to work around this, and take advantage of their characters abilities in order to find a measure of success and enjoyment while playing.Talisman can be a long game, and it can be a very short game. The expansions make the game play more interesting, and challenging.For the price, I'd recommend anyone who enjoys table top gaming to pick this up.			"

												Talisman: Digital Edition!  Where do I begin!  Great if you're actually playing another game and really don't care whats happening.  An interesting experiment into randomness awaits you - the player and also a very long climb up the levelling tree, which would be much more exciting if it was exponential rather than linear because then it would drag you in (unless it is expontential and it takes 3 games for your first minor upgrade that has the same effect as a horde rolling its eyes at an oncoming avalanche of over-excitable honeybees.  Bare Pass unless you don't even have the boardgame and want it cheaper and with flashy lights.			"

It'll take some time still and there is a bit of a learning curve with the digital interface (how cards work, when in the turn order they should be used, etc.) but thats hardly a problem. AI is totally trash of course, I couldnt imagine how they could even program a 'good' AI for this game anyway. I got it to play with other people so not a problem for me. Get this and come play with me! BEST part of the game, if any player or host has any expansion, it opens it for all. Very mindful and generous of the publisher.			"

												This game is fun, but only if you have the correct mindset: sit back in your chair and relax, maybe pop a beer and most of all, play with your friends and socialize. The randomness makes it really hard to have control of the game and it can be infuriating to spend half an hour to try to move into a specific space that is necessary in order to move forward towards winning the game. Another thing to keep in mind is that a single game takes several hours to complete.The game gets pretty dull already after one game and I really recommend that you invest in some DLC in order to make it more interesting. A good starting point is to buy the Highlands expansion and The Dungeon Expansion and if you want to live dangeroulsy: the Reaper expansion.  If you want to shorten the game length (and don't want to grind) it might be a good idea to buy the Runestone deck. I've never tried any of the DLC that modifies the victory condition, so keep that in mind if you listen to my recommendations.I've played the tabletop version of this game and have about 10 hours of in game time divided on two Steam accounts at the time of writing this review. Now to the implementation: the game is extremely buggy. You can play  a whole game without issues, but it gets really irritating when the bugs appear. All cards don't work as they should and during my last game we had to restart it twice because we were unable to do any actions. The AI is stupid and I don't recommend this game if you plan to play it alone offline.So do I recommend this game? Although it's glitchy it's not unplayable. It's fun with the right people and it's an OK way to waste some time, but it's really not for everyone. So yes, if you are OK with all the downsides I stated I think that it's a good buy!			"

												Talisman is a faithful recreation of the board game.  I've only gotten to play against AI opponents which currently need to be bit more aggressive, but otherwise keep the game interesting enough to allow solo play.The devs are active and working on bringing new content while weighing suggestions from players.

He's dancing back and forth between the ruins and the castle so he heals to full for free every other turn. I can't leave the Crown. He won't stop the pattern. I close the game.			"

												The game simulates tabletop experience pretty well and makes stuff easier by not having to check rulebooke every 2 minutes. But it's bugged as hell and has connectivity issues, and there's not a lot of things in this world that are more infuriating than getting disconnected from a 3h long session you were winning.			"

												It's probably the most underrated party game of 2014. Precurser to Warhammer, this game is so blatantly fun that it's impossible to not crack a smile as you play. If you truly want to rip and tear in this game so hard that the game just autokills for you try out the Troll. Fantastic starter class to make all of your friends huddle up in a corner crying as you lay the smackdown on them.			"

												Roll and move now on a PC.Talisman: Digital edition is a PC implementation of tabletop board game Talisman. In it you will take a role of one of many adventures and embark on an adventure. Roll dice to move, pick a direction and deal with the consequences. Many characters have special powers that you can utilize in one way or another to make achieving your goals a bit quicker. Talisman came out a long time and as many old games it has it’s share of issues that modern board games have learned to deal with. However like old games it also has a big fan base. Talisman: Digital edition is for better or worse a faithful representation of the board game. But as digital board games go it is quite well done. You are able to save your progress without occupying a whole table. You can play with your friends that are spread across the globe. And you can play by yourself if you don’t have any friends to play it. If you buy season pass that gives you access to all the dlc, of which Talisman has many, it will save you quite a bit of shelf space as well. Most of the issues with Talisman: Digital edition come inherited from the board game. That means it can take forever to finish a game and is quite unbalanced and a lot depends on a roll of a die. Added to that are a few AI issues where computer controlled players can get stuck in a loop of selling and buying swords or make actions that are not quite optimal. Dad rating: FineYou can save only on your turn. But you can pause the game during computer opponent turn.Some of the art on some cards can be a bit scary but it’s always static images that you could see in a book or a board game.Talisman is not my favorite board game. But I do like board games and it’s good to see some of them cross over to PC world. With digital implementation of board games they usually fall short because playing with physical components is so much better. In Talisman: Digital edition a lot of the hassle of playing with real board game is removed and that’s why I recommend it.			"

												Game is basically dead, rolls are all predetermined and only spells like time steal change who the game will favor. I have played enough to see the pattern by now and the game will favor one character at random from the start. The devs have opted to go with a predetermined dice sytem instead of RNG and that really kills the gameplay.If you want to play talisman play the original board game and not the digital version as this game is balanced when you do not enable every expansion all at the same time and is a good game at its core. It is the terrible progaramming that ruins it.			"

Worst board game I've ever playedI've played dozens of, if not over one hundred board and card games in my life. It's my favorite hobby when I can gather friends. Most of my income comes from tabletop games as well. Still, this is by far the most broken, dumb, and luck-dependent game I've ever played, not to mention it has player elimination in the late game, which might stretch for hours and hours and hours.I had heard about Talisman before, but never got the chance to play it. I ended up getting it on Steam recently to play it later. Also, after reading good reviews and trying the solo mode (the other app), I thought: ""It looks dense, but nice after you get used to it"". I even decided to get the Season Pass during last summer sales--oh, how I regret...Indeed Talisman gets slightly better overtime, after you get used to it. But in the end, it's a bad game, made worse in every aspect I could find. I ended up playing one match with a friend plus 2 AI's. One of them (Martyr) started off nicely, them the other AI (Assassin) and I (Sorceress) started catching up, until the Assassin made it to the end, trying to kill us off. Martyr was really close, but she got really, really bad rolls, despite she had built up pretty well, and she was the first to be elimnated, despite having dominated the entire game. My friend was next. Then, I spent DOZENS of turns surviving the Assassins attacks, not being able to reach him in any way. I couldn't get in because there were no amulets available, and I couldn't drop my quest (to get another one), which was to hurt another character, in order to maybe get a Talisman, because the only character in the game was out of reach. So I quit the game with 6 life, because I was tired of just surviving, not being able to do anything against it.The only pro in this game was getting a friend to laugh at it together, because Talisman is just ridiculous with all the luck-fest (and those who deny it have either been away from better, modern, and more balanced board games, or are just blind fans.... or both). The cons: too much luck (you roll dice for EVERYTHING), INSANELY slow, even with AI on top speed, broken mechanics, very unbalanced, takes way too long (almost 2 hours had gone by when it felt like the game was finally starting)... Not to mention broken achievements on top of that.To sum it all up, stay as far away from it as possible! Go buy an actual board game to play with friends. Or pick ANY OTHER board or card game on Steam, because you have a very, VERY high chance (I'd almost bet on 100%) of getting something better.			"

												 this is a good game it sticks to the board game, but it needs loads of work yet to be a great game, The only trouble being that because there is so many different items and spells that you can use that have unique rules. there tends to be a lot of bugs. i don't think i've played one full game through without spotting a bug or an error, This game needs some serious work to get rid of them all and get it working right. It can be really annoying when you think your in a winning position with a spell you've got and you cast it and it either doesn;t work as intended or doesn't work at all. Or what as happened to me several times it crashes the game!!! very annoying when your typical game lasts a few hours and can be ruined at anytime. You find yourself not wanting to use spells and items, which goes against everything that is enjoyable about the board game. Its a shame i think the game developers should concentrate more on getting everything working right than releasing new expansions that just add to the frustration.			"

												All beautiful and good as other positive reviews say.BUT the AI cheats: it rolls almost always a number that have a good effect or to move to a positive card on table.AND on my first (and only, at the moment) game I lost having failed the Command Spell 9 times in a row.I calculated the odds being less than 0.00002%.I don't believe that this wasn't cheated by computer.Look at this... I was trying to replicate the same result I got in game.https://www.random.org/dice/?num=9I wasn't able to reproduce the same result of all dice being 1-3Try yourself. If you are lucky enough you can succeed, but just try 100 times and see how many times it will happen.My suspect is almost a certainty: the rolls are not equiprobable in game.Maybe it is just a BAD random number generator, nontheless it is not fair.

I've only played as the prophetess - her discard ability fails to work correctly if you draw more than 1 card at a time... How pointless to have a game that cant even follow its own stated rules!?!They've also made it so all face up cards in players' inventory are hidden but can be seen if the game is paused???			"

												A pretty simple and straightforward, yet classic board game about choosing whether to go right or left - and that statement really isn't that far from the truth. I don't mind it myself because it can be really enjoyable to play with your friends and in my opinion that's what's most important about these type of games.But when you're making a video game adaptation of a board game, you have to somehow compensate for the lack of physical interaction between the players and the social part of it - by making the game experience much smoother, faster, more manageable (simplifying the things that the players have to do mechanically - taking away all of the mess with tokens and cards etc.) and approachable.And this is the standard that I expect from every board game adaptation like this - this is something that is pretty much must be if there's any point in hoping that one would play it longer than 2 game sessions.And this is where this title fails - the UI is really, really clunky, a lot of interactions seem not to work as expected; not to mention some pretty annoying bugs that we've tackled very early on into the game. These are the basic things that the game should provide, and while I find the existence of bots really helpful (when someone suddenly has to go somewhere or just got really tired of the game, he can leave without spoiling the fun for everyone), this is not really enough to compensate for the rest of the issues this game has.The game itself is quite fun, as I said, but the board game original is the one that should be praised - the digital edition is very mediocre and is, as it seems to be, a superficial, hastily made, badly playtested piece of programming crap, and for that, thumbs down.

That is not the gamers fault now I like playing hey leave me alone I am doing my own thing I am quiet now I understand that is what gets me in other games but this game there should be a little more leaway but It just shoves it in your face then there is the fact that the AI in this interface never really changes up it's moves it some how always knows whats best which I find highly insulting because even if one them just gets screwed over they find a way to screw you over to it is fun at time but not nearly as much it is frustrating			"

												I own every expansion for the physical version of talisman and am sorely dissapointed with the digital version.  The game is a buggy cash grab.  Crashing randomly and not giving you achievements.   Only a few of the actual expansions from the physical game have been made available with the developers deciding to opt for making individual characters(which i have been told now by someone with access to the dev build were just reworked characters that didn't make it into the original games that were just rebalanced which is even LAZIER than if they had created them from scratch) that cost roughly half as much as an ENTIRE EXPANSION!  for reference each expansion comes with 4 characters as well as roughly 100 new cards to add to your game.  The whole thing  is designed to milk your cash.  Nowhere near as enjoyable as the board game. Do not purchase this game. Especially avoid the season pass as who knows what new and incredibly lazy ways they will attempt to exploit their customers or if they will finish at all.    The physical game will be yours forever and doesn't require an online community that was already dying off when i got disgusted with the way this game was being mishandled.			"

												NOTE: This review is based entirely on games playing as a single player against 3 AI opponents.The game is in general fun. Yes, it's buggy. Yes, sometimes the AI makes idiotic (sometimes incomprehensible) choices. I am giving this game a bad review based on one thing:The ""Random"" spell.The number of games I've had completely upended by this one spell is ludicrous. I never got the chance to play the original board game, but if it were up to me, I would have pulled this spell out of any games I played with other people. The radical swings it causes either totally ruin the game, or extends the length of the game to the point where it is agonizing.If radical, late-game shifts in power balance are ok with you, then I can recommend this game. For myself this is a rage-quit offense (especially in a single player situation).			"

												Talsiman is dervied from the board game. It is JUST like the board game. Inanimate pieces move around the board, dice rolls, cards flip. There is no animation. And OMG it takes FOR EV ERRR  for the final battles at the end of the game. There is a seperate animation for eachj character as they loose health. Does not sound bad - until you have this 8 to 10 time per 3 characters  and then on multiple games.  I have many of the DLC's. They add depth  but some characters greatly unbalance the game. Why would anyone play the priest if you could play the exorcist for example.  I was dissappointed. I was expecting more than a computerized board game.			"

												This is a faithful recreation of the boardgame, no question. Simple roll and move, random card draw, limited decision making, like a slightly cooler version of Monopoly. The AI seems good at times but ultimately falls flat and gets caught in un productive loops. For example, The wizard had an axe and was in the forest so he made a raft to cross the river, this put him over his item limit however, so he had to discard an item, naturally he chose the raft he just made. every turn until I killed him. If you are looking for a faithful reproduction of a pretty bad boardgame, this will fit the bill nicely. If you're looking for a faithful reproduction of a good board game, try Space Hulk, Carcassonne, or Ticket to ride.			"

No problem, they cast teleport on their next turn, go to the warlock, just happen to roll the quest to deliver a follower and boom, free talisman. It's all random, riiiiight.			"

												A fun and rather simple game to learn.   It's mostly RNG with some strategy involved.    Though the price of the game is a bit much for how little content the base game has.   The DLC spam is way too much as well  and adds in much needed content.   Only buy on a heavy sale.			"

												I remember countless hours I spent playing ""Talisman"" when I was a teenager. I loved how you could travel through the different realms and get more and more powerful. The different additional boards such as the City, the Dungeon and the Timescape added so much to this game. Especially the Timescape addition, with its Warhammer 40K science fiction theme was brilliant.When I first saw the digital edition, I remembered those great hours of joy I had as a teen and bought the Gold Pack. Unfortunately, the digital adaptation turned out to be extremely boring and lackluster. The additional sets are only integrated with new cards and, in the case of the Dungeon or the City, with one additional region on the main board, not with an entire board itself. There's no delving into the streets of the City with all its dangers and possibilities; there's no Dungeon to enter; and, which is at least to me the biggest issue, there's no Timescape with all its weird possiblities, deadly adversaries and powerful artifacts. I really don't understand all those comments who say that this adaptation is faithful. It seems as if those guys have never played the original board game with all its expansion sets. Of course, you can say that the developers are still working on the game, but they've already published the Dungeon as well as the City expansion, and both of them are very poor adaptations of the original expansion sets. And this isn't simply a case of different subjective tastes or different valid opinions: just take a look at the original board game and its expansions, and then take a look at how these were adapted in the digital version. If someone wants to tell me that this is a faithful adaptation, then he's no idea what he's talking about.The AI isn't really convincing. It searches for the most direct way to reach the central region, making the player to rush forward in order to beat it. In the two games I completed, the AI characters killed off each other, so I had only to deal with one weakened survivor.There are only a handful of characters who are useful, so most players probably won't care for the other characters at all. This was an issue with the original Talisman as well, but each addition had some new useful characters that the digital version doesn't have. The Dungeon and City boards had some mediocre but useful characters to choose from, and the Timescape addition came with such great characters such as the Space Pirate, the Space Marine, the Astropath, the Chainsaw Warrior or the Cyborg. All of them were powerful additions that gave the player a greater rooster of useful characters to choose from. However, the digital version doesn't have them and leaves the player with only one or two characters to choose from; the others are just underpowered rubbish.I haven't played the multiplayer version, but I've heard only bad things about it, so, even if I did find anyone who plays it, I wouldn't try it.Damn, I really wanted this to be a good game. I really wanted to give a smaller studio a chance, even if this meant that I paid a lot of money for an unfinished product, quasi at face value. How I was disappointed! Admittedly, the developers come up with new content on a regular basis, but it's just not convincing at all. This is one of my all-time favorite board games, and they turned it into a dull, uninspirated, luke-warm rehash.CONCLUSIONIf you haven't heard of Talisman before, don't waste your money on the digital version. Better try to find the old board game, gather some friends and play it. If you, like me, loved the original board game, then don't make the mistake to waste your money on the digital version. Grab the old board game, get some cold beer, try to find some surviving friends who still have time to spend an evening with an old school board game, and enjoy it.			"

												This is by far the worst game that I have ever played in my life, it is nothing more then a series of dice rolls, in fact I think you would have more fun if you spent 2 hours mindlessly rolling dice then play this game. the first game I attempted to play I was doing great almost going to hit the last space, but an A.I characters cast a spell on me that turned me into a toad, in which I lost all my items, then the next turn he stole all of my items, which after that I restarted the game. to which I was treated to the most mindless and boring experience of my life, I quickly was able to aquire enough items to make it to the last square, instead of winning like I assumed I would, all it did was trap me and force me to cast a spell to kill the other players. Not so bad you might be thinking to yourself, let me explain what this spell does, first you have to wait untill the other players take their turns, then since its a spell any player may counterspell or other things to stop you. Then you have to roll a dice at 50% chance to succed, which after the end of my game my total percent of succeding was a whopping 12 % (in which i rolled 2 in particular over half the time) and then after all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t all you get to do is take one life from the players, in which they can prevent, or heal back up (which there are a bunch of chances for players to be healed back to full, normally 4 lives). You might be thinking thinking thats not so bad, after 8-10 turns all the players should be dead, thats what I thought at first... but after 2 and a half hours, YES THATS ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT, AFTER 2 AND A HALF MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING HOURS OF WATCHING THE AI TAKE THEIR TURNS AND ME DOING NOTHING BUT MINDLESSLY CASTING A SPELL AND LOSING THE DICE ROLL I ENDED UP LOSING THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. How in the ♥♥♥♥ing world of mathamatical averages could I lose that game you might be asking me? well, since the AI gets to take their turns, they just ran around the board building their stats up and healing every 4 or 5 turns. At 10 points in the game I had a single player 1 life from dying and lost every dice roll, I did not end up killing a single player during the course of my 3 and a half hour game, the odds of me losing 10 ""coin flips"" in a row is .09 percent by the way. and now to how i lost, after 3 and a half hours of playing this mindless god forsaken game, one of the players, a warrior, managed to turn me into a toad for 3 turns while being at 1 life for 6 turns, heal up and make his way up to the middle square in which he then had to battle me to kill me, at this point i was at 12 str with 2 modifier and a +4 str follower to his 11 str and +1 modifier. but when it came time to battle I realized that somehow during the course of my toadness the follower had vanished from the game, the AI then managed to beat me every single time, he rolled five 6's in a row by the way, I cant even do the math on that one. so my final thoughts on this ordeal, DO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS GAME, I wish I could get those hours of my life back but I cant, I will be haunted by this experience untill the day I die, if I ever am able to meet the creator of this game I will not be held liable for my actions toward that spawn of satan. ♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

												The user interface is a little iffy sometimes, with the occasional mis-cast spell or item timed incorrectly, but this game accurately captures the magic of Talisman in all its random, insidious and unbalanced glory. It's fun as heck. If you only play games to win, well, you're a shallow loser and this game is not for you. If you play games to watch unpredictable upsets, see a toad kill a mammoth, or lose 7 points of strength in a single die roll and then laugh it off, you will enjoy Talisman.			"

												Until they fix the DICE and Spell system, I would avoid this game. Players constantly get low rolls while the AI gets 6's. The dice rolls are not random. they are script fed and pregenerated and the AI knows what is coming next. Which is why the AI constantly charges into fights with dragons using a stick and underwear and slays them while I get throttled by sewer rats while using a sword. You also have an issue trying to cast spells on other players... It always selects yourself, as in there are no other options to choose... Like I want to paralyze myself so other players can kill me... or destroy all my own items so everything on the board can kill me even though I spent the last 2 hours struggling against the BS dice to get enough equipment that I no longer need to roll to win but auto kill. THANK YOU FOR REMOVING ALL MY EQUIPMENT.    F.U.   FIX YOUR CRAP!!!			"

												I cannot recommend this game until they improve the Enemy AI.Talisman, itself, is a really great game... but I would much rather play it with freinds around a table, than here on Steam. I picked this up because it is not always possible to get a third of a dozen people together for a day to play boardgames, and this was meant to satisfy my gaming itch at those times.Unfortunately, the AI cannot truly handle themselves... they constantly make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices, and they will spend forever farming for items and ability points without making any effort to actually win. Only once have I ever seen an AI player advance towards the crown, and even when they find themselves in the inner region by pure luck, they will typically turn around and leave on the next turn.To make this game worth the price, you must play it with real people... but there is very little online activity, and if youv'e got three freinds with a day to waste, you may as well just buy the IRL boardgame.

												If you like Talisman the boardgame, don't play this. Not only did they change so many rules and not expressly say so, and make the game moreo r less pay to win, they expect you to know this without being told. Additionally, half of the cards and characters do not function as they are writen. Prime example is the Ninja: It says you can evade anything outside the inner circle, but in actuality you can't evade anything that can gain an advantage over you. Additionally, it says it can lower an enemy's strength down by your craft; It will only ever reduce it by -3, regardless of your craft, bonus too, or even base craft from runestones. Talisman was functional when players interperated the rules , not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard coded computer.			"

												As someone who regularly brought Talisman (Second Edition) to Sega game nights and who no longer has a group to tabletop game with, my knee-jerk reaction to seeing a digital version available on Steam was one of irrepressible excitement - I didn't even bother reading any reviews, I just bought it immediately, so compelling was my nostalgic glee. Boy, what a dope I was. In fact, playing this now, I can't even imagine or remember why I liked it so much in the first place. To paraphrase another reviewer, all this game wants to do is make you lose. I thought perhaps one of the expansions might make it a little better, but here's how a list of the Reaper Expansion adventure cards reads: A robber gobsmacks you from behind - lose all gold; flash flood - if you have a mule, it dies a miserable, horrible death by drowning and you lose all your possessions; plague outbreak: all your followers become infected with bubos and die miserable, horrible deaths. And so on. Actual play with AI characters using the base set goes something like this: AI player 1: roll 5, land on a Forest; you encounter a frightening, powerful Wraith...who smiles at you and gives you an Amulet - no one can harm you with a spell, ever! AI player 2: roll a 3, land in the Crags; you found three gold! AI player 3: roll a 6, land on a Field; you encounter a fiery, angry dragon - you pit your Strength 3 Wizard against a giant Strength 7 reptile...and win! You: roll a 1, land on a Stream; your Strength 7 Troll encounters a Strength 2 Wolf...and loses! Lose 1 Life! Lose all Gold! Lose all will to live or ever play this effing game ever again! Basically, you spend hours and hours trying to beef up at least one trait so that you are strong enough to pass a duel with the Sentinel guarding the gate to the middle ring, then work your way through the middle ring (which is ten orders of difficulty harder than the outer ring was) to pass a trial which will allow you to get to the center of the board and engage in ultimate combat to see who is the winner. Unless someone has the Reverse Decision spell, which can reverse the outcome of any combat, making you start all over again from the beginning. There is very little fun to be found in this game, both by design and because of the clunky, unfriendly nature of the user interface (after seven hours, I STILL can't figure out how to make sure I get to use a particular item or a spell in combat). Also, it uses the first edition art, which is fussy, cluttered, and amateurish at best, and, ""Hey, my little brother got a gold star in his art class, can he draw the Prophetess card?"" at worst. MIGHT be fun for five seconds from a nostalgia standpoint, but, really...save your money - just look at the screen shots and video and say to yourself, ""there but for the grace of gaming gods go I.""

												This is not a game so much as a hobby.  Every square on the board has different rules.  Every player has different rules.  There are four different decks of cards to draw from and of course each card drawn is unique.If you're thinking this is a role playing game where you might choose to pop over to that trader, stock up on items, then head over and kill that creature, you are going to have a bad time.  Game play is random.  Very random.  Strategy tends to be very broad and take hours to play out.  Mistakes are painful.  At its best, any one turn might have a 33% chance of something good happening, 7% bad and the other 60% of the time is just time spent.  Better maybe than real life but its hard to play with a goal of ever finishing.  And by something good I mean anything good.  You hardly ever get to do what you want.  Most often its just pragmatism: ""choice a gives me slightly better odds at improving my lot than choice B, and choice C is suicide, so ""A"" it is.""  Worst part is learning what effects what and where and when so you can tell the A's from the B's.You'd think computerizing the gameplay would at least make things faster but it absolutely does not.  Delays are built in automatically to attempt at giving all players a chance to respond to every action. And it's unforgiving.  You'll end up missing opportunities for counter moves because there arent always hard prompts when you could take action and no way to go back if you click wrong.  Wishing for a much freindlier interface like ""You just took damage, would you like to cast that heal I see in your inventory?""  ""You have a spell, which player would you like to have skip a turn?"" or for Pete's sake ""No one can effect gameplay until the next turn, why don't we skip ahead until then?"" And please plaese please do something about the end game. ""Autoplay to finish? Y/N"" would shorten most games by hours.  * UPFDATE * (I found the house rules to shorten end game, makes it much better.  Why isnt that the standard?  Other way suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks.  I get some of the appeal now, but still ""No.""))			"

												To explain this game in one word: LuckGet lucky with the character you getGet lucky with your draws, your dice rolls, your enemies dice rollsOr you lose.This game has no skill in it. You get lucky with your rolls, And you win. Simple as that.But, only problem is, that is horrible game design.Now that wouldn't be as much of a problem if it where not for the card effects, namely those from the DLC.Bace set is good and fairly balenced, But once you add all the DLC in, things get a little bit... well... kids use steam. So I'm just going to say stupid. Lets look at the clasic set for a moment. There are some spells, and other effects, that allow you to teleport, but not in the inner regon.. Thats all fine and dandy. But then there are cards from some of the DLC cards that let you teleport. And thats it. They let you teleport up to the crown of command. The item that exist to end the game. There are no downsides to these teleports. You just use the card, and get a free win. It would be fine, if it wasen't so easy to get said items. No long is it this fun race to the middle, it is now a race to see who can get the teleport item first, and thus win the game. I unfortunately thought that this game would be as fun as the table top verson was, But I was wrong.Oh wait, I'm not done yet! This game is dead! No one plays this game anymore, So I suppose there is no reason to even write this revew, But you never know. The graphics are outdated, And the devs clearly don't want to improve them. There might be 2-3 open public games, so unless you have friends who also want to waste money on a dead videogame, or you did what I did and made the mistake of doing and buying the 4 pack, you have to fight horrible made AI that play overly aggressively, and will never try and progress the game. I can never finish a game because I tend to get too fustrated with the fact that an AI just attacked me for the 5th time in a row, and the game has gone on for about 40 minutes, or atleast it feels like, and there is nothing interesting that happens, making it imposobal to keep playing.

												very buggy, AI is horrible does the most dumb tings you ever saw, only unit worth playing againsts is the troll and mainly because of its high str number. not even worth $14.99 what a ripoff. Wait for bargain bin priceing on this one. You'll be glad you did :)Also it's easy to see the rnd numbers aren't random because loaded the same game serveral times after a crash and the same number was rolled and the ai went to the same square and drew the same card....can't even play fair gotta cheat and now the game crashes even more than before. They broke it even more not fixed it.EDIT: Still the same crummy game with the same crummy 4 characters. When yah gonna make the real game with 6 characters?Something else fishy is going on with this game. It says I have played 282 hours I haven't played anywhere near thta many hours. They must log your playtime for the amount of time you're on STEAM lol. I barely have played a couple of games online and I ran one tournament of AI just to see how the ai played and what was the best one's (3 best are Troll, Cultist, and Druid) they won their matches and made it to the finals. The cultist won one game so fast I couldn't believe it. I ran them all with no grim reaper and fest to tower wins.But, seriously I haven't come close to playing this POS 282 hours lol. They are just pumping the numbers to make themselves and this game look better than it is imho. ;)			"

												I've played both the physical and the digital version of this game. Though I really like the physical game, I've come to hate the digital version. Why?1. The rng is HEAVILY skewed in favor of the AI. They will consistantly roll 5 and 6, game after game. First time I met a basilisk it rolled double 6!2. Despite the equipment and spell cards saying they can be used in a situation, the game will not always allow you to use them. This hasn't been as big of a problem as #1 but we've run into it on numerous occasions.3. The game will randomly pick a player and everything bad will happen to that player for a while untill the game picks a different player. EVERY player I've played with has mentioned this trait. It shouldn't happen, but it does.So I've stopped playing the digital version. An rng game should be just that, this one constantly shows a pattern that I'm just fed up with.			"

												To preface, I have played hundreds of hours of the physical board game. This is one of those games that holds a special place in my heart and I bought this specifically so I could share it with my friends... The base ruleset is unplayable, unfun and without a workshop for mods to fix this, I will never recommend this game for anyone.In the board game, once someone has the crown of command, no more healing can occur. On THIS however, a troll with 6 gold can face tank the spell, run up to the top with nothing I can do but spend over a half hour (yes we counted) clicking ""yes, continue"" etc. On top of that, making the command spell have a 50% chance of success is just prolonging the game.I believe that adding a steam workshop to this game so you can customize rules, card sets and characters more easily would fix all my issues with this particular version. However as is, this is a literally waste of time and effort. Please games workshop give the community the chance to do what I know so many have done with your board game and let us make the game more fun as we see fit.			"

												The game has good AI, almost insidious at times, almost abysmally idiotic at others. So it is a work in progress as one has to expect from a beta-ish product which is being offered at a beta price. Since it contains a functional solo game, one that sells for a significant fraction of its price, this makes its purchase a pretty low-wattage afterthought, if you have any interest in getting in on a value - and have some friends of a similar temprament who like these kind of board/card based RPGs.The game is nearly impossible to complete playing with 2 human players over the Internet. Over a LAN, maybe OK. But in my experience, especially if wireless communications are in the equation somewhere (cellular or WiFi), I seriously doubt there can be played a game between 2 people all the way through to the end as of the time I wrote this comment. For this reason, I cannot recommend it right now.			"

												First off I love the boardgame. I love it so much I was actually going to spend the full $60 for the game and season pass. Thank god I didn't.The game is very unbalanced and not in your favor. I've played about 20 games now and every single time the AI wipes the floor with me. Every single time, I'll draw enemy cards that are stronger then me and lose 99% of the time. While the AI collects all the good adventure cards. There has been games by the end my strength and Craft will be pathetic like 6 strength and 5 craft while the AI by the end will have 12+ for both. Whenever I play as the Wizard I always get stuck with a counter spell and the AI never uses spells against me so I'm stuck. While the AI doesn't even have to be a wizard and will end up getting to use all the good spells. I've played the board game for years and there has been very few slim times it has ever worked out like this. Everything good happens to other players while I'm stuck getting nothing. And like I've said this has happened every single game. 20 out of 20 games. Also the AI is very stupid. There's too many things to list that the AI does that no one would ever do.So then you figure ""Ok just don't play against the AI, play the game online against real players"" Nope, not gonna happen. There's never anyone online to play with. So there goes that feature.I try to play by the rule and make all players including myself random. So far every single time the AI will get the Wizard and the Prophetess. So even the random feature is useless. Also the game isn't accurate. It will allow to have 2 of the same characters in the same game. So if I pick the Wizard or the Prophetess, the AI will also be one of them.There's only a very few reasons to buy the digital version and it's really scraping the bottom. Only in certain situations would this be a good buy. If you don't have or want to spend the price of the board game, but want to play with a couple of your friends and not playing against the unbalanced AI. Or if you're lazy and don't feel like breaking out the board game to play with your friends or to show people how the game works. Other then that, even at only $7 I feel ripped off. I'll say it again, thank god I did not buy the season pass!			"

												Overpriced rubbish.$70 for a digital boardgame that costs 10cents in electricity to reproduce, and you are paying 6cents in your electricity bill.The game chooses who it wants to win.If you have a 10 stat lead in all stats, and you are sitting on the throne. You will roll constant 1s, 2s and 3s. Meaning the command spell is useless. Then over a period of 300 turns, the computer players will steal all your equipment, followers and dignity. And then somehow an npc who has inferior stats to you, will acquire a talisman and teleport from the outskirts of the board, directly to the centre of the board in a single turn.This mother fukcr has 1hp which he has had for OVER 300 TURNS, now is the time FOR HIM TO DIE. You roll a 4! YES VICTORY!!Just kidding, you roll a 1. Then his next turn starts, and he uses a temporal wave.He is nearly at the gates, YES IT'S YOUR TURN AGAIN! Nope immobility spell. Miss a turn.Now it's his turn, and he uses ANOTHER FUKCN TEMPORAL WAVE.Now he's attacking you, don't worry he has 1hp, and you have 8hp, and all your stats are greater than his.ROLL! 1.

												This is an amazingly bad game.  I have never played the tabletop version but see no reason why this isn't a totally accurate port to pc.  The game is simply an endless sequence of random good things and bad things with not the slightest element of strategy.  If more good things happen to you than bad, you will buff your stats a bit and then it is off to the equally random quest for the killer command fire. Roll a few hundred more times and hope that the other players finally run out of lives (or that you do because you just want the pain to end). You could replicate this game for free by shuffling a deck of cards and, if you turn up a red card, move one square forward.  If you turn up a black one, either move one square backward or don't move at all.  When you turn up a Joker the 20th time you win the game.			"

												Despite having spent many hours in this game I really can't recommend it.I've been playing Talisman for what feels like years and they weren't able to fix the many bugs of the game until now. If anything it feels more buggy than before. But the technical issues are only one part of the problem.To sum it up:-The algorythm for calculating the dices is plain broken. It can have several players rolling the exact same dices again and again-There are occasional crashes in the middle of an ongoing game that often make it unplayable, forcing every player to quit or start all over again-The game is highly exploitable. You can quit a running game and rejoin right away to undo the last move. Some people do it to prevent a move that would have killed them or brought them in a difficult situation. There are also character-based exploits like infinite supply to coins etc.On the plus side, it can be nice if everything is working properly for a change and if you get some decent players. There are many cards and items, lots of areas and expansions to explore... but it's a matter of luck whether or not you will be able to enjoy it.			"

												I've tried with all myself to like this game. Heck, I've even played it for an absurd quantity of time (but not the ones you see in my profile, as I often open it during work and let it in the background) and bought two expansions.But no, the game planly sucks. It would be a really nice and good game, but let's be honest: there is no randomness in it, the game just choose a set of possible winners from the beginning and drive the events and the dices accordingly.You know who is going to win since the firts 6/10 turns, as it's pretty obvious who always get the best dice results and cards. Among those there is then a bit level of uncertainess of who will exactly win, but halfway of the game you know the winner.And this apply to you, too: the moment you start the game and EVERYTHING that happens to you is useless for, let's say 20 turns in a row, you know this is a game you will not win. Just quit, start another round, and try again.Useless like never getting a single enemy encounter for 20 turns, just always getting the exact dices number to move to all those area where you don't draw an event card, or getting a couple that are totally useless. Or you never getting the number you hope, and the IA getting ALWAYS the number you get, so you just go on for 5-6 turns in a row moving to a useless space and the IA getting the same exact number and landing every time in your space and fighting you and killing you because it ALWAYS get the good number even if they have like 20% of chance for it.And, no, it's not just a matter of bad luck: it's a matter of bad luck for a couple of games, but it's not when you play like tens of games and the pattern is always there. I'm sorry, but after having tried so many times, I don't buy it anymore, the game is scripted.			"

												Honestly, this game will make you the saltiest mess you have ever been. The element of randomness is so prevalent and unforgiving that you will find yourself calling this game names that i will not disclose in this (short) review.Your entire game depends entirely, and i can't stress this enough,  ENTIRELY  on luck and dice rolls. You have little to no input into what you do, either you go one way or the other, hit one guy or the other. 80% of the time that will end in a random event.Most of the time you'll just be expecting one of the other characters to jump on you and kill you instantly, which will happen.The card that broke me; Assassin from the city expansion. 3 gold (close to nothing!) for 3 lives off me, killing me instantly after two hours on the map. I don't want to play this anymoreIf you want a game where you watch ♥♥♥♥ing grass grow before getting curb stomped by a large fat ♥♥♥♥ with a t-shirt that says ""NUHMUD GAYMS INC"" and a badge saying ""IM A SPECIAL"" then play Talisman today. ♥♥♥♥ me.

												If you're a masochist go ahead and buy this game.  I did so foolishly.  It has some great mechanics that are fun, but is crippled by extremely punishing RNG.  The game is a dice fest.  Everything, and I mean everything depends on your rolls.  After that you get to chose where you go, whether right or left and that's pretty much all.  Everything else is a no-brainer.  Kill the guy who is winning.  Steal the best items.  Rinse repeat.And how you win...*sigh*.  The goal is totally anti-climatic...the objective is basically a king of the hill thing where you kill off the other opponents to win.  It would be much better if you could just end the game there but since its so hard to even get there thanks to everything based on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ die rolls, they really have to make it so that someone has a chance to get to you while you do nothing but roll to try and hit everyone for a life point.  Talk about fun...not.  The slow drip of waiting for your turn even when you're not on the hill creates more stress than it should.Worst of all is the hateful RNG.  Yeah, I know that getting toaded is just part of the game but you may as well rage quit if your toaded because you are going to be hard pressed in getting everything you earned back while the rest of the players go ape $#*%!.  When you miss a turn or are crippled like the toad during a turn, it is maddening...and maddening doesn't make a fun game.If you just want to bs and drink beer and do something because you enjoy getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by die rolls, this is the game for you. If you like playing slots this is the game for you.  If you like playing Hold'em this is not the game for you.  If you're simply looking for a strategic challenge in trying to win, this is not the game for you.  I'm unfortunately the later.Edit:  I'm editing my review because I couldn't get my refund so I kept trying this game and I noticed something:  How is I reroll the same number after a roll that is negative, 4 out of 5 times.   Each time it happens I quit the game and start over.  Am I really that unlucky or is it the game just trying to present me a challenge?  Either way, it is the most frustrating thing...even more so than getting bad teammates playing League of Legends.  Maybe I can trade this crap away.			"

												Bought this game for 2 dollars : it's not worth it.It's just about rolling the dices. You roll an roll the dices until you manage three times the good result ; if you fail once, you have to start all over again. It is barely a caricature, this game is really ennoying.Avoid it, there are many good free games.Je l'ai acheté pour 1 euro et quelques : c'est encore trop.Ce jeu est juste un jeu de dés vaguement amélioré. En gros on attend sans fin de faire le bon tirage 3 fois de suite ; si un mauvais tirage arrive, retour à la case départ. Je grossis le trait, mais à peine.Bref : d'un ennui sans nom, à éviter quand on voit tous les bons jeux gratuits.			"

												4/10: This game is just silly, wildly-imbalanced nonsense. It's like the pay2win version of monopoly... for nerds.Typical pay2win, imbalanced garbage, the kind you would expect from GW. Here's some reasons why:It's based on a boardgame from like... the late 70s? It's a VERY old board game, at any rate. That should tell you A LOT. If you're all playing only the base game, and playing the same character (which will never happen), the game is about, 60% luck, 40% ""skill"" (knowledge of how to play).Now, If someone is playing an OP character, or any spell caster, for that matter, you can throw those percentages out the window. Then you will be 100% fu cked. That's because any spellcaster that refreshes spells can just spam spells until they (inevitably) win. Spellcasting is THAT advantageous.There's also PLENTY of pay2win OP characters that you can buy, which will be blatantly overpowered. And I haven't even tried the new Warhammer expansions (LOL... Warhammer characters, why not? Seamlessly fits into any game, right? Because GW knows they can milk a nerd OVER AND OVER AND OVER again).BECAUSE OMG SPESH MARINES *Every nerd on planet earth or gasms instantly*TL;DR: Typical pay2win garbage from GW, set in a chance-based board game that was originally created in the late 70's... Sound sh it enough for you?			"

												The game is just like the original board game. Very easy to learn if you never played Talisman before because it has a very nice tutorial.The AI seems to be pretty good but in my opinion it needs to take more ""chances / risks"". It seems to be playing very safely just to survive rather than winning. But it is still fun. I guess Online mode is there for more challenge. But would be nice with some AI improvements for those of us who don't have time to play online.			"

												h1] Talisman is the perfect Trolling Game	 [/h1]And I mean that in a good sense. Because it is so total random. You can have the best character in play, be ahead of your friends and than someone or something turn your character into a TOAD. I love the dice who can without problem roll four 1 in a row (including re-rolls) to avoid being turned into a TOAD. Like the Original Talisman from GW it is unbalanced, totally random, and above all so fun to play. Laugh at your friend's misery as he is dragged screaming into a portal and sent to...wherever. Or when the Evil Assassin has his alignment shifted to Good by the Mystic in the village, and he sulkinly has to leave behind his runesword of pure evil. this game loves to troll you, and will do so constantly. And if the game won't give you a hard time, sure your friends will. cast spell at each others, attack eacht others, steal items or even followers from each other in Trollisman	 ...aheh Talisman. One instant you are fighthing wolves in the hills, the next you find yourself drunk at the tavern, only to be beaten up by a farmer. stuff of legends.  this game is.			"

												If you're a fan of the board game then I'm sure you'll enjoy this.The graphics are okay, and reminiscent of the first edition of the board game.The AI is a bit iffy, but not terrible, although I suspect some of the RNG is a bit dodgy.I've played through a couple of times so far and the only frustration I had was trying to kill off an AI Warrior when I was at the Crown of Command. I was rolling 3s more often than not (you need 4,5 or 6 for the Crown to take a life from the other characters) and he was healing himself up at the Castle and at a random Healer card that had been drawn in the middle region. Took a *lot* of dice rolling before I eventually beat him. But he was massively overpowered in terms of Strength and yet was still not coming after me at the centre of the board. If he had he would have thrashed me. But he just kept bumbling around the middle region, losing lives, healing them ad nauseum.Hopefully some of the other endings will fix this frustration and make it a bit less RNG.Still recommended though.

												While I do definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a board game to play or is a fan of Munchkin and is looking for an experience with more depth, this game definitely has a lot of issues as of this review that the developers need to work on. There are a lot of gamebreaking bugs that sneak in with every release, the game has a tendency to crash a lot with no real reason, and there is definitely function that could and probably should be added within the future such as more custom house rules or the ability to use characters from an expansion without using the whole expansion.That being said, I still like the game a lot. I would say it has the potential to be a lot better and while I do understand that the developers aren't a big group it doesn't mean it has to show.  This review might very well change to a more favorable one as the developers work on the game some more but I'm just letting people know that plan to get this game to expect a clunky experience to say the least, it's a diamond in the rough of a game.

												Rough around the edges but the first time you achieve ultimate victory after backstabbing your way through all your friends, you might get hooked.It's a little bit like Mario Party, you'll often feel like random chance has a much larger impact than any choice you make. There is definitely strategy and a meta-game to it, but you'll occasionally find yourself glued in last place through no fault of your own. Mario Party-esque could be a good thing or a bad thing, up to you.There is a ton of DLC. Like, there are more characters for you to buy than there are to play in the standard version. Buying them is the only way to access them. Many of them seem MUCH more powerful than the default characters. It's the kind of setup you would expect from a F2P game. I can't imagine wanting to buy the game and ALSO buy a ton of minor additions piecemeal. I recommend the game, but I want you to know what you're in for.			"

The number of DLC packages available - I feel like I've bought a playable demo with the amount of extra purchasable items available.2. The gameplay is REALLY slow.  The AI turns feel like they take FOREVER to complete.  It would be nice if you could skip or speed them up.3. Somehow my game went into windowed mode and I have no idea how to flip it back to full screen.I would recommend this game for anybody looking for a fun and casual boardgame, but I'm not sure that I would recommend it at its full price - especially with the huge amount of available DLCs.

												So far a fairly faithful representation of the game. Some bugs which I expect will eventually be worked out. My only major gripe is that the AI opponents aren't programmed to win; they never go for the Crown of Command (CoC). When a human player reaches the CoC, the AI opponents just keep running back and forth healing making the endgame mind-numbingly boring. The only way to play this game with AI is with the Race for the Crown option turned on. Improved tweakable AI algorithms would go a long way to solving this issue.			"

												Fantastically fun game. Two Thumbs up, will keep you occupied for hours. It's only missing one thing...an actual pause button for single-player and co-op. Pros:Hours of gameplayFun and entertaining Can play with friendsMany different characters to choose fromAlways something new everytime you play.Cons:No pause buttonSome characters appear to have better abilities or starting stats to progress further in the game.100% do recommend!

												If you have played the boardgame and like it... what are you waiting for? This is a great adaptation. I can't resist chanting ""toad!, toad!, toad!..."" every time someone has to roll and may get the infamous one. An ""advantage"" of a digital version over playing with board and pieces is that it resolves the ""rules lawyering""; no more arguments over taking the doppleganger as a trophy or which spells can be cast together. In some cases the reading of the rules may be a little unexpected (deducting the base craft instead of the current craft, for the ninja's secret strike) but I think in the end the designers achieve a good game balance.If you don't know Talisman but you like turn-based fantasy boardgames that are easy to learn, with games taking a couple of hours, then this is a great choice. The game mechanics are: you compete against 3 othe players, each with different stats and abilities (RPG-like). Move around the board where different events happen, building up your character's abilities. When your abilities are at a good level, try to get to the end game (this is the ""inner ring"" on the board, for the base game, or it can change depending on expansions). Like the original boardgame, you can add much variety with the expansions, it does not get repetitive. The events are fun and well balanced. Generally you will make progress by making the right choices but... don't get too complacent! Even for the strongest character there is a small random chance of a minor ""disaster"" that brings your stats down a few notches. By the way, the base game does provide plenty of fun, the expansions are very nice, and I do recommend getting them if they fit into your gaming budget, but the base characters and cards should also provide with a good dose of variety before you need to spice things up. Also regarding the expansions - they are selectable from the options screen, you can try them out and turn them off (e.g., if you want to show the game to a new friend and want the ""simpler"" game, or if you feel the expansion makes a game longer and you want a quicker game today). For the character packs you can turn them all on or all off.In terms of bugs the game is quite stable; very rarely I've come across a situation of a missing ""continue"" button or a seemingly endless loop of questions but it was easily solved by exiting and restarting.Overall - A great game, and after getting it for myself and playing a couple of games I also bought additional copies as gifts for my friends who I used to play the boardgame with :)			"

												I really do like this game. I've own multiple copies of the box version of Talisman (and the expansions). The reason for multiple copies is because we played it so much we just wore them out. The great thing about this game and the people behind it is that they were able to take much that is good about this game when the converted it to this digital format. And they keep putting out expansions and enhancements. I recommend this for people who (1) like the box game version, (2) like board games in general, or (3) people who just would like to enbrace the randomness of rolling dice and dealing with the results. This game has a LOT of multiple play through value.			"

												h1] Talisman is the perfect Trolling Game	 [/h1]And I mean that in a good sense. Because it is so total random. You can have the best character in play, be ahead of your friends and than someone or something turn your character into a TOAD. I love the dice who can without problem roll four 1 in a row (including re-rolls) to avoid being turned into a TOAD. Like the Original Talisman from GW it is unbalanced, totally random, and above all so fun to play. Laugh at your friend's misery as he is dragged screaming into a portal and sent to...wherever. Or when the Evil Assassin has his alignment shifted to Good by the Mystic in the village, and he sulkinly has to leave behind his runesword of pure evil. this game loves to troll you, and will do so constantly. And if the game won't give you a hard time, sure your friends will. cast spell at each others, attack eacht others, steal items or even followers from each other in Trollisman	 ...aheh Talisman. One instant you are fighthing wolves in the hills, the next you find yourself drunk at the tavern, only to be beaten up by a farmer. stuff of legends.  this game is.			"

												The game is just like the original board game. Very easy to learn if you never played Talisman before because it has a very nice tutorial.The AI seems to be pretty good but in my opinion it needs to take more ""chances / risks"". It seems to be playing very safely just to survive rather than winning. But it is still fun. I guess Online mode is there for more challenge. But would be nice with some AI improvements for those of us who don't have time to play online.			"

												I bought the original Talisman in the EA ages ago, played a few hours, and thought, meh.  Not that it is a bad game, but could not figure out when a game with an AI takes an hour or more how I would fit it into my schedule to sit down and play on line with real people.  I also never played the original game so had no context to even judge the online game.Fast forward, I picked it up again, just wanted to see what is different.  Low and behold many expansions, so kudos to the company for continued support of this game, and judging by the DLC season bundle you can buy there is still more to come.  I am wrestling with whether I want to drop the 50$ Canadian for it, that decision I will make in the next day or two.Judging by what I see and read the game is true to the board game, finding great renditions of board games is a challenge as most don’t port to the PC well.  For a solo play experience, I have to say the AI does a fair job in handing your butt to you, the dice and cards can be cruel, often leaving me wondering “what does a guy have to do to get a break.”The game does get a bit tedious eventually, as a solo game, especially at end game when you know that there is squat you can do other than continue to move and watch as you slowly and mercilessly lose the game.  If I was to add any advice I would say that even on the fastest setting the game feels slow at times.  In my opinion this game is designed to be played by friends over beer, in the basement like we did in the old days before computers.Should you buy this game, I have mixed felling, based on the basic game no expansions, I would rate this game a good solid 7/10.  Will see if we modify this score that depends on whether I pick up the expansions and see what they add to the game as solo vs. AI. "

												Sadly the game comes up short.... Only due to the cheating AI computer in single player.  Most games you will lose due to miracle play by the AI computer players. Everything goes their way... Its almost comical.  Aside from that, the game reminds me of the Dungeon! board game.  It is fun to play, and addictive. The expansions do add to the fun, along with the online multiplayer, and leveling system.  If you can deal with the cheating its worth a try, though I am glad I bought it on sale.			"

												Bought the 4-pack as a Christmas present for my board game enthusiats friends. I've known about Talisman but they'd never heard of it and knew they'd get a blast out of the highly competitive playstyle. But I will flat-out say, don't make the same mistake as me. The multiplayer is completely unusable. After multiple attempts, restarts, changing of hosts, I can't get 4 turns into a match without it breaking...even when only one other player is in the game.Admittedly, some people say the local multiplayer works fine and the single player does seem to work quite well...but who buys a multiplayer board game to play it single player against an AI that doesn't quite know what it's doing. There's a 4-pack for online multiplayer...and it doesn't work. Avoid completely :/UPDATE: Well, I had the opportunity to play this with friends locally and gave internet play another shot. Somewhere along the line, they patched the multiplayer and I've now played 2 games with friends (one of which having a very unstable internet connection) without any issues whatsoever. So I've changed my recommendation. It's working great now. Cheers, devs.			"

The middle region was a breeze.I was getting close to the inner region. I could feel, that was it. The other players could do nothing to stop me.just one more round to the inner region and, uh, a basilisk?No big deal, his stats aren't even that good.Ha, i rolled a six, do better than that...The basilisk rolled a 2-2.I lost all my lifes, respawned as an elf, and got utterly humiliated by all the other players until the rest of the game.I cry evrytim.9/11, would be utterly humiliated again.

												This is a duplicate of the classic board game, not a traditional PC game. That's isn't an issue.In fact in that regard it is perfect, an almost seamless transition from the real time original to a digital version.The issue is that the board game isn't very good. Board games have moved in leaps and bounds since Talisman was first written, and even the fixes this version applies doesn't fix those issues.The game takes far more time than it warrants. The randomisation is nonsense. The layout of the board, wherein you do loops around the board until you are dizzy is vomit inducing.The worst part is the end game, when you get to the penultimate goal and have to hit snooze repeatedly as you spam the kill spell until someone gets to you for some stabbing or you win.The randomisation math is rather laughable. The spectrum of 1 to 6 is produced with sufficient statistical rates, but the interaction of 1's and 6's, either appearing in double or after one another, might as well be the production of the most boring customs clerk in existence. My suspicion is the game actually produces a set list of numbers at the opening load and continually runs you through that invisible spreadsheet.But I will keep playing it. I'm writing this with 15 hours played, I'll add more to that shortly I expect. But not because it's fun.It's because it's maddening, and I want revenge on that damn Prophetess who spammed the Cown of Command while I spent 22 turns running around as the cultist trying to get enough stats, health and a talisman only to fall apart when my luck deservedly ran out.The game is making me play it more. In that sense it is very much a successfull. Is it a fun experience I want to inflict upon anyone else? No. Not until it has driven me further into psychopathy anyway.			"

Not only does it add a lot of content and replayability to the game, but if you buy it your friends can use all the DLC for games that you host.

												I'm editing my review of this game because my last review was a little too blunt.I have not played any of the expansions for this game nor I have played this game online.  This review will be just from what I have played against the computer.The game does look nice but I do believe a little more animations would be ideal.  Also, if the game speed could increase overall when playing against the computer would also be helpful, only slowing down during necessary parts like when the computer is giving a player a chance to cast a card before another action is about to be played.I still very strongly believe the computer DOES CHEAT.  However, if you catch on how the computer cheats, you can beat it.  Usually you have to stick it out and survive.  I have had the computer give me terrible rolls and target my character even though it is only the third strongest from everyone.  Yet if I survive despite a computer character using the Crown of Command, it will kill off the other players, leaving their belongings behind which usually empower my character enough to survive while building up stats so that I can easily reach the last character and kill him/her.  Sometimes the computer will act strangely, like killing off one of its own characters.Still, it is a fun game overall and if you can bear through some of the BS you will likely see in the game, you should be able to come out on top.

												I was surprised to find this the other day while searching around for games in Steam.Surprised with myself for not realising that it was actually available and had been for a couple of years or so and that I had not seen it before, considering the amount I had wanted it to be made into a digital version of the original boardgame, and that is exactly what it is. If, like me, you are old enough to have the original boardgame lying around in your loft/attic and don't get much chance to dust it off and bring it out and would like to know if this is worth getting, then I can assure you it is. There is good attention to detail to the original game and the original cards and I haven't found any of the DLC here to have taken anything away from the game, but actually add to it. I've not played nearly enough to come across even a small amount of scenarios that can happen within this game but I certainly haven't come across any bugs as of yet. On top of this I haven't found the rolls and RNG to be anything other than random and haven't seen them as biased in any way, whether against AI or other players. I've played a couple of games online and have found them to be good without any real dramas or problems with other players. Overall, if you do remember this game and do like it then I would most certainly recommend it. As I have read from other people, this is not a fast-paced multi-action game so if you are looking for this type of thing then this is not for you. I have found it good to whittle away a few hours of peaceful gaming myself though!			"

												This game is bugged...badly. I've played a couple of games with the AI already and I can tell it does not work completely as expected. I found cards and companions that do not respond the way I expected. Then again, this game is a little complex, so I must concede that maybe I do not fully went through every card's mechanics and might be my mistake. I did not try to play this online since I played local or with AI.Now for the good side, which leads to a positive review: This game is FUN. This version was the first one I tried, and it took one or two games to understand some mechanics; once that was done, it was incredibly fun.It is one of the most responsive digital board games I've ever played (even with the tons of bugs that it contains!) since you can fully enjoy a complete game without facing any critical issue. Lots of characters, lots of events, many many cards and ways to play this. Lots of expansions that, even though are a little bit too expensive, give the game quite a new face and feeling on each playthrough.The runestones system is highly criticized but it gives new players a little handicap to play a game having certain advantage if used properly. It is not an easy game, but it feels rewarding at every step.Talisman also works as a intermediate step between easy board games (such as Monopoly) and deeper strategic board games; it has many cards, a bunch of characters with different stats and abilities, several rules, but nothing too complex or abstract as to push the player away while learning.I highly recommend the game for the fun that it brings, and I helped some friends play it, and they liked it too, but keep in mind that as many negative reviews say, the game IS really buggy, and might be problematic for many gamers out there. I also recommend this as a tabletop game, which I'm considering to buy after my wonderful experience with this digital edition.			"

												This is the original board game. However, I find the execution is not done that well. The controls are rather clunky and unintuitive. For example, in multiplayer, actions that need to take place in other players's turns are handled by a feature, where you have to put your action into a ready state, upon it will be used on the next possible occasion. This is not only very tedious to time right, but also very uncomfortable to manage. Mainly due to the slow animations/responses of the user interface and a rather bad overview of the overall situation. It happens regularily that cards are being used on things I didn't intend them to be used on (e.g. a counterspell).On top of that, there are a lot of cards-fly-around animations that drag the turn speed down. Sure, at the beginning it is nice to see cards flying around, but when you've spend 3 hours in a multiplayer game, you just want to play, instead of wasting your time with those slow turns.I find it much more comfortable to play the game in real life, at a table. Sure, setting it up takes longer, but once it started, the turns are much faster in real life compared to the digital game.In terms of actual game-play, there is no difference to the classic board game (besides the problematic handling of interrupt cards, which are really annoying to use here).In case you don't know the original board game: It is 90% about rolling dices and coming out on top. You move with a d6, and cannot influence much, except for the direction you want to move (clockwise, or counter clockwise around the board). When you encounter another player, you can fight, thowing a d6 adding your strength. The same way you fight monsters that might pop up.Many fields you can end your move on come with other random effects. You always throw a dice and see what happens. Throwing a low result usually means something bad happens, throwing a higher result usually means you get stuff or improve.Talisman never was a game of much depth, but of luck. There are some choices you can make, but it is really all about those dices.			"

												I'm editing my review of this game because my last review was a little too blunt.I have not played any of the expansions for this game nor I have played this game online.  This review will be just from what I have played against the computer.The game does look nice but I do believe a little more animations would be ideal.  Also, if the game speed could increase overall when playing against the computer would also be helpful, only slowing down during necessary parts like when the computer is giving a player a chance to cast a card before another action is about to be played.I still very strongly believe the computer DOES CHEAT.  However, if you catch on how the computer cheats, you can beat it.  Usually you have to stick it out and survive.  I have had the computer give me terrible rolls and target my character even though it is only the third strongest from everyone.  Yet if I survive despite a computer character using the Crown of Command, it will kill off the other players, leaving their belongings behind which usually empower my character enough to survive while building up stats so that I can easily reach the last character and kill him/her.  Sometimes the computer will act strangely, like killing off one of its own characters.Still, it is a fun game overall and if you can bear through some of the BS you will likely see in the game, you should be able to come out on top.

												Just a few quick words:- From what I understand, this is a pretty faithful adaptation of the original board game, so if you're familiar with that, you know what to expect.- The learning curve on this is STEEP.  Perhaps die-hard board game players would catch on more quickly, but I actually uninstalled it out of frustration and only came back months later to try again.- The above being said, if you enjoy board games and/or classic fantasy settings, this is definitely worth a shot.  It has near infinite replayability with all the different quests, alternate endings, expansions, and characters, so $15 (the current listed price) is pretty good.  Plus, as I understand it, you can hot-seat with your friends (which I plan to try shortly), in addition to solo or online multi-player.- Don't worry too much about the various purchasable DLC (extra characters, expansions, etc.) until you've gotten a hang of the base game and are quite sure that you enjoy it.  As you'll see once you start playing, each character drastically changes gameplay, and the expansions all add new characters - two even add extra maps to the game, with their own special cards and challenges.  As I said, though, the base game should provide plenty of entertainment for a good while.- Overall, I'd give this a 7/10 - fun, replayable, hot-seatable, and relatively inexpensive, with some laudable art and music that only occasionally grate on the nerves.  The only thing bringing down the score is the utter lack of a thorough tutorial.			"

												EDITED 27 JUL 2016; recommendation changed.  See bottom for explanation.A potentially wonderful game.  The presentation and mechanics are great.  Unfortunately, the AI is abysmal.  Actually, the AI is non-existent; it's just a random number generator.  The AI will not try to win once they have a talisman and adequate strength.  Instead they just wander around the board, picking up random trash and fighting random monsters.  The player will inevitably win the game, it's just a matter of patience.  I suppose if you have friends who own it and can make the time to play with them, it's a great game.  If you're thinking of buying it as a solo game, however, do not waste your money.Note to devs:  if you fix the AI, I'll happily give this a ringing endorsement and buy all the DLC without hesitation.  But not until then.EDIT:I'm changing my recommendation from a ""No"" to a qualified ""Yes"".  Here's why:  You can select the house rule Sudden Death and thereby nullify much of the problem with the AI.  In this mode, you play for a set number of rounds (determined by you at the start of the match), and the player or AI with the most improved Strength, Craft, and total count of gold, spells, followers and items wins.  This plays more to the strength of the AI since, as noted above, it mostly roams around gathering stuff and improving its stats.  You can easily lose to the AI in this mode.  The downside?  It's more RNG-based, since there is no defined strategic goal.  However, it's a dice-and-card game; RNG is at the core of it.  The game is, in essence, a pretty time-waster.  I can live with that.  I don't know that I'll necessarily buy the season pass, (maybe during a 50% sale), but at least the game is more enjoyable in solo mode by using that house rule.  Your mileage may vary, of course, if you're prone to RNG rage.			"

												I was surprised to find this the other day while searching around for games in Steam.Surprised with myself for not realising that it was actually available and had been for a couple of years or so and that I had not seen it before, considering the amount I had wanted it to be made into a digital version of the original boardgame, and that is exactly what it is. If, like me, you are old enough to have the original boardgame lying around in your loft/attic and don't get much chance to dust it off and bring it out and would like to know if this is worth getting, then I can assure you it is. There is good attention to detail to the original game and the original cards and I haven't found any of the DLC here to have taken anything away from the game, but actually add to it. I've not played nearly enough to come across even a small amount of scenarios that can happen within this game but I certainly haven't come across any bugs as of yet. On top of this I haven't found the rolls and RNG to be anything other than random and haven't seen them as biased in any way, whether against AI or other players. I've played a couple of games online and have found them to be good without any real dramas or problems with other players. Overall, if you do remember this game and do like it then I would most certainly recommend it. As I have read from other people, this is not a fast-paced multi-action game so if you are looking for this type of thing then this is not for you. I have found it good to whittle away a few hours of peaceful gaming myself though!			"

												I've never played the original board game.In my first game I was a warrior. I used a sword and an axe at the same time. I learned a little magic. I killed a dragon. A wizard turned me into a toad. A druid stole all my stuff. A troll killed everyone of us. Good game.If you like board games and movies like the Lord of the Rings, there is a good chance you will like this game.An extra tip: When you play against the computer, increase the speed of the AI to spend less time waiting for your turn.

												This is one of my favourite group games on Steam. No experience needed as the rules are carried out and explained along the way. Ignore the recent drop in ratings, Nomad Games made a character especially to raise money for a charity, some people who got the season pass expected this to be included, I do not see anything wrong with what Nomad Games did in fact if more companies gave all profits for certain things to charity the world would be a lot better off!In short buy this game!
