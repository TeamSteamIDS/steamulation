												I enjoyed this more than Arcania but it's far too short. It says between 4-8 hours but I completed it in 2 1/2 hours. The RRP for this game is 13.99! (UK). Do not buy this unless it's on sale and I'm talking a 90% off sale, not worth more than a couple of pounds for what you get.			"

												I could tell this is as good as Arcania. Pretty nice game. But I can not recommend this because it is too short. Stand-alone expansion for about 5 hours of gameplay. This should be included into Arcania or exist as DLC. This game will let you import your character form Arcania with full inventory and stats. Very good solution. Purchase of this game make sense only as a part of pack or on a sale.  "

												Unless you really loved Arcania: Gothic 4 then don't bother with this stand alone continuation of that story.  And if you do want to continue Arcania's story, get this on sale.  It took me about 5 hours to meander through the whole thing.  You can take your character from Arcania along with all his loot and stats.  My character progressed a few more levels but there was not enough content to really make much of a difference.  In contrast to Arcania's wide open areas, the Fall of Satarrif features mainly a trench/corridor environment for most of it's story.  Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as the original, even down to the end game fight.The story itself is fairly simplistic but I didn't think it was noticeably worse than the original game.

												Picks up at the end of Arcania, so if you have your save file you can carry it all across.  It is a very painless transition and unlike games, such as Mass Effect, every item in your inventory are carried over.However, this is more likely because of the Expansion-like feel of this game. Overall it is an anti climax to the prior game. There are fewer encounters, those that exist get pretty tired. The Boss battle at the end is almost identical to the boss in ArcaniA.If you have to get the game to complete the saga, I guess do it. However, there are only a few new enemies, no new powers and you will feel that the expansion really only rounds out the story.If you were picking this up as a standalone, I don't  think you will get the relationships between the characters and thus the story will just feel like a shallow chase to kill a demon that is cursing a kingdom. The greater conflict is lost and the chance to make something epic of that showdown is lost even without the prior story knowledge.			"

												Do not even consider buying this abomination if it's not included in any bundle.This is a joke,not a standalone expansion.This game is so short that it should be released as an update to the original ArcaniA. In some RPGs single main quests take as long as this whole game does...it looks like they cut out a quest from the original game before its release and sold it as a standalone title.			"

												PROS-There is an improvement of the dialog over the main game Arcania. The possessed human's are colorful.-Worth getting if you plan to play it right after Aracania, AND if you buy it for 75% off or more.-You can import your high level character from Arcania. You keep all the gear and cash which is nice, and almost feels like cheating.CONS-Very short.  It has a short main story, and several really mini side missions.-Map tracking wasn't improved.  But since the environments are smaller than the original game it's less likely you'll have to google where your mission is.			"

												This is how JoWooD ends. Not with a bang, but with a $15 expansion for a game nobody bought or liked very much that re-uses a lot of the same assets from the main game. Originally supposed to come out a few months after ArcaniA shipped, the expansion seemed to be destined never to come out until Nordic Games (now THQ Nordic) picked up a lot of JoWooD IP, along with ArcaniA, and put this out. FOS is basically the ending to ArcaniA, locked up behind $15. It takes place immeditely after the main story concludes with the Shepard being sent to assist forces in Setarrif. Remember the cool looking  white and gold Persian-esque city with the miniarets that was under siege and could not be accessed? That's Setarrif. However, a volcano has errupted and has cut off the city from the rest of the island, as well as seriously affected the city and the surrounding wildlife. The expansion is pretty linear and there are exactly two side quests outside of the critical path. It's worth noting that you can start FOS with an end-game character from ArcaniA along with all your equipment and inventory, although it will all get quickly replaced with better gear.The engine performs slightly better, with none of the *many* glitches and bugs that hounded ArcaniA present, and there are some interesting sequences where you take control of Lester and Gorn for story-related purposes, but overall, FOS is pretty bare-bones. I paid $3 for this and I still feel like maybe I could have spent it on something better. Also, the voice acting is weirdly delivered in FOS with lots of unnatural pauses and volume levels versus how it was in ArcaniA (although that had it's fair share of audio problems too) which can probably be explained away by its traumatic development process. Your money is better spent elsewhere.			"

												This is a very short and anticlimactic expansion/real ending of Arcania.  It explains what happens immidiatly after the events in Arcania but does so in a painfully enclosed environment consisting of deep trenches and long tunnels.  Again the voice acting is just appauling and you are not offered any new weapons or armour to spice things up.  The game ends rather abruptly following the last battle and you are left craving something, like a refund or a real game.  Same graphics and combat feel as Arcania.  I would only buy this for a cheap package of if you are some kind of mega gothic fan.			"

												Games like Fall of Setarrif really bring me to think that some guys in the development team didn't know what they were doing. The flaws of this game are so obvious that they scream in your face. The AI is dead stupid. When the enemies go into attack mode, you can dodge on the side and continue attacking while they aim where you last stood. At times enemies fail to attack you at all and just stand there while you're finishing them off. Another thing that bugs me is the loot, or rather the lack of it. The environment is rich in detail but you can only interact with a fraction of it. I also noticed that when you loot clothes, amulets and rings, the game sometimes replaces them with items you've already equipped. The stats of the equipment seemed higher in a way so I'm thinking if the game was programmed to do you a favor. I sometimes discovered that my character was wearing some amulet with very good mana stats and the amulet with decent health and armor stats was placed in the inventory.Then there were those little logical flaws that were ok 10-15 years ago, but start to appear as amateurish when you still see them now. Example: a guy is locked up in a bamboo cage, you have to help him out. What does your character do? He asks where they keep the key. I mean, c'mon, I'm sending archdemons to the abyss here, if you need a key for a bamboo cage then I've got this magic ore battleaxe here, just take one step back. Or on other occasions you're fighting off 30 feet tall trolls and sending exploding fireballs towards a swarm of enemies, yet can't climb a wooden fence. I wish games were past such nonsense and come up with something better.On top of everything they also didn't fix the moon gravity. The nameless hero keeps floating through the air. I guess they thought it looks cool. So cool that you don't get tired of it till the end of the game.I had hard time rating the game. I was in between. The graphics still looks great, the design department has built a stunningly beautiful world. And there are some splendid features in the game. For example in some places you get to play as Lester and Gorn. Having gone through all the Gothic marathon just think how cool is that. The game's got a great sense of humor. Someone in the development team did they're job.I decided to lable it as a negative review only for one reason. Throughout the game I kept thinking about the flaws and bugs and what they might have done better. What this means is that the game lacked atmosphere. It didn't suck me in as games are supposed to. The lack of atmosphere is quite unforgivable.			"

												Did it in 4.0 hours on normal difficulty, I think I completely explored the game and killed every single enemie, too.CLASSES:I started with the ""Knight"" class. ""Mage"" and ""Hunter"" are the other 2 available classes.MELEE WEAPONS & COMBAT:Weapons which apply burn or have life steal are just OP and get you through the game even easier than regularly. It's very easy to stunlock enemies by using a ""Zweihänder"" sword, I guess even a one handed would do, but I played with the two-handed fire sword most of the time and that's where i noticed it the most.SPELLS & COMBAT:You only need the lighning spell, which deals damage and paralizes every enemy, except the boss, for a long enough time to get close and kill them. It also doesn't cost much mana, which you'll regen very fast anyways and it can't be charged, so you can just spam it.You don't even need to aim exactly at the enemie because it has a relatively big hitbox, so if you'd fire it a bit to the left or right of an enemy, it will still hit. I don't know about the other spells but I think they won't be as useful.RANGED WEAPONS & COMBAT:I didn't use crossbows but normal bows are okay, not too good, though, because the hitbox for ""headshots"" seems off and aiming is a pain. Sometimes a hit in an enemie's head will deal as much damage as a shot anywhere else in their body, and sometimes it deals like 300 extra damage.MERCHANTS:Merchants are pretty useless and the 3 merchants in the game just pop up at certain spots during the story, all three of them almost standing in each other. That makes it seem like they've just been dropped there without a second thought.Buying stuff isn't necessary at all, you'll find anything you need in chests, which aren't even well hidden, and you can craft good gear, if needed and if you found the recipes in chests (which again is hardly a challenge). EXPLORATION?!:There isn't very much to explore, though. It's a linear setting and you can see caves on the mini-map so you don't even need to search for those.What I hated the most was, that you only can sprint with an ability (""8"" on default), which has a painfully long cooldown. It took so long to walk around that it took my joy in exploring away after 5 minutes. OTHERS (Graphics,AI etc.):For a stand alone it feels kind of unfinished and empty at many parts. For example the water ""animation"" which glitches, the environmental shadows are jumping around, the background looks plain and loveless, enemy AI has it's problems at times (enemies just standing around for 2 sec after I approached them, for excample). But besides all that it has fairly good graphics.Charachter models and Enemies are well designed.The mobs won't respawn, so after a while you just cleared the few enemies and turtles in the areas and go on.RESULT:I got the game as part of the Gothic Pack on a Steam sale and therefor the price wasn't too high. I won't recommend buying it any other way, because it sadly is not worth it.			"

												This Add on i bought together with  main game for a low price so i never regreted many which i spent on it and it could be one factor why i will be very calm on this product.First this which i noticed was that it was cut from original game and presented as Add on or datadisc product-but it was only a dirty work of distributors-today it i nothing new-but when i played it and completed after about 10 hours i realized that if this will be part of main game it should be ok, but for datadisc it is too short,with only a little quests, too linear and with terrible actor voices, but the graphic is perfect and the mainstory is okk also and you harvest extremely good items so at the end you are a superhero-strange strategy but why not.So I think it could be better and the developers should made a better work with it, on the other side it is solid RPG for beginners and i enjoyed it somehow also -so i will not join huge negative responses for this game.Rating:62%			"

												Okay, I have finally resolved all the issues I had about this addon and I can now fairly review it.This is a typical endgame DLC with a new piece of terrain to explore, better equipment and stronger enemies. Something else to do after you've finished the main game and became a hero. It suddenly turns out that your job is not done yet and you should become yet more heroic to overcome a yet greater threat. That being said, there hardly is anything to add to the description. Anyway, given that you take your time there, it provides a total of 5 or 6 hours of gameplay. I've seen whole titles delivering the same or even less, so this addon is worth getting if you want to visit the universe of Arcania once more.			"

												The original ArcaniA was quite a bland RPG experience and this game promises more of the same, only worse.  Linear questing, one or two items worth crafting and finishes quite quickly in a cutscene that gives you a sense of release rather than of accomplishment.  I enjoyed it only because it was short and mindless.  The conversations are still awkward, and the developer tries to show off how you can converse with more than one person at a time (wow) and how you can play other characters in their own mini-adventure.  Buy only if it is on special.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago, when I was still a new member of Steam, and I played it for about five minutes! It was a great game and it seemed like it would offer plenty of fun for the money but there were other things in the way of long playing sessions - like life! - and I started playing Skyrim. Needless to say Skyrim kept me busy and Arcania fell by the wayside, waiting in the wings for me to take it up once again. Tonight I did just that - by the lambent light of my keyboard I loaded the game and set the options, no problems incountered - my Asus ROG 74X machine has 12Gb of DDR3 ram, with the Nvidia 560M graphics card that has 3Gb of ram onboard, and to top it off the machine has the Intel I7 dual core 2.0 Ghz chipset. The game runs great, no chatter or ghosting or other problems as I killed a pack of wolves and took up my life with a sheep no one else wants and I can't kill - I tried with sword and bow but nothing works. Thus far the game has my attention and I doubt I'll finish it in less than 100 hours as I tend to look under every rock and behind every bush for loot and potions. I love playing a game and squeezing every drop of programmer minutae from it, my money bought the game and thereforeI feel justified in taking as long to play as I like. No need to rush, I do that in real life and frankly, I'm sick of doing it at all. Gameplay is solid, a bit easy even on ""normal"" but the upper modes of play are more challenging and there's enough of them to satisfy just about anyone playing the title. My knight is awesome looking, his armor appearing solid and strong, the weapon in his hand, a flaming sword, looks very dangerous and the shield looks as if it could hold back a dragon! No complaints on the gameplay or graphics. HOWEVER - there is no help file on how to play the game or what keys do what! For instance, I cannot level up despite the fact the message has appeared twice already to do so. How does one level up? I'll keep playing, but I'm getting better in battle and can't benefit from the improvements or points earned to upgrade with. ]Saving is a snap and the game loads quickly and smoothly. Some people have had problems with WIN8, which I have installed on my laptop but I don't share their problems with the game, which is not to say they aren't having any, just that I'm not. Game is easily worth the money dropped on it and I have no regrets on the purchase or playtime invested. Another Steam hit, and one more reason to stay faithful to the best gaming site ever!			"

												I don't understand why this game has so much hate. This game was fun to play. There are some things bad about the game, like the overpriced items in shops, the lack of story and the NPC's behaviour, but there where things that made this game good, like the humor and the quests. I would reccommend this game, but not at full price.			"

												First of all I like expansions that allow you to import your hard earned loot and character into them from the long hours you spent on the original. However in this case, most of the items - especially the Innos blessing - have been nerfed almost to mundane status. Disappointment. The game follows in its predecessor's footsteps in the aspect that it is easy. I mean I played on Gothic difficulty again and it was easy! Even easier than the previous! Tends to get boring people.. and what's the deal with the copy pasted NPC heads?!?!? lol Anyway get it if it's in a sale, otherwise... no, unless you're a Gothic maniac :)			"

												Way too short of a game, was expecting Skyrim quality. Instead a a few glitches(waking on air, jumping over boundaries, getting stuck and restarting), only one armor change, the same minions, doing one minor quest for the endgame.Not that groovy.			"

												This add-on is very disappointing. It has some neat ideas, like taking over two NPCs like Gorn or Lester, but the ideas are wasted as you use them only for a few moments and like the rest of the add-on you only fight your way through instead of using their distinct character strengths - ok for Gorn it is fighting your way through :) . The game is way too short - I finished in in 3-4 four hours and way too easy on the normal level – something that I noticed on the regular Arcania game as well. Don’t waste a penny and hour on this one.			"

												Yes, but only if sold for about £3.00, ...since I played it through twice in 6 hours. And I'm normally damn slow, so not worth £15. If I pay £30 its gotta delvier 80 hours of gameplay which is probably 40 hours for most folk. Fall of Setarrif is more of the same, some of the areas are really well made and beautifull. But that's really all there is that is remarkable of this expansion over Arcania, new areas. It's the same game, just a micro-sequel.			"

												This ""expansion"" was horrible! It was short, way too easy, and a VERY Mediocre end to say the least. It was a rushed job, and I felt that absolutely no love was put into the making of this... game. I suggest you save your $14.99 for something more interesting.			"

												Hey, another form of Gothic game. A misshaped one.After Arcania (unGothic 4) which was playable, buti invested to much time to explore every inch of the world.Just kill all living thins to get the exp. point and do the missions.Well, is this expansion better? Brings it something new?Nope, its a Gotic like Hack n' Slay on steriods and caffeine.There is no need the search for something in this world.Because there is no world. Its a tube/pipe world where you can anly go where you should.That limits any experience to nice grafics and running around fighting.Play it if you want to get the rest of the story and get it really cheap.Ahm, im not listing any pros and cons, because there are few to mention.Like playing as your allies, Gorn and Lester.Play it in a hurry so you dont loose to much time with this one.Happy slaying			"

												Make sure you don't pay too much for this one... It's a bit rubbish.  And if you didn't play the last game, it will be largely meaningless to you.Honestly, it's more of the same.  It's largely linear with the biggest choices being how you kill an NPC, not weather you kill an NPC.  In this one, almost everything dies well with shock ... except for the final boss who seems best done-in with ice.  I didn't have any patience to play an archer or a melee character.  99% of battles with the mage can be sniped from a distance further than the NPCs can react.But... if you did play the last one and you vaguely like another 3 to 5 hours of easy stroll, it amuses vaguely.

												While the Arcania games are not as good as the previous Gothic games, they are quite enjoyable and a nice walk down memory lane with old friends popping up again to say hello. As for Fall of Setarrif, I found it to be a very nice rounding off of Arcania and am very happy I purchased it. It's not very long, an additional 5-7 hrs (I spent 7, I'm a completionist) but it does make up for the ending or lack thereof in Arcania. If you've played Arcania, I recommend playing this, too			"

												This expansion is shorter than the original game Arcania, though in line withother expansions in the Gothic series (e.g. Gothic III's one). Except for some more regions and a slight development in the plot, it doesn't add anythingnew to the gameplay of the original Arcania.Still, it's strongly adviced to play this right after the original game, because it wouldn't feel like it was a concluded story otherwise.

Contra: No decisions/linear story, no collecting of better items (you get most of the OP items at the beginning), took me less than 4 hours to complete the game which mostly consists of slashing enemies of the same types over and over again and there even is an exploit to some of the boss fights (just keep slashing them and they can never slash back because they are stunned)Pro: If you are a fan of the Arcania universe and you want to ""complete"" the story then I recommend buying this game			"

												You have almost nothing to explore. It´s nice that you can import your hero of the main Game, ArcaniA but that´s not enough to say it´s good. It litteraly takes around 5 a half hours to play through this Standalone Game. It´s even worse than the Add on for Gothic 3 (forsaken Gods edition). It´s far to short. I mean if you compare that with the main game, ArcaniA (I have 21+ hrs) it´s a joke. For the price of 15€ it´s way to expensive for its quality. Just have in mind the main Game ArcaniA costs 20€... And even the following comparison is the only thing you need to know.ArcaniA: FoS (5,5 hrs) -> 15€ArcaniA (21+ hrs) -> 20€The mapsize is a joke. I try to compare it with the main Game: The whole world of ArcaniA: FoS is as big as Toshoo combined with Feshyr or even smaller.This game is not with the 15€			"

												Extremely linear, extremely short, extremely tedious. This really is the last chapter of Arcania separated into a standalone expansion. It takes all the worst parts from the latter half of the original game - boring environments, endless tunnels, unchallenging combat - and doesn't offer anything new. Even the boss fight is a lame rehash of the one in Arcania.Took me a measly 3.4h to complete, and I explored every nook and cranny I could find.			"

												Played it just because Gothic 1 is such a legendary treasure that anything to do with Gothic universe i had to experience. Was quite dissapointed how short this DLC was, Plenty of bugs, but still i would play more....id like to see gothic universe in multiplayer, or even PVP arenas.... or i would definitely pay for Gothic 1 remastered....no changes in story, just graphic and world and physics			"

												This is a fairly disappointing expansion to a fairly disappointing game. The only good thing I have to say is that it lets the player use a save file from the original game, so all the ♥♥♥♥ I did and leveled up wasn't just a waste of time. Unfortunately, like Gothic 3's expansion, this takes place outside of the main story, which is depressing, especially considering how well Gothic 2 nailed it.	The very linear add-on takes place in a massive, unexplored chunk of the map from the main game. It just seems like a tease, to have it there in the first place, with this expansion being the only way to get to it. However, this significantly smaller area doesn't give me the stuttering problems I had in the original game, leading me to believe that the engine is just set up to render most of the playable world simultaneously.	As I mentioned earlier, the player can import a leveled character, but this snaps the already fragile difficulty in half, because by this point most of the skills are probably maxed out. I kept pausing the game to check whether I was really still playing on the hardest difficulty because this was such a cakewalk, and on top of all that, there is much better equipment to be had here as well, making it even easier. I don't think I died even once.	Finally, it's too short. I beat the thing in less than 3 and a half hours, and I did every single quest... not that the expansion has a lot of quests to begin with, but that just goes to show how utterly lacking in content this $15 is. Thank God I got it on sale, at least.			"

												Sadly, this is an example of Downloadable Content that lost a lot of opportunities to correct the flaws of ArcaniA.I bought the DLC in a package and finished the Story.Instead of playing it, if you want to know the finale, just search YouTube and watch it.Play ArcaniA only!			"
