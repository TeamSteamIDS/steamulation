STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™ – Adventure/RPG; Squad Tacticsa spoiler-free reviewRating: Recommended as EssentialYou wake up on a battle cruiser during an all-out firefight, find your way to the escape pods when it gets severely damaged, fight your way through enemy soldiers and crash-land on an unfamiliar planet. Knights of the Old Republic [KOTOR] takes place some 4,000 years before the events of A New Hope; Yoda, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker are names of no consequence in the Star Wars universe. You are in completely new, unfamiliar territory here.Star Wars fan or not, KOTOR is a game that everyone should play. A companion system ahead of its time, multiple storylines, rich dialogue and backstory, YELLOW lightsabers and a unique tactical approach to combat allow this installment in the Star Wars series of games to really shine.- Companions -You will meet several unique, diverse characters in your travels; a few of them can join your party. Grab two party members of your choice and your main character and hit the streets (or dunes, or forests, or whatever). These characters come with set attributes and skills, but when they level up (yes, there is a leveling/experience system; this is an RPG), you control how they improve.- Story -No spoilers here, don’t worry. There are a multitude of side-quests to complete that complement the main quest, backstories to explore for each of your party members, fascinating lore on the origins of a few prominent species and multiple storylines. Depending on dialogue decisions, you can earn either Light Side or Dark Side points, determining the final path your story takes.- Cons -Not too many of note. I clipped through the floor a couple times. A number of seemingly random fatal crashes. This game was put out in 2003, so it’s a little behind the times in visuals and the cutscenes are really cheesy. The camera is a bit tricky to figure out at first. If you’re not expecting tactical battles (give orders rather than do battle yourself), it can be quite confusing. The biggest thing is that your companions will, at times, slow down or stop when you’re not looking for no reason, preventing you from entering the next area.The Bottom Line: None of these presents anything more than minor frustration; the game is well-built.Well, that’s all I have to say about KOTOR. An aged but timeless classic that any Star Wars fan (and quite a few non-Star Wars fans) will enjoy.Not RecommendedRecommended With CautionRecommendedHighly Recommended- Recommended as EssentialFun Facts:Developer: BioWare (Dragon Age: Origins, Baldur’s Gate, Mass Effect)Release Date: July 18th, 2003Soundtrack Composer: Jeremy Soule (The Elder Scrolls, Guild Wars 2, Total Annihilation)Prominent Voice Actors: Ethan Phillips (Star Trek: Voyager, Benson), Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect 3, Baldur’s Gate), Steve Blum (Wolverine and the X-Men, Metal Gear Solid)			"

												I've put in way more hours into this game than Steam shows because I originally owned the actually discs (yes, physical discs) and later got the Steam version.  This is one of the greatest games ever.  An immersive storyline, interesting characters, great gameplay.  Despite its 2003 release date, and somewhat dated graphics, I still return to this game every so often to replay it.  Because of the branching story and different choices you can make (be evil, be good, kill this guy, steal this item, etc) each playthough is different.  I actually have a difficult time playing as an evil character because the game makes me feel bad about my decisions; very few games can do that!  There's also some funny moments, particularly anything that HK-47 says :)Make sure to get one of the widescreen hacks if you have a modern computer.			"

This review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough+ Character creation allows stat customizations right from the get-go, and goes the extra mile by adding a 'recommended' button that offers balanced numbers based on class; useful feature for beginners+ Very even and agreeable pace throughout the entirety of the game; never felt too fast, slow, or interspersed with filler content+ Excellent, marvelous soundtrack; really keeps you in the game, and does well to make this title feel true to the franchise+ Mercifully short load times+ There are myriad available side-quests, all voiced+ Combat mechanics are well thought-out (despite 'dice-roll' RNG, of which I am not normally fond, as a general rule) and give you plenty of room for creativity and finesse+ Excellent story with lots of depth and freedom of choice+ While some characters remained a bit two-dimensional throughout the game, the majority of them are adequately fleshed-out and seem to develop to some extend+ The game includes a few optional minigames (eg. Pazaak Cards)+ Multiple endings, based entirely around the player's decisions+ Tons and tons of lore-friendly set-pieces and items (both practical and aesthetic)+ Extremely, alarmingly mod-friendly+ An absolute plethora of immersive dialogue options+ Boasts a few masterful plot twists- Poor camera; you get used to it, but it's initially quite frustrating and limited in functionality- Poor inventory system; throws everything into one long list as you accumulate items, leading to lots of monotonous scrolling when looking for equipment (mostly a problem for fellow hoarders, you could just sell all of your junk)- Mostly flat, uninspired voice-overs (some voice actors were of inordinately better quality, though that mostly served to highlight the disparity)- AI movement is mostly terrible, leading to waiting for characters to catch up, and lots of blocked doors/paths- Lots and lots of bugs and glitches; most notably terrain glitches and a few CTDs (some of this can be fixed with a small amount of modding, I'm told)- The autosave function is too sparse in functionality, and has led to some extremely frustrating momentsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Before Mass Effect there was Knights of the Old Republic. Bioware, in 2003, decided to introduce a decision-making system which enabled you, the player, to align yourself with either the light or the dark side. Major plot decisions could be made and your gender could also yield different options during the conversations.This is one of the things one can like in KotOR. The two different alignments enable you to have at least two different playthroughs. But you have many side missions anyway. Even the companions can give you some. The world where the game takes place in shows us the previously unknown history of the Star Wars universe. A world that is 4,000 years before the films are taking place. You are awaken on a ship that is being attacked by Darth Malak. Your job is to escape, find companions, regroup and annihilate your archenemy. Of course, in the process you get to learn the Jedi way!Do note that the game is round-based. You pick the actions necessary (though this is limited each round) and you can even pause at certain points. You can also make a decision on behalf of your companions - the choice is really yours. What I have found out about the game later on is that it is based on Dungeons and Dragons rules. And the actions are calculated in accordance with these rules. As to how successfully the dice were rolled and what modifications were applied to the damages you are not told - but this is accessible from a menu.The game has excellent music (composed by Jeremy Soule), a long-lasting experience and, well, I wanted to say good graphics, but as the game has aged in the last 10 years or so, this is not really true anymore. Still, the art design is as Star Wars-esque as it can get and this being a Bioware RPG I highly recommend it. Not just for Star Wars fans or Bioware fans but to everybody wanting to have a good time!			"

												""Savior, conqueror, hero, villian. You are all of these things... and yet you are nothing. In the end, you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.""(This review contains spoilers.)The original KOTOR has what I believe is the quintessential ""Star Wars experience"" out of all the franchise games released to date. Mixing the gold-standard Bioware gameplay and character arcs before they became overused and predictable, a focus on exploration and discovery, respect to the SW lore and a strong attention to world-building and detail, it's a game that still stands the test of time and is recommended for any fan of RPGs.As much as I'm a fan of KOTOR II's cerebral, relationship-driven, ""take every trope and turn it on its head"" gameplay, I still think the first game is the better of the two. The mystery of who you are, what your relationship is to the squadmates and enemies you meet in the world and how you grow to encompass that reputation again (whether for good or evil) still sticks out in the post-KOTOR world of cookie-cutter games like Bioware's own The Old Republic, which only has a superficial understanding of the choice and consequence that went into the former.The plot is fairly straightforward. You are an amnesic man (or woman) who wakes up aboard a starship, having been out for several days and coming to just as it is being attacked by the Sith. Narrowly escaping with pilot Carth Onasi, your pod crashlands on the city-world of Taris, where you begin investigating the circumstances that led to your foggy memory. Along the way, you'll pick up a starship (the Ebon Hawk) and meet crew members like the murder-happy HK-47 assassin droid, Jedi Masters Bastila Shan, Juhani and Jolee Bindo, Mandalorian soldier Canderous Ordo and Wookie renegade Zaalbar, among others. All this comes to a head as you uncover the true identity of the Sith leader Revan and assault a space station called the Star Forge in order to stop Darth Malak, the man who took up Revan's job and threatens to destroy the galaxy.This game has some of the most ""pure"" Star Wars moments I can think of. The moment when you first step out into the Dune Sea, and see that vista all around you and the smoldering Sandcrawler in the distance. The trek through to the lowest levels of Kashyykk and the civil war going on between the various Wookie factions. The underwater walks under Manaan. The reveal of Revan, backed by that epic score.While the player being Darth Revan is a plot twist that is firmly in ""It Was His Sled"" territory as far as spoilers go, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game one bit despite knowing about it long beforehand. There's so much content to see and do that it really felt like an enjoyable and fulfilling role-playing experience. Whether it's doing some of the sidequests (like getting involved in ruling family squabbles or doing assassination contracts) or just running through some of the areas, there's a wealth of material here for fans.It's true that the storyline wanes a bit by the end (not counting the potential Dark Side twists like convincing Zaalbar to kill Mission or the Bastila reveal), but it still didn't mar my enjoyment, mainly because I brought a pair of squadmates specced out for long-range combat (Canderous and Juhani) and went in guns-a-blazing in the Star Forge.The morality system can also be exploited to great effect (you can get to full Light Side or Dark Side in less than half of one playthrough), including doing things like maxing out your LS points than choosing Bastila's Dark Side option at the end to still remain ""neutral"" but get her as a squadmate for the Star Forge finale.If there's one thing I hated about the game, it's the inventory system. You WILL pick up a lot of vendor trash in this game, and I found it was far easier just to dump or never pick up most of the gear I found, sticking to one weapon until I found something significantly better.It's also much better to spec your character manually, because the auto-level system is nigh-useless and will often result in your character gaining abilities that either aren't class-specific or generally have no benefit to you.Regardless, KOTOR (and its sequel) still stand out among the best sci-fi RPG's in recent years, and the price point is a steal, regardless of whether it's on sale or not. If you haven't played it, you owe it to yourself to check this out.			"

 “A Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far, Far Away…” A war rages between The Republic and The Sith. ‘Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’ throws you head first into a fantastic recreation of the Star Wars universe filled with lightsabers, Sith Lords, and political intrigue, in an immersive, gripping tale of Good vs. Evil which - more than a decade on - stands tall as one of the best RPG’s of its generation, and probably the finest gaming interpretation of the iconic Star Wars franchise.Campaign: Released in 2003 by Bioware | Lucas Arts, and set 4000 years before the events in ‘Star War’s - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace’, ‘SW:KOTOR’ tells the tale of a relative unknown caught up in events of cosmic proportions. The opening credits thrust you into the midst of an inter-galactic battle between Republic forces and a Dark Sith Lord, which finds you crash landing onto an alien planet, trying to stay alive and escape an inter-planetary Sith blockade. An unusually strong connection with the Force catapults the player from by-stander to protagonist, as an engaging, story-fueled campaign takes you across the galaxy from the mysterious water-world of Manaan, to the desert planet of Tatooine among many others. A lovingly crafted universe is filled with lots of recognizable faces to include – the treacherous Hutt’s, Bounty Hunter’s, Sith, Jedi Knights, Wookies, Protocol Droids, Rancor’s, and Sand People - amongst a broader cast of nearly 300 distinctive alien races.Gameplay | Graphics | Sound: A Third-Person RPG in the classic mold, gameplay in ‘SW:KOTOR’ is built around the 4 pillars of ‘Character Development and Customization’, ‘Inventory Management’, ‘Combat’, and ‘Dialogue-driven Story-Telling’. You choose to play as one of three character classes (Soldier, Scout or Scoundrel – with both male and female options available), and then as one of three Jedi sub-classes (Sentinel, Consular or Guardian). A deep inventory system allows you to customize and equip your character with a multitude of clothing, weapon and armor options as well as assign XP to level-up in a variety of areas from Attributes, Skills, Feats, and Force Powers. Combat is based around the ‘D20’ RPG rule-set popularized in ‘Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)’, and while round-based, players are able to queue up actions and run them simultaneously in real-time. Finally, Character interaction is via a dialogue menu that is rumored to contain over 2000 lines of text, clearly geared toward maximizing player choice across multiple playthrough’s. While the broad strokes are seemingly representative of standard RPG fare, three elements serve to distinguish this title from the rank and file – 1.  The ability to switch to | customize | play as any character in your group provides for great overall variety 2. The campaign is well-paced with ‘Third Person’ gameplay broken up by ‘Rail-shooting’, ‘Stealth’, ‘Racing’, and ‘Gambling’ mini-games and 3. Deep customization options, lots of side-quests and the sheer glee of roaming the Star Wars universe adds great replayability to this title. Sound Design is also particularly noteworthy, with voice-acting, sound effects and background score composition all top-shelf. Well optimized K&M controls round out a well polished title.Flaws: There is little to gripe about here, and perhaps the game’s biggest ‘flaw’ is its dated graphics - which have not aged particularly well - but it’s a testament to the overall strength of this title that it remains not only playable, but immensely engaging, despite this. Other minor issues include somewhat repetitive combat, and some minor character pathfinding issues.Overall, ‘Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’ is an erstwhile classic from another time, rich in Star Wars lore, with a deep, engaging campaign, a fantastic background score, compelling combat mechanics, high replayability and filled with iconic characters, plot twists, and moral complexities. This is a title you could easily lose yourself in for 50-60 hours on a single-playthrough, and that’s even before player-choice dictates your ultimate path to the Light or Dark Side.

												Alright, hands down my favorite Bioware rpg released ever. A great story that allows serious plot changing options such as killing off companions or finding out their individual personal stories. Great graphics for the time period and some of the most entertaining star wars lightsaber combat, beaten only by the Star Wars Jedi Knight series. Not to mention the STELLAR voice acting.With the recent announcement of EA purchasing the patent for KOTOR 3, this is a great item to pick up to get you into the realm of KOTOR.But how much could they have changed compared to the realm of star wars might you say? A but ton that's what.Ok to start with, the game takes place 4000 years before the movies and revolves around a wide spread jedi council. You are , (with as few spoilers as I can manage to describe this in) travelling across a set of 8 unique planets and locations where you can interact with tons of sidequests.One more entertaining sidequest (Non Main Story Spoilers) on Manaan where you act as a lawyer/detective and attempt to prove a man in court either innocent or guilty. Which winds up being a lot more fun than expected due to the depth of the investigation process and the trial interactions.However, I do have a few complaints about the game.First, the beginning sequence is AWFUL. The first time through it is entertaining to an extent, but if you want to start a fresh playthrough, you are often discouraged due to the length and lack of interest the beginning sequence holds. Once you are off Taris(the starting planet) however, the game's pace drastically improves. (Note: However there are mods to solve this issue should you find them necessary)Also, the main character is unvoiced, while it is kind of nice not having to hear one or two voices for all of your characters, the addition of voice and voice editor would have made the game that much better.Let's also not forget the utter lack of animations. Let's see, the game has about 5 death animations, 2 talking animations and very ugly running animation. Leading to a severe lack of depth visually.All other complaints I may think of are tiny things about the game that I take as a personal disliking based on taste, not anything that drastically affects the title. Overall, pick up this game if you like RPGs. You won't be disappointed in the slightest.			"

												-----------------------------[SPOILER FREE REVIEW]-----------------------------A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but oddly familiar.Oh boy, this game. Bioware nailed it again.When I first played it when I was about 10 years old or so I didn't like the fighting system really. The game was available on four different CDs to install. I couldn't finish it back then because of bugged boss fight. Now, around march this year I began playing it and got super hooked and finished it the same month.IntroductionWhen you start you get to create your character with a set of heads different to both genders that you can choose, class, starting statistics and skills that you can hover over or smthng so it'll tell you what they are for, so while this could be overwhelming for some people it's explained well. You play as a soldier and start on Endar Spire cruiser. The action takes place ~4000 years before our canon Star Wars movies. You serve for the republic. You wake up and learn basic gameplay mechanics. Short Gameplay ReviewWell about the gameplay because I said I didn't enjoy fighting in this game when I was young: the game has an active pause and it kinda plays like a paper RPG with many different stats rolling your chance to hit a target etc. This can be considered a con if you want something like a Jedi Knight game but it works really well here and makes the gameplay strategic and all of your skill upgrades give you satisfaction when then help you win. You fight with up to 2 partners on your side at once and you can choose skills for them as well, just make sure to disable auto-promotion for them.You can play melee in this game from the start in the form of vibroblade. I don't want to spoil it to you so I'll just say that there are at least 4 different paths you can take in designing your character and only one of these is gunning people down. I'm not saying that gunning people down is empty and boring: there are also many abilities and weapons for that! When you play you'll understand because if you want to go melee you'll have to chose one of 3 paths.The World Here, Presented & Mass Effect ComparasionNow more about this world: Sith soldiers look dope af. Republic soldiers look authentic too. It doesn't look like episode 4 or anything, it's new and fresh but it fits Star Wars theme very well. The planets have quite a lot of story to them and you can talk to many NPCs and get many sidequests. Your choices have some consequence and you can gain light and dark side points depending on your actions. After finishing KOTOR I can safely say that this is the best Star Wars story ever told alongside Original Trilogy (ep. 4-6). Doesn't have none of the Death Star nonsense you and I already got bored of! The plot is very interesting and dialogues with your partners are 10/10. You can spend a lot of time talking to them and sometimes the game will prompt you that something is wrong with one of them and you should talk to them but it's not necessary, however this is the real icing on the cake. This game is kinda like Mass Effect and it's even made by the same guys: Bioware. If you want a good Star Wars story then definetely buy this! However, now let's go into some technical issues...The Rollercoaster of Emotions: Technical IssuesKnights of the Old Republic II got updated on Steam with new resolutions as far as I'm concerned and - workshop. This one on the other hand requires some outside programs for you to enjoy 1920x1080. Another problem is that cutscenes are prerendered videos that will not play in 1920x1080 res no matter what. It isn't a big issue unless they don't play for you at all... If you don't set up your mods correctly for higher res then it might disable cutscenes, and cutscenes have also some tendency of making setting up your resolution crash the game. After you figure it out though you can get around 50h out of this game in one playthrough.This isn't Republic Commando - this game is long.50 hours is a lot of game time for a game that is all gold. The begining can be a bit of a chore but when you get hooked you will sometimes play 4h straight! This game is such a classic...The Force is Strong in my EardrumsNow to music: it's not John Williams, there is some hints to him eg. Bastilla's Theme has some moments sounding like Force Theme. There is a lot of interesting music that you can chill out to in this game or get pumped up. As for graphics they are rather bad but they don't make the game any less enjoyable than if it had Battlefield graphics for me. This is same stuff as Mass Effect 1: it's old but it stands out because of the great, belivable world, your partners and the story in the game. Conclusion AKA Great Wall of Text, RecommendationsMy visit in this world was great and totally worth the time. The game's stuck in my head ever since March. I'm still waiting for a right time to begin playing the sequel. If you want a good Star Wars story then it's a must-play, if you love Mass Effect then it's a must-play, if you want to play a good RPG then it's a must-fu**ing-play. Don't make the mistake of spoiling yourself this story without first playing it, no need to watch other reviews. Wait for some discount, get it and try it out! If you want to then bother getting higher res with mods, if you don't then play full oldschool mode and swap your monitor with your old one that you still keep in the basement.LET'S SUMMARIZE:Graphics: Worse than Mass Effect 1 but they don't break the immersion or anything, the world is still very belivable and badass.Audio: Great voice acting, varied languages (as in: you get to listen to alien languages as well). Music is top notch.Gameplay: Strategic, if you like games with active pause system and paper RPGs you will love it. If you want a fast paced game then it's not for you. Skill upgrades give satisfaction and more than make up for the lack of Jedi Knight-like combat.Story & The World: Very belivable, you'll get hooked so hard! Best Star Wars story alongside Original Trilogy.Characters: Your partners have a ton of dialogues, a lot more and less scripted than Mass Effect. They're very varied and tell your their point of view on stuff, they'll argue with you but if they see that you have a point they will be sorry later on for being too aggressive. They are very human, as in they act like real, but they aren't all human.Skills, Upgrades, Equipment & Weapon Arsenal: More than a decent amount of weapons & upgrades, the progession system of skills and abilities is very cool! Lots of replay ability in this. Hell, you even get many different grenade types, mines, usables in form of adrenaline. Lots of different armour types that make all game styles viable, different headgears, belts, implants...Final Score, so if you like numbers...Overall the game would get a perfect 100/100 from me but it requires too much hussle to get working properely with AD 2016 standard of resolution and even X years ago when I played it as a little guy there were some bugs, and now there were some bugs too. A bit of odd gameplay decisions in some areas that don't work too well.The payoff however, is superb! This is a hard choice for me. From the perspective of playing this over half a year ago I want to give this game a perfect score but I remember that there was some negative things in it and I even pointed them out in the review. This game definetely deserves to be a part of the Canon.I'm gonna give it a score of 99/100. Might've increased the score slightly because of the nostalgia, but ffs: this game is so great now so imagine how great it was back when it was released in 2003! Don't get it spoiled to yourself by watching it on Youtube, IT'S DA*N WORTH PLAYING AND THAT'S IT! There is a reason why I bought it 2 times.			"

												If you've never played this game I pity you as much as I'm excited for you. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is the love-child of early Lucas Arts and Bioware (that should be an amazing sign right off the bat) released in 2003.  This game, widely and massively regarded as one of (if not THE) the best Star Wars games by the Star Wars fanbase, is absolutely notorious for its amazing storyline and characters. Set in an era over 3000 years before the events of the prequel movies, KOTOR is an experience which takes you back to a time where a threat greater than incompetent Stormtroopers and hordes of Battle Droids looms over the galaxy. Pros:----------A brand new Star Wars experience. KOTOR takes place in an era before any current Star Wars film. This leads to multiple things. The setting and theme is fresh and new, despite taking place in a setting far older than the Original, Prequel, or Sequel trilogy of Star Wars films. The conflict and enemies are new, widespread, and deadlier than ever. Despite taking place in ""the Old Republic"" the game is fresh and new in almost every way.Multiple hours of meaningful story. KOTORs story isn't something you simply walk through, it's something you grow and progress with. KOTORs story is an experience. You're not instantly the all-powerful Luke or Anakin Skywalker of the story. You progress instead. The game isn't something you simply rush through in 10 hours while destroying all in your path, its something that can take as long as 40-50 hours to get through. The flow of the story is perfect. It glides with you side-by-side. It never rushes ahead and it never falls behind. It's neither too fast nor is it too slow. Its pacing is great. Meaningful sidequests. One of my favourite things about KOTOR is how many sidequests are in the game. Now this might sound like a major negative to some, lots of sidequests usually means lots of useless, grindy, annoying tasks where you kill ____ amount of enemies and your only reward is some money and a pat on the back, but that's anything except the case with this game. One of the things KOTOR does best is how well it makes its sidequests matter. You won't ever find any sidequests to be repetitive or the same as the last. All sidequests are unique with their own characters, issues, rewards, backstory, and even consequences depending on how you play your cards. Some sidequests require certain things, some require certain companions. Some sidequests are as big as helping destroy hordes of enemies, while others are as simple as passing someone who needs help in the street or in a bar. All sidequests are unique and worth doing.Diverse, interesting, and lovable characters. Bioware is known for its ability to write amazing characters and KOTOR is prime example of that. From Humans to Twi'leks to Selkath to Droids, you'll find that KOTOR has interesting characters from a wide array of different backgrounds and species. All unique in their own ways. Unique combat system. I've heard multiple people compare KOTORs gameplay to D&D. KOTORs gameplay style is a combination of action and RPG fighting styles that make for interesting strategic combat. Planning, skill talents/abilities, items, and companions all play vital parts in KOTORs combat. While some dislike KOTORs combat system I'd say the majority of people enjoy it and find it refreshing. Different environments and enemies are also plentiful.Different Paths. KOTOR is a Role Playing game. This means you can be whoever you want to be. Want to be the guy who helps old ladies cross the streets? Go ahead. Want to be a hate-fueled fighter who'll fight anybody? Go ahead. Want to be a credit-loving vigilante who'll take up any form of work? Go right ahead. You can choose a wide array of options suited to who you'd like your character to be. Gives the game lots of replayability as well. Supports modding. Should you ever wish to spice KOTOR up on your next few playthroughs there are plenty of graphical and even a few story mods you can install for your game. Some mods even add new companions. While the KOTOR modding community isn't insanely massive there's always new ways to spice your game up.----------I've played through this game (as wells as KOTOR II) so many dozens of times I can't even remember what my first character looked like or what his name was. Both KOTOR games (as well as BFII and TFU) were basically my childhood, and are still massive parts of my love for Star Wars, the Old Republic era even being my favourite era in Star Wars to this day. I'll always recommend this game to people. You shouldn't consider yourself a ""true Star Wars fan"" until you've played through this game.If you thought Biowares Mass Effect series was the pinnacle of their RPG storytelling just wait until you play this game.Buy this game.

												People. You can call me crazy, stupid, insane, but you're looking at the greatest RPG ever made. Not only for it's time but even to present day this game is completely unique and unmatched by any other RPG aside from Fallout and Mass Effect. 100% of gamers won't regret this purchase.

												Are you a fan of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale? Then this game is a must play. It's a classic Bioware RPG. Obviously, it's not Medieval style, but set in space and instead of magic you get the Force.PROS:- good, compelling plot- your ""band of misfits"" and team progression- variety of worlds to explore- ""detective"" quests- character development- background and enhancement of Star Wars lore- old school gameplay mechanics with pausable combat- lightsabers- graphics is oldish nowadays, but it's still coolMEH:- I believe the soundtrack doesn't try hard enough, it could be better, with more obvious themes for different planets- shopping is kind of optional, you can get by with items found on dead bodies and looted from chestsCONS:- pazaak gambling gets boring, Witcher made gambling much more interesting- some bugs, for example your companions frequently block your way or start the fight when you intend to just sneak byBefore playing KOTOR I wasn't a huge fan of Star Wars lore. Now I begin to like it all! The game gives you a lot of background and information on specific races, planets, history of the galaxy. It's definitely one of the best RPGs I've ever played!

												Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic is a fantastic game. It really doesn't get better than this. The amazing Story, the fun gameplay, the likeable characters , everything seems to be perfect on this game. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that considers himself a Star Wars fan, and loves the Old Republic era. And after playing KOTOR, you should definitely give KOTOR 2 a try. (Sadly I doubt there would ever be a KOTOR 3)I have heard people having issues while running this game(specially in new hardware), but I can't really say anything about that. The game played normally on my computer, with no problems.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic is not a game that would only satisfy Star Wars fans, nor should it be played by only them. It is one of the masterpieces of RPG genre. Whether you really know anything about Star Wars universe does not matter much. If you are a true follower of the genre, you should definitely play this game.

												So good! I was skeptical about the gameplay when I used to watch videos of this game but it works really well. You have 20 levels to rank up jedi powers, combat skills and feats (your starting class determines which of these 3 categories gets the most points per level up). A jedi power available is force lightning, a combat skill is something like flurry which increases your number of attacks but they deal less damage and might not hit and a feat is which type of armour you can wear or other passive benefits.Combat is played on a turn-based dice roll system which might sound off-putting but works out well. Throughout the game you will meet characters who join you on your spaceship and you may choose 2 of them to accompany you outside of the ship. Companions will have their own stats, gear and skills so you can play around this (if you come across a companion with high lockpicking you might choose not to level your own and swap to this companion to unlock things for you). You can choose to level up your companions skills manually or automatically. You can choose preset combat manoeuvres for yourself and companions such as ranged attacking or jedi support (buffs and heals) or you can choose to manually decide you and your parties actions by pausing the combat and assign attacks and items to a queue. You also don't have to use companions at all, you can elect to play in a solo mode where all the exp gained from enemies will go straight to your character. You also don't have to worry about this mode because companions will automatically be boosted to your level if you haven't used them.How you play the game is up to you. I went for a dual-lightsaber character with light armour and attack bonus jedi powers but you can play as a sniper, explosives expert, jedi caster or even unarmed fighting. The story is really what made the experience for me however. You will travel to multiple planets, gain your own starship, meet interesting characters and get to interact with almost every NPC you come across with multiple lines of dialogue and character development. One downside to this game is that you can't play in a widescreen resolution without using mods (although guides can be found for this on the forums here on steam, along with HD mods and many others).

-Quick Review-Knights of the Old Republic (Also known as: KOTOR) is an RPG that BioWare developed in 2003. KOTOR implements conversational dialogue where choices are made between different interactions the main character can make various ethical decisions, solve puzzles, provoke, chastise, forgive, extort, and more. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  You are a crew member of a republic ship named the ""Endar Spire"", after creating your character you awaken to find that your ship is under siege from the Sith forces, you need to use your class-specific-skills to slice, pew, or sneak your way past the Sith troops.As you progress through the game there are probably HUNDREDS of sub-stories that you encounter, including 9 different characters with their own unique back stories. When it comes to story time, few do it as well as KOTOR.For my fellow Star Wars Junkies, this game takes places during the ""Old Republic"" era, not long after the Sith wars (or Jedi Civil War). The lore on this game is very good, you get to visit Kashyyk, Korriban, Tatooine, Yavin, Manaan, Dantooine, and a few more KOTOR specific planets.

 Game Play: This is the part where I stop praising the wonderful lore and story of the game... I have been replaying this game on steam, I had actually spend many hundreds of hours on this game when I was a kid... I had forgotten that the game is rather buggy, and your character gets stuck often.There are ways to get around the flaws (teleport back to your ship, or switch characters and run as someone else), but the inconvenience is VERY obnoxious. Others may not encounter these problems, but my point is the game hasn't aged very well at all.Bug's aside, the auto level up feature in the game is definitely suggested for beginners, however I was an idiot when I first played this game and would create characters who had skills they had no business in specking into. (For example; a soldier with high intelligence and focused on the persuasion skill)The Game play really doesn't get rolling until after you've escaped the Endar Spire and Taris, then you get to chose between having Jedi, Droids, or range fighters by your side. The strategies in the game really start to shine once you get into situations you cannot win with default combat alone. (For example; trying to get off Taris without leveling up the main character... I had to heavily rely on grenades) Something should be said for the detail and complexity of the combat system in the KOTOR series, if you don't want to learn how it works, just auto level up and you should be able to get through the story. (However, there are parts and fights that will elude you unless you get creative.)

 Achievements: There are no Steam achievements for  KOTOR, that doesn't mean there is no challenge or difficulty... Someday I'll need to try to speed run and/or try to see if I can beat it without my whole party wiping (game over). Price: Knights of the Old Republic is priced at $9.99 that's a pretty fair price for most RPG's. Since this game is rather old, I would recommend waiting for a 50-75% off sale, I got my copy from a Humble Bundle. (Humble bundle was like ""Heyyyy Atratzuuuuu, GiveUsYourMoney!"" and I exclaimed ""No! I'm trying to pay back college loans!"" And Humble bundle retorted with ""It's a Star Wars Bundle."" And then I threw my wallet at my monitor...)

 Conclusion: I cannot speak for everyone, but this has always been one of my most favorite Star Wars games, even with the various bugs while running the game, I still intend to play through the game at least once via steam.The game should easily take about 25-40 hours... depends on how easily you're side tracked... if you're a completionist like me you'll probably be looking closer to 50 hours, and then if you want to replay to help/screw the NPC's you screwed/helped, you can easily double your time spent.Let's put it in a simple pro's vs con's list:Cons: graphics are old, characters get stuck, not much aesthetic customization, combat is more complicated than it needs to be, cheap tactics to get you to replay the game, screen resolution limitations, and lastly Bastila Shan and Carth Onasi as main characters.Pros: HK-47 and Jolee Bindo... Trust me - they're awesome. Good story telling, skills/talents/stats are highly customizable, multiple endings and multiple endings to sub-stories, props for all the voice recording required for this game, and the appearance of familiar star wars themes/planets/factions.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 20, 2015:I recently turned on V-Sync in my graphic settings, and that has removed all ""getting stuck"" after combat and interactions. Which has already improved the game 100% (it's a pain switching characters, or saving and reloading to move again).Update September 17, 2015:Added screenshots to review.Here's the URL to see my review for  Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords "

												Awesome story that has multible endings; light/dark side endings.Very memorable characters, very good combat system.Good Moral choices; choose to help people in trouble with bounty hunters/ect, help the man/woman in trouble, accept bribe and walk away, or help then demand payment, dark side/light side actions, let people go or kill them, etc.Every decision you make affects the story and how the characters/world act and talk to you; light/dark side choices, killing off companions, choosing to help people or not changes things, etc.Great level up system; can choose between many force powers, and melee or ranged weapon atacks/passives, many stats to upgrade, etc.Very interactive companions; you get many companions as you play, what you do affects how they act and talk to you, some things you do before can affect if you even get some of them, you can talk to them and learn their history, and develop a mild romantic relationship with some of them, they fight and argue amongst themselves, etc.Good variety of weapons; rifles, pistols (can duel wield), swords (can duel wield), duel-blade swords, lightsabers (can duel wield), double-blades lightsabers, gernades, mines.Only complaint is the companions walk rather close to you at times and can trap you in a doorway, corner of a hallway, etc. "

												A true classic.+ Simple combat system that pretty much anyone should be able to enjoy.+ A good story with twists you wont see coming.+ Pizaak, because who needs a game when you can play a game within a game. It’s all about those credits baby!+ Decisions that effect the outcome of the game.+ Things can get dark!+ Good characters, good voice acting.+ Not a very hard game, I think anyone could enjoy it.All these are pretty minor annoyances:- Carth, just a whiny meat bag.- Dated graphics (hey it was originally release in 2003!)- Parts of the interface are a little confusing.- Minor graphical things, like on Windows 10 when a movie plays the window will minimize and you have to click to reopen it.TLDR;Save the republic and Jedi, or crush all your foes in one foul swoop. I’m not your mom, do what you want. Graphics are dated but the game is an instant classic and worthy of any RPGers time.			"

												Star Wars KOTOR is regarded as one of the best RPG games of all time. I admit, it's not as grand and open as The Elder Scrolls or Fallout. It's closer to that of Dragon Age. PROS:  The game is everything Star Wars It opens up a whole new area of lore, events, story, characters not seen in the movies It has a great RPG aspect, letting you choose your character, party, and slight storyline. The game lets you decide the fate of some quests & how your party members get along with you and others. A well-done karma system is also in place, letting you choose the light side or the dark side You have a fully customizable character build, you star with selecting your base class, but can place your attribute and skill points where you wish. Weapon usage is also your choice. Like blasters? Shoot some Sith. Swords? Slash some Sith. Lightsabers? SLice your foes with your badass laser stick!  LIGHTSABERS, who doesn't want one?![* Lightsabers are customisable with their crystals, changing stats and their colour. CONS:  Old graphics, but still looks beautiful. Could POSSIBLY get a texture mod somewhere. The game is also being fan remade (3rd and 1st person view) and will be available at some point. Nothing else, this game is near perfect. "

												SInce this game has been out for close to 13 years now, I'd heard a lot about before I finally bought it. I love this game. While its age does show in the graphics and there are a few bugs because it wasn't meant to be played on current OS (which there are multiple easy solutions to) Knights of the Old Republic continues to shine through.The combat system is built like a D20 tabletop game with all the calculations done in a nano second.The gameplay, while not for everyone, I enjoy.And the part that everyone talks about, the story. Oh my goodness. The plot is spectacular and I wish that I hadn't spoiled it for myself. The story is honestly the best part of KotOR.So if you want the best Star wars experience, play Knights of the Old Republic. If you enjoy an amazing story with interesting characters and character devolopment, Play Knights of the Old Republic, If you just want to play a good RPG, play Knights of the Old Republic.This game does not disappoint.

Knights of the Old Republic is one of the greatest RPG Games ever developed. I highly recommend this to any Star Wars & RPG Fan.KOTOR is best played with K1 Restoration mod and Brotherhood of Shadow: Solomon's Revenge mod (both are compatible with each other).Pros+ Far better than SWTOR (also known as the game that killed Revan)+ Storyline is intense, revelations that will leave you speechless (unless you're stupid like me and decide to look at a Youtube playthrough and ruin the ending for yourself)+ Aside from the main storyline there are plenty of side quests you can do to keep you busy for hours+ The fate of the entire galaxy is placed in your hands, as you search for clues to the mysterious 'Star Forge' you can either help people or destroy them+ Excellent voice acting that fits perfectly into the storyCons- Game has the potential to crash at the most inconvenient times (happens less on the Steam Version)- No Achievements or Steam Trading Cards- Textures & Graphics are a bit dated, but thankfully there's a bunch of mods that aims to fix that- Camera in the Ebon Hawk is zoomed far too close to the character (There's a mod that fixes this)- Unlike in K2, you can't have much of a conversation with HK-47 or T3-M4My Rating: 10/10 (Recommended) "

												This is not only the game that got me into Bioware, but it might be my first RPG I actually tried to get good at and learn the mechanics of; setting the oath for my love of RPG's as a whole. It's not perfect and it can be argued if it aged well or not, but it's a lot of fun to play and has a great story if you let it suck you in.The game itself follows the tried and tested D&D rules like many Bioware games, with this game using a variation of 3rd/3.5 Edition rules; at least that's what it reminded me of. Put simpler; Dexterity for guns, Strength for melee. Feats add to abilities, skills and the like and force users essentially get a magic bar and the choice of powers every few levels. There's also the use of the ever present Dark side/Light side choice in Star Wars. This is mainly to affect opinions of your team mates in some conversations, but it also provides cheaper Force use for certain powers if they conincide with your alignment (Spamming Lightning never became easier!). It's nice simple, it works. There are a few useless powers and feats, but really, that's subjective on my part and there's probably someone out there for every combination.As for the atmosphere and world building, I won't go into too much detail. It's Bioware, by this point we all know that Bioware can excel at this. I will say though that by being set years before the movies, there's a nice chance to set up some new villains and situations that provide a nice background to everythgin; I'd say the whole story is a huge point in the games favour.Like I said though, the games not perfect. It's hard to ignore that the levels you visist are essentially successions of corridor after corridor. There's one path that reaches the end, sometimes you divert off it for secrets, but the apth is always there. The game tries to disuguise this, and I admit, it took me a while to catch on, but it's there, and hard to ignore once you notice. Not to mention, without spoiling it, the end game can feel a little sloggish with how it handles itself. It can be fun, but your first time, without expecting it, prepare for a lot of reloads.Still, despite all that, the game's a tonne of fun to play and I love to return to it once in a while. I'd easily say it's worth every penny and should be played by everyone at least once; wholeheartedly reccomended			"

I'd have to CTRL-ALT-DEL just to kickstart the graphics. There was also a loading error 75% of the time. If it didn't load, I would have to close it out thought task manager, then go back in, CTRL-ALT-DEL to kickstart the graphics again, and attempt to load once more. Every cutscene minimized the game.All that aside, I played the entire game, start to finish. That says a lot about how awesome KOTOR is.			"

The Best Star Wars RPG out there.   10/10 This is one of the best RPGs I've ever played. This is probably the best Star Wars game ever made, and anyone who likes RPGs or Star Wars should play it. Even today, despite its age, this game is still amazing. The graphics are dated sadly, but that shouldn't put anyone off.The overall storyline will mainly be the same, but everyone is likely to have their own experiences with this game. You get to choose your actions, and what your character says, and everything you do will guide you torwards the light or the dark side. There is so much satisfaction by the end of the game whether you choose one side or not, and the side that you do choose will affect the ending. The story is where the real experience is, there are so much likeable characters, there are side stories among the main stories that give yoiu more if you invest in them. The story also contains a lot of twists and shocking moments throughout.There is so much content to this game, examples of this are the main story, side missions,  Bounties, character backstories, swoop races, gambling and more. My playthrough of this game lasted about 30 hours, not completing every task.I loved the characters in this story, you have a powerful enemy, and come across a variety of colourful side characters in the storyline. You recruit unique characters into your team as you progress, a Jedi, a Chewbacca, an Assasin Droid, a Utility Droid, a Bounty Hunter, Alien species and more. You will need to choose which ones you are bringing with you on each mission, and sometimes that isn't easy.The combat was great, and enjoyable. I guess it can be a get easy when you're the correct level. You get to create your own Lightsaver which is fantastic, which can then be upgraded. I loved my Green Double Bladed Lightsaver. You equip weapons, and when enemies spot you, auto combat will begin, you can switch between controlling yourself and allies. As the combat occurs, you can choose a skill/attack for your characters turn. Its a mix of real time action with turned based combat.You can unlock force abilities, upgrade stats of your team members, purchase droid teammates upgrades, purchase armor/weapons for you and team members. There are a lot of different weapons for you to find, and set to your team members. There are a lot of options to play how you want.			"

												Well, it has finally happened. After years of constant recommendations from friends and the broader community, I have played and completed what is considered to be the quintessential Star Wars game; a near unanimous masterpiece and supposedly one of the best role-playing games of all-time.Was it worth it? Did it live up to expectations? That big, blue thumbs-up should give you an idea.There is so much I would like to say about Knights of the Old Republic, but in such a small character limit. As already indicated by the thinly-veiled reviews, years of support and playthroughs beyond counting in more recent titles, BioWare is a developer I still continue to hold in high regard as a team that has delivered some unmatched personal favourites over the years and truly memorable experiences. Knowing next to nothing of KotOR and very little of Star Wars lore in general then, you can imagine the surprise of finding a video game that lives up to its enduring legacy and, even more so, the regret of not having played it sooner.  There will not be any spoilers or discussion of the narrative here, nor even a basic or general premise, suffice to say that it is that good - you should experience it for yourself.What I will say however is that to be more than twenty hours into the first playthrough and have such a massive plot twist hit - completely unforeseen and unexpected - is indicative of the level of quality that Knights of the Old Republic shows.Building on the classic formula of design and narrative that would later come to influence the likes of Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins, the writing here is absolutely top-notch, as to be expected in a BioWare game. All the companions and party members are fleshed out and gradually present enthralling stories through a tonne of meaningful exposition... and romance, if you so desire. Reminiscent of the many hours spent in Origins, the pacing and strategic depth to combat is remarkable and lightsaber gameplay is some of the best out there. A definitive step between the design choices of both old and newer games, KotOR is heavily reliant on the many stats, factors and attributes that are running behind the scenes and a welcome reminder of the RPGs of yesteryear. Chaining abilities together is immensely entertaining, especially dark side powers, and carving through a group with lightsabers is just as good as it sounds.As overwhelming as the recommendation may be however, KotOR does have flaws. Tactics for the A.I. are decent enough but navigating and establishing a set of commands between enemies for a single character, (let alone an entire party), can often feel clunky and slow to respond. Invisible walls are aplenty, (common for games of the time), but you will also find yourself stuck on geometry a lot - visible or otherwise - and temporarily unable to move. But honestly, these really are insignificant when compared to the game overall and, while noticeable, are hardly a problem. I had no issues with running it on a more recent operating system, though this initial save game was of the base (and unmodded) game. (They are coming up next.)Also, if you have not designed or optimised your character class properly (or party, for that matter), it is likely that you will not enjoy the experience. As was already mentioned, KotOR is heavily reliant on traditional dice-based role-playing and stat factors. A wrong decision in levelling and feat allocation could be unforgiving, leaving you with the option of playing with the difficulty settings or tanking it with health kits and buffs. Play to your strengths and build the party around that or check out one of the many build guides if unsure.Knights of the Old Republic is more than worthy of the success and acclaim that it has earned over the years. A traditional epic in all sense of the word, the enduring BioWare phenomenon is definitely worth your time, regardless of your level of investment in the Star Wars universe.This really is a timeless classic and undoubtedly deserves a place in your library. Recommended, easily.			"

												A Classic, an absolute classic. this PC port of an amazing Star Wars classic, does not disappoint. Knights of the Old Republic brings us the story of Revan and Malak, after their fall to the Dark Side. The story takes us to several familiar worlds, and gives us a little backstory on some of the species we've grown to love. Without giving any spoilers, I will say if you enjoy story-driven adventure and are a fan of the Star Wars universe, you will absolutely love the Knights of the Old Republic. Even though the graphics are a little dated, it is worth the time.			"

There's drama, comedy and a love story thrown in for good measure. The gameplay is amazing. Just twirling your lightsabers while running around is immensely satisfying.

Because of this I nominate it for the ""test of time"" award as it stands the test of time very well and is a worthy experience even today after so many years.

General info~Genre: Role playing game~Number of players: 1~Star Wars related product~Completion time: 30-45 hours~High replay valueStrong points+Variety: Visit places with different geological maps, inhabitants, natural characteristics. Even the “tutorial” planet (Taris) is distinct from the others. You won't find repeatable patterns in this game. Each place has its own story to tell. My advice: Don't rush; take your time and explore.+Music score: A plethora of modern games advertise the “quality” of their music. Mostly it's just a marketing trick. Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) is an exception. The developers put a lot of effort to capture their product's atmosphere in a music sheet. Example: 


YouTube™ Video: Star Wars: KOTOR Music- Manaan (Ahto City) 

			Views: 214,902		

			Music from the video game ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"".		

+Story: “Memorable characters” is a cliché. Numerous titles brand the term in their case cover but only a few actually deserve it. KotOR does. Don't take my word for it. Just try the game and see if Juhani, Jolee or Canderous won't leave a mark on you. This will be a tale about partnership, trust, love, hatred, grief, revenge, anger, maturity, and reckoning.+Liberating experience: This is a game of more actions that words. Albeit a role playing game, KotOR pushes players to be responsible and pick their own path. Every character has a background and follows a moral code. Your protagonist's choices will reflect upon your companions in more than one ways. Aid them and they will aid you back. Betray their trust and see what happens in the course of the story. The game allows you to be whoever you want to.+Grey: Despite being a Star Wars game, KotOR isn't a monotony of light and dark side choices. You can pick grey as easily as you can pick black or white. In that aspect it surpasses even the films in some instances. Are the Jedi the just order and Sith their everlasting evil counterbalance? Are the terms good and bad viable in such context?+Micro-management: Pause the action anytime and give your commands to any member of your team. Sometimes, such management is the difference between success or… reloading the game. Just press “Space” (by default) during combat.+Working bench: Forge weapons, enhance armor efficiency and even craft your own lightsaber piece by piece.+Blend in: Not a Star Wars fan? No problem, neither am I. The story takes you 4,000 years before the events of the first film trilogy. You will meet individuals never seen before and you shall witness how certain groups became infamous in after years. Even if you have never heard of Star Wars before, you will still be able to enjoy the game to the fullest.+Living in the parallel: Fan of Star Wars? This game is for you. You will recognise many familiar patterns. Be alert though: Darth Vader and Darth Malak despite playing a similar role in the two stories they don't necessarily serve the same purpose.+Side questing: Tired of mundane sidequests which involve killing massive amount of weak enemies, fetching items from borings NPCs and ultimately rewarding the player with useless items and questionable currency? From saving a captive spy to playing the attorney for the shake of an old friend, KotOR will make you remember each completed side quest.+Narration: KotOR is one of those games that utilizes your imagination to some extent instead of showing you everything through a cut-scene or an FMV. Listen to your teammates stories, close your eyes and imagine being there with them; in their old tales of youth and inexperience. Gaming as it should be.+Price: Even if you can't wait for a sale, buying it at full price worths it.Weaknesses-Old school dice: KotOR utilizes some mechanics which younger gamers won't recognize or are too lazy to study them for a few hours, such as invisible dice and hidden statistical factors. As a result, if you don't plan your character carefully you might be unable to finish the game. It is advisable to consult some guides before starting a new game.-Graphical issues: This game might be unplayable in Windows 7 or later versions. One common solution is to turn off the grass on graphic options and disable movies. If that doesn't fix the issue (as it did for me on Windows 8.1) consult the helping and friendly community here on Steam.-Limited customization: Unfortunately, the only body part that you are given a choice to meddle with (at the character selection section) is the face; not even the head generally. NPCs suffer from the same banality as well.My rating4.5/5
I'm not a Star Wars fan. Nevertheless, this game reminded me of how a proper title must be developed. Forget the flashy trailers and bright packages. This is gaming at its finest. After 20 years of gaming experience, I feel content to include this game amongst my favourites. "

												Alright to start off this review im going to say i thought this game was going to be full of bugs and crashes.... I was wrongNow this game does very well in every single rpg category for me amazing detailed story, Amazing combat, Great soundtrack/music/sounds and moreThis game had one single problem though when you start up the game and go to make your character when you finish the game will most likely crash.. Now to fix this you will need to go back into the game and go to settings then graphics then advanced... Now turn off FRAME BUFFERING this will stop the crashing from happening.Now i can say that the only con of this game is that you're now playing it right now. This is probably the best star wars game ever made and the fact that you're here reading my of course amazing review its triggering. Now please do us all a favor and yourself and go buy this game... All the negative reviews saying this game is buggy and crashes a lot has to do with their system and not yours. I really recommend to buy this right now because say you do have a few problems that cannot be fixed and they are really bugging you or make the game unplayable then just get a simple refund.Anyways thanks for reading my review and go have an amazing fun time with this gameP.S: I really recommend watching or reading some guides to get past some of the really hard parts in this game it will help you out a lot and save you a hole in your wall :D			"

I have more than 100 hours on my old Xbox, not just the hours i have on steam. Win 10 may glitch the game up, but i managed to play it through with around 10 crashes in my latest playthough.

												I've probably logged at least a hundred hours on the original PC game (who knows where those discs are now) and the mobile port. This is more than just a piece of gaming history. This is possibly the best Star Wars game ever made. If you are a fan of Star Wars and RPGs then you will love this game. If you don't know the story already then don't spoil it for yourself! To truly get the full game experience, you will likely want to play through at least twice, once as a good guy and once as a bad guy.While it was impressive and considered groundbreaking for its time, I would stand it next to many modern AAA games. It is definitely a game that has stood the test of time, as many others have said.It's an absolute steal if you manage to snag it on sale price but I had no hesitation paying the full price for the mobile port.If you have issues running it, you may need to tweak some settings using swconfig.exe in the Steam install folder. As of yet, I haven't had any issues on Windows 10 although I have heard other users have.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. Seriously.Skip to the bottom if you want a TL;DR.According to Steam I've only played 23 hours' worth – that's not true. I've always had weird problems with the whole connection with Steam – one day it'll say I've played 31 hours, the next it'll say I've only played 7. I am pretty sure I've logged over 40 hours of gameplay on this.Not much, when you compare it to other people's times. But I'm not a hardcore gamer. I game when I have some spare time.This game is seriously good.Sure, the combat is a bit odd and clunky, especially if you're used to modern games or if you don't role-play, but give it a bit and it'll feel natural. I actually prefer it.The story is gripping, the characters well-developed.It really does it's job in inserting you into the Star Wars universe, and story wise I have no complaints.One complaint I do have is the length of time you spend running around. It's at least seventy percent of the game. And for some reason it just feels like a real drag.TL;DR?Excellent game, story is brilliant, role-play-style combat system, too much running around.			"

												Great game.  So much nostalgia from my childhood.  Been needing a change from playing Kerbal Space Program and Age of Empires all the time, so I finally decided to play this game again.  Was sad to find out upon launching the game...INSTABILITY ON WINDOWS 10 (I found a solution; keep reading)!!!  The game allowed me to select new game and create a character, but as soon as I launched the gameplay, it would instantly crash.Was able to get the game to work though.  Hope this helps someone:My solution:1.  Go to the game directory for KOTOR (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\swkotor)...for most people; exceptions for example, all my games are saved to HHD on drive F.  Right click on the executable for the game (.exe file) and select Properties.  Go to the Compatibility tab, and check the box which says ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"".  I selected Windows 8 from the drop down menu; if you finish these procedures and it still doesn't work, stry Vista or XP (The Windows 10 instability seems to also affect Windows 7).  Hit OK.3.  Once in game, got to Options and then Graphics.  Deselect Shadows and Grass.  I chose to run the game in 1024 x 768 at 75 Hz refresh for screen resolution (1280 x 1024 was just too small for me).4. Select Advanced Options.  The setting on this page that seemed to make the game crash on me was Frame Buffer Effects.  Deselect this.  I was able to run at High graphics, 8 sample AA (Anti-aliasing), Anisotropy at 16%, and enable V-sunc.These are all the changes I made.  The game appeared stable for the intro scenario and didn't crash.  I will update if this changes as I play farther into the game.Another recommendation I had been given was editing the .ini file to run in windowed instead of full screen mode, but I didn't have to do this to get the game stable (I think) but it's something to keep in mind if your mileage varies from mine.Just in case, here are the instructions I was given for windowed mode:1. Go to swkotor.ini file and open it with Notepad (or Notepad++, etc). This should be located in the game directory.2a. Locate the following line: Fullscreen=1  b. and change it to: Fullscreen=0.3. In the [Graphic Options] section add the following line: AllowWindowedMode=14. Save the file and exit.5. Launch game from directory .exe.  Launching through steam client or steam desktop shortcut will revert changes to this file.Good luck!			"

												By far one of the best RPG games i have played. At first the battle style was very different from what i am used to, but as I progressed farther into the game and i understood it more and the story became more developed I started to really like the battle system. It can either be a faster paced or step by step battle. Also, this game has one of the best storylines i have ever played and the interactive part and choosing light or dark side really made this game what it is. If you are considering buying this game, don't hesitate, just do it.			"

												This is one of the greatest adventure/rpg games of our time, possibly the best star wars game of all time. With relatable and interesting characters, difficult story-line descisions, easter eggs, and loads of replayablity, this game is a classic masterpiece, and in my opinion, the most interesting star wars story ever told. Unfortunately, it's not timeless, as the graphics and controls definitely don't stand up to anything released in the last 5 years. If you can look past the less-than-average controls and graphics, you have a D&D style adventure/puzzle/rpg game that will absolutely blow you away.			"

												A truly amazing game. I originally had this game for the Xbox way back when it was first released. I never really played it that much, although I did complete it and so when I came back to it as I was older, I had vivid memories and details that made the game seem more enjoyable. Every playthrough is amazing, and surprisingly never gets boring. The plot is amazing, although sometimes predictable, and each character has their own background story to do on the side. You can progress with each member and learn of their past and what they want now. With the character story progression, you cna find that 4 or 5 of them will let you into dark or secret parts of their lives that let you venture out and help them cut ties, deal with loose ends or help them find peace. The only downside to this is that you cannot do every party member's side stories, only those you progress well with first.The games engine is out-of-date, however it doesn't take out any value from the many, many play throughs of the game I have completed. The game is simple, yet captivating, and each playthrough is just as good as the last. With the ability to add mods, textures, story-lines and unreleased content, you can be sure to find something new to explore or give yourself a new perspective to enjoy. I could honestly write so much about this game, but there is too much. I can just never play the game without finding everything; doing all of the sidequests, talking and exploring. It's old, it shows little age, and it'll always be one of my favourite Star Wars games of all time!			"

The story in this game is one of the best narratives that I have seen in any Star Wars game. It is Full of great twists and characters. The graphics even by toady standards still looks good. The music is nice especially the manaan theme. The game length is also perfect as it is not too long and not too short. This game has high replay value. Fully recommend this game.  "

												This is a great classic star wars game.There are 3 different classes with different skills and abilities.You better google search for more details on that, might be a little too complex for this review.For example, in certain situations, depending on your abilities, you might be able to intimidate or pursuade people, repair or hack some machinery to help you out, unlock certain doors and containers.There are blasters, melee weapons (swords and lightsabers) and different grenades to use in combat.Aside from that, there is also a variety of force powers you can use, though you have to unlock those abilities with skill points first.Combat is turn based and pausable, so you can plan out fights pretty well.You can switch between your main character and his companions (if you have any) and control their actions in battle - Or you just let the game do it for you.Companions level up as well, and you can upgrade their skills accordingly.Might wanna check some gameplay on youtube if you wanna see what it's exactly like.A lot of times in the game you have to make decisions, which either give you light side or dark side points. This also has an impact on how people react towards you.(Just a heads up: Being a good guy is way more tiresome and expensive. Just kill everyone.)The game runs perfectly for me on Windows 8.1 Professional 64 bit, the only little annoying bug I had fixed itself when turning on V-Sync, though I can't guarantee. Some people have reported problems. You should check out the community hub for that.Any more questions? Feel free to leave a comment.			"

												One of the best Star Wars experiences you could ever have. Knights of the old Republic is an RPG that was made to be on computers. Its controls may seem archaic now but they were a massive step above the original Xbox release. As an RPG there's a lot of depth not only in mechanics but decision making as well. Two of the games strongest features are open ended but linear levels and its moral system. Kotor is a linear game, but it hides this so well through its level design. Each place you travel too feels like its own small world, full of quests and characters to meet. You can spend hours exploring each one of them. The moral system adds weight to your choices and the direction of the story. Other characters in your team may even be influenced by your decisions and affects what force powers you can equip. Its a fantastic game, which admitedly falls apart near the end. Difficulty spikes in the final area end up creating a frustrating experience rather than a fulfilling one. But the journey there is more than worth it. Its one of the great PC classics and as a star wars fan or as a newcomer you can't go wrong here.			"

												Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic ReviewIntro. Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic or KOTOR for short is a classic video game. It is one of Bioware's first RPG it is a very popular game from 2003. This game is the precursor to Bioware's Mass Effect and Dragon Age games.  Pros 1 Star Wars KOTOR is a great roleplaying game with a great story that is comparable to the quality of the starwars movies. It has a very interesting plot with a very imersive world, well written characters, is true to Star Wars lore and is a joy to play through multiple times for the story alone. 2 The gameplay in the game is very fun your decisions in the game have benefits and negative if you decide to follow the dark side or the light side of the force. There are often many different outcomes to a quest, adding more to the replay value. The games combat is similar to dungeons and dragons with attack damage calculated like a dice role, so how much damage you do can depend on luck making the game more challenging. There are also many mini games throughout the story adding variety such as swoop racing, space fights, card games, arena battles and riddles just to name a few. The game does not feel repetitive with all the extra mini games. 3 The mods for this game are wonderfully done there are well over 1000 mods for KOTOR including, KOTOR 1 restoration mod, yavin IV planet mod, Solomon revenge the brotherhood of shadow, and many many more mods. There are many mods that fix parts of the game you may not like mods adding content mods fixing bugs, and mods restoring lost content. Some of the fan mods even have voice acting, 3D textures, dialogue and extra stories that are higher quality than the content in the game. Most KOTOR mods come with a TSL patcher that makes installing and uninstalling them very simple just run the installer to install the mod. Cons 1 A rule is said about KOTOR and that is that it's impossible to run KOTOR without the game crashing on you at least once. The game even crashes in speed runs. The game is really buggy and unfortunately many of the wonderful mods don't help how the game can crash during cutscenes, movies, loading screens and such. The game can be fixed to run well even on modern systems. I have played through the game on windows 10 both the steam and disk version and it had some issues but I was able to beat the game with only a few crashes. The community support to fix any issues you might have is very good but there are many problems in KOTOR due to the game running in a awful engine. Despite you likely having to change game settings a few times and it crashing on you a few times I still recommend the game. If you want a game just like this that is more stable and crashes less try KOTOR the sith lords 2, but I am one of those people who think KOTOR 1 is  better.2 The game is very old and does not look very good. The game looks like a ps2 era game and is quite dated by today's standards. There are many mods that improve the graphics of the game, there are mods the redo most of the textures in the game even texture mods that fix the textures of mod content so if you don't mind installing a few texture mods you can improve the look of the game Its effects animations sounds and much more. The game even with all of the setting cranked all the way up and with all the texture mods the game looks much better but still looks dated but it doest look like its 10 years old if you mod it. 3 KOTOR had some issues with the game being rushed and it having cut content. KOTOR the sith lords had this issue too but that game at least had a new steam update that officially added that mod content into the game, adding controller support, and improving the games performance. Sadly KOTOR 1 does not have these improvements but some day it may get such improvements. The game feels well made in a few areas but empty in other parts of the game. You will want to mod the game to get more content because the old KOTOR series 1&2 had development issues.Thoughts Kotor 1 is a classic and a excellent game despite these issues. if you want a more stable game I would recommend you try KOTOR 2 but I personally found KOTOR 1 much more fun as i have beaten the game multiple times while I liked KOTOR 2 but I could never enjoy it enough to play it through. I think KOTOR 1 had better sound was more imersive as a story, was more fun, and it has more mods than KOTOR 2. The best way to describe this is if mass effect or dragon age was a Star Wars game but older. The game was the first bioware game to have the first ""romance scene"" ;) To ConcludeDo I recommend you buy this game? Yes I do recommend this to anyone who wants a fun game with a great story, TONS of awesome mod content, a game that immersises you in the starwars universe like no other game I have ever played and is really fun and has great replay value. If you consider mod content to the game it has enough replay value to play the game over 12 times playing each class each difficulty, each mod that is incompatible with other mods and playing different decisions. The game is unstable and will crash on you at least once but I found the steam version to crash less than my disk version of the game. I recommend that you buy the game and see all the wonderful mod content, the great story and get immersed  into the world of starwars in a story as good or better than the starwars movies.			"

												Wo fang ich an .. ?Als ich SW:KotoR zum ersten Mal auf der Xbox Classic gespielt hab, war ich ca. 10 Jahre alt.Ich hab das Spiel damals immer und immer wieder durch gespielt ! Nach ca 10 Jahren sah ich das die Star Wars Collection im Angebot ist und hab natürlich zugeschlagen. In dieser Box war zu meinem Glück SW:KotoR 1 & 2 dabei und dachte mir sofort das ich sie unbedingt wieder spielen muss !SW:KotoR 1 ist damals wie heute einfach ein RPG MEILENSTEIN, das Spiel hat eine wirklich sehr gut geschriebene Story die ein jedesmal von neuem fesselt egal wie oft man das Spiel durchspielt. Nach jedem Playthrough finde ich immer wieder Quests und Dialoge die ich noch nie gesehen hab. So jetzt noch eine kurze erklärung vom Spielverlauf: Man erstellt sich am Anfang vom Spiel ein Charackter. Man wählt die Klasse aus verteilt paar Talentpunkte, bestätigt und es folgt Star Wars typisch ein kleines Intro die, die Handlung vom Spiel kurz erklärt. Man startet auf einem Raumschiff das sozusagen als Tutoriallevel funktioniert, in dennen die Spielemechaniken erklärt werden. Die Kämpfe sind Rundenbasiert wärend man sich auf Nah- oder Fernkampf spezialisieren kann. Dabei wird man immer mit 2 weiteren Charackteren begleitet die man im Verlauf des Spieles findet. In dem Spiel gibt es eine Gut-Böse Mechanik, sprich alles was man tut oder nicht tut hat Folgen auf den Verlauf des Spieles.Nun folgt noch eine kleine Warnung:Das Spiel ist frustrierend verbuggt auf Windows 7, ohne gewisse Einstellung und Fixes die man sich aus dem Internet zieht crasht das Spiel fast nach jedem neuen Level (Planet).Deswegen möchte ich noch einmal einige Tipps mitgeben die mir beim spielen geholfen haben: - Im SW:KotoR Ordner gibt es eine Datei die ""seconfig.exe"" heißt, dort müsst ihr unbedingt die Hardware-Maus deaktivieren.Wenn bei euch das Spiel crasht wenn eigentlich eine Video abspielen sollte, müsst ihr leider die Videos deaktivieren.- Im selben Ordner gibt es eine Datei die sich ""swkotor.ini"" nennt dort geht ihr unter ""[Graphics Options]"" und stellt ""FullScreen=1"" auf ""FullScreen=0"". Ausserdem fügt ihr ""AllowWindowedMode=1"" in der untersten Zeile von [Graphics Options] ein. Diese aktiviert den Fenster Modus des Spieles, da es im Fenstermodus weitaus stabiler läuft.- Hier nochmal ein Video auf Englisch der das hier alles nochmal erklärt + einem Fix zum downloaden :

- Das alles fixt jedoch nicht eines der nervigsten Bugs im Spiel: nach einem Kampf kommt es vor das der Charackter sich nicht mehr bewegen kann. Das liegt daran der er noch im Angriffsmous steckt obwohl keine Gegner in der nähe sind. Was dagegen hilft:* Wenn du Glück hast ist noch ein Gegner in der Nähe die diesen Bug beheben können.* Manchmal hilft es einfach mit einem Bgleiter kurz zu reden.* Aber am effektivsten ist es einach zu speichern un neu zu laden.Das sind wirklich die einzigen Bugs die man merkt und wer über sie hinwegsehen kann, dem erwartet ein grandioses Rollenspiel der bis zu 40 Stunden pro Spieldurchlauf fesselt.

												If you are a fan of Star Wars then this is the game for you. Star Wars Knight Of The Old Republic is a role playing game with combat based off the D20 system which allows more strategy over other hack & slash rpgs. With a great story & compleing characters you will be immersed for the full  thirty to forty hours of gameplay. I can't recommend this game more it is a true video game classic & one of the best Star Wars video games ever made. It is truly well worth the money & your time.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic is one of the best games I have ever played. Bioware did a great job with character design and creating an extremely high quality story. The game takes place many years before the events of the Star Wars films during the ""Old Republic"" period. The characters you meet and places you explore are very well done and I could argue that this game is Bioware's best work.If you are a fan of Star Wars or just like a well crafted RPG game, I highly recommend STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™			"

												I just finished this wonderful title today, and it's hard not to be over excited and exaggerate on my review, but I must say; it's a gem. The Star Wars universe feels alive and welcoming in this game, complemented by solid RPG mechanics and an amazing story. Sure the graphics are outdated, but that shouldn’t discourage you from diving into this game. As a GM and amateur game designer, I’ve learned valuable lessons in character progression, level design and overall plot development.If you enjoy RPGs and never played this game, do yourself a favor and buy it. I should also say that the combat isn’t very intuitive, rather more tailored towards strategy, but that’s not a bad thing. I found myself often pausing the game to analyze my surroundings and make the best decisions I could.The game is based on the D&D 3.0 ruleset and it brought me nostalgic tears of joy to have that system powering my journey. One thing I wish was better implemented though, was the Light and Dark balance and point acquisition. I felt like we needed more meaningful choices and moral ambiguities to spice things up, but that might as well be just my personal taste.I haven’t played the sequel yet, but I plan to. I’m now hoping for a third game, with updated graphics and no compromise on mechanics and storytelling. "

												I recommend this game, because even after so many years it's still a pretty good RPG with some memorable characters.BUT!Be warned that, even with additional fan patches, this game seems to have a lot of trouble with modern OS.- There is a bug that after, like, 90% of the battles my character just got stuck and I had to quicksave and reload. Many other people have this issue, but there seems to be no fix for it besides the above-mentioned 'trick', which gets super tedious.- The game crashed at irregular intervals, and it got more frequent the longer I had played. This tends to happen especially while quicksaving or loading, and if it happens during the first, the quicksave file is broken and can't be loaded anymore. That combined with the 'stuck after battle' bug gets INCREDIBLY annoying the longer you have to deal with it.This doesn't render KOTOR unplayable, but I can't say I really enjoyed playing it either. So, if you buy the game, be prepared to face these nuisances too.			"

												Star wars knights of the Old Republic is a master piece and an example of what a game should be. It has memorable characters, fun gameplay, amazing story, great atmosphere, good gameplay mechanics, and doesn't feel stale after 3 replays. Even though textures are very much starting to show their age it still doesn't look bad and even still has some visually stunning areas (I still take a second to admire Mannan). Sadly though, some people are not willing to lookup how to fix the easily fixable issues they are having trying to get the game not to crash and would rather leave a bad review and are thus ruining the score of this near flawless game. I would recommend anyone who is a Star Wars fan to check this game out, anyone who is a RPG fan to check this game out, and just anyone who is able to load up a video game to CHECK THIS GAME OUT. Go in knowing nothing and come out loving everything. 10/10- A truly unforgettable experience			"

												Even today, KOTOR I stands as an excellent example of what an RPG can be, and strongly breaks the assertion that all movie-licensed video games are terrible and cash-grabs. It isn't just a great RPG or a great entry of the Star Wars universe, but is also and quite simply a great video game that can be enjoyed by a wider audience than just RPG and Star Wars fans. Story is an EXTREMLY important part of this game, and a highlight to that as well. You are a Republic soldier on a ship called the Endar Spire, and your goal is to escape before the Sith destroy it. You crash land on the planet Taris, and your adventure unfolds through exploration, character-development, and revelation. Choice is present in this game as well, adding replay-value as well. I cannot give away much about the story without spoiling the game, and it is best to experience it for yourself. Personally, I had no qualms with it, and the game stays true to the Star Wars universe while adding flavours of its own. The setting of 4000 years prior to the movies also makes it so you can appreciate the story without any past knowledge of Star Wars. I would even dare to say that this game easily triumphs over the stories of the movies.How about gameplay? It is a turn-based game with many different weapons (from ranged to melee), powers and abilities that can be disposed against the enemy, and thankfully this game has a lot of different foes to defeat. The layers of strategy are quite endless, as you always have two squad-mates present at any time. Do you charge into battle while they cover you with gun-fire? Do you all throw grenades to make quick work of your foes? Difficulty options are also present, which are nice as some weapon configurations can allow you to be a god while others will leave you crying for mercy. Luckily with squad-mates, this is really a non-issue. There are also side activities, called swoop racing and pazzak, which are fun side games that provide replayability.Also a side note, but combat can be paused to issue commands, and you watch the action unfold. Modifiers can allow you to deal more/less damage, and you can even miss, as the game has a dice-roll mechanic in its turn-based formula.As for graphics, the game is clearly dated by today's standards. In terms of art style, this game is spot on. It retains Star Wars' signature look and style, and developer BioWare has added their own flair and style to it, making the game stand out in this department, and being memorable to that. This can also be said for the sound, which is indentical to what you would expect from the franchise. Lasers to lightsabers all sound spot-on, and both the soundtrack and voice work are fantastic as well. In terms of replayability, the great story and presence of choice already make it a game that you can put multiple playthroughs into. There are also many side quests and lore that you can delve into, and maybe you'll see something that you didn't see before on a second or third playthrough. Even the gameplay can offer up different experiences depending on how you play. My run of the game was about 31 hours, and this was ignoring most side-quests, so you will find your money's worth at $10.99, especially if this game goes on sale. Honestly, this is one of few games I can say I didn't have any personal issues with. Others may differ in opinion, but to me KOTOR was flawless. If you're a Star Wars or RPG fan, this game is a MUST BUY. I'd strongly reccomend it to anyone, however the combat mechanics may turn some off, especially if you loathe RNG. However, in this particular game it comes off as natural and is perfectly fine, unlike the TES III Morrwind combat system, as it is turn-based. If I had to rate this game out of 10, it would definitely be a 10/10, but like every game it does have mechanics that have the potential to be even better. "

												Got the steam version of this game as a gift from a friend, and after playing it two times I'm ready to write down this review. KOTOR is an amazing game with one of the best SW stories so far. It's story is, in my honest opinion, better than anything the new canon has to offer. It's combat system and storytelling is one of the best of it's time. KOTOR's companion sidequests will make you start seeing them as something more than regular companions who just follow you around healing you or tanking damage for you.If you like Star Wars (and want to get into the Legends part of it's lore) and a classic RPG-style game, this game is for you.

												Ahhh, yes.Sweet ol' KOTOR.At first it might seem quite complex to figure out what to do, but once you get a hang of that, playin' will not only become a piece of cake... naw, it'll get you somethin' special.You won't be able to stop yourself from sneaking, looting, shooting, light-sabering, trading, framing, doin' quests, repairing droids, swoop racing, Pazaak playing, lockpicking, droid jamming, Force using, story appreciating, fighting Sith, fighting Jedi, killing mercs, forming your squad, levelling up, upgrading stuff, getting high, killing the Gizka, being rude, being nice, intimidating, persuading, hypnotizing things, getting surprised, trolling your allies, solving puzzles, getting gear, learning Force, planet travelling, relaxing at the beach, earning credits, enjoying the game.Yes.Also, it's Star Wars.

												Just recently bought this game on Steam after owning it for a few years on Xbox. The PC version is far superior (go figure) and it doesn't suffer from any bugs as you may hear as Steam recently updated it to be compatible with up to Windows 8 (and possibly 10). Only buy this game however if you are willing to invest dozens or even hundreds of hours into a game. It's a juicy one boys and girls. Tons of content, multiple paths, many weapon and gear combinations, charming characters, great music, and beautiful environments. A must have for all gamers. P.S. One of the few Star Wars games where a Light Side playthrough is just as rewarding as a Dark Side. XD			"

												I'm a great fan of Bioware. The quality of their games in term of gaming experience is totally something else. Now coming on to one of the best games ever made, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a great addition to Star Wars timeline. Chronologically this games predates the movies by roughly 4000 years. At the time of writing this review this game is more than 13 years old but there wasn't a single moment in the game where I felt like playing an old out-dated game. And this is one great quality for a game to have. Talking about why you should buy this game:Reasons To Buy: You love RPG, you buy it. You love Star Wars, you buy it. Great story progression. Interesting character development. Detailed character upgrade tree. Expands the Star Wars universe in extremely style. Very affordable in price than other games.The game is totally deserving the current price of the game now luckily for me I got it during Star Wars sale so it was a bonus for me. But seriously there is no reason a Star Wars fan shouldn't play this game. Its a must play and must have. Cheers!!!			"

												Despite dodgy AI from non-primary characters, it's still an incredibly timeless game with a great story and a great expansion on Star Wars lore.Feat progression for each individual class can be confusing for first-timers but if attention is paid, it's all quite easy to pick up on. The ability to choose to gravitate towards the Light or Dark side of the Force is fantastic; as is the ability to choose Force powers to go with your choice (ie. Light side powers involve buffing, Dark side powers have things such as Choke and Force Lightning). Obviously the Dark side is a lot more fun, simply due to the dialogue options you have available, the ability to earn a lot more coin and the joy of choking your enemies.Great game.			"

Rank: 9/10Recommendation(s): Like Star Wars, RPG games, and old school game mechanics.Major Theme: This old title shows us how games should be made.Bought at Price: $10.99I have over a thousand hours on Dota 2, 700+ on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and more than enough on Garry's Mod. So why would I play this game if I have plenty of hours on my other games? There's a simple reason for this.Bioware. Yes, the timely company turned EA division, makes this game great.While this game will prove a challenge for people who want non-stop action, this classic title has to be one of the most solid RPG games, if not PC titles ever made. Before I got a Steam account, I played this game with CDs (yes real CDs).There's actual content to the story, and the plot is well thought out and executed. Your actions will have consequences, and will either lead you down to the light or dark side of the force. Beyond just simple dark vs. light, the game offers other ways of having a unique experience.

Using your repair and computer skills, you can clear rooms filled with enemies, or fix up and alter a robot to fight for you. Want to avoid enemies? There's a stealth skill for that. Want to avoid fights in a bar? The persuasion skill is your go to skill. Maybe you even want to have the most powerful force powers available to you? There's a way to go about that as well. The only limiting part of the game is base story, which should be entertaining and engaging. It can be a little dry, as there is a lack of humor, but this title does very well considering its ESRB rating (Mass Effect isn't in the same boat).

As always, it wouldn't be a Bioware game without companions. Each offers something unique, and will progress your back story which isn't mandatory.

Downsides? Well every game has some which isn't surprising. For being an old title, the graphics are very simple. If you failed to notice the processor requirement of an Intel Pentium 3, then I'm not sure what to say. There's nothing you can really do to improve the graphics of the title, but there are certainly ways to modernize them. By default the game is only compatible with a 4:3 ratio monitor. By using third-party utilities, you can resolve this and get a better experience with a now standard 16:9 monitor.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427275987Being an old school game, it does have all the “attributes” available. Yes, you will have to micro manage things like points in “wisdom” and “dexterity”. If you want to avoid all of that, play with the “auto upgrade” button. The game does also have a “dice roll” system, where there are chances to miss/hit and not do complete damage. Mass Effect 1 carried on from this, in case you were wondering where that game got its mechanic from.All in all, this title should impress you for being so old, yet being so solid. Why games aren't being made like this anymore, who knows..			"

												FIRST OFF, IF YOU ARE CRASHING AFTER CHARACTER CREATION ON WINDOWS 10, DISABLE FRAME BUFFER AND SOFT SHADOW. YOU'RE WELCOME.TL;DR: Knights of The Old Republic is a classic RPG and an essential purchase for Star Wars or RPG fans. If you are a casual gamer, or do not want to any reading, I would pass on this game. The textures may be outdated, but the gameplay and atmosphere stand strong. The depth of this game is incredible, and titles like these come MAYBE once a decade.So, I get why you make not like KOTOR.It's slow to start. You have to learn D&D terminology and do a little internet research to make a good build. It's turn-based and feels awkward at times. The narrative drags along at first, and since you don't begin as a sith-slaying god like Obi-Wan or Skywalker, you may want to quit out of boredom.But honestly, please give this game a few hours to see if you like it. Knights of The Old Republic is one of the best and most in-depth things about the Star Wars franchise, and definitely their best game next to Battlefront II and Republic Commando.You begin as a lowly republic soldier whose fate lines up with some heavy hitters in the galaxy. While KOTOR sort-of starts off like Morrowind, where you assist a character in saving the world, it is soon up to you to bring down the Sith armies and rival gangs, and to restore order to the galaxy.On your journey, you will have to make many black-and-white moral decisions that have little to no ambiguity, and pretty barebones consequences. I don't really mind this honestly: it's Star Wars, not exactly a franchise known for grey areas.You will also meet many well-rounded and relatable characters along the way: Carth Onasi is a hardened Republic soldier who's seen more than his fair share of combat, and holds deep inner turmoil for what happened in his past. He tries to keep on the mission at hand, and is a strong leader despite his occasional cynicism.Mission Vao and Zaalbar are two rebellious, street-smart characters who are on the run, and have to look out for each other to survive. Their bond reminds me of something out of a movie.And the list goes on. KOTOR's allies that you discover on your journey to the light or dark side are ultimately what make this game so much fun. You may often see your allies talk amongst themselves, and occasionally even fight over small issues. This creates a sort of humanity and real vibe to the world you are playing in.KOTOR also divulges topics like religion, politics, racism, and more, often directly in the dialogue, or in situations with NPCs in the world. I've had to save racially oppressed aliens more than a few times from the punk-♥♥♥ humans. The Empire, while not an official superpower yet, holds control over the planets they conquer in a fascist, do-as-we-say kind of government. This was very interesting to see, as similar imagery directly alludes to Nazi Germany in The Force Awakens.The items and environments in KOTOR are fantastic and do the franchise great justice. Nothing I saw in-game took me out of the experience in any way, and the pace felt fine as I played.There are also many things to do apart from the ""main story"": you can help merchants, save or kill civilians, break into apartment rooms, go after bounty hunters or do bounties yourself, participate in duels, gamble, race swoop bikes, and the list goes on and on. While KOTOR sticks to the basic premise of jedi=good, sith=evil, there is enough creativity in the story for you to be the character you want to be. The story is not a one-note, drab playthrough; there are many different ways to play. The characters feel human enough that there is often moral conflict when in different situations.Honestly, I haven't even finished the game and I could write forever. KOTOR belongs up there with the likes of Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Deus Ex, and System Shock 2 for the best RPGs of all time. Get this if you like Star Wars or RPGs.			"

												The gameplay feels out of date by today's standards, but it's very similar to a turn based rpg.  Skill points are scarce enough to make you feel like you're making real choices upon level up (a common feature of older rpgs).  I found the game to be challenging, but easy mode should let you get through if you just want to experience the story.  The story is incredible and that's what makes this game a must play.   It took me a little bit to get into the game, but I eventually got hooked.   There's multiple endings so playing the game through twice just to get very different endings is worth it.  This game is worth the standard price, but if you ever see it on sale PICK IT UP!			"

												The graphics aren't amazing, and there are a lot of glitches (save often), but the storyline is interesting. The characters can come across as a little flat, because interaction is left mainly to between-mission interaction, and the skill system is a little awkward but by the end, I felt like I'd actually become a jedi, which is pretty freaking cool.  Over all, the game has aged surprisingly well. Side note: if you have a hard time getting the game to run at first, go to the steam folder where the game was installed run swconfig.exe, check turn off movies, and uncheck enable hardware mouse if it's enabled. If you can't find the steam folder, right click the game, click properties, and under the third tab select 'browse local files'.			"

												Star Wars KOTOR is an RPG made by the RPG masters at Bioware. As a fan of Star Wars myself, I was excited to finally play this game. I've heard really good things about this game and I was not let down by this game.Pros:+The Story.... MY GOSH THE STORY (I won't spoil a thing because its that good)+The morale system that greatly affects the story, characters, atmosphere, and ending.+The characters feel three dimensional with their extensive backstories and colorful personalities.+The background lore to this game is really well done and when you look at it closley you'll see the parallels to the movies+The design of the locations is top-notch+Gives a more in-depth look at the Star Wars universe.Cons:-Graphics look a little dated, but not too bad.-The Real Time combat got boring to me after a while (although this is something that I don't like in RPGs in general)-It had to endOverall, (9/10) This game is a masterpiece and it is a must-buy to all Star Wars fans.P.S.

												Great game. However, this port, or at the very least this version of this port crashes constently in Windows 10. This is a problem which I have verified occurs frequently among Windows 10 users. This problem is NOT present in KOTOR II, strangely enough, and is unique to this game. Some methods which partially fix the problem do exist, but I would advise against purchasing this game if you have Windows 10, unless an update is released addressing these problems.***Edit from 12/28/2016***Even after running fixes of the game to make it more playable, it is marred by multiple graphical bugs, including one which makes character models partially invisible in wildnerless combat zones such as the fields of Dantooine and Taris's Undercity. These bugs do not outright make the game unplayable, but they do ruin cutscenes and make targeting enemies more awkward, alomng with ruining any sort of immersion.***Edit from 1/23/2016***A bunch of people are commenting that they have Windows 10 and are not having the same difficulties, stating that I must have done something wrong. I thought might have been my fault as well, initially, but I checked the Steam Forums and elsewhere and have found that there are frequent issues with running this game on Windows 10.I do think that this is a good game and recommend it to those not using Windows 10. If you do use Windows 10, I advise caution. If it works for you, then that's great, but there are clearly problems here. These problems are NOT present in KOTOR II, with I was able to run at length without issue.			"

												I have two words for this masterpiece. HOLY ♥♥♥♥. This game is magnificent. One of the most compelling games and stories I've ever seen in games and movies. The story is so well-written and it sucks you in. I play this and not even notice the hours go bye. This is one of the, if not best, Star Wars game out there. The story is up there with the greats of the original trilogy. I  recommend this game to anyone looking for a compelling story and just an overall fun game. I give this a 10/10.			"

												Even now this game is still one of the best RPG's of all time. If you liked Mass Effect or Dragon Age then you'll love this. Graphics are kind of dated and it lacks voice acting, but the combat system is stilll extremely fun and the story and characters are high quality and remain interesting to this day. Defnitely the best Star Wars game of all time. If you're on the fence about buying it, I strongly reccomend you take the risk and get it.			"

												STAR WARS - Knights of the Old Republic is a truly beautiful adventure that can only be truly understood through playing. The game will always hold the number one position in my heart.In terms of storytelling, the game is unparalled. It features a diverse range of interesting and loveable characters who all undergo major character development, and will ellicit some form of emotion from you, be it laughter, sadness or anything in between.The storyline itself is easily the greatest amongst star wars games, and easily compares to other powerhouses of it's genre. The branching story lines empower the player, making you feel like every single dialogue option, or path of action can, and will have lasting repurcussions. Not falling into any clichés or overused plot devices, the storyline is an emotionally fuelled, gripping adventure that will have you staying up until 2 o'clock every morning, just to see how a particular event pans out.The graphics, though somewhat dated, detract 0 from the experience, and are quickly forgotten amongst the rich and vibrant worlds, teeming with interesting side characters and side missions, begging to be explored. Although linear, the worlds feel open and diverse, augmented by anyones previous knowledge of star wars.Many people preach the replayability, and I could not agree more; But certain aspects can only experienced once, and if I could erase my own memory to experience these things again, I would do so without a second thought. The game has mind blowing scenes, scenes that I wouldn't dare spoil so that everyone could experience the same as I did.All in All, I could not reccommend this game to any higher degree. I cannot fault it. It will leave you constantly wanting more. It is in my opinion, the perfect game.			"

												For those having problems with loading the first part of the game: Go to Options, advanced options, go to graphics, go to advanced, and disable Frame Buffer Effects.Now to the review.Pros:+Good character voice acting+Pretty decent graphics for it's time+Jeremy Soule (Music composer for this game) who also did the work on Skyrim did a marvelous job+Great atmosphere. Everything is very well designed and well-placed.+Fantastic Story+Great game length (about 40 hours)+Very Replayable+Good combat+Great main Villian+Amazing and lovable characters+Pretty fun sidequestsCons:-Starts off a little slow. But in my experience, most fantastic games do.-Money is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to come by in the early stages of the game.-After you beat the game, you cannot continue. SO DO ALL SIDEQUESTS IF YOU EVEN CONSIDER DOING THEM-Takes over your life-Puzzles are often complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Luckily, there aren't many of them.If you like Star Wars, get this game. if you like kickass stories, get this game. This is a classic and a must-play. Enjoy! :) "

												Star Wars: tKotOR  is one of the greatest rpgs ever made. It is a truly magical delve into the Star Wars universe, with an expansive story, interesting characters, and challenging turn-based gameplay. The game has some of the best roleplay elements extantt o date and allows for the player to go far above and beyond the typical black/white morality of many morality-driven  rpgs. That all being said, the Steam version does not work. A quick google search will show you just how broken and unplayable this version of the game is. There has been no attempt to update this game for modern computers and even in compatability mode, it does not function. There are literally thousands of game-breaking bugs and glitches in the steam version that make it unplayable.Please, please, play this game but for the love of god, save yourself the frustration and do not buy the Steam version. Wait for a sale on GOG. Steam couldn't care less about how this game does not work.			"

												One of my favourite games of all time and the greatest Star Wars game ever released. I probably will get downvotes for this, but when I bought this game at launch, I had never actually seen the Star Wars movies (I spend more time gaming, instead of movies), so I only knew the basics. This game (+Star Wars Galaxies) made me like the Star Wars franchise and watch the movies. You could compare Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic to Mass Effect, also made by Bioware. What makes SW:KOTOR such a great game to me is without a doubt the story. The choices you (have to) make, good vs bad, light side vs dark side and one of the best endings I've ever seen in any game. Most of the npc's are interesting and you build relationships with them, as the story progresses.Obviously, the graphics have aged over the years but It still manages to make the Star Wars universe feel alive. For example, there are space ships flying around, even though they only consist of a few pixels, you still know what they are and makes the world feel more alive. Combat is semi turn-based and often relies on tactical thinking. You are able to play KOTOR in real-time but you will probably die often.Like I said before; Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic, mainly relies on the story. Unless you are a real Star Wars fan, this game is not recommended for players who rather have great combat but for anyone else this game is one everyone should have played, before they are dead.  "

TL;DRA must play for Star Wars and/or RPG fans.+ Compelling plot+ Dialogues (apart from Aliens' lines)+ Characters+ Classes+ Force powers and skills+ Option of choosing between the light and the dark side+ Lots of items+ Soundtrack+ Minigames- Bugs! Bugs everywhere! (Saving often and in different slots is highly recommended)- Camera and movement- Neutrality is punished hereREVIEWStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a well-acclaimed RPG made by Bioware. Its action is set 4000 years before the Galactic Empire. The war between the Republic and the Dark Sith Lord named Malak is raging. The protagonist is merely a Republic soldier at first, but, as the story progresses, he/she starts to play a much more important role. It turns out that the main character has a strong connection to the Force and has to train as a Jedi.The player can choose between three classes for the protagonist: Soldier (expert in combat), Scoundrel (rogue), Scout (jack of all trades), and, later on, 3 Jedi classes: Guardian (focus on lightsabre combat), Consular (focus on Force powers), and Sentinel (jack of all trades). Every class has its own strengths and weaknesses and require a different approach so choose wisely.The main hero will not travel alone. There are a few characters who will join him on the journey. Every companion has a story and motives behind them so it is worth to talk with them. Moreover, they add yet another layer to the rich plot.The gameplay is focused on doing quests, visiting planets, levelling, and, of course, combat. The game's mechanics are based on D&D 3.5. Fortunately, it is made accessible even to the players who are new to RPGs. There is a huge variety of skills, feats, and Force powers at your disposal which definitely contributes to longevity of the game. Most of the time, the player leads a small group (with up to two companions) and ventures forth. All characters are controllable and while they seem to do well enough on their own, there are issues with pathfinding and sometimes the characters get stuck. This is particularly noticeable in locations with tight corridors.Throughout the game, the player will have make many decisions. The choices can have a huge influence on the outcome. This is one of the biggest strengths of the game. Speaking of the freedom of choice, the player is able to choose between the light and the dark side as they see fit. Earning light side points make using the light Force powers cost less and using the dark ones cost more and vice versa. This is one of the first games where being the bad guy is just as doable as being the saviour of the Galaxy. While remaining relatively neutral is possible, it is not a very viable choice. For instance, there are some items which are restricted to either side of the Force spectrum. Moreover, the player more often than not will be forced to join one side of a conflict or to take some action. Be wary of your choices, for the Galaxy is at stake!Saving the Galaxy (or dooming it to fall) can be exhausting. Worry no more, for there is a lot to do in your free time. Apart from a myriad of side-quests, there also are minigames, namely pazaak (blackjack on steroids) and swoop racing. Not only they are enjoyable but also can give you extra credits.However, there are some serious technical issues. The game is utterly crawling with bugs*. For instance, it is not an uncommon occurrence when the dialogues start to skip. Restarting the game and reloading a previous save seems to help, but it is a glitch worth mentioning. What is more, teammates may sometimes stop attacking the foes. While I have not found any gamebreaking bugs, it is very sensible to save often and in different slots** just in case. Speaking of downsides, I am not particularly fond of the camera and movement. It is not bad per se, but it may take a while to get used to. And last but not least, there are few Aliens' dialogue lines so they get extremely repetitive after some time.Concluding, this is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. Its compelling plot alone makes it outstanding and the decision-making adds to its replay value. If you do not mind dated graphics and are able to get past the technical issues, the game will reward you with a memorable experience. They just do not make games like they used to...*Yes, I am aware it's a terrible pun. I apologise.**Yes, you've heard it right: you can save whenever you want and in different slots. It used to be an ""industry standard"" back in a day. No silly checkpoints and such.P.S.

												KOTOR is truly a great rpg. The game immerses the player in the Star Wars universe, and It has some of the best voice acting and stories that I have heard in an RPG to date (and this is 2010). There's actually a focused and captivating story unlike most rpgs in the market today. I didn't really find any problems with the interface or gameplay (for its time). I really enjoyed Candorous' stories of the Mandalorian Wars, for example. They were compact with imagery and none of the dialogue seems superfluous. I seriously don't understand why this game should get anything less than a 9. I have played nearly every Star Wars game to date (and certainly many rpgs) and KOTOR is definitely one that sets the standards high. Don't be fooled by the low reviews. If you're a fan of rpgs, this is a must have.			"

The story, characters and voice acting are far better than you'd expect from 2003 and, despite a few slow sections in the plot and some inevitably dated features (graphics, HUD, resolution etc.) the game still plays really well.Pretty sure the success of KOTOR is what gave BioWare the courage and recognition they needed to develop their own in-house space/sci-fi IP, which of course became the Mass Effect series.Also, the minigames in this are great.

												Kotor was my first BioWare title and still my favorite. The graphics are a bit dated, however, and the combat takes a lot of getting used to if you're a first timer (turn based d20 system ala DnD) but once you get used to it you'll be hooked. This game is somewhat notorious for having a slow start (Taris/Dantooine) and not all planets are action-y (Manaan) but when it's good it's really good. The story is captivating and open, giving you choices on how you want to take on the plot, which has a crazy twist. The characters are fleshed out and the writing and voice acting are well done too. Everyone will find something to like in this game. I was lucky to find it on sale, however, it's still worth the full price point at $9.99. Hands down the best Star Wars experience along with Battlefront 1 and 2. Go get this game. "

												When I look back on KOTOR now, I think classic Bioware mechanics, classic Star Wars story. The merging of two formulaic entities to create something that is certainly standard fair for Bioware nowadays and probably hammered to death in the Star Wars universe. That said, I think about the experience when this game actually came out and it's hard to deny that there is something special that happened here. From a plot and story perspective; A true Ode to Star Wars that encapsulates the feeling of the first movies (4,5 and 6) so truly that it's hard to fault them on the story being so familiar. If you've played Bioware games since, you will also be familiar with what's going on under the hood as it plays very similar to other Bioware RPG's (Jade Empire, Dragon Age, etc) but again when this beast first came out a lot of these features were new and still exciting and that would probably be considered a strength instead of an overused format.    All other things aside, this is a game created by Bioware when it was in my opinion, at it's best and what Bioware did best was write engaging stories with characters that were filled with genuine humanity. So even though the format might seem tired now, the story and the characters are truly one of a kind and if you're playing through for the first time I would bet that some of your favorite moments you experience in this game would likely become some of your fondest memories that you have in the Star Wars universe as a whole.

												I'm aware I don't have many hours logged on this game for the PC. However, as kid I played this on the original Xbox back in the day. So trust me on this.1.) This game is by far my favorite in the Star Wars series, it's unique RPG style was unlike any game at the time (at least for me.) The choices you made in-game defined your character from the Jedi, Sith or even the interesting/unique Grey jedi and each choice could impact in small/ large ways the overall outcome of the story and your companions which makes for a lot of replay value.2.) The story (without spoilers of course) is very compelling and complex with many new challeneges as you progress further and even a few twists and turns that keep the story exciting and not dragged out. The characters are interesting and fun to learn more about once you start forming bonds with them through your adventures.3.) Turn based combat which is interesting and though wasn't my favorite style of combat, the formula for this game just feels right and flows well for what it is. It makes weapon modifications, skills and talents, armor and modifications and even the choice of companions important based on the enemies you may face in each and every encounter.4.) Just buy this game! it's worth it. If you like a game where you create your own path, then make one in this beautiful universe of Knights of the Old Republic. Years have aged this game but it's a hidden gem you can't find anywhere else.			"

												I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so keep that in mind as you read this review.I just played this game for the first time a couple weeks ago, and it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in terms of gaming in a while. Despite this game being 13 years old it is much better than many games that have come out recently.My favorite thing about Bioware games, whether it be Mass Effect, Dragon Age, or Knights of the Old Republic, is the characters that Bioware creates. I fell in love with every single character in this game. The interactions you can have with each character after every mission is great and something I always looked forward to while playing. I thought the romance with Bastila was well written and actually believable, unlike many other games. Also, as a huge fan of the Mass Effect series, it was so cool recognizing voice actors in this game, and they did a great job.The plot in this game is well done in my opinion. I obviously won't go into specifics as I don't want to spoil anything, but the foreshadowing is great, and the plot twist is awesome. Freaking lightsabers. The one thing I was looking forward to most coming into this game was crafting my first lightsaber, it wasn't all that great, but still pretty cool. Other than that, lightsabers are probably the coolest thing ever imagined and just being able to use one instantly makes this game awesome.The combat in this game was something I was not used to and still don't like very much. I was coming into this game expecting to run around swinging my lightsaber randomly at enemies like you would in skyrim. However, this game has MMO type combat where you just click on enemies and the game takes care of the rest. I hated this at first but after a while I was ok with it.Overall, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a fantastic game, and my new most favorite. There are so many things done right in this video game. If you're a fan of Star Wars buy this game you will love it. If you're not a fan of Star Wars I still definitely recommend this game as it's one of the greatest of all time. I rate this game a 10/10.			"

												An excellent adaptation of the d20 system by BioWare. The NPCs aren't amazing, but, as is almost always the case with Star Wars, the universe more than makes up for it. Admittedly I prefer the writing styles of the Obsidian-born sequel, but if epic quests to save the galaxy are something you enjoy, you should pick this game up. Unfortunately, this game like many others suffers from a very shallow morality system that often comes down to two choices.			"

												There are countless positive reviews on how this is one of the most brilliant RPG's ever made so I am just going to touch on a few things and lend a few quick pointers to people who are brand new to Kotor. The first thing to note is that the game is quite buggy, crashes occur at random and minimizing will periodically result in a crash as well. There are not enough auto saves in the game so SAVE OFTEN. This will prevent some serious frustration. The second thing to note is that the start of the game can be difficult to sink your teeth into. You may find your interest is not aroused immediately, just remember to give it time. I had to put the game down several times at the beginning as my interest waned. Come back with a fresh mind and push through and you will soon find the game much more immersive and rewarding after you contend with the beginning. Knights of the Old Republic is the Baldur's Gate of Star Wars games and is one of the greatest RPG's ever made. A no brainer for RPG enthusiasts and Star Wars fans.			"

												There are very few games out there that I would declare 10/10 games, this is one of them. Ever since the original Star Wars trilogy ended 30 years ago we have been given lackluster successors to the trilogy in both film and video game. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game that really captures the narrative sense of adventure and good vs evil that made the original three films such joys to watch. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The characters you interact with are for the most part a very strong point of the game. Carth is a tortured character you really to have to spend a lot of time to understand. Bastilia is a gifted Jedi who is attempting to be the emotionless patient Vulcan-like Jedi we have come to known in the prequel films which makes it all the more fun to really get her angry at you. Mission Vao and Zaalbar are basically Chewbacca and Han solo if Han was a 13 year old girl. Jolee Bindo is one of the more interesting Jedi you’ll ever encounter; he’s not a member of the Jedi order and dodges any attempts you make to probe his character. Canderous Ordo is a perfect specimen of a Mandalorian (the human version of Predators) and is a combat veteran. You get two droids on your adventures, T3 who is basically R2-D2 and my favorite companion HK-47, a assassin droid who refers to all non droids as “Meatbags” and who you’ll learn is responsible for the deaths of all his previous masters. Oh and if you run into someone called “Juhani” just kill her, it saves you a lot of time. The Combat of this game is turn-based and as you gain more levels you are able to spec into a variety of different abilities which will give you new options when it comes to fighting enemies. However the calling card of this game is the story (MAJOR, GAME RUINING SPOILERS AHEAD). The game leads you to believe at first you are a Republic (insert class here) stationed on a ship orbiting Taris and it is up to save the galaxy by rescuing the Jedi leader of the ship’s expedition who was lost on the planet following an attack by the main enemy of the game Dark Malak. You then learn after you escape the planet you learn that you are gifted and can learn the powers of the Force. You take this as simply coincidence and continue on your journey to stop Malak (M. NIGHT SHAMALYAN SPOILERS AHEAD, LAST CHANCE TO TURN BACK). However in one of the greatest plot twists in video games, you learn that your character is actually “Darth Revan” the former master of Malak whose memory was changed by the Jedi Council. Now while this game is my favorite of my all time favorites it does have its faults. There are extra quests in the game that are just not do able unless you so happen to do planets in exact orders, the first two planets (Taris and Dantooine) are major drags to get through and are not the most enjoyable things to get through. Despite this, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is the greatest Star Wars game to exist and is easily worth the 10 dollars.If the droid in Rogue One is a HK-47 Clone i'm going to be annoyed.

												At this point I highly doubt my opinion will cause anyone to buy this game but here goes:This is the best an RPG can be. The absoloute hieght of lore and decisions that affect the outcome of an entire galaxy. Not only does the game let you feel the power of a force user, it lets you do what you want to with it. But your choices have reprocussions to those around you, some of whom you can turn away entirely or even slaughter. Play this game and I promise you will fall in love with the individual charactors and the universe as a whole. This is the best we have gotten so far in gaming. No more is needed to say.

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a team-based third person RPG set in the distant past of the Republic in the Star Wars universe. It is an excellent game, and a great RPG in the vein of other Bioware RPGs. Mechanically, it is a little dated and can take some getting used to, and the early portions of the game can drag a little bit, but once you get to the meat of the game, it's one of the best RPGs of all time, and a truly, truly excellent game.It's been some time since I played through it, so I'm afraid the details have faded, but it's really a must-play for fans of the genre or of Star Wars. It's one of the best Star Wars properties which has ever been made, and it's a great game that stands up even a decade later.			"

And that is what Kotor 1 is, great in every single way that matters for an rpg and Star Wars game.The best part is of cource the story, about Revan, Darth Malak, Bastila and all the jedis of the old. The Sith is back and strong as ever. The quest for the Star Forge is very interesting.And for a game thats over 10 years old, its has age well. The version on Steam works well with few problems.

												Before I start this review I'd like to say that this isn't the first time I have played this game as I played it a while back on the original Xbox and I just had to buy it again for PC because 1. The PC graphics are slightly better 2. The mods you can download are AMAZING and 3. I just had to.. its star wars okay I just had to, So lets get started with this review and firstly lets talk about the gameplay.Gameplay: At first it took me sometime to get used to playing this on PC with the mouse and keyboard but I adapted quickly to it and to be perfectly honest I prefer playing it this way than on the Xbox simply because it is sooo much easier to click on which enemy you want to attack rather than scrolling through each enemy with a gaming controller and also navagating the menu's on PC is highly superior and its pretty obvious why. The combat in this game is fun most of the time as you would issue a command and your characters will carry out that command without you having to mash buttons or whatever kind of like a Final Fantasy game but in more of a real time than that, but at times it can be very repetitive and enemies can just get annoying as it feels like they are stopping you from carrying out the story but this is just a minor grip with the gameplay as most of the time I felt very happy with the combat its just certain areas in the game the enemies get a little tendious (Damn Khath Hounds.) Story: Well this is definetly the strongest part of the game as it is a Bioware game (Known for  the Mass effect series, Dragon Age and Jade Empire) and when you buy a Bioware game you know the story is going to be good and in this case the story is DAMN GOOD. I won't give anything away story wise but something happens later on that made my jaw drop. Overall story wise this game has a ton of sub plots as well such as the characters you interact with that come along with you on this journey all have their own back stories that mostly impact the main plot in some way and are also very interesting (well mostly).Graphics: The graphics of this game are very good for its time and I think they still hold up today I mean it is a dated game so its not going to look amazing but with some extra mods you can download the game looks even better and theres nothing bad I can really say about this.Overall verdict: Well I would say if you enjoy games that are heavily focused on story and if you love Star Wars (who doesn't) this is a must buy.

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, also know as ""KOTOR"" to fans of the series, is one of the true founding fathers of the RPG genre. This game, which produced a metascore rating of 93 out of 100, takes you into the Star Wars universe, and lets you ""run free."" You can choose the path you which to take, whether it be the light side or the dark side, and you can decide which planets you wish to visit. Along the way you will encounter new characters and aliens, some of whom will even join your party. KOTOR is a game for those who enjoy long, deep stories that let you truly decide who your character becomes. It has an incredible soundtrack created by Jeremy Soule, who later went on to compose the soundtrack for multiple games, including Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim of the Elder Scrolls series, and the Harry Potter video game series. If you're looking for a first person shooter or a game with intense combat, this game is not for you. The combat is primarily turn based, and can take some getting use to. However, if you are looking for an RPG that you can immerse yourself in and play for the story, then Knights of the Old Republic is the RPG for you.			"

												If you ever thought what it would be like to be a part of the Star Wars universe this is the game you have been looking for. Even after 12 years it still gives me the shivers every time i play it. For its time of release back in 2003 it was considered a masterpiece. Now its simply a living legend amongst all rgps fans and enthousiasts. There are simply not enough words to place for this game. Its storytelling is unparalleled, its graphic design although kinda outdated for modern standards remains one of the best out there and the music is what you would expect for a game of this magnitude and more. The characters, the planets, the enemies, the tension in this game are all tied together to make you feel like you are indeed part of something bigger and better and you feel every moment as you play. Everything you have seen and loved in the Star Wars Universe is here and is up to you how to feel and connect with it. Every decision you make counts so its up to you to decide whether to save or destroy the universe. Will you join the Dark Side and make them feel the power of the Sith or will you wage an impossible effort to save the galaxy while remaining true to the teachings of the Jedi?W/e u choose may the Force be with you!!!

Make sure that you get the ""Flawless Widescreen"" application. It injects a dll that allows you to run the game in higher resolutions than are available via the in-game menu. It sill looks dated, but makes it a lot better than the stock 1280x1024 resolution. If you've never played this, do yourself a favor and get it.			"

												This was one of my first games i ever played and finding it on steam was great mow i can replay this amazing game.If you like star wars and roleplaying games then give this game a trythe game has a great combat system. A amazing story with a magor plot twist (PLease don't spoil it if you know it) there are also 9 companions to pick from you may only your max Squad size is 3 so pick carefully.A light side and dark side ending there are also alot of force poweres like force choke and force lightning and many more.There is more to say but i'm not gonna tell you everything about it you should find out some of it  yourself to make the game more enjoyable.If you like what you read then this is the game for you. the 2nd game is just as good if you like this onethe downsides to this game is you have to turn off a few settings to get it working there is a guide for it it's not made by me so all credit goes to whoever made it so read that before starting the game or you will crash as you start the game after create your characterand that is about it now get out there and save or rule the galaxy.

												Summarized: This game adds to the lore, plays very well, and brings you hours of pure entertainment for anyone. Even people who don't have the most knowledge about Star Wars could easily get into this game!Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game where it starts off slowly but as you delve into it the story will progress and you will shape the way your character is. To keep it short, there's actually choices that matter, even though the gameplay might not be as you'd like it still functions very properly and when we're talking about graphics, it is not the most beautiful game but it are enjoyable graphics to look at. The planets and locations you'll visit will keep you interested as it adds to the lore and true Star Wars fans will actually get to see new stuff!The game is pretty cheap and I'd definitely recommend anyone who likes Star Wars to play it!

Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic is an Adventure RPG based on the D20 System. Set 4,000 years before the Galactic Empire, you are a Republic Soldier stuck in a war against a newly formed Sith Empire lead by former Jedi heroes, whose steps you retrace in an attempt to discover the source of their military power.Pros: Nice story that explores the ages before the modern Star Wars setting, back when the Republic was half its size and most of the Galaxy was yet to be mapped. You are joined by a cast of up to 8 additional characters, up to 2 can join you at a time. You can travel to 5 different planets (with different environments, creatures to fight, and equipment to buy for you and your party). Different encounters or quests might unlock depending on which side character is in your party at a given time. Some items are upgradable standard enhancement parts, others are fully customizable such as lightsabers. Multiple side quests allow you to delve on which side of the force you want to be in. Oh, and the story has a great twist!Cons: The graphics didn’t age too well, many objects and characters look very polygony. If you’re not familiar with tabletop RPGs and the D20 system, you can easily get confused of how the mechanics work when selecting weapons, upgrades and other equipment. Character creation is limited, at least by today’s standard, where you pick from a dozen pre-gen faces among 3 different classes to begin, then among 3 jedi classes. Each planet has a very linear map, with a few outbranching paths, again contrasting with today’s standards.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your listIf you’re not a fan of Star Wars, you probably won’t see the appeal of this game. Otherwise, it’s one of the best installments of the games. The game isn’t too lore-heavy, allows both light and hardcore fans to enjoy the settings and game. I recommend giving it a try, it’s worth the price!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												I love this game, I really do. I deeply regret having to not reccomemend it, but THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. Whether it's because of steam or that's it's old as hell, whenever I even start up the game it has probably about a 5/10 chance of getting to the main menu screen and a 1/10 chance of being able to use the menu screen without it frozen. To make it better, even when you get in game during normal cutscenes you have about a 1/2 chance of crashing and during a specific cutscene for me (the one where you leave Taris) I've only once got through it without crashing the game and am stuck since I can't continue on without crashing. I've probably started up and turned my computer off and on accurately about 35 times total, not even an exaggeration, just to get the game to work/start up. My pc has a htx 960 and an i5 intel core proccessor, so it isn't that I'm on a potato either. I really wish I was able to play this beautiful game..(EDIT: Turn steam overlay and Game Theatre off and you will probably be able to get through the cutscene if you are having the same issue).			"

												Hands down, this is the best Star Wars game ever. At least the best one thats been made so far in gaming history. From character development; exploration, an incredible story, a diverse combat system, down to the smallest detail in the game, its a jewel amoung RPGs. It can hold its own easily up to todays RPGs still, even if its a bit dated. If you never played this through, its worth every penny for the number of hours that you'll be playing through again and again. No matter if you're a huge Star Wars fan or completely new to the SW universe, there is no better game to sink your gaming teeth into than this timeless epic.			"

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game I had mixed feelings about going into. On the one hand, it's a Star Wars game with all the baggage that brings. On the other hand it's a Star Wars game that's set in an era where nobody from the movies can ruin things with a cameo. I eventually ended up getting with the deciding factor being that it's a Bioware game and back then Bioware still made a good RPG.To start you off Knights of the Old Republic is nothing revolutionary, in fact it's a step backwards in a lot of places. It's real time but with behind the screens turn based combat as played in third person and while the third person camera does add more action to the combat it also makes any semblance of strategy feel distant and uninvolved.As you start off the game you are a seemingly unimportant Republican soldier that survives an attack on your ship by the evil Sith empire. You then set about gathering companions, finding loot and solving everybody's random problems in a usual RPG fashion. As you progress through the storyline things quickly become more than they seem and you eventually end up having to save the galaxy.The storyline and the interaction with the various characters are one of the main points of the game and this is also where one of the game's major flaws become apparent.Bioware has never been good at writing grey, they always tend to stick with the ultimate black and white scenario, either you stop and help every kitten down from every tree or you stop to kill every kitten in every tree with the only neutral option being not accepting the quest in the first place. Normally they can get away with it through the storyline placing the player as some form of superhuman on a quest so epic that it probably needs 1812 as it's theme music. Although this also happens here the black and white writing of Bioware is combined with the natural black and white of the Star Wars universe and it becomes rather jarring at times being forced to take such extreme positions on every little issue with the only option for neutrality being to decline any story/experience/loot that might be on the table and say ""Gotta go save the galaxy, bye!"" to the quest givers.The storyline is not Bioware's greatest in general but the various interesting characters you meet along the way does a lot to make up for it, even if some of the lesser ones are just Bioware archetypes.The gameplay is not terrible, it just isn't that impressive either, while the occasional boss fight might force you to do more than click attack and sit back and wait for your enemy to die that is the default position even on the highest difficulty. This I suspect is to compensate for how cumbersome it feels to use any sort of strategy beyond setting up which AI type your companions should use.If you have heard about this game, chances are you have heard about the by now famous plot twist. For all it's hype however it is not particularly surprising nor particularly plausible. The story is not bad mind you, and the game throws so half-decent choice and consequence your way every once in a while even if it's marred by the game's poor morality system.All in all Knights of the Old Republic is a solid piece of RPG, it might have some technical issue, it might have some poor combat and it might have some less than stellar story writing but none of this is enough to detract from the overall quality of the game. It might not be the RPG classic we were hoping for but it does give you many, many hours of entertainment.			"

												his WRPG brought to you by Bioware was a stunning release for its time and playing it really shows you where their newer games have come from. But how does it stand up to some of the standards set by their newer RPGs? Pretty well, in fact; however, there were some pretty major annoyances and some issues I did have with the game. For starters, I just got done playing Planescape: Torment, and that WRPG (released 4 years earlier) had infinitely better decision making paths than KotOR did. I recognize that this *may* be due to the confines of working in the Star Wars universe: you have the Dark Side and the Light Side - each contrary to the other, but really I felt it could have been done better. Your options in KotOR seem to boil down to A) I'm going to help you out or B) I'm going to be a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Example: You are in the slums and you have the ability to save a race of people for light side points. The dark side path is you can sell them out to some junk dealer because he wants to keep his profits up *for a measly 100 credits*! Just to let you know, that's not a lot of credits. And if you don't pick a side and want to stick in the middle path then guess what, no awesome light/dark side affiliated equipment for you sir! Speaking of roleplaying, if you decide you want to roleplay as a blaster user then you're going to have a bad time. As I said, I just got done with Planescape and I figured, ""why not go a charasmatic path"" like I did in that game. Well, KotOR thinks it's fun to throw you into 1v1 duels quite frequently, and if you don't have a lightsabre or focus on combat you're going to have some serious aggravation. Eventually I got through them and carved a niche for myself by spamming the Insanity and Force Wave abilities. Those abilities got me all the way through the final boss of the game, so another complaint I would have is game balancing - whether it's combat, dialogue choices to avoid battle, or other ways to accomplish things, I think this game could use a once-over. Some of the characters were also a little one-sided, not just regarding light vs dark side, but wholly uninteresting. Take T3-M4 for instance. Yes, it's a droid, but R2-D2 had a personality and T3-M4 doesn't, which is disappointing and I can only attribute it to laziness. The game is also a little glitchy. My characters ended up getting caught in doorways quite often and during conversational cutscenes sometimes weird things would happen - eg holding invisible weapons. A few final annoyances were whenever you suit up (either underwater or in outerspace) you walk stupidly slow and every time you travel from planet to planet the cutscenes are recycled and you end up playing the same repetitive ""space battle"" minigame. KotOR also has bad and unfrequent quicksave times (spam that F4 key!). The inventory was also quite a mess, a lot of wasted screen real estate in the menus and it was nigh impossible to determine exactly what items you receive as quest rewards.While the above may seem like a long list it really didn't effect my enjoyment *too* much (except for those 1v1 duels, ugh) and the game has a lot of merit to it. There are many fun and challenging puzzles, the music is phenomenal, using motiffs we know and recognize from Star Wars that weave seamlessly in and out of original material that keeps the nostalgia flowing, and the controls are quite good, allowing you to mostly play with your mouse hand only. And, most importantly, the story was excellent. I was really impressed overall with the narrative and felt empathy for most of the characters in my party (I really loved the other droid you get as well, meatbags!). Pros:NarrativeCharacterizationMusicLots of character customizationCons:Lack of ""good"" character customization from protagonistA little too ""black and white""Some annoyances (see above)All in all it was a memorable journey that I would recommend you try if you like Star Wars or Bioware/WRPGs but it falls short of my ""must play"" stamp of approval.

												Fantastic Star Wars game, easily THE best Star Wars game! You make your own decisions, it's a unique storyline and setting in the SW timeline (No Clone Wars and no Rebellion) and it has a fantastic storyline and sticks really well to the lore. You can visit multiple planets, and thats just the vanilla version. The amount of mods is amazing and can improve gameplay substantially. This game is easily still worth 60 bucks, and for the price it's getting sold by, it's a steal. If youre a fan of Star Wars, it's a must-buy, if you're a fan of RPG's and tolerate Star Wars, still a must-buy. If you hate Star Wars, then why the hell are you reading this review?			"

												Bwee. This game might be old now, but its still one of the best RPG's ever made. Star Wars might be a tainted franchise in alot of ways, having produced alot of garbage and many terrible games. But some is good... and some is great, and this is one of the great things.Gameplay wise, it came between Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect, and you can see traces of both games in this one (the ""dice"" combat from BG and the dual morality and third person gameplay of ME). A few parts of the game are a bit slow, most of all in the beginning, but the later areas more than make up for this. And story... well, you will have to see that for yourself. No spoilers from me! It's one of the best in any RPG, with plenty of interesting characters to go with it. Especially that... droid. You will know which one when you meet them.This game pretty much always gets hugely discounted during major sales, so if you don't have this one you may as well pick it up cheap and check it out. You may find something you will like here. :)			"

												In this classic game by Bioware you play as Dash Rendar, a sassy, no-nonsense mercenary and smuggler. The goal of this game is to go around and try to become a Pokemon Pazaak master. However, most of the time you are aimlessly drifting around alien worlds, and solving other people's meaningless problems. But I know why many of you are reading this, and so I'll cut to the most important bit of information, you don't get a lightsaber until 5 hours into the game. A silly oversight by Bioware Corp, but what's even sillier is the fact they completely forgot this important piece of equipment in this game's sequel, Mass Effect! You know why Shepard ultimately failed in that series? Because he didn't have a damn lightsaber. There, I said it.			"

10/10 Utinni----------As an avid fan of the Star Wars franchise, I would highly recommend this title. It has space travel, your own starship, multiple characters for party choice, an optional Solo Mode, great ""pause-then-set-tactics-then-attack"" battle system, a proportional storyline / quest with multiple side quests, great weaponry / armor / droid customization / lightsabe customization / armor customization, fully outfittable party members, auto-leveling (if that's your kind of thing), epic battles between Sith and Jedi, full scale path choice (can go either Light Side or Dark Side), great writing and voice acing and much, much more!----------I, for one, am very glad that I spent the $9.99(USD) for this game, as I have played numerous Star Wars franchise titles, including all the Lego Star Wars titles (even the Lucas Arts X-Wing title for the Sega 32X system add-on for the Sega Genesis), and I would have to say that besides Star Wars: Republic Command, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is by far my favorite title, thus far. It provides me with enough of a challenge, but not too much as to turn me into Bantha fodder and even adds some great references to the saga itself along side of some great antics and enough humor to make even a Jawa laugh.----------A definite ""Must Buy"" for any Star Wars Fanboy or Fangirl!

												Bioware takes hold of George Lucas's Star Wars universe and expands it with engrossing story in Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR). Played from a third-person perspective, KotOR is a fun and thrilling role-playing game that caters to Star Wars nerds and appeases the fans of the Expanded Universe. Although dated, KotOR is a must for fans of the Star Wars series as well as Bioware die-hards. If you can look beyond the technical limitations on modern systems and accept a change of pace from traditional first-person shooters, KotoR will keep you entertained at a cheap price.			"

												This is the best RPG of all time. The mechanics are old, but work flawlessly, the story is incredibly modular, and at that, it's great, the characters are unique and interesting, and who wouldn't want to be a damn Sith Lord?Essentially you and two others are the sole survivors of a ship that is attacked by the Sith. One of said survivors was a Jedi, and your mission is to find her on the planet from which you escape to. From their the story escalates and soon your a Jedi Knight with the decision of whether to follow the path of the dark side or to stay on the light. Your choices impact the outcome of the game.			"

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game I had mixed feelings about going into. On the one hand, it's a Star Wars game with all the baggage that brings. On the other hand it's a Star Wars game that's set in an era where nobody from the movies can ruin things with a cameo. I eventually ended up getting with the deciding factor being that it's a Bioware game and back then Bioware still made a good RPG.To start you off Knights of the Old Republic is nothing revolutionary, in fact it's a step backwards in a lot of places. It's real time but with behind the screens turn based combat as played in third person and while the third person camera does add more action to the combat it also makes any semblance of strategy feel distant and uninvolved.As you start off the game you are a seemingly unimportant Republican soldier that survives an attack on your ship by the evil Sith empire. You then set about gathering companions, finding loot and solving everybody's random problems in a usual RPG fashion. As you progress through the storyline things quickly become more than they seem and you eventually end up having to save the galaxy.The storyline and the interaction with the various characters are one of the main points of the game and this is also where one of the game's major flaws become apparent.Bioware has never been good at writing grey, they always tend to stick with the ultimate black and white scenario, either you stop and help every kitten down from every tree or you stop to kill every kitten in every tree with the only neutral option being not accepting the quest in the first place. Normally they can get away with it through the storyline placing the player as some form of superhuman on a quest so epic that it probably needs 1812 as it's theme music. Although this also happens here the black and white writing of Bioware is combined with the natural black and white of the Star Wars universe and it becomes rather jarring at times being forced to take such extreme positions on every little issue with the only option for neutrality being to decline any story/experience/loot that might be on the table and say ""Gotta go save the galaxy, bye!"" to the quest givers.The storyline is not Bioware's greatest in general but the various interesting characters you meet along the way does a lot to make up for it, even if some of the lesser ones are just Bioware archetypes.The gameplay is not terrible, it just isn't that impressive either, while the occasional boss fight might force you to do more than click attack and sit back and wait for your enemy to die that is the default position even on the highest difficulty. This I suspect is to compensate for how cumbersome it feels to use any sort of strategy beyond setting up which AI type your companions should use.If you have heard about this game, chances are you have heard about the by now famous plot twist. For all it's hype however it is not particularly surprising nor particularly plausible. The story is not bad mind you, and the game throws so half-decent choice and consequence your way every once in a while even if it's marred by the game's poor morality system.All in all Knights of the Old Republic is a solid piece of RPG, it might have some technical issue, it might have some poor combat and it might have some less than stellar story writing but none of this is enough to detract from the overall quality of the game. It might not be the RPG classic we were hoping for but it does give you many, many hours of entertainment.			"

												In all my 20 years of living. I have played everything from Super Mario RPG, all the way up to FarCry 4 and Fallout New Vegas, no game gives me a feeling, no, a sensation of feeling like a total badass like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. bonus points given due to it being made by Bioware.Basic storyline: This game is set some 4,000 years before the original trilogy, during this time, the Sith are trying to take over the entire galaxy, just like your average bad guy corporation, after you spend thirty or so minutes of game time aboard a ship that should've been destroyed by the time you first opened your eyes, you already will have the basic controls down. After a few hours, you will get the force, despite this. I still tended to stick with the tried and true rifle-type weapons, even though the lightsabers, which come in dual, short and standard types, are incredible to look at and use,   RPG Elements: The greatest asset in this game, to me, is the ability to modify certain weapons and armour, including lightsabers and Jedi Robes that turn you into a walking laser sponge, the addition of a conversation system was one of the first examples I've seen, and was used later just as innovatively in the Mass Effect series. Final thoughts: I love this game, it's light-hearted, but can be serious at the same time. I never had as much love for the second KoTOR game, because it didn't feel like the same game, if you're either a veteran of RPG's or are a kid just starting their journey into the gaming world, this is one of my personal top picks, it's fun, it can run on a potato, and for the hardcore Star Wars fan, it holds a little surprise from the comic series.

You can visit multiple planets, and thats just the vanilla version. The amount of mods is amazing and can improve gameplay substantially. This game is easily still worth 60 bucks, and for the price it's getting sold by, it's a steal.

												Bwee. This game might be old now, but its still one of the best RPG's ever made. Star Wars might be a tainted franchise in alot of ways, having produced alot of garbage and many terrible games. But some is good... and some is great, and this is one of the great things.Gameplay wise, it came between Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect, and you can see traces of both games in this one (the ""dice"" combat from BG and the dual morality and third person gameplay of ME). A few parts of the game are a bit slow, most of all in the beginning, but the later areas more than make up for this. And story... well, you will have to see that for yourself. No spoilers from me! It's one of the best in any RPG, with plenty of interesting characters to go with it. Especially that... droid. You will know which one when you meet them.This game pretty much always gets hugely discounted during major sales, so if you don't have this one you may as well pick it up cheap and check it out. You may find something you will like here. :)			"

												his WRPG brought to you by Bioware was a stunning release for its time and playing it really shows you where their newer games have come from. But how does it stand up to some of the standards set by their newer RPGs? Pretty well, in fact; however, there were some pretty major annoyances and some issues I did have with the game. For starters, I just got done playing Planescape: Torment, and that WRPG (released 4 years earlier) had infinitely better decision making paths than KotOR did. I recognize that this *may* be due to the confines of working in the Star Wars universe: you have the Dark Side and the Light Side - each contrary to the other, but really I felt it could have been done better. Your options in KotOR seem to boil down to A) I'm going to help you out or B) I'm going to be a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Example: You are in the slums and you have the ability to save a race of people for light side points. The dark side path is you can sell them out to some junk dealer because he wants to keep his profits up *for a measly 100 credits*! Just to let you know, that's not a lot of credits. And if you don't pick a side and want to stick in the middle path then guess what, no awesome light/dark side affiliated equipment for you sir! Speaking of roleplaying, if you decide you want to roleplay as a blaster user then you're going to have a bad time. As I said, I just got done with Planescape and I figured, ""why not go a charasmatic path"" like I did in that game. Well, KotOR thinks it's fun to throw you into 1v1 duels quite frequently, and if you don't have a lightsabre or focus on combat you're going to have some serious aggravation. Eventually I got through them and carved a niche for myself by spamming the Insanity and Force Wave abilities. Those abilities got me all the way through the final boss of the game, so another complaint I would have is game balancing - whether it's combat, dialogue choices to avoid battle, or other ways to accomplish things, I think this game could use a once-over. Some of the characters were also a little one-sided, not just regarding light vs dark side, but wholly uninteresting. Take T3-M4 for instance. Yes, it's a droid, but R2-D2 had a personality and T3-M4 doesn't, which is disappointing and I can only attribute it to laziness. The game is also a little glitchy. My characters ended up getting caught in doorways quite often and during conversational cutscenes sometimes weird things would happen - eg holding invisible weapons. A few final annoyances were whenever you suit up (either underwater or in outerspace) you walk stupidly slow and every time you travel from planet to planet the cutscenes are recycled and you end up playing the same repetitive ""space battle"" minigame. KotOR also has bad and unfrequent quicksave times (spam that F4 key!). The inventory was also quite a mess, a lot of wasted screen real estate in the menus and it was nigh impossible to determine exactly what items you receive as quest rewards.While the above may seem like a long list it really didn't effect my enjoyment *too* much (except for those 1v1 duels, ugh) and the game has a lot of merit to it. There are many fun and challenging puzzles, the music is phenomenal, using motiffs we know and recognize from Star Wars that weave seamlessly in and out of original material that keeps the nostalgia flowing, and the controls are quite good, allowing you to mostly play with your mouse hand only. And, most importantly, the story was excellent. I was really impressed overall with the narrative and felt empathy for most of the characters in my party (I really loved the other droid you get as well, meatbags!). Pros:NarrativeCharacterizationMusicLots of character customizationCons:Lack of ""good"" character customization from protagonistA little too ""black and white""Some annoyances (see above)All in all it was a memorable journey that I would recommend you try if you like Star Wars or Bioware/WRPGs but it falls short of my ""must play"" stamp of approval.

If you know any die had fans of star wars ask them about this game and i bet they will tell you its amazing. Its a old game i belive this was what mass effect was based off its Lead Designer is Casey Hudson so its the same guy, if you love mass effect then this is mass effect but star wars.This game lets you be a sith or a jedi some bounty hunting can be done too plus swoop racing and dueling. This game is the best star wars game i have played and im going as far as saying the best star wars game we will have for a long time. 10/10!			"

												10 years ago this game was released to critical acclaim, winning multiple GOTY awards for obvious reasons to those that have played it. If you havent played it yet I strongly recommend you do as it is essentially your own Star wars trilogy. Ill go into why it is so in a spoiler section at the end but this game has such a great twist I wouldnt advise reading into it. But enough exposition and acclaim, The game feels like Star wars; From the fantastic sound design that captures the original score perfectly to the sound of lightsabers clashing and blasters firing. The set-peices, ships, weapons and armor all look like they are of some older era of the star wars universe capturing that feeling of an even longer time ago. The story and subject matter is (arguably) the best ever told and/or touched on in the Star wars universe telling countless stories of redemption, betrayal, revenge, hope, loss, sacrafice,ascension,downfall the list goes on, you become the embodiment of the character you play (good or evil) be it Sith, Jedi, Bounty hunter, Soldier, Scoundrel with any number intertwining for you to create this story thats set a long a fixed path into something of your own. Again making it your very own Star wars trilogy....************************************SPOILERS************************************************************************************From the point it begins to the point you escape Taris and arrive at the Jedi temple on Dantooine I consider to be the First Episode in th KOTOR trilogy and a story of the players new beginning (obviously). From the time you begin your training at the Jedi temple to the confronation and big reveal to be Episode II and the defining of the characters ascenion be it Dark or light. Events that Follow being Episode III with culmination of the Characters final acts as a savior and a Jedi or a Dark Lord of the sith.... Truly epic.			"

												Where do you begin, when they ask you to review one of the best games of all time? It's hard, I tell you what. But I'll give it a shot, regardless.My first experience with Knights of The Old Republic was on the original xbox, back in the year of 2004. And my only memories from it are good ones, walking on the bottom of the sea on the ocean world of Manaan, or wandering around amongst the trees of the wookie planet of Kashyyyk all made you feel incredible due to the great sound-design and beautiful (at the time) visuals. The gameplay can feel a bit slow and sluggish by todays standards since it's not superfast and pulse pounding the way some games are, but that's not what it was about, and frankly, I rarely cared so much about the gameplay in this title because of the fact that the story, the characters and the setting is what brings this puppy home. It's safe to say that what Bioware created with this title was a game of the ages, something that would stand the test of time forever, and proudly so. When people place this game on their ""Best games of all times"" list, they do not do it for any other reason than the one that it is a god damn good game.The story will take you far and wide, beginning with your character (which you can customize, male-female, caucasian/hispanic/african etc) waking up on board of a republic ship that is under attack by Sith forces, for you who don't know, the sith are the ""bad"" guys. In the spirit of spoiling as little as possible, you end up on a city-planet called Taris, where you have to take on an underground crime syndicate, join a swoop race (kind of like floating motorcycles) and take out a crimeboss. All while doing this, you will meet companions who joins your party. The companions are varied, and extremely well fleshed out, and they all have good voice-actors (admittedly some better than others).By the time you're done on the world of Taris, you will have spent about 3-6 hours in the game, depending on how much time you spent doing sidequests, exploring and talking to your companions. And that's just the first ""major world"" that you get to visit during your main quest, which I shall not spoil for you! Regardless, you have several more worlds to visit during your quest, and the game can take you anywhere from hardly any time, to a god damn lifetime to complete. All in all, I rate this game a perfect score, there is a bug here and there, but they are rare and have never (to me) been gamebreaking. So to summarize:Amazing storyAmazing charactersAmazing setting and locationsAmazing gameplay (in my opinion, this is more subjective since some do not like the DnD combat in RPGs)Amazing sound-design and soundtrack (composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule!)It's a god damn 10 out of 10 in my book. And everyone should at least give this game a try. :)			"

												If you ever wondered where games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age came from, then sit down, my child, and let me tell you of a game called KOTOR. This game is one of the best, all-time Western RPGs. Yeah, it's showing its age compared to more modern RPGs. Yeah, the combat system is clunky and easy to exploit (the AI's pathing is awful). Yeah, the graphics aren't the great thing they were back in the early 2000s. But the real heart of this game is the story and characters. It was one of the first games of its kind and wasn't afraid to take risks, paying homage to the old Star Wars trilogy while creating its own interesting universe and characters. I had this game as a kid on my old Dell (it was piece of junk) like ten years ago and I thought this game was the ♥♥♥♥ back then. Basically, you play as a Jedi trying to stop the Sith from destroying the Republic. You can use the Force to bring unholy destruction on the dirty non-Jedi plebes or even just use blasters, because lightsabers are for the weak.Generally, the choices go between being the nicest guy (or lady!) in the galaxy, or being a total ♥♥♥♥. But there's a lot of good writing you don't see in a lot of modern video games. Especially from your companions (9 of them in total). I'm able to get it running on my MSI laptop w/Windows 10, so I'm not sure the difficulty others are having. I disabled movies and it works just fine (you're not missing out on anything essential with the movies). Also, get Flawless Widescreen from somewhere in the internets if you have a large monitor, it helps a bunch with some of the visual glitches users run into. If this game comes on sale and you like Star Wars or RPGs, definitely consider buying it.			"

												This game has it all: an awesome story, amazingly written characters, immersive dialogue options and possibility to customize your character. There are also multiple endings, depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Mechanics aren't exactly what I'm used to, but they're interesting and fun to learn.Of course the title is a bit old -in graphics and mechanics- and there are some cons, like the extremely unorganized inventory, but if you're looking for a real old school RPG this is definitely what you are looking for. If you like Star Wars even a little bit, this is a must-play.Also, you get to customize your own lightsaber. What are you waiting for?			"

The gameplay is not spectacular, but gets the job done really well, the story is top notch and it feels really satisfying building and wielding your first lightsaber.

The graphic style ages well and with 3rd party software you can get this game to run at 1080p, which looks pretty good for its age.Even though running the game is a bit of a hassle, I still strongly recommend this to any RPG fan, even if you're not interested in the Star Wars universe.

One of the greatest games of all time, if you haven't played it you owe it to yourself as a gamer to play this game at least once.Not only is the story one of the best out there and will shock you in many ways but the graphics were ahead of their time so it doesn't look as bad as you'd think a 2003 game would look, in fact it still looks pretty good. Every decision you make can effect how people react to you so you can get multiple playthroughs of it not to mention two different paths you can take. With a quick mod you can add in widescreen 1080p as well. Best money you will spend for a game, wait for a sale and you can pick it up for peanuts.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is one of the most beloved Star Wars games to date. It takes place about 4000 years before the Rebellion destroyed the first Death Star. The game is an RPG (Based on the D20 system, meaning the game 'rolls' to see how much damage you will do at the current turn). Before you start up, make sure to familiarize yourself with RPG mechanics (For example, you will want to know what Fortitude is, or saves)The game has an average completion time of about 30 hours, and about 20 if you've played before. The story is one thing that is truly remarkable. If you haven't had the game spoiled for you, drop what you're doing and just invest your time into this, as it has one of the most compelling and unexpected stories you could find in the Star Wars universe.Pros-Long story-Story keeps you invested-Great variety of planets-Lot's of variety in playstylesCons-No native 1080p support-Few bugs on newer OS's (Windows 7 and above)			"

												It's hard to find games like this. Its complexity. Its story. Its intrigue. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic draws out as an instant role-playing game classic, influenced modern RPGs like never before. Developed by an unknown company, known as BioWare, the game is a golden hit by its original dialogue, choices, companions, and character development. The game even expands the Star Wars universe that can equate to the six Star Wars films by its popularity. Despite that the game was released in 2003, there is no argument that the game has a direct impact in popular culture and how it shapes other games, even Bethesda Studio's Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. Knights of the Old Republic is need to be played from anyone who thinks that other RPGs is better suit than this; they're wrong. Never underestimate the aged graphics and look upon its gameplay elements and choice elements that will determine your fate for the Star Wars galaxy.			"

												Knights of the Old Republic is an RPG based in the Star Wars universe. It is about 20 hours long and it is turn based. Normally I dislike turn based RPG's, but this game is an exception. The way you can go through the game making light and dark side choices is also very intriguing. If a woman has a bounty on her head you can leave her to her fate, get the bounty removed, or collect the bounty for yoursel. The story is also pretty good with a fair amount of depth and I think all Star Wars fan should give it a shot.			"

You go explore planets, get members for your party, level-up and all that jazz. First played it on the original Xbox, then got it for cheap a while back. Has visually aged like a woman, but plays like a nympho who will die if it doesn't get the D.

It just felt a teeny bit clunky to me. But other than that, it is a splendid game and I would definitely suggest it to any RPG or Star Wars fan, or any gamer in general.

												Knights of the Old Republic is an RPG based in the Star Wars universe. It is about 20 hours long and it is turn based. Normally I dislike turn based RPG's, but this game is an exception. The way you can go through the game making light and dark side choices is also very intriguing. If a woman has a bounty on her head you can leave her to her fate, get the bounty removed, or collect the bounty for yoursel. The story is also pretty good with a fair amount of depth and I think all Star Wars fan should give it a shot.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is one of the most beloved Star Wars games to date. It takes place about 4000 years before the Rebellion destroyed the first Death Star. The game is an RPG (Based on the D20 system, meaning the game 'rolls' to see how much damage you will do at the current turn). Before you start up, make sure to familiarize yourself with RPG mechanics (For example, you will want to know what Fortitude is, or saves)The game has an average completion time of about 30 hours, and about 20 if you've played before. The story is one thing that is truly remarkable. If you haven't had the game spoiled for you, drop what you're doing and just invest your time into this, as it has one of the most compelling and unexpected stories you could find in the Star Wars universe.Pros-Long story-Story keeps you invested-Great variety of planets-Lot's of variety in playstylesCons-No native 1080p support-Few bugs on newer OS's (Windows 7 and above)			"

												This game is one of my favorites of all time, and with Steam it does have some unexplained issues. If you're having major graphical glitches (but don't understand why because your computer isn't a chump,) turn off shadows and grass. Along with that, set compatiblity mode to run with Windows XP Service Pack 3. You're find it after right-clicking KOTOR in your library and going to Properties at the bottom of the pop-up menu. I was enraged by not knowing this, but I hoped I helped someone out there! Thanks.			"

												I have put well over a thousand hours of game play into this game before I even got it on steam, I played it when I was younger and I still play it from time to time. Weather you are a StarWars enthusiast, or just getting into the vast wold of the Force this is a must have in your game library.The game offers a fair amount of replayablility, both in game and from the modding community. Three Base classes and then three more jedi classes on top of that, along with a full range of Skills and attributes. Anyone who has played D&D or some form of paper game that uses the D20 rulings will get even more out of this game, KotoR's turn based combat style follows a very simulat D20 format that some of us are so familiar with.

												This is my first playing a Bioware game ever and hearing the popularity of Bioware in recent years of its story and characters I had to check it out, and what better way they manage to create in their early works and my favorite franchise, Star wars!Story I will try sum it up as much possible without any major spoilers, the story is average good I’m sorry to say I can’t be wow by the plot which I will explain later in more details, but the main plot is interesting don’t get me wrong. The light vs. dark side I should say is cliché but there are some story telling that is pretty surprisingly interesting picking up half way through the game. 	I chose to be light side because I’m always am and got motivated to defeat Malak the antagonist of the game. There are some nice moments where you go “awe” and “what” and that’s good, it shows Bioware was starting to stable themselves as the “capital ship” of 3rd party company.However, their earliest isn’t much what I expected because the backstory of the old Republic never mention this ever and even talks about the origin of the war. Yes they do talk about the rise of the Sith but just a brief one, I was expected a prequel of the star wars movies about telling the origin of what happen about everything; the war, the rise of Sith, the origin of the Republic everything, but no not a whole lot and both side doesn’t show much color. The Sith are so generic with their “I’m a snob so that means everyone I look is a weakling” their motivation of doing this to so weak to me, yes they do what Sith do but what they are doing just doesn’t convince me to show sympathy to them or even see them differently. Is just “he’s bad and we’re good.” What about the republic surely they are some goody-two shoes? Well at first almost but no they can be somewhat corruptive and wrong of their morals too! And that’s what I want from it, the republic side showing its own “both side” but also want the Sith to show “their two faces as well” instead of all being rich snob Nazis. A final note on this yes they do some moments with the Sith on Korriban but not entirely enough to see them as “they are evil but I can see their side point why they do this horrid things.”Charactersthe NPC and partners are interesting as well especially I like that when you got the time you can talk to them and hear some back stories even if you bring one of them along in one certain planet, more dialogue options to choose and you will have a good backstory of the character. Malak I think is a cool villain especially the way he talks plus and robo-jaw that he has is really cool to look at.Now here comes the problems I have this game and two things are repetitive and cliché for the story aspect side. The NPC of any species just looks the same especially on the human side they have the same texture face model which doesn’t add a lot of emersion seing the same human character twice and even the voice, the alien sort of get a pass but their voice over just doesn't because they reuse the same alien language dialouge many times and it gets tired around the ears. Yes, I know that Bioware was at their first steps and you could say is budget problem by not hiring more actors and having to change face textures about everything that won’t affect too much on the rating scale, is just a nitpick problem where you try to discover a new world with new species (though in my case I already know the species) but they sound the same you wanted to see many new variation looks/voice as possible. Hopefully in the second game when the game got very popular it will have more.Choose your sideAlright now the big one and is, which side would you choose, well I should say, none of it matters! Well what I meant was it really doesn’t matter in “morality,” yes of course you still choose your light and dark ending but at endgame, for the rest of the game it really doesn’t matter if you are the lightest person in the world, you can still choose the dark path at the end of the game. So what gives? What is the objective of those light side dark side points? Is really for gameplay wise in armor and weapons, the force powers I made my main character have some dark powers even some of my light-side partners, which doesn’t really matter if you are good or not you can still equip dark powers or light powers if you are choosing your endings. Another thing about the moral points is just cosmetic option but only in the dark path when your character begins to change color. So now it sounds like it only effects gameplay and not story telling which blows badly right? Well at first yes, I thought it would be the biggest disappointment ever since no matter if you are the biggest jerk in this galaxy or the nicest one you can switch sides in matter of seconds. Well I should say not entirely in that center problem, because you can still have consequence when doing certain side quest and do evil things and in some planets some characters will pay you back hard, if you are prepare.No, I think the big point taker has to be your partners’ reaction to the player’s action. Yes they say “you did a wrong thing” but they never “punish” you for it or better yet leave you or stop you even though they are the once that help you do the main’s dirty deed. Most of your partners are from the light side and whatever you do will make them react but not upon action which is really shame. I expect during some quests or the main “dialogue” choice your friends will abandon you and you will be recruit with more dark players and the story switch to another quest, “conquest” I thought. You can be the biggest jerk without a reason to them and they won’t even leave your side no matter what you did, even by the next set of choice that you made “wrong” you can switch to being nice again and they will forget about your “dirty deeds.” I find it odd that after everything I do bad they won’t bat an eye of my behavior which just tells me that my choice won’t affect much around me until the very end, but during the whole game experience I thought choosing one side might affect the story telling as two sides, one fight for the good or join the Sith and fight from the republic and you will eventually fight Yoda! (Which I know that isn’t him.) My main when going dark or light doesn’t give a deeper meaning why he’s doing it, I’m just having that express feeling that “I do it because I’m a bully and want to take things just because,” “I’m good because I’m a goodie two-shoes,” and mind you I’m talking about story wise, the gameplay well that is different because I want the extra status boost.The side missions some I like but is just another generic “do this because is the right thing to do and do this because you are a jerk” Even the options you choose sounds a bit preachy for me thinking “well duh of course is bad to do this but should I?” There is only one side quest I think is my favorite where it involve no light or dark side points and only pure morality choice which about there I got a moral dilemma and I wish there was more like that but I know if it is it makes the system even more pointless.Verdict: The final verdict is a 7/10 a good starting game for Bioware’s time but need improvement on the writing, and moral choice but other than that I did enjoy the game despite some minor flaws the gameplay works flawlessly and I don’t have much of a problem to say, hopefully when I finish star war kotor 2 maybe things will change and improve until then, may the force be with you.

If you don't like Star Wars or never cared for it, and want a solid RPG, this is your ticket. If you like Star Wars and have been a fan for who knows how long, then nobody has done anything greater in the gaming industry for you than this. Play this game.

It brings back nostalgia, while also playing like an absolute dream at high settings. Adventuring through space, exploring foreign worlds, fighting wild beasts, this game has it all and more. If you love RPG's and want to really immerse yourself in the world of STAR WARS than this game is a must have for you. Play on the Darkside or play on the light, the options are limitless and you'll be in for a wild ride the entire time -- following a plot full of twists and turns. There is really no reason not to buy this game!			"

												Remember that feeling you got the first time you saw Star Wars? (I don't mean colossal dissapointments that were I-III) That is the feeling that this game evokes throughout the 40-60 hour story. All the elements that made Star Wars the science fiction epic that it is today are present in this well crafted and designed classic. Be a evil Sith and torture people with lightning from your fingertips or be the uncorruptable Jedi, or forge your own path in the gray area between. Well written and more than worth the price.

												Now 13 years old, the affectionately nicknamed Kotor is still worth playing. Sure the menus are clunky and textures show their seams from time to time, but the meat of the game, the plot and the character development, is still fresh. The story arc, like with the original Star Wars trilogy, is better if you've managed to avoid key spoilers. Even knowing what's going to happen doesn't stop the journey there from being wonderful because the main plot is secondary to the events happening on the planets involved in it anyway. In true Star Wars fashion, the mission at hand has our heroes hopping from one planet to the next and each layover is focused around getting entangled in the goings-on of that place and its people rather than moving the plot forward.  Captions are a necessity as some speak in their native tongues, further driving home the fact that the galaxy doesn't revolve around you as the player. The world and its people feel alive, though the lack of player accommodation can get a bit tiresome.The world of Kotor may not be an 'open-world', but with a seedy card game-based gambling ring, a struggling racing circuit, and plenty of side quests, there are too many distractions to call it linear either. The same can be said for the physical act of playing the game as well. Straightforward violence with all its lightsaber dueling, blaster shooting, and Force pushing is always an option, and though it is a fantastic spectacle of parring and dodging, the fun of it wears out quickly. Thankfully, a number of encounters can be bypassed with a clever application of a character's skills. Computers can be hacked to shut down security systems, derelict droids can be repaired only to be sent against their former masters, and enemies can be persuaded to disband before a conflict even arises. For a game that was designed with the original Xbox in mind, there is a surprising amount of freedom in how the game is played.  That freedom is echoed in the game's approach to the player character's companions. Though only two can be chosen to leave the ship at any time, they all hang around and level up either way, meaning the dynamic can be altered to suit a situation as it arises. Simply talking to your companions can reveal a good portion of their character, but it's the personal quest each companion has that acts as their turning point. How players react during a personal quest will affect their compatriots for better or worse, providing some bit of control over their personalities, and giving the player the option of role-playing with the group dynamic in addition to their own created character. At its core, Kotor is about a group of heroes struggling against the dark side of the Force while traveling through hyperspace and interacting with a wide variety of alien species, just like any good Star Wars episode. But Kotor offers more than just lightsabers and blasters, and it never loses sight of the legacy it's adding to.			"

After a few quick fixes, if any (your lucky), your able to play the game with little to none of the issue I went through. If your a fan of Star Wars, this is the game for you. If your a fan of RPGs, this is the game for you. The way the game looks might be old but doesn't in any way make it unenjoyable (for me). I highly recommend getting this game and the sequel, KoTOR 2.

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic or Kotor for short is an amazing game set in an era of the Star Wars universe that is never explored in the movies. In A New Hope Obi-Wan Kenobi says to Luke: “For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times…”. But because Episode 1 starts just before the Clone Wars we never get to see this “more civilized age”. This is where KOTOR comes in! Set thousands of years before the Clone Wars and the fall of the Jedi, Kotor tells a very compelling story that doesn’t mess around. You are a Smuggler with a shady past that is charged with protecting a ship that’s escorting a very powerful Jedi master known as Bastila who years before staged a trap that killed the last evil Sith lord. The ship gets shot down so you, the pilot and Bastila use an escape pod and just barley manage to avoid the ship blowing up on you. The pods crash on a planet called Taris And you find out that the Sith lord had an apprentice that managed to escape Bastila’s trap has the planet occupied and flooded with Sithtroopers, any ships that try to leave are melted down by a Sith field around the planet. Now you and the Pilot of the destroyed ship must find the Jedi master before the Sith do. Along the way you meet some really interesting characters that you can recruit to  help you on your quest such a Twi'lek and Wookie duo that grew up on the streets and stick together to survive. The combat is pretty slow, (it’s kinda like a refined version of Fallout 1 or 2) but you can still manage to get into tense fights where you just barely make it out alive. It’s makes for a very compelling game where there is always something to do and a reason to care. Another cool thing about KOTOR: A Star Wars story is that you don’t really need to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy it! That’s right, unlike most licensed games where they just assume that you’re already familiar with the series *cough*Shadow of Mordor*cough* in Kotor they explain everything you need to know very early on. Besides, most Star Wars fans aren’t very knowledgeable on this era. All in all, this is a must play for Star Wars fans and RPG fans alike.			"

												 Ignore my low Steam hours, I played this hours on end on the original Xbox port and then on a disc version for PC. This game is incredible. Even if you aren't much of a Star Wars fan or fan of the Extended Universe, I still recommend this game. This was the original game by the great Bioware, and so when you are playing it you might think to yourself ""Hey, this is a lot like Mass Effect!"" Pros:+++Great Story-I have to say this is one of the most well written stories in a video game ever, in my opinion. Don't let anyone spoil the story for you.  One of the greatest plot twists ever! ++Non-linear gameplay-You choose what planet you go to and in what order in the story.++Great and Memorable Characters-Anyone who has played this game knows how interesting and memorable the characters are; not one person could forget Carth or Bastila.++Fun Turn-Based Gameplay-Very reminiscent of Tabletop RPG's mechanic wise.+Interesting Locations-Some planets return from the movies, but their are plenty of new ones to keep you interested, from a Sith planet haunted by the ghosts of Sith Lords long passed to a planet entirely of water with a few cities here and there.Cons:-Somewhat slow start-Beginning of the game can get quite redundant after a few playthroughs, but still has enough to keep you interested and having fun.-Shows its age graphically-There are mods to fix this, however.Ultimately I give it a 9.9/10. A great experience.			"

												My second Star Wars game after Battlefront II on the Xbox.   I am really enjoying this game so far, I didn't know I would get so hooked.  The gameplay is fun and the story is very intriguing! Even though I was gifted this game, I would recommend you buy it if you're looking for a good adventure RPG.			"

												Here is my review of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.As a huge Star wars fan it surprises me that it took me so long to play this game. I recently picked it up in the steam christmas sale for like 3 bucks. I played a couple days later to see how good it actually was. to be honest at first I absolutely hated it. the combat style was completely new to me and I had no idea about anything in the old republic era of star wars so I closd the game and didn't play it for another month. I opened it back up convinced that this game was something. I mean most people say that this is the greatest Star wars game ever, let alone rpg ever.I beat this game a couple hours ago and I have to say that this has been the best Star Wars game I have ever played in my life. Number one this game has an insane amount of content in it. I beat the main storyline in about 30 hours. Most games that hae come out recently don't have a storyline this long. The characters in this game are absolutely awesome to learn about and get to know through the game. the game incorporates a kind of moral system where decisions you make in the game effect whether you go to the dark side and go to the light side. This game has a very cool combat system (was you get the hang of it.) It is turn based so most people (at least me) was not used to this type of system. The graphics are very dated yes, but the game is by far playable. I honestly didn't really have a problem with them. But the best part of the game is that it feels completely ""star wars"" I really did feel as if I was imersed in the world of Star Wars.Now for cons of this game. In my opinion there isn't that many cons. The only ones I can think of is that your ""bag"" i guess or where you hold items in endless you can hold a million items if you wanted to which is cool but the items aren't very organized which is the con in this case. My other con is that after I beat the game I planned on doing all of the leftover side quests but when I beat it just rolled credits and I wasn't allowed to go back and do other things in the game which kind of annoyed me.My final rating of this game would have to be 10/10.

												This game should appeal to anyone who has a good taste in RPG's especially those from older console generations. I personally need every game to excite me and make me want to continue playing it, ultimately that is why I always go back to those games. KOTOR is one of those games. I have played it through and through. Please, if you are a KOTOR virgin, remember to never read a guide too far ahead, or anything that would be a spoiler, you are playing possibly the most epic game story ever.			"

												You know, every couple years you have one ""pearl"" in every kind of genre. 2003, BioWare and Obsidian gave us ""Knights of the Old Republic"" or short: ""KotoR""And this game IS absolutly amazing. WARNING: May include spoilers, even though I´ll do my best to keep them out.KotoR plays like 4000 years BBY (for not SW Nerds: Battle Before Yavin, or 4000 years before ""A New Hope"").Darth Revan and Darth Malak, two heros of the Mandalorian war, a war that could´ve destroyed the Republic, return to the galaxy as new Dark Lord of the Sith. Darth Revan, the leader of the newly ""build"" Sith army wins one battle after the other, before he´s betrayed by his student Darth Malak, who wants to rule on his own. Now that we know a little bit about this games backstory (which is also included in the game and one central point of the plot), let´s get down to the mainstory.You´re a soldier (or one of two other classes), recruited for duty on the ""Endar Spire"". While you´re resting, the Endar Spire gets hijacked by the Sith army. You try to fight your way trough the enemy, while you do your best to reach the Jedi ""Bastila Shan"", an important role in this war because of her ""Force Meditation"". As you´re unable to find her, you make an emergency landing on the planet ""Taris"", which is confronted with a sith blockade. On Taris you´re trying to find Bastila and afterwards leave this planet. As soon as you found her (after doing some favors and a veeery terrible first 2-3 hours), you leave Taris and travel to ""Dantooine"". As soon as you arrive, your Jedi-Training starts and a long journey to save the galaxy begins...Even though KotoR is already 11 years old, it still has some good graphics to offer. Surely there are so animations that look kinda strange or even some textures which look ""washed-out"", but it´s still a pretty game. You travel to different planets, which all have their individual look. As we´ve seen in BioWares ""Dragon Age 2"", this isn´t something they´re always able to achive ;) Also, some of the characters faces look kinda mechanic. They have a disturbing lack of emotions, espacially your main character. Yet they´re able to eradicate this by having absolutly professional voice actors. The atmosphere created by a very typical Star Wars score, pretty graphics and  very well written (and spoken) dialogues is intense and believable, espacially as you´re reaching the end. Planets like ""Kashyyk"" create their own unique flair and are very well translated from the source-material. Especially the dialogues do a good job of delivering story, feels and atmosphere and serve a very wide variaty of emotions. But as we all know, that´s something BioWare has mastered over the years. The character editor is also nice. Even though you don´t have that much influence on the appearance (as you can only decide how your character looks by some different faces, without having much influence on them), but you´re able to build a charater you want through the variaty of stats and attributs. A good and fair skill-system keeps you motivated to level up and the (even though it´s very limited) customization of your weapons will enable you to create a very individual character. I won´t say much about the story, but.. it´s absolutly amazing. I finish this game at least once a year (also KotoR II: TSL, which in my opinion is a little bit better, even though it´s an unfinished game) and I´m still enjoying it. It keeps you motivated to go on, find all this different NPC´s and involves you in a story that (at it´s time) was a amazing thing for the SW franchise. I recommend you to buy this game and enjoy it. I´ratte it with an 8.6/10. It´s a classic. It´s an example for BioWares brilliance. Buy it now and you will have 20 hours of fun in a world that wants to be explored!			"

												By faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar Bioware's best RPG. This game is very old, but is still the crowning achievment of the studio. The combat is very tactical, but rewarding if you know what to do. The music brings chills down my spine. However, what really seals the deal is the story. It's unparalelled by any other star wars game, and the twist at the end. Play this game guys!An important thing to note is that it's a hassel to make it run, but if you do... It's a game you won't forget.			"

												KOTOR (as the cool kids call it) is; put simply; a classic. If you've enjoyed newer BioWare titles such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age, you will enjoy Knights of the Old Republic. Following a battle system very similar to Dragon Age, KOTOR puts you in the shoes of a force sensitive character trying to survive, find his (or her) place in the universe, and deciding between the call of the light side or the pull of the dark side. Of course you've got to save the universe somewhere along the way.This game shines in always giving you the option to CHOOSE how to do things. Will you help that troubled person, or destroy them? Will you show charity, or rob the helpless of what little they have? Whether you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a must play. Very few games give you an experience like this.The gameplay is no slouch either, with deep customization, party choices, and force powers to train and use. If you're a fan of RPGs, Star Wars, or video games in general, get this!			"

												The sequel manages to develop this game's lead character in a more meaningful way, than the entirety of this game. The lead character of this game is barely in KOTOR2.That's the difference between Bioware and Obsidian, in a nutshell.The most interesting thing in this game, is how the ""love"" relationships in this game are developed. Ironically, this is the exact thing that Bioware is slammed for doing these days.And ""The Twist"" sucked.This game is alright, but KOTOR2 is leaps and bounds better.KOTOR1 is a ""Saturday Morning Cartoon"" Star Wars game. KOTOR2 is a ""Thinking Man['s]"" Star Wars game.			"

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: Turn Based RPGThe Good+ The game has a lot of robust options in how you build your character. You start by choosing between 3 classes, soldier, scout or scoundrel. Each class obviously focuses on different aspects of combat. Further in the game you can then choose the Jedi you wish to be: Guardian, Consular or Sentinel. You can fully customize your character how you wish between attributes, skills, feats and jedi powers. All of this leads to many different options and replaybility in how you design your character+The core aspect of the game is that as you can either play as a Jedi that is good or evil. Saving people, being kind and choosing the peaceful solution leads you to the light side while doing the opposite leads you to the darkside. Doing so leads to certain bonuses to your Jedi Powers. Being good means Lightside powers will use less mana and darkside powers cost more and viceversa. I find the system to be very effective because it ties morality choices into gameplay, a feature that seems to be very lacking in today's modern games. +The game supports a solid story that is engaging throughout the entire game. Dialogue is well done although a bit heavy on exposition in the beginning. +As is the case with every Bioware game, the supporting cast of characters are interesting and unique and features some of the best writing in the game. Getting to know your companions and there back stories is one of the highlights of the game. +The game has plenty of interesting sidequests that are fun to play and depending on how you solve them really start to shape your character. I wish there was more ambiguity with the quests because it becomes very obvious which is the good and evil way to solve them. A moral grey area would have made choices tougher to make.+ The game takes place across a series of planets within the Star Wars universe. Each location feels different from the last and has a rich back story that just adds to the authenticity. The AverageCombat in the game is basic, simply select your choice of attack then watch and hope your character can actually connect with a hit. It doesn't feel very engaging especially in the later parts of the game when you become really powerful. The game had many graphical glitches and bugs in certain areas that made it difficult to play.Final boss is frustratingThere are a lot of areas in the game that feel big and empty.The BadThe UI especially navigating to find items in your inventory is a chore and frustrating. The inventory screen is a long list of your items. Finding a specific item can be problematic, for example, if you find a data pad and want to read it, you have to open your inventory scroll through a long list of items until you find it. If you have other datapads in your inventory that you haven't checked yet then you have to check each one until you find the one you're looking for. There are options to filter the list based on specific items but this doesn't fix the overall problem of a bad overall inventory management system. ConclusionI have played this game many times before it came on steam and having it in my library I decided to play it again to see how well it holds up and I was pleasantly surprised. This game feels like the blueprint for Mass Effect as it shares many similarities in its design choices.  "

												Since the original posting of this review there now appear to be more trouble shooting resources than ever before. Steam has also improved refunds. I still do not recommend the steam version from personal experience and have had better success and instant playability with the GoG version on three separate computers.If you don't like trouble shooting this game probably isn't for you.I have found KotOR to be near impossible to play through steam. Some people may not have much trouble starting it but a majority are not able to get this game to run without spending a significant amount of time troubleshooting. The first time two years ago after nearly an hour of trying fixes the game finally ran after character creation. I was about two minutes in  but could not figure out how to progress. Turns out it was bugged. More troubleshooting and I manage to finally get to the next part of the mission only for it to be bugged again. After a few hours I could not get the game at any more playable of a state. One year later I give it another shot and this time I can't even get the first mission to load. Close to four hours of work and I manged to play five minutes of the game.			"

												Alright I have finally put 100 hours into the steam version of this game and countless more back when I had this game on the xbox. About time I leave a review.This game was a massive part of my childhood growing up as I would always play it growing up. I had never really played an RPG style game such as Kotor before and have hardly played any others afterwards and was mainly only interested in the game for its connection to Star Wars. However, rpg experience grew on me and I really enjoyed the turn-based combat and roleplay aspects and would reccommend this game to the rpg fan and/or the casual Star Wars fan.One of the reasons I enjoyed this game and have replayed it many times (and will likely continue to do so) was the story and the characters which were an excellent part of the game.The graphics for this game are not bad despite being from 2003 (ok they are a little dated... but not bad at all)Now the game has been known to have some issues with some minor bugs and crashes and it can sometimes be hard to start the game but there many fixes that can be found on the internet from people who possibly have run into a similar problem that you could experience. Just remember to save often and in different slotsSummary:Story = GoodCharacters = GoodMusic = GoodGraphics = FineReplayability = Hell YeahHope this was helpful :)			"

Since then, I've been desperatly searching for a way to play it without buying another Xbox. Finally, the answer came. I built my own gaming computer, and got this game as soon as I could.Bioware always presents us with beautiful games full of in depth story and great characters, and KOTOR is one of the greatest. Even today, with all the amazing next generation graphics coming out with vantastic games like Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Uncharted 4, etc., KOTOR remains great. It is one of a kind and absolutely.....perfect!			"

												I got this game from my grandma for Christmas when it released. I never really had any experience with RPG games and I was really young but I could understand the dialogue well enough to love it. I'm still very young today but back then, the game felt so epic and HUGE! I felt like each planet would take days to finish when in reality it only took a few hours. This was the only game I would ever play, I had to have replayed it over 40+ times and this isn't an exaggeration! Once KOTOR 2 came out I just had to get it, the game was fun but not as memorable as KOTOR 1. I remember being actually scared at points in this game. When I arrived to Malachor V, I literally was frightened to play it. The atmosphere and music was so grim and well done! Yesterday, I found my original XBOX along with both games, I checked my save files and WOW, did I play a lot of this game. The music is so nostalgic and a masterpiece! I decided to replay both games and it still holds up today as my favorite game of all time! KOTOR will forever be in my heart.﻿ I could write an entire 5 page essay on the game because of so much more I have to say about it. But I'll leave it at this, and I highly highly encourage you to try out this game. It may seem kind of stale to todays standards, but back then, it was next-gen. This was the only game that I played in my childhood, and I probably played it for 4 years straight without ever getting bored of it. Please give this game a chance and even the sequel the same. One other thing I would like to mention is how emotionally invested in the characters you can get into this game. I was attatched to multiple characters and they felt like they were my friends in real life. I haven't ever had this feeling until recently, with the masterpiece ""The Witcher 3"", and honestly, it's amazing.			"

There are 100s of Mods that enhance this game and give it so much replayability.Cons:- The graphics are painfully bad (though Mods help)- The controls and combat are very clunky and take some time to get used to.- Can be buggy, so you should save often.It's a great game.

												I played this game when I was like 4 or 5, and I will admit I didn't get passed the second mission. I am 13 almost 14 now and I purchased this while it was on sale and was very hesitant on playing it. In late April I played it and being older I now understand ALL of it. I have had many struggles in the lower city and on the last mission of Taris, and may or may not have thrown my mouse at the wall. During the last mission on Taris I forgot to save MULTIPLE times right before the boss battle resulting in 2 hours of my life wasted...Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Star Wars. the controls are nice, and the pause during combat is VERY helpful. My favorite part is when I walked up to an alien and he was being harrased by children, I told them to stop and they drew swords and killed me... 11/10 would tell them to stop again			"

												KOTOR is a great game with an amazing story and character development as well as solid voice acting. Bioware has been crafting these aspects of games right for a long time. This game also has a stellar sense of environment for its time in regards to the planets you visit: each area has a distinctive and memorable atmosphere and adjoining characters. The music, geography, encounters, and side-quests all make each area an amazing experience on its own.The component that makes this game a must-own and a classic, however, is its story. The fact that you have true agency over certain situations through dialogue is engaging and makes for a unique gaming experience. The parts of the story that you don't have control over still create such a compelling narrative that truly inhibits emotion - something that many games tend to lack.While no one needs another review to confirm that this game is a classic worthy of any and everyone's library, another voice to support is always helpful.

Also has a bunch of unexpected and genius twists that kick you in the balls and make you say ""What the hell?""+Brilliant yet simple combat system based on the D&D dice roll system.+Lots of customization for you and your crew.+Lovable characters that you actually see develop through in-game dialogue selections(except Juhani)+Decent graphics for a 2003 game.+The planets you visit are diverse and extremely fun to explore.+Large range of weapons and powers+Light side and dark side alignment choices are present (you can be a saint or a ♥♥♥♥, your choice).+Has HK-47, the slyest and murderous son(or droid?) of a gun that you MUST purchase when you're in Tatooine if you want to laugh all the way to your final fight with Darth Malak. Also has Jolee, the sterotypical old black man that makes you crack up at his sarcastic antics.+Mods support, but why modify an already amazing game,CONS:-Lots of bugs.-Pazaak, the most unfair and unbalanced variation of the game Blackjack/21-Podracing gets old.-Juhani, the most emo character in Star Wars history. I half expected her to burst out singing ""Crawling.""To be honest who gives a damn about the cons. Just get this game if you want to immerse yourself into a 50 hour campaign of lightsaber duels, firefights, well rounded characters(except for you-know-you) and the best Star Wars story, hell even the best story in a video game.10/10			"

												Simply awesome. If you like role playing games and are a fan of the Star Wars franchise, getting this game is a no-brainer. The graphics are a bit dated, but that's to be expected from a game released in the early 2000's, and it's still a very playable game despite the aged appearance.			"

												Like Star Wars? Like RPGs? Then you will love KOTOR.Don't be put off by it's age. I played it for the first time 12 years after it's release, and it's still great.Pros:- Rich story and great characters.- Fun and rewarding ""Powers"" and ""Skills"" system- You can choose different paths that changes the story- Dark side/Light side choices- MODS. There are 100s of Mods that enhance this game and give it so much replayability.Cons:- The graphics are painfully bad (though Mods help)- The controls and combat are very clunky and take some time to get used to.- Can be buggy, so you should save often.It's a great game. I picked it up on a whim for 10 bucks. Totally worth it!			"

												Well, this is THE BEST STAR WARS GAME to get, it has it all, compelling story, awesome (and well developed) characters and combat (even if it is a bit clunky and old dated, i still quite rather enjoyed it), that ending was phenomenal, but because this game is old and there was not many software updates, the game brings some bugs to the table, at my case, i didn't had many eccounters with them, but when i had... Darth Malak seemed like a nice guy to talk with, my 30 hour save got corrupted right when i was going to face him... Though i still beaten the game, that experience made me not want to play it a second time, fearing that what happened to me in the first time would repeat, i would still say that you MUST buy this game if you are a Star Wars fan..

												I got this game from my grandma for Christmas when it released. I never really had any experience with RPG games and I was really young but I could understand the dialogue well enough to love it. I'm still very young today but back then, the game felt so epic and HUGE! I felt like each planet would take days to finish when in reality it only took a few hours. This was the only game I would ever play, I had to have replayed it over 40+ times and this isn't an exaggeration! Once KOTOR 2 came out I just had to get it, the game was fun but not as memorable as KOTOR 1. I remember being actually scared at points in this game. When I arrived to Malachor V, I literally was frightened to play it. The atmosphere and music was so grim and well done! Yesterday, I found my original XBOX along with both games, I checked my save files and WOW, did I play a lot of this game. The music is so nostalgic and a masterpiece! I decided to replay both games and it still holds up today as my favorite game of all time! KOTOR will forever be in my heart.﻿ I could write an entire 5 page essay on the game because of so much more I have to say about it. But I'll leave it at this, and I highly highly encourage you to try out this game. It may seem kind of stale to todays standards, but back then, it was next-gen. This was the only game that I played in my childhood, and I probably played it for 4 years straight without ever getting bored of it. Please give this game a chance and even the sequel the same. One other thing I would like to mention is how emotionally invested in the characters you can get into this game. I was attatched to multiple characters and they felt like they were my friends in real life. I haven't ever had this feeling until recently, with the masterpiece ""The Witcher 3"", and honestly, it's amazing.			"

												This is an attempt to make a spoiler free review from a modern perspective for people unsure as to whether to purchase the game and are unfamiliar with it, but it is, of course, my own opinion, and an informed consumer should look at multiple reviews before buying.Gameplay: The game follows a D&D style turn based combat system, which can either be fun or needlessly boring depending on your preference. It is not a very difficult game to beat, either. Most enemies are there for the sake of being there to slow you down and/or give you something to do. Difficult fights that require you to scratch your head and mix up your approach are few and far between. Don't get me wrong, that does not necessarily make this an unenjoyable experience, but those who wish for a challenge will be dissapointed. In between combat you will focus mostly on dialogue (WARNING: there is A LOT of dialogue in this game; if you are not a fan of listening or reading lots of text, it is unlikely that you will appreciate this game very much), though you will probably also be doing quite a bit of inventory management and min-maxing of equipment, too. Skills in this game are usually used to aid in combat or dialogue (i.e. repairing droids to help in fights, using persuade to get more money out of a quest that you were given, etc...) Apart from that there are several optional mini-games but that about sums up what you actually do.NOTE: It's very useful if you go into this game knowing how basic D&D or D20 RPG systems operate so you understand what all the stats mean. You might have some trouble getting a grasp of the systems without knowing anything about that.IMPORTANT NOTE: This game has difficulty running on anything newer than Windows XP. It's probable you'll have to do some troubleshooting to fix issues playing the game, especially with cutscenes.Story and Quests: The main story in KOTOR is good,  but is unlikely to be that life-changing or awe inspiring for anyone, and its big twist can be seen coming for some time if the player has been paying close enough attention to all the dialogue and story thus far. The main plot also begins rather slowly and takes quite a bit of time to develop. This is not the game for the impatient and easily bored. Sidequests typically are, again, good, but not great. There are some real gems in there, though. I mean, it's a Bioware game. Perhaps the biggest strike against it is the binary morality system. You tend to either be the nicest and most compassionate person in the galaxy, or be a psychotic space Hitler. That being said, the game is classic Star Wars in design, so it's likely that is purposeful, but you should still be aware you are unlikely to be morally or ethically challenged or questioned in any way during this game (very much unlike its sequel, KOTOR 2).Characters: I'm giving this its own section because I feel like it deserves it. Optional party member quests and dialogue are a large part of this games overall story. Most party members in KOTOR are not particularly interesting, and it's likely you'll only do the backstories for characters you do find interesting. But most of this is entirely optional, so it doesn't really count as a strike against the game, and is a nice addition.Sound: Music is by Jeremy Soule so of course it's good. It is not classic John Williams, however. Take that as you will. It can either be good or bad.Graphics: Very dated. I don't feel the urge to go into greater detail as you can just look at screenshots above.Aesthetic: It is mostly bright and colorful without overdoing it. Nothing particularly stands out here. It's vibrant where it wants to be vibrant and dark where it wants to be dark. I don't really have anything to compare it to. Again, I recommend just looking at screenshots.Conclusion: It's a very good game, and definitely worth playing if you enjoy this style of combat and are patient enough with the story. You don't even need to be into Star Wars to have a lot of fun with this game.TL;DR: It's a quintessential Star Wars story (albeit a very slow paced one) mixed with D&D style gameplay and sidequests. If that sounds like something you'd like, you will probably enjoy this game. Be aware that if you try to run it on anything newer than Windows XP you can have problems, especially with the cutscenes. You may have to do some troubleshooting to get it to work.			"

												Revan, Bastila, Carth, Mission, Zaalbar, Juhani, HK, Canderous, and Jolee would form the crew of the Ebon Hawk, and together, embark on a journey unlike any other in the Star Wars Universe. One that is a tale of friendship and hope. A saga of darkness and light. An examination of morality and corruption. A study of past sorrows giving way to future joys… all these things and more. Framed by the journeys of Revan, who wanted nothing more than to keep the galaxy and those he loved, safe. Together, the crew would endure the trials of Tatooine’s Dune Sea, uncover the mysteries of the Utopian society of Manaan, trudge through the thick worshyr forests of Kashyyk, and encounter, first hand, the power of the Dark side on the Sith academy of Korriban. Piece by piece, planet by planet, they would complete the Star map.

												Before Mass Effect and Dragon age were released in the galaxy far far away was a game called Star Wars Knight of the old republic. Where evil and good are the opposite and you my friend have the choise of becoming one of them. Do you want to join forces with the dark side ? or face the dark side for the republic ? the choise is yours. Kotor is a brilliant rpg game by Bioware which till today is known for their amazing rpg games. Kotor has interesting story (with an amazing plot twist, one of the best that I have seen ), great characters, good gameplay and most importantly the game is over 30 hours of gameplay also lets not forget that it isn't an easy game and most likely you will die alot while playing the game. This is the game that caught my interest in the Star Wars universe. This is the game that worth the title of Game of the year 2003			"

												Its an old game that requires alot of work to get running these days, many people who review this game negatively for technical problems have not bothered to attempt to fix any issues they encounter. With that in mind here is an honest run down of some things in it.Every character is exposition dump. Every character is a cliche. Every character keeps me smiling.  Its a bioware rpg so i guess ye. Combat system is old dnd ish. Turn based realtime combat. Can be satisfying with the thud of three lasers hitting a single target all at once dropping it instantly. Generally the combat sounds and looks good for its age, cwl dueling animations.In terms of gameplay its very easy to manage and is only a problem on sand ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planet (sry for edge cant spell it) due to level scaling enemies meaning you are swarmed by large numbers of tough asf sandpeople. (do it first)Force powers are cool to use but are comparable to spells u might see in a standard rpg really- Not that they dont appear fitting of star wars- just that the system is the exact same. Nice plot and companions, as well as the Darth Revan ofc being one of the most loved EU characters .  The second game gives us far more ♥♥♥♥♥♥y exposition regarding him that to me is cwl asf. (Is a Starwars Alexander the Great or maybe a starwars Rand al'thor/Matt?). Companions give you that good old exposition dump. However there is plenty of snappy dialogue and plot lines to chase with them. Canderous has some passionate stories for you. Mandalorians have some cool ♥♥♥ ships.If you have played the original dragon age- then expect a similar formula for how the game rolls.Finally- the music in this game is top tier... The opening theme for the game Endar Spire is amazing and the level is maintained from this game to the next. This ties in with the overall star wars atmosphere and universe building. Lots of details are filled by the heavy winded exposition. At the same time the atmosphere/music creates powerful dialogue and moments sometimes.  POTENTIAL SPOILERS ""They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind.  It can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity. ""shiiitttttOverall if you are willing to troubleshoot the game or perhaps buy it from GoG, deal with biowarerpgitus, aged graphics and aged battle mechanics you will find an atmosphere that breathes awesome and characters that go down in star wars history as the best!If u want an idea of the emotional music or kick ♥♥♥ music see belowEmotional:

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old republic is a huge series of tropes aimed at Star Wars nerds. You can equip a gun but can't even aim it, and the dialogue is frankly awful. The plot twist (You are Malak), was predictable for anyone with even two brain cells, unlike MW2's. For some reason however this game reviews amazingly high reviews from acne-ridden nerds that beat off to the female sidekick (Who has the dumbest name in videogame history: Bastiltda).As a predecessor to Mass Effect, I don't understand why this game is so bad.5/10			"

												KOTOR. Motha♥♥♥♥ING KOTOR. This game my middle school life bearable, even if I didn't make it off of Taris half the time.First, the negatives. This game will crash. A lot. It was originally for XBOX classic, so compatibility issues run amok on this game. Not so much for the sequal for some reason. Next, your teammate AI is equivalent to a 5-year-old when it comes to enemies, especially if they just come out of combat. If there's a herd of kathak hounds 20 yards out and they're about to die, they're gonna jog the distance and let off a few rounds before it occurs to them they might bleed to death before they pull a trigger any more. The graphics are kinda cruddy, but again, it was made for XBOX classic, so notm uch you can do to help that. As for positives, the lore is a nice bit of fun to sink your teeth in to if you're into that (I know I am), and if you set the difficulty right for your level of badassery, the game can be challenging and fun in it's combat. the skills allow you to tackle problems a multitude of ways, as are expected, but the persuade skill becomes moot fairly quickly when you become a jedi and get access to the force persuade ability.In summation, if you're willing to fight through a few crashes and some crummy graphics, and you're a fan of Bioware RPGs, I recommend it.

												KotOR is probably my favorite game of all time, for quite a few reasons. I remember picking it up back in 2003 when I was 8, just because it had 'Star Wars' in the title. Ever since then, I have played this game through numerous times. The game regardless of how you play it, is just plain fun. The graphics are dated, yet they still look pretty decent. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding. The setting and locations in this game are stunning. From the urban cities of Taris, the deserts of Tatooine, to the oceans of Manaan, all of the locations are beautifully done. The characters you meet are diverse and likable. Most are pretty interesting, including npcs. There are plenty of opportunities to walk around and explore or talk to characters off of the beaten path. There are also mini games such as Pazaak and swoop races. The story is intriguing and has many turns. It also has a lot of replayability. There are different conversation choices, different endings, different classes, abilities, weapons, character party, and for the hardcore players no alien subtitles. There are plenty of customization options for the weapons you use, whether you want to be a calm and thoughtful Jedi using lightsabers and the force, or be the smooth talking smuggler using blasters and grenades, you are able to choose the way you want to play. In conclusion, this is probably my favorite game. It has decent graphics that have aged somewhat well. The locations, characters, and story are all well made and great. There are many options for customization and replayability. Also the game is just plain fun. I'd highly recommend it to any Star Wars, sci-fi, or rpg fan.			"

Getting chain stunned, two shot and crying in pure rage when an enemy spams medkits and drain life are all part of the experience. Pros: Everything but npcs that use medkits and drain lifeI always forget about a certain bounty hunter that likes medkits and trigger his appearance underprepared.Fifteen or so playthroughs give me the authority to rate this a Calo Nord/10.

												Still a great game after all these years, there's only a few real problems I can think of:* Controls are a bit fiddly sometimes. I've gotten stuck on invisible objects, and once somehow got trapped inside a door requiring me to reload a saved game.* The underwater section in Manaan is still horrible. Prepare to spend 5-10 minutes /slowly/ walking across the sea floor while wishing horrible things upon the developers. * The inventory system is a bit of a mess. Maybe it's because I loot everything I come across, but by the end of the game finding anything was a nightmare. Just way too much stuff and not many ways to sort it. Other than that this is still a great RPG 13+ years later. The voice acting is superb and the story is the most well written out of any Star Wars media I've come across. Recommended.			"

												Great game- loved it. Got it on Saturday and I've spent 24hrs on it already (Tuesday on day of writing).Story is great did not see the twist coming and made me really involved in the story.The choices you make actually change the story!! Already replaying it to do the light side ending...13 year old game graphics are a bit vintage a bit like GTA SA (play it if you haven't!!).I was pretty happy with the gameplay. But I think you can mod both of those things anyway as well as adding widescreen compatibility (which I did and I have no idea with how to mod things...). Find a youtube vid on it!Playing on Windows 10  with 2 GB RAM and 1.33 GHz, I know cute little system properties.Only got  crashes untill I added AllowwindowedMode=1 under the [Graphics Options] in the swotor config settings file (it opens up as a .txt file in the steamapps/common/swkotor bit.

												Pretty cool game. I didn't get to play this game around the time it came out so the graphics are a bit dated for me. But the rpg elements are nice, you get to customize your stats (like str, dex, int, etc.), skills (like opening doors, repairing droids, etc.), and feats (which are actions you can do in combat or passives that gives bonus). If you don't want to do all that customizing, you can just auto allocate them in the options. Some items, like armour, lightsabers, and other weapons, are customizable that will increase damage or add effects like a chance to stun your enemy.The story, which is probably why you're here, is pretty good. Side missions are good. You get to choose your conversations when interacting with npcs, some of them can make a difference in the story while others doesn't. Just a warning though, there is a lot of talking in this game and if you try to choose every possible conversation, some of the npcs will just repeat the same information that you got from other npcs.Overall, this ♥♥♥♥ is good. If you're an rpg fan and doesn't mind dated graphics and long conversations, this ♥♥♥♥♥ is for you. I give this game a thumbs up, as you can see up top.			"

												Where can I start with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, only that it really is the best game that Star Wars has and will ever see. There is still to this day a huge community of modders that work on ways to better the KotOR experience. Even here on steam you can post in the discussion pages asking for help with anything you need. There really isn't any downfalls to KotOR besides it coming without native widescreen support, but you can always just download FWS (Flawless Widescreen) to make your KotOR experience even better!

												In my humle opinion, one of the best RPG's and certainly one of the best Star Wars games ever to grace this world. I honestly can't find any flaws in this game (apart from the dated graphics, but that is of no concern). If you ever had a dream of being a brutal Sith, slashing your way through varied enemies, or being a noble Jedi, inspiring his followers and dealing out justice, then this is the game for you. There are a lot of  replayability in this game, and the sequel, and in almost every playthrough, you will discover something new (especially if you start toying around with mods), whether it be new dialogue, new items, another way to do a mission etc, and it is just so satisfying. All in all, if you are a fan of well-done RPG's or Star Wars, this is an absolute must.			"

												Still a great game after all these years, there's only a few real problems I can think of:* Controls are a bit fiddly sometimes. I've gotten stuck on invisible objects, and once somehow got trapped inside a door requiring me to reload a saved game.* The underwater section in Manaan is still horrible. Prepare to spend 5-10 minutes /slowly/ walking across the sea floor while wishing horrible things upon the developers. * The inventory system is a bit of a mess. Maybe it's because I loot everything I come across, but by the end of the game finding anything was a nightmare. Just way too much stuff and not many ways to sort it. Other than that this is still a great RPG 13+ years later. The voice acting is superb and the story is the most well written out of any Star Wars media I've come across. Recommended.			"

												the game has a weak gameplay in the beginning but at half the story its way better. The story is really great and has a good plot twist that supprised me. The only things i didn't like are: the auto save, there are never after a cut scene or after a long dialogue, i had to save each time by myself or i would have to watch it again in the case of a failure.Second one is the the resolution made my game minimize each time there was a cut scene. I love the jedi knight series way more but this one is good to. They focus more on the story telling and i loved there approche on the force. Most of the time the conversation choice i wanted was there, that's something i like, makes the immersion better.Not the best gameplay i have seen but it felt better served for my money than most AAA i have played.Took me 26h to complet the campain and I bought the game for 2.5$ at 75%.So YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAMEThe play time is worht your money, its more than 1$ the hour.

												Just finished this game for the 1st time after seeing that it was $2.99 on the Steam Holiday sale, & it's by far one of my top 5 RPG games of all time.Pros:I love how vast the Star Wars KOTOR universe is (especially for such an old game) & how the player can steer the game in any direction that they choose since there are so many ways the game can be played.Also, the character customization is great & the story is very solid & immersive. If you're a fan of Star Wars & love RPG-type games such as the Witcher series, then I highly recommend this game.Cons:In my opinion, the ending/s of the game was a little weak. It was very short, abrupt, & unsatisfying after playing through such a deep & immersive story to say the least.Also, once you finish the story, you can no longer free roam. Instead it takes you back to the main menu where your only options are to reload previous saves or start a new game. I wasn't a fan of this since I spent so much time upgrading my character & making him look cool just to find out that you literallty can't do anything with him after completing the story.Still an amazing game though! Highly recommend.			"

												I've been a fan of Star Wars for many years, and I've played many of the franchise's games. Some of them provide excellent action ('Republic Commando', 'Jedi Academy'), but none of them are memorable in the way that 'Knights of the Old Republic' is. In fact, the only Star Wars game which I think approaches it in terms of quality is its sequel. The premise of 'KOTOR' is fairly simple: You play a soldier whose mission it is to stop a powerful Sith Lord, and in order to do so you have to find several components of an ancient map. It may sound like a cliché RPG, but on your travels you'll encounter so many interesting people, fascinating stories and incredible quests, you'll never want it to end. I know I didn't.			"

Features you love games like Jade Empire, Mass Effect, KotOR 2 and Dragon Age or even Arcanum, The Elder Scrolls and newer Fallouts for were pretty much all introduced to me by KotOR. A great soundtrack, deep companion stories, good/evil choices that make a difference in the storyline, plentiful side-quests, plot-twists, they're all there. This game was certain to become a classic the moment it hit the shelves in the second half of 2003.Definitely among The Essentials.			"

You can choose between the light(good) or darkside(bad) by the decisions in the game,so that makes replay value off the charts(plus 2 endings). The control for the game is ok ,not to bad but I have to say I didn't like some of the elements for the combat but you can look over them when you start getting into it. The  music is your StarWars fare so nothing bad about it. So all in all I would give it a 8.5 out of 10			"

Best decision I made. 2 hours in I just got hooked on what happens next and by god this game has one of the greatest twist I will ever experience in this life. Great game, amazing story.

												KotOR is probably my favorite game of all time, for quite a few reasons. I remember picking it up back in 2003 when I was 8, just because it had 'Star Wars' in the title. Ever since then, I have played this game through numerous times. The game regardless of how you play it, is just plain fun. The graphics are dated, yet they still look pretty decent. The gameplay is challenging and rewarding. The setting and locations in this game are stunning. From the urban cities of Taris, the deserts of Tatooine, to the oceans of Manaan, all of the locations are beautifully done. The characters you meet are diverse and likable. Most are pretty interesting, including npcs. There are plenty of opportunities to walk around and explore or talk to characters off of the beaten path. There are also mini games such as Pazaak and swoop races. The story is intriguing and has many turns. It also has a lot of replayability. There are different conversation choices, different endings, different classes, abilities, weapons, character party, and for the hardcore players no alien subtitles. There are plenty of customization options for the weapons you use, whether you want to be a calm and thoughtful Jedi using lightsabers and the force, or be the smooth talking smuggler using blasters and grenades, you are able to choose the way you want to play. In conclusion, this is probably my favorite game. It has decent graphics that have aged somewhat well. The locations, characters, and story are all well made and great. There are many options for customization and replayability. Also the game is just plain fun. I'd highly recommend it to any Star Wars, sci-fi, or rpg fan.			"

												This game is amazing and super fun, I have put roughly 100 hours into it and keep coming back for more! This is easily the greatest game I have ever played! That being said it does have a lot of issues, like first off, at the end of the game when the magical vodoo pony Beonor VI takes over the galaxy for the Dark Guys (For those who don't know the Dark Guys are evil), why does he then do the tranquil flip of freedom on himself to become a Good One(Good ones are the good guys in this game). HE HAD THE WHOLE GALAXY AT HIS BECK AND PONY CALL! IT DOESN't MAKE SENSE! Also this game is annoying because it takes like 60 hours to get your first glow stick and even then it's like ""This is basically just a cool looking sword!"" If I wanted a cool looking sword I would've just played Call of Duty! Another issue that I ran into is that when I listen to Michelle Jackson's Thriller on the background when playing it in the underground part I get the real real heebies. The main chick Bastilla is pretty cute though so it's all good.... but not really because I still had major problems with this pile of absolute ♥♥♥♥! 10/10			"

												Seriously let me just be completely honest here. This game is amazing, but Can be a pain at times. The game itself is absolutely amazing and it has a wonderful story that any starwars fan should be enthralled by. HOWEVER! The fact remains that this game is extremely dated and it has a lot of problems when it comes to computers. It can be as I would put it ""whiny"" and crashes a lot for some people. The game is so outdated that it literally thinks some pc parts are older than itself or it cannot recognize them. I know many work around for this issue and they are on the forums, but it is still a pain. Beyond that, the graphics and some of the sounds are pretty iffy, but since it is 10 years old you should expect that. I would still recommend buying this game even if you wait for the steam summer/winter sales where it is 5-10 bucks. (US) It is seriously worth it even after all of the problems behind it. (Be aware that the second is even worse off with those issues for some people.)			"

 ONE OF THE BEST RPGS OF ALL TIME	In short, KOTOR is a legend. A game that you should buy just to witness the story. It has a well deserved place in my TOP10 best games of all time list. Search for TOP10 RPGs of all times and you will see KOTOR there in any list that is worth mentioning.Like all Bioware games, this game  heavily relies on the story. You wake up in a ship that is under attack and from that on try to save your own skin. On the way you meet good friends on different planets who have rich background stories on their own. 3 of the characters in this game found a place in the Most Popular Star Wars Characters of all time list by Lucas Arts Fans. Especially you will have incredible moments with HK-47. There are usually many ways to complete guests and depending on your actions the future of people and even nations change in the end.WARNING. Dont read any spoilers about this game before your first playthrough. There is a moment in the game that is selected The Most JAW BREAKING MOMENT of all time. It is such a moment that made me stop playing the game because of the shock and made me think how that is possible for a week.Fighting is amazing. There are 3 classes which effect your play stile a lot. Soldier is the typical fighter class while others are a little different. You are a jedi but you are allowed to focus on guns with high dexterity. You can queue 3 actions for each character while fighting for an easier management. I remember the easy difficulty was too easy so avoid that unless you are only into the story.I still love the graphics and the soundtrack is a piece of art. Character voices are very well done. I am still inlove with Jennifer Hale as the voice of Bastila Shan and it still makes me smile remember HK-47 saying MEATBAGs.In conclusion if you are a RPG fun, its highly likely that you already bought the game. If not, then this is the game that willl make you a RPG and Bioware fan.  Graphics 88   Music/sounds 95   Gameplay 90   Story 100   Replayability 90   OVERALL 98  "

												A classic RPG in every sense of the word, KOTOR remains a seminal point in gaming history. With a unique vibe that can only come from the Star Wars universe, the story and gameplay of KOTOR hold up surprisingly well even today. It isn't the prettiest game at the ball -- and it's not without its missteps -- but I'd recommend RPG fans of any caliber to relive this slice of history if for nothing other than the geek cred and good times that can only be had with a lightsaber (or two) by your side.

												the game has a weak gameplay in the beginning but at half the story its way better. The story is really great and has a good plot twist that supprised me. The only things i didn't like are: the auto save, there are never after a cut scene or after a long dialogue, i had to save each time by myself or i would have to watch it again in the case of a failure.Second one is the the resolution made my game minimize each time there was a cut scene. I love the jedi knight series way more but this one is good to. They focus more on the story telling and i loved there approche on the force. Most of the time the conversation choice i wanted was there, that's something i like, makes the immersion better.Not the best gameplay i have seen but it felt better served for my money than most AAA i have played.Took me 26h to complet the campain and I bought the game for 2.5$ at 75%.So YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAMEThe play time is worht your money, its more than 1$ the hour.

												There are two things I like most in the Star Wars universe - the sound of a lightsaber and the sound of an imperial interceptor in space! Even in KOTOR doesn't have the latter, if still manages to keep up with the first condition, and the use of the Star Wars universe while simply expanding it and not getting into the thin constraints of the movie makes it so much more interesting and welcome to changes. And all of these changes are only for the better. It is a worthy RPG with a lot of replay value, but I would wait for a discount because KOTOR 2 was updated recently. I'm not sure if KOTOR 1 has widescreen support, some modding might be necesarry.			"

												It's a solid dungeons and dragons game masquerading as star wars. The base system for this game is quite obviously D20 from character creation to combat.I'll cut straight to my main gripe which admittedly comes from my expectations compared to reality. Not only do blasters have nowhere near the impact they had in the movies (and they retain their clumsy and random nature) but also everyone has swords. At first this is confusing, but when you replace blaster with bow in your mind it starts to make sense. That's because weapon statlines are straight out of D20 analogues. Mechanically this is fine because it creates some balance between melee and ranged, but thematically it just ruins the experience when you just want to blast some thugs and move along.That is not to say that the star wars paintjob is bad: the story and characters are great! I just was dissapointed with how the game played. I recommend it if you're desperate for a star wars RPG and can put up with the combat. I've enjoyed it, but only despite the gameplay rather than for it.			"

												Honestly the only reason you should get this on PC over the Xbox version is for the consistent framerate.  It just feels better with a controller and unfortunately the PC version doesn't natively support controllers nor will binding keyboard keys to a custom controller set up alleviate that issue.  This is a great game, It has interesting characters, good progression, a decent amount of non-linear play, and fulfilling side missions, With all that said it's just not as great as I wish it was on the PC version.  I've heard from many that they can't stand the PC version, but I got used to it.  I even managed to play this game on my laptop while in bed using my touchpad because I'm filled with sin.			"

Your companions include Kaiden and Commander Shepard in a rare crossover, a spunky teenager who isn't legal so you can't romance her even though this is a Bioware game and I fully expect everything to be romanceable; even the toaster, a Wookiee who's like Chewbacca but with suspenders instead of an awesome bandolier, a really really ugly catgirl, a wise old black dude, this old dude with a minigun, a robot that's like R2D2, and a robot that's like C3P0 except not British and gay.

Quite literally now when I play an RPG I hold it up to the standards of this game, which isn't usually a good idea because this game isn't easy to beat. I still enjoy playing through it again and again, it just doesn't get old. The story is so filling, it's hard not to get drawn into it. I know some RPG's you have to focus or constantly try to put yourself in the protaganist's shoes, but Knights of the Old Republic does it for you. It opens the door for you, grabs your coat, sits you down on one of the best chairs on earth, hands you a beverage created by George Lucas from up in the cantina in the sky, and tells the best story you've ever heard. Quite literally, if you haven't played this game yet, you're the equivilant of a bantha fodder. Don't know what is? Even more of a reason to play this game. What are you waiting for? Just buy it.

The Republic is under attack from fallen war heroes.  You play a soldier of dubious background, whose role in the plot is far greater than first implied.

												Just finished this game for the 1st time after seeing that it was $2.99 on the Steam Holiday sale, & it's by far one of my top 5 RPG games of all time.Pros:I love how vast the Star Wars KOTOR universe is (especially for such an old game) & how the player can steer the game in any direction that they choose since there are so many ways the game can be played.Also, the character customization is great & the story is very solid & immersive. If you're a fan of Star Wars & love RPG-type games such as the Witcher series, then I highly recommend this game.Cons:In my opinion, the ending/s of the game was a little weak. It was very short, abrupt, & unsatisfying after playing through such a deep & immersive story to say the least.Also, once you finish the story, you can no longer free roam. Instead it takes you back to the main menu where your only options are to reload previous saves or start a new game. I wasn't a fan of this since I spent so much time upgrading my character & making him look cool just to find out that you literallty can't do anything with him after completing the story.Still an amazing game though!

												Good story hampered by clumsy mechanics is the simplest way to sum up KOTOR. Having played this again recently I was struck by how terrible the D20 style ruleset is for a Star Wars game. The force is a mysterious energy field, supposedly binding and connecting all living beings. Except sith troopers apparently, who will resist force push at DC 14 unless your wisdom is over 20. Reducing the force powers to simply ""wizard spells"" is greatly at odds with the narrative of Star Wars and the game suffers for it. This game is the standard Bioware plot (tm). You have a rag-tag band of heroes and villains, you have 4 totally different places to visit each containing a quarter of the plot device and you can be good, evil or slightly sarcastic. Despite the copy paste plot and characters Bioware somehow crammed a lot of Star Wars moments into this game, it also amazingly has a plot twist to rival ESB which was superbly executed. Another hugely annoying aspect is having 9 allies and yet you can only ever adventure with two, leaving most of the team hanging out on the ship. For all its flaws this is still a game worth playing, especially as it sets up the masterpiece that is the sequel.			"

												A game coming from the good days of Bioware, with a deep setting, and a shapeshifting plot. The story is riddled with plot twists, and the game is using a form of D&D in combat, so the D20 still reigns supreme. The visuals fare just fine, and the music is well-placed in the various locations of the game. Sure, there are a few occasional bugs, and some can be quite annoying, which, when combined with the game's above-average combat difficulty, can cause some headaches. But the drawbacks are largely overshadowed by the well-done aspects of the game. If you're a fan of the Star Wars universe or not is unimportant, since an excellent RPG is the same, no matter the setting. Buy it and do the old Bioware justice.			"

												Set thousands of years before Luke Skywalker leaves Tatooine, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic sets you into a galaxy that is familiar, yet new and exciting at the same time. KOTOR is truly one of the best, if not the best, titles BioWare has put out. In fact, it is one of the best RPGs  on the market, and, needless to say, this a game that EVERY self respecting Star Wars fan needs to play. The characters are compelling, and the storyline is one of the best game storylines I have ever played. Even after all the years it has been out, the game still holds up as fun and enjoyable, and still gets multiple playthroughs from me. I cannot speak highly enough about this game. For anybody who wants a gripping and epic Star Wars storyline, this game should be at the top of your list to play.			"

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. When this game released many moons ago I was a young teenager. I have never played an RPG before and even worse: I did not know this game was an RPG. Unaware of my ignorance I placed the game into the the disc tray of my Xbox and never looked back. Since the release of the game I have over 1000 hours of play time between the Xbox and PC version. But what makes this game so good?Firstly is the the story. From the first second you feel a level of immersion that I find hard to get with other games. What makes the story even more enjoyable is that each playthrough you can do things differently and experience something new.Character customization has almost everything I could want in a game. While there are restrictions with physical appearance in character creation everything else seems to disregard it. The leveling system is beautiful with enough options that ensure every character you create will be different if you try. I find myself being immersed with the Equip screen as well, sometimes going through my equipment just to see what I will look in various armors/robes.The gameplay itself is satisfying. Using a real time turn based combat system, you rarely feel things are moving slow. While in combat you have the ability to pause the game, if you wish, and issue up four commands for your companions to perform. Experimenting with this can be fun to see what type of damage you can do and how quickly you can kill harder opponents.Overall, I would highly recommend this game for any Star Wars or RPG fan. Knights of the Old Republic is a milestone in gaming and everyone should try to experience what it hast to offer.			"

												I am now 26 years old, twice as much as I was when I first played this game. I was already impressed with Bioware's Neverwinter Nights at the time, but the hundreds of hours I spent on KotOR really set the bar for all future RPGs for me. Features you love games like Jade Empire, Mass Effect, KotOR 2 and Dragon Age or even Arcanum, The Elder Scrolls and newer Fallouts for were pretty much all introduced to me by KotOR. A great soundtrack, deep companion stories, good/evil choices that make a difference in the storyline, plentiful side-quests, plot-twists, they're all there. This game was certain to become a classic the moment it hit the shelves in the second half of 2003.Definitely among The Essentials.			"

												KOTOR. Motha♥♥♥♥ING KOTOR. This game my middle school life bearable, even if I didn't make it off of Taris half the time.First, the negatives. This game will crash. A lot. It was originally for XBOX classic, so compatibility issues run amok on this game. Not so much for the sequal for some reason. Next, your teammate AI is equivalent to a 5-year-old when it comes to enemies, especially if they just come out of combat. If there's a herd of kathak hounds 20 yards out and they're about to die, they're gonna jog the distance and let off a few rounds before it occurs to them they might bleed to death before they pull a trigger any more. The graphics are kinda cruddy, but again, it was made for XBOX classic, so notm uch you can do to help that. As for positives, the lore is a nice bit of fun to sink your teeth in to if you're into that (I know I am), and if you set the difficulty right for your level of badassery, the game can be challenging and fun in it's combat. the skills allow you to tackle problems a multitude of ways, as are expected, but the persuade skill becomes moot fairly quickly when you become a jedi and get access to the force persuade ability.In summation, if you're willing to fight through a few crashes and some crummy graphics, and you're a fan of Bioware RPGs, I recommend it.

												Just finished this game for the 1st time after seeing that it was $2.99 on the Steam Holiday sale, & it's by far one of my top 5 RPG games of all time.Pros:I love how vast the Star Wars KOTOR universe is (especially for such an old game) & how the player can steer the game in any direction that they choose since there are so many ways the game can be played.Also, the character customization is great & the story is very solid & immersive. If you're a fan of Star Wars & love RPG-type games such as the Witcher series, then I highly recommend this game.Cons:In my opinion, the ending/s of the game was a little weak. It was very short, abrupt, & unsatisfying after playing through such a deep & immersive story to say the least.Also, once you finish the story, you can no longer free roam. Instead it takes you back to the main menu where your only options are to reload previous saves or start a new game. I wasn't a fan of this since I spent so much time upgrading my character & making him look cool just to find out that you literallty can't do anything with him after completing the story.Still an amazing game though!

Also (with the exception of the final boss) this game gives the most options I've ever seen to the ""Scoundrel"" class. Talking your way out of things and finding alternatives to force and combat will be almost constant as the scoundrel, provided you've focused your progression correctly.This will seem very similar to old school ""Neverwinter Nights"" but with significantly improved presentation and balance.Some compatibility issues may arise, most appear to be fixable, this game is simply VERY old so it's to be expected.

Quite literally now when I play an RPG I hold it up to the standards of this game, which isn't usually a good idea because this game isn't easy to beat. I still enjoy playing through it again and again, it just doesn't get old. The story is so filling, it's hard not to get drawn into it. I know some RPG's you have to focus or constantly try to put yourself in the protaganist's shoes, but Knights of the Old Republic does it for you. It opens the door for you, grabs your coat, sits you down on one of the best chairs on earth, hands you a beverage created by George Lucas from up in the cantina in the sky, and tells the best story you've ever heard. Quite literally, if you haven't played this game yet, you're the equivilant of a bantha fodder. Don't know what is? Even more of a reason to play this game. What are you waiting for? Just buy it.

												The favorite of all time Star Wars RPGs. The game has an awesome story and it narrates based on your choices. This was what Bioware was all about back when they created the game. The game is linear however the story itself that unfolded was just amazing. Highly recommended to people that are looking for a good story game if they dont mind the graphics since they are dated a bit.			"

												An absolutely tried and true component of the foundation of the RPG genre, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a game that can only be described as an essential experience. As a fanatic of the Star Wars universe from a very early age, KOTOR was a journey that only confirmed my love for the expansive lore and excitement associated with the franchise. If you're perusing reviews on KOTOR wondering whether or not you truly wish to buy this game, please allow mine to be an opinion that sways you towards this purchase.			"

												KotOR is a traditional RPG that was released in 2003. I played it for the first time in 2011 and found the graphics and gameplay to be very playable. The battle fighting mechanics might seem a little odd (find some gameplay footage on youtube), but you get used to it very quickly and it starts to feel natural. I found the voice acting to be good, and the story to be very engaging. The game has a solid length (took me around 45 hours to do the main story + all side quests), and some decent replay value as you can play as a light or dark jedi, and choose a character class of soldier, rogue or scout.

												By far my favorite RPG of all time. Quite literally now when I play an RPG I hold it up to the standards of this game, which isn't usually a good idea because this game isn't easy to beat. I still enjoy playing through it again and again, it just doesn't get old. The story is so filling, it's hard not to get drawn into it. I know some RPG's you have to focus or constantly try to put yourself in the protaganist's shoes, but Knights of the Old Republic does it for you. It opens the door for you, grabs your coat, sits you down on one of the best chairs on earth, hands you a beverage created by George Lucas from up in the cantina in the sky, and tells the best story you've ever heard. Quite literally, if you haven't played this game yet, you're the equivilant of a bantha fodder. Don't know what is? Even more of a reason to play this game. What are you waiting for? Just buy it. You won't regret it.			"

												What can i say? This game is absolutely amazing from start to finish.The plot is very strong with some suprising twists which makes it interesting as well.The characters that follow you have their own background, and your companions may trigger an argument making it feel more alive!The combat is turn-based and easy to understand, with the ability to pause in the middle of the battle, giving you time to set up a strategy.Throughout the game, your actions will change who you are alligned with, whether its the dark side or the light, each having their own unique powers giving it some replayability.There are many side quests for you to complete ranging from interrogating to finding missing holocrons, adding a bit of variety.The only downsides that i give to this game are: the autosave sucks a lot, so make sure you save often to avoid any stress.The AI sometimes messes up, whether they block your way, they get stuck and rarely stop attacking and bugs out for a second or two.Overall i give this game a 9.5/10 because it is one of the best star wars games of all time. It has a lot of content for you to explore and learn the universe of star wars, i believe if you can bypass these cons, this game is a perfect 10/10 without a doubt.  "

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old republic is a huge series of tropes aimed at Star Wars nerds. You can equip a gun but can't even aim it, and the dialogue is frankly awful. The plot twist (You are Malak), was predictable for anyone with even two brain cells, unlike MW2's. For some reason however this game reviews amazingly high reviews from acne-ridden nerds that beat off to the female sidekick (Who has the dumbest name in videogame history: Bastiltda).As a predecessor to Mass Effect, I don't understand why this game is so bad.5/10			"

If you ever had a dream of being a brutal Sith, slashing your way through varied enemies, or being a noble Jedi, inspiring his followers and dealing out justice, then this is the game for you. There are a lot of  replayability in this game, and the sequel, and in almost every playthrough, you will discover something new (especially if you start toying around with mods), whether it be new dialogue, new items, another way to do a mission etc, and it is just so satisfying.
