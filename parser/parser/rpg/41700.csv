 Gameplay Stalker CoP is an open-world RPG survival shooter with 3 large areas Zaton, Yanov and Pripyat, very atmospheric with plenty of side quests that reward exploration.The beginning of the game is tricky with hardly any equipment or money, there's no tutorials or any kind of help so you need to find your own way to survive, isn't an easy gameThe A-life will not give up until you ran out of ammo or eventually die, some will trow objects at you     Screenshot  and even telekinetically steal your weapon, things appear randomly in the sky or mutants with camouflage   Screenshot   etc. Human opponents put up a tough fight, they kinda cheat in fog weather or at night even without nightvision scopes equipped, (but mods like Misery fixes that) so playind like CoD will get you killed.Still includes the emissions and anomalies (detectors needed for finding artifacts  Screenshot  ) and more customization of armor/weapons. Graphics it features the X-Ray 1.6 engine supports dx11 elements like real time tessellation, shadows, wet surfaces, volumetric smoke and others like SSAO DOF... so in other words it looks good, models and textures are a little outdated but shadows and sun rays are amazing (i recommend to use mods like AtmosFear3 specially designed for sky textures and weather behavior ). Screenshot  Sound The background noise of the zone is enchanting. In the distance, the reactor is booming as before, animals roaring in the west, shootout in the East, everything draws exactly the image of the restricted area as you are used to it. Multiplayer has Deathmatch and CTF style competitive matches with its multiplayer mode. Mind you, this doesn't exactly represent the highlight of the experience. If you want to get the best out of this game, stick with the main campaign, for what it's worth.  Story Call of Pripyat - takes place shortly after the events in Shadow of Chernobyl. Having discovered the open path to the center of The Zone, the government decides to take control of it via ""Operation Fairway"", in which they plan to thoroughly investigate the territory before dispatching the main military force.Despite these preparations, the military operation fails, with all five helicopters crashing. In order to determine the cause of the crashes, the Ukraine Security Service sends an ex STALKER agent, Major Degtyarev, into The ZoneAfter discovering that the crashes were caused by strong electrical currents, Degtyarev makes his way to an evacuation point located in Pripyat. Along the way, depending on the choices the player makes, he may meet a number of different characters that can become his allies. Eventually, after arriving in Pripyat, Degtyarev's party finds themselves surrounded by the military survivors, who take them to their base. Once there, they work together with the military commander of the helicopter group in surviving and escaping The Zone. They are met by Strelok, the protagonist of the first game, who offers his full cooperation including the reasons why the operation failed in the first place.Degtyarev then helps to re-establish contact with headquarters and, together with Strelok, organize a desperate evacuation out of The Zone. There are multiple different endings available depending on the player's success, whether or not some of the characters survive the evacuation and how the lives of other stalkers Degtyarev met throughout the game turn out. In the ideal scenario, Degtyarev becomes head of the Security Service in The Zone, and Strelok gives all the materials he found in The Zone to the government, prompting the creation of the ""Scientific Institute for the Research of the Chernobyl Anomalous Area"", with Strelok taking up the position of chief scientific consultant. Bugs/Glitches It has soooo many and it will crash or make one or two missions almost unplayable. i recomend to mod the game (some will make it worse lol). MODs MISERY: (for hardcore difficulty) its full concept modification that touches every game aspect including textures, sfx, music, weapons, AI, items, weather, economy and 3 playable USS characters classes to choose from: Assaulter, Recon and Sniper.Each comes with unique attributes like endurance, speed, health, stamina, weapon specializations, starting gear...AtmosFear: like i said before it tweaks and expands the vanilla weather system to be more realistic and various.Call of Pripyat Reloaded: it's like misery but for better and easier gameplay.http://www.moddb.com/games/stalker-call-of-pripyat/mods?sort=rating-descOverall 8.5/10It's easily in my top 5 Exploring the hazardous lands and scavenging through abandoned buildings with aggressive wildlife never gets old.This is a true PC game ( not ported, bad optimized or locked at 30fps and weird controls. not that junk we see today)If you liked the others stalkers this is a must or this type of game i recommend Metro series.sorry about errors/bad spelling, english isn't my main language			"

												I really hated this game.I bought it, downloaded it, launched it, and found myself plunged instantaneously into the Zone. I was alone. There was no tutorial, no introductory cutscene, no explanation, not even a basic explanation of how the game worked. I walked forward, and looked around. I was instantly shocked at the low FOV and uncomfortably ""floaty"" mouse control. This was not what I was used to - my most played FPS is Team Fortress 2, closely followed by Fallout 3. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was something else - something new. I was excited. I continued walking and came across three people with guns walking in the other direction. ""STOP WAVING THAT THING ABOUT"" one of them bellowed, while sticking his assault rifle up my nose. I pressed ""e"" (because by now I'd explored the options menu and rebound some keys) to speak to him. What was going on? That was a question that I'd ask myself a lot while playing this game. This guy told me absolutely nothing of interest, except that there was a base of some description a little further down the hill. By now I'd figured out what some of the HUD was for, and how to open my inventory. I then went to Skadovsk (although I didn't know what it was called then) and got yelled at to put my gun away again. So I opened my inventory and moved my rifle from its slot into my backpack. I would be doing this for a while until I discovered that I could just press ""3"" to holster my weapon. I then walked into the ship.I didn't know what the hell I was doing. Where was I? What am I doing here? What do I do now? So I spoke to someone who told me there was a strange glow in the distance that he wanted me to check out. Fair enough, I thought. So I went where the map pointed me and found a ship. I walked onto the ship - and died instantly for (seemingly) no reason. (In actual fact I'd hit an anomaly, I just had no idea what anomalies were or what I was doing.)  Having not saved at any point, I started the game again. When I got to Skadovsk for the second time, I couldn't find the guy I'd previously talked to, so I talked to Sultan instead. He wanted me to help kill some people. Once again, I thought ""fair enough"" and went with him. At midnight I boarded a boat and once again struggled to see what the ♥♥♥♥ was happening in the darkness. I think I killed someone. And I got some money. So then, being a Fallout veteran and this being an open world game, I decided to go exploring. I went about 100 metres and the game crashed. One thought ran through my mind: ""♥♥♥♥ this"". I quit the game and didn't come back for at least a month. I ♥♥♥♥ing hated this game. What I piece of ♥♥♥♥, I thought. I couldn't understand the 95% positive review score. This was after about 1 hour's play time. Eventually I was bored and I decided to boot the game again. After switching my lighting renderer from DX10 to DX11 (as the internet told me to) the game didn't crash (although it does crash a lot when trying to enter the ""load game"" screen). I then tried again. I got to Skadovsk. I talked to Sultan. I did the mission. I learned how to quicksave. From there, I continued (on the easiest difficulty because I'm a casual scrublord).I then discovered why this game has so many positive reviews. Although the graphics are somewhat dated, the gameplay and atmosphere are second to none. I warmed to the game within another hour. Did some side missions, figured out where I was and what I was doing. I learned what anomalies are. I learned how to collect artifacts. And, ultimately, I learned that Google is my best friend. From this I can see that at least 90% of the negative reviews are either performance issues (there is admittedly a good deal of stuttering in this game) or they are people who, like me, just haven't given the game a chance. I see people in the negative reviews saying how awful the game is with 1.6 hours on record. And I know why. This game tells you absolutely nothing. You know a sum total of jack ♥♥♥♥. Why am I dying instantly for no reason? ""♥♥♥♥ you, figure it out!"" Why do my bullets not work? ""♥♥♥♥ you, git gud."" What do these numbers and icons mean? ""♥♥♥♥ you, use google!"" This is a good thing when you've got into the game because it enhances the atmosphere and is more immersive. The downside is it scares away new players who are frustrated by how bad they are at the game. To people who are looking at buying this game: I say buy it and don't give up on it in the first hour. Google things you don't know and teach yourself about the game - this is hardcore FPS survival horror and it does not hold your hand. In actual fact, it amputates your hand, kicks you into the ground and spits on your face. And that's without the Misery mod! If you are strong enough to get past that, it is one of the most atmospheric and immersive games I've ever played. The gunplay is amazing, it feels realistic, and you truly feel like this could be happening and you could be there experiencing it. If you like FPS survival horror, look no further than the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.I love this game.N.B. After going into Pripyat, I went to the Kindergarten to do that mission where you destroy the interference transmitter. It was 1 A.M. and I had my flashlight on as I entered the psy-field. Blew up the door, went inside and the first thing I saw illuminated by my flashlight was the creepiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lion I've ever seen. It scared the absolute living ♥♥♥♥ out of me - more than any horror game has ever done. АНУ ЧИКЙ БРИКЙ В ДАМКЕ "

												Call of Pripyat with the Misery 2.1 mod  is the ultimate S.T.A.L.K.E.R. survival experience and possibly the most challenging and immersive singleplayer FPS/RPG adventure out there. It's PC gaming at its finest: No holding hands, no dumbed down inventories, no immersion breaking achievements, tons of loot to collect and an unforgiving difficulty level without being unfair.   It doesn't get much better than this!			"

												This game is a good shooter combined with nice RPG in open-world, many quests, dark climate and high difficulty level. What do you need more? Maybe lot of guns with possibility to modify them? That's also included.This game is different than a STALKER book, but Strugatsky brothers may be proud of that.VERDICT:If you're a fan of good, difficult shooters, you have to play it.If you're a fan of Metro climate games, you have to play it.Why are you still reading this? You should have started playing this.Like this review?

												I spotted the derelict ship, known by the local STALKER's  as Skadovsk, in the distance. A wave of hope passed over me. The Zone was cruel, unforgiving, and merciless. With the sky growing darker every second, the tension and anxiety building up, I made the final sprint to the Skadovsk. It was difficult to see at this point, with only the silhouettes of dead trees and abandoned machinery to guide my way. My flashlight had ran out of battery, along with my PDA. Navigation was close to impossible. I could feel the Zone closing in, with the sounds of the unnatural creatures this unholy place has birthed echoing in the darkness. I may have a weapon - however, it was badly damaged, and my single magazine of ammunition wouldn't do me much good, as my gun was unreliable and often jammed or malfunctioned. No prayer could change the fact that I was a walking meal for these creatures. Creatures, whose shimmering eyes you could see in the distance with no visible body, speeding across your vision. Whatever unnatural cloaking the Zone has given them, they could attack from any direction. I wasn't going to let them get that chance. The Skadvosk was near, now. I'm getting exhausted. I'm hungry. I'm thirsty. I had used my last bandage after getting shot by a bandit, if I wanted to survive, I had to get inside. Just as I approached the gaping hole in the hull of the ship, those piercing yellow eyes appeared in a cluster of dead grass. The eyes that followed me, watching me, waiting for me to slip up before it attacks. It was all I could see, the rest of the world was encompassed in a miserable darkness that could strike fear into a fearless man. Just as I had stepped inside the broken hull, sprinting with my last burst of stamina to the sealed door, ear-piercing shots were heard above me, along with the heart warming Russian insults being directed at the creature that was just hunting me. Stepping in the ship, closing the door behind me, I quickly unloaded my haul to Beard, the bartender and trader. The weight lifted from my shoulders, I purchased some Bread and Vodka with my newly acquired Rubles, and sat around the table, listening to my fellow STALKER's tell the tales of their own Misery.

												This game makes you want to buy a ticket to Ukraine and tour Pripyat.  It takes the core concepts of the original game and pushes them in a direction that allows you to have a little more fun while exploring the brutal representation of a real-life scarred patch of earth.The first game had a lot of elements of wanting to go somewhere, but the high radiation levels or heavy enemy resistance prevented it.  CoP opens up the world around you a little more and gives you some more room to do your own thing.There are little touches that help crank up the entertainment level as well.  One of my favorites is the randomly occuring ""blowouts"" that will almost always (without the appropriate inventory items) kill you if you can't find cover in time.  Some of the greatest moments in this game exist when in the middle of a vicious firefight, or at the final moments of a task that has you hurt and running low on supplies, and then a blowout starts rolling in.Get ready to feel like a badass.  Get ready to have moments where you're running for your life.  Get ready to drain hours of your life exploring the wastes.  Pripyat is calling.			"

												Zaton, Misery.Walking. Watching the sun slowly rise, it could've been a scene from a thousand years ago- with no cars, no lights, no noise but the animals and wind through the trees.Human interference seemed so minute, I barely noticed the subtle gunfire in the background, the cracked and blistered road I walked across.Then suddenly-CRACK.Something small and fast whizzes past my head like a bee.No time to check.I hold shift and book it.There's a van nearby. Maybe two metres, maybe four.I make a line straight for it.CRACK.I hear the bullet thump into the road. A plume of dust floats past the van i'm hiding behind.I pull my gun out from it's holster.It's a 357 magnum revolver. Condition is terrible, and rust visibly coats the gun like fungus on a tree.Three shots. Better make them count.Pull the hammer back, ready to fire.I hold it steady, creeping my way to the edge of the van.I peak out the side. Slowly. Carefully. Don't make it obvious.Binoculars out.In front of me is a hill. Tall and green, with a thick layer of grass and foliage covering the top like mould.Something flashes in my eyes. Movement. I track it like a sniper.The grass is moving, alive like some unknown mutated creature of the zone.I look closer.Whoever it is, his outift blends in well with the greenery. He evidently hasn't noticed me yet, and he's moving down the hill no doubt for a better view.On his back is a long gun. Maybe a rifle, maybe a shotgun. It's metallic sheen stands out like a sore thumb amongst the natural hues surrounding it.I check my gun again. Yeah. Definitely just three shots.I wait.He reaches the edge of the hill. Cautious. Careful.Starts running.Not close enough yet.As soon as he goes past the van, that's when I'll start moving.From over his shoulder he reveals his gun to be a shotgun. The long barrelled 'over-under' type.It'd be deadly if I give him the chance to use it.His aproach is swift, not wanting to be caught out in the open road, completely disregarding the van I could be hiding behind.Now.I slowly creep to the back of the van.Small, miniscule steps mark my way as I go, gun aimed with an intense trigger finger.It finally centres over his head.I stand up.Calmly walk out into the road. Gun still trained on his head.I wait until he notices something. The subtle echo of footsteps, or just good situational awareness, he eventually hazards a look behind him.""ANNU CHEEKI BREEKI IVV DAMKE,"" I scream in real life, as I hit mouse1.The gun jerks back as a plume of smoke appears at the front end of the barrel, and my vision goes hazy at the edges for a moment.Then it happens again. Then again. What? What the hell is happening? The same sounds, the same bullet sound, over and over again until - ""X-ray engine has stopped working. Windows is trying to find a solution to the problem,""10/10 Would have the game crash on me again.			"

A Paladin's Review: S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat. A Polished Yet Stark Post Apocalyptic World.Genre: FPS RPG Post-Apocalyptic Horror Open World.Developed and Published by: GSC Game WorldPlatform: Windows Only. Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsIf Shadow of Chernobyl was the wild west of the STALKER universe, Call of Pripyat is the ""civilized"" entry into the series. My immediate impression of the game is that it's much more polished, with refined mechanics and a much more stable world to explore. Its clear that the developers didn't want another buggy Shadow of Chernobyl again. However, there were trade-offs with this approach. Unlike the creepy and danger-around-every-corner feeling that SoC gives you, CoP comes off as a more stark and alien. As if this wasn't Earth anymore. The ""living world"" that was present in SoC is much more subdued and scaled back in CoP and some mechanics were removed to my disappointment. Despite my disappointments, they didn't overshadow the sheer fun surviving in the Zone. After all, what could possibly be more enjoyable than listening to glorious Russian accents, finding strange anomalies and surviving the mutants of the Exclusion Zone. Combat ThoughtsThe game is more complete, better balanced and more variety of weapons no doubt thanks to its focused development cycle. You can also modify your suits and weapons this time around was also a nice change, allowing for a much more RPG-like experience. My favorite gun had to be the railgun you picked up in the later part of the game, the sound from firing it was just too cool. Overall, weapons feel very well balanced and have their own pros, cons and punch to each weapon. Ammo is still pretty limited but there are more merchants to buy from so it's not terribly difficult to keep a good supply on hand. Everything is suitably deadly, requiring you to keep on your toes the entire time. Exploration ThoughtsExploration in this game is better and more rewarding. There are plenty of interesting areas to look around, people to meet and creepy as heck underground structures to freak out in. I noticed more of the exploration took place out in the zone more than in underground facilities unlike SoC which had several notable X Labs to explore. That being said, there's still a creepy lab or two to get creeped out in. Atmosphere and the WorldIf there is something to be disappointed about, its the reduction of mechanics from the previous entry. Gone is how epic the A-Life engine felt when creatures roamed the lands and danger was around every possible corner. That sense of risk evaporated. In SoC, you could come across battles going on or the aftermath. Also gone are the risks to the NPCs, the zone changing around you on a regular basis with every emission. Any important quest giver won't be killed this time around which I felt was a damn shame. Gone is that sense of continual change that SoC had. In SoC, factions fought each other over land and constant conflicts. When certain events, those factions took advantage of the craze to get into all-out warfare. The Zone feels static now, not as unpredictable as it used to be. It stays put for the majority of the main story. Instead, it goes for more mechanical purity and straightforward experience. I can't blame them for going that route and I'm certainly not going to complain about it being a lot less buggy than CoP. However, I do wish they had taken the A-Life engine to a whole new level rather than step back. PC Settings & ModdingCoP is largely clean of bugs in its vanilla state so modding isn't as required as it was in SoC though there is some. The expected PC settings are mostly here though you have to do some modding to open up Field of View options, V-sync and borderless windowed mode. You can find more about that on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. In game you have a selection of resolution options, quality options, full screen on/off and sliders for gamma, contrast and brightness. Advanced options include vision distance, object detail, texture detail, anisotropic filtering, antialiasing, grass detail density, lighting distance, and shadow quality sliders. In fact, there's almost nothing you can't tweak and change in the advanced graphics options. Everything from SSAO modes to volumetric light to NPC flashlights, there's a crazy amount of choices to optimize your experience. CoP is the best optimized game of the lot too so your computer shouldn't have too much trouble running it. There's only two audio sliders this time around for SFX and music which is a bit limited. Key rebinding and secondary keys are also supported. Final ThoughtsThe S.T.A.L.K.E.R. remains one of the most memorable series I've had the chance to play. The journey has been exciting, terrifying and challenging all at the same time. Call of Pripyat is the least buggy and better overall game of the series. But, I feel it loses that sense of risk that Shadow of Chernobyl took, instead going for a more standard open world experience. It's still incredibly compelling compared to most open worlds though. I still want to return to the Zone again and tackle it again. Which is pretty rare for me to want to do with most open world games. What can I say, it's a unique series. Its tragic that the development studio closed its doors. While GSC has been rumored to return, I'm doubtful that we will see another STALKER game again. I definitely recommend this game if you're into the FPS, RPG and post-Apocalyptic type titles such as these. Despite all of its flaws and quirks, the experience is well worth taking head-on.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]A Paladin's Review: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl "

												You are completely alone, stranded on the rusty wreck of an abandoned barge, you have 6 bullets left in your AK rifle,  You hear a lone roar, in the distance, the lone roar converges into a collective one, sending a spark of pure terror into you, as you ready your rifle. Such is life in the zone. If you've heard of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. , you probrably know what the niche set of gamer it appeals to, and you know if this game is for you. The Plethora of high profile mods like Misery and SGM only add to the awesomesauce of this game, keeping it alive long after the game company itself had died. It improves upon many of the gameplay aspects of SoC, only not quite making it in the atmosphere and horror department, while greatly expanding the RPG and Open world aspects that really make this game shine. Now, what are you doing? Get out of here STALKER, go and buy the game.			"

												It's like Fallout in Russia.....but better. with a handful of happenings with the anomalies, emmisions, and creatures/mutants actually roaming the lands, and of course you can't forget the artifacts that add a little something different to the mix, there's never a dull moment. this game is great for fans of the sci-fi/apocalyptica genres with a little piece of survival horror in some sections. i'd highly recommend this game if you're looking for something new to take a break from the other games you may play a hundred hours a week of. also if you ever catch this game on sale, don't pass it up. i've had this game on my wishlist for a good three years, and not once has it gone on sale until October 7th.

												An absolutely amazing game with an incredibly oppressive and bleak atmosphere. Following the Chernobyl catastrophe, there was another explosion in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, an explosion that left the surrounding environment altered in ways that defy scienfitic explanation. The area is now filled to the brim with deadly physics defying anomalies, countless pockets of radiation and incredibly lethal mutants. The area is simply referred to as ""The Zone"". Those that explore the zone, in search of valuable artifacts spawned from the mysterious anomalies, are called Stalkers. You are one of them. Or rather, you pose as one. You are in fact a Ukranian army major, covertly entering the zone to investigate a lost helicopter squadron sent in to conduct reconnaissance in the zone. To accomplish your mission, you need to make allies with other stalkers and with their aid make your way towards the city of Pripyat and find out what exactly happened to the helicopters and their crews. Of course, there's also hostile humans to contend with, ranging from bandits, brain fried zombies (Still capable of using their guns) and foreign mercenaries. You also have some degree of choice in which faction to align yourself with and every side mission you complete (Or don't) have an impact on the epilogue endings of the game. It is very much worth it to complete every side mission, for that reason but also because a lot of the best moments in the game happen during them. The game is very survival focused, with a large emphasis on resource and inventory management. It also has a hunger mechanic, which adds flavor without in any way becoming overbearing. There's a real time passage of time (At a factor of 1 minute per 3 seconds or so), various weather conditions and there's also recurring ""Emissions"", which are essentially storms that turn the entire world red and fry your brain unless you take cover inside a solid structure. There's quite a lot of weapons and armors to acquire and many ways to upgrade them to improve your survivability. You can also equip artifacts to boost various attributes, like improved healing rate, increased endurance or resistance against radiation. I personally find that the equipment progression curve is a bit uneven, with the player finding equipment early on that's good to stick with nearly all the way to the end game. The feeling of being outmatched and outgunned, which was prevalent for a large part of the first two games, is much rarer in this installment. That's not to say that the game is easy, because it certainly isn't. Later in the game, you very much want to stick to the biggest guns you've got and bring as much armor piercing ammunition as you can. But it lacks the initial desperation, trying to scrounge for decent gear, which made the beginning of the first two games so frustrating, but also exciting. This also has the effect of making pistols somewhat useless, which is a shame, because there is quite a few of them. But, as far as the story is concerned, it makes sense to not have terrible equipment from the outset. This is still the best installment in the series, due to it's gameplay refinements and focus on a handful of large open areas rather than multiple smaller maps. I do however think the environment design of the first game is superior, but it's entirely possible that that is simply nostalgia speaking. I just felt that each area in the first game introduced something new, while the 3 large areas of Call of Prypyat feel a bit more sparse and predictable. I do miss the beginners area of the Cordon (Rookie Village, Railway Bridge), the claustrophobic streets. alleys and railways of the Wild Territory (Exploring this in a thunderstorm is amazing), the absolutely terrifying Bloodsucker village and the city of Pripyat itself (And the locations you find there).Really, what I'm saying is play all of them.

												The sequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, Call of Pripyat does an excellent job of adding to the previous game's mechanics and making it a smoother experience.  Issues from Shadow of Chernobyl such as item repair are now included without needing mods and other aspects are changed such as artifact hunting and a degree of neutrality with other factions (such as mercenaries and bandits).  The game is perhaps more open world than SoC and the side quests are much more intuitive.   Most importantly, the game retains much of its original atmosphere and you'll continue to explore the decaying wastelands of the Exclusion Zone.With that said, the game does have some weaknesses.  While it retains that atmosphere that made SoC great, it also (disappointingly) leaves you cut off from much of its namesake town of Pripyat.  Regions you once explored in SoC such as the hotel, government building and the park with its iconic Ferris wheel are now only seen in the distance behind fences.  The buildings you explore instead seem sparser and more linear.  Likewise, human opponents are pretty thin in the game and most of your fighting will be against mutants.  Sure, you CAN just start shooting people on sight but the different factions and uncertain nature of SoC felt much more exhilarating to me and winning against 'human' opponents just felt more gratifying than shooting umpteen mutant dogs and pigs.  Finally, the ending felt rushed to me and less epic than the original breech into the forbidden CNPP.Even with all that, Call of Pripyat still felt like a worthy successor to Shadow of Chernobyl.  I would definitely recommend that someone new to the series play SoC first but Call of Pripyat will be a satisfying way to remain in the mysterious world of the Exclusion Zone a while longer.  Call of Pripyat played well 'vanilla' without requiring mods (which is more than you can say for the buggy SoC) but there are multiple well crafted mods to dramatically change the world and keep things interesting for a long time to come.  Shadow of Chernobyl was a tough act to follow and Call of Pripyat made it most of the way there; a recommended purchase in my book.			"

Play with the highest difficulty for perfect experience (Trust me, i'm not an engineer) The different accuracy, durabillity and damage of the guns fits perfect to the game, you should take care of your guns or you will not hit the enemy as you wish and don't forget the durabillity of you armor!

												A typical day as a STALKER:I wake up as day breaks on an old ship we STALKERs use as a makeshift base.  I check my gear for the day; one pump-action shotgun for the mutants, and a rifle in case one of my own decides he wants my gear.  I make sure I have enough food for the day, drugs in case some form of radiation decides to run rampant through my body, a few medkits and bandages, and my artifact detector.  I decide its a perfect day for artifact hunting.  As I step out the ship, I hear gun shots to the north, my intended direction.  F*** that, I'll go somewhere else.  On my way to the first anomaly, I suddenly hear shrieks and the sound of ruffled bushes.  As I turn toward that direction, a snork leaps its way toward me, claws ready to dig straight through my throat.  Luckily I had my shotgun out, and I was quicker than him.  As my slugs blow off his face, another one follows, but I make short work of him too.  Unharmed and feeling confident, I continue to the anomaly.  Before I'm even halfway there, a fight breaks out between a group of stalkers and bandits.  I lay in wait, hoping the two groups wipe each other out.  Suddenly the bandits have an overwhelming advantage.  Then I'm spotted.  My rifle fires into the head of the first two, but I'm not so lucky with the third.  His bullets clip my side.  I quickly bandage them up to stop the bleeding, pop out of cover and fire, exploding his head.  I use my medkit to heal everything up, and a few minutes later I'm back on track.Or so i thought.  Out stomps a god damn psuedogiant, as large as a frickin SUV.  As I'm running, I see a group of stalkers and head in there direction.  They see the situation, and begin to fire into the giant, as do I.  But it's not enough.  The thing destroys these three stalkers, but while he was distracted, I managaed to lay a few grenades under him, and finish him off with the shotgun.  It's nearing night, and stalkers know thats when more of these mutants come out, and not just the ones I've seen.  I'm frightened I'll run into a buror, or a controller.  Not to mention the horde of wild dogs hungry enough to sink their teeth into any form of flesh.  I'm make my way back to the old ship. What was I out here for again?			"

												Okay you little casual, listen here and listen here good.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is not your average 'Pew pew shooter'.  You need to realize this right here, right now.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. will ♥♥♥♥ you up. If you think playing Dark Souls or ArmA  prepares you for this game then I'm sorry for you.In S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you will be thrown into The Zone (some people call it Hell and they have their reasons)  and you will be given an objective. Simple as that.  No tutorial, not any big baby hand-holding cutscene and no magic armor that defends you from everything. You are literally one of the most useless things walking around in The Zone and of course the NPCs will treat you like one.  They will try to steal from you, kill you and even ask you if you want to die fast or slowly.  'Make your choice'.What can you do to avoid that? Nothing. It will happen sooner or later because as I said you are the most useless thing in the game.  You will die at least 5 times within the first hour and if you are a dirty casual, you will abandon the game.If you want to master this game though, you will continue playing and every time the game beats you up like you were a bag of trash.So here are two tips from  an experienced player such as myself:Tip #1 Take your ♥♥♥♥ing time, idiot.    You do not kill everything you see, because you can't.  You have a better chance waiting for your ""friendly"" NPCs to kill each other and then go loot their bodies because that's all you can do at the start of the game.   You are pathetic.So after you get some nice loot, go sell it in Skadovsk. You do not know what Skadovsk is? Then open the ♥♥♥♥ing wiki and see for yourself. That's how you will play this game from now on. You will learn things from the damn wiki because it's the only place that explains things. Tip #2Do not go outside during night. I did once, and to this date I still wake up in the middle of the night from the nightmares.  Don't go outside during night, ♥♥♥♥nut.Overall score:10/10. And if someone gives it lower than 10,  he is a rookie and Vodka is too strong for him.			"

												The vanilla game is good but for the full experience get the Misery mod through ModDB. You will die, you will limp away from skirmishes and fights with mutants, you will end up consuming Charlie Sheen levels of cocaine just to make it back to camp with a half beating heart to sell your loot for scraps, you will smoke more weed than Willie Nelson just to survive an encounter with poltergeists or controllers, drink more vodka than Courtney Love to cope with radiation, eat raw mutant flesh like Hannibal Lector to subside your overwhelming hunger, you will save every three steps, you will want to punch your monitor, you will probably take your aggression out on your spouse and/or kids but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it you enjoy every second while doing it because this is how a game is supposed to feel and how it's to be played. You will most likely release your bowels while venturing tunnels or the zone at night so make sure you get your diapers ready, the ambiance is unbelievable, the mod is very hardware intsenive but if your rig can handle it then its very aesthetically pleasing if you like dead trees, grass and half ♥♥♥♥♥ voice overs. Its also very likely you will develop premature stages of Carpaul Tunnel from looking every direction every .6 seconds to see if something is going to molest your face and dignity.This game is highly recommended to anyone who is masosadistic enough to venture into the zone and struggle through every aspect of life.15/10			"

												Frankly, I loved this game ... as is probably apparent by the ""hours on record"".  I've always liked the weapon physics in the Stalker series.  Its a bit tougher to be accurate whether ADS or from the hip.  And some of the creature noises just make my hair follicles bristle.  Some creepy stuff, but not so intensely as to be truly horrific (imo).  Stupid snorks!  I felt engaged in the story, driven to ""save"" (for instance) all my squad when going through the tunnels to Pripyat.  Losing one of them was unacceptable.  Trading with the good guy, ""Beard"" instead of ""Owl"" whenever possible ... and always dissing ""Sultan's"" team of bandits.I'd really recommend playing the game a second time 'round with a different weapon setup.  Get clever with saves so as to purchase the special weaps and armour from ""Nimble"" that you'd favour.Then play again on the ""Misery"" mod.  Despite having played CoP at least 4 times through --yes I've lost count-- trying ""Misery"" mod was enjoyable because of the difficulty.I wonder where the dev team is now ... ?  I thought they were working on another post-apocalyptic adventure for me! ... a loyal supporter of the franchise.  :D			"

												Before I get into the details, I'll have you know that I've only played this with Misery Mod... a massive overhaul mod tweaking the game to be harsher with bartering, adding dynamic weather, more weapons, the need to eat and sleep, the removal of food healing and adding real time eating and bandaging of which both take around 5 - 10 seconds, new mutants and not to mention this locks the game difficulty to the hardest setting.Do not expect the following:1. Regenerating health2. Bullet sponges (except for chimeras, which are the STALKER equivalent to deathclaws, and they almost always 1 shot you)3. Cinematic cutscenes4. A levelling up system5. Being a pack mule (you CAN carry up to 3x the ""weight limit"" shown, but you will also lose stamina quicker and get hungry quicker)Now the reason I recommend this is quite simple.... Never before have I played a game that contains all the following at once....1. The player characte being in need of sleep so badly that their head would shake while yawning, trying to line up a shot, all the while with hazey vision...2. Situations with 2-4 bandits with basic rifles being a threat to the player character even in newly purchased grade 3-4 armor (there are 5 grades of armor, 5 being the highest)3. Situations where the player character suffers from hunger, and blood loss, while being shot at and trying to bandage, praying the enemy will either miss or not decide to throw a grenade while you're stationary (since you can't move while bandaging, medikit healing or eating)4. Gun jamming  and armor being completely cracked leaving you cursing at the enemy in Russian throwing what little grenades you have (due to limited weight) at them while trying to unjam the gun5. Ugly looking humanoid things that fry your brain from 100 meters away in 2 shots because you are unlucky and stupid enough to miss it's head6.

												I cannot recommend this game enough, as it's one of the few open world games that captures a truly ""living"" world. That is, a living world that can, and will, probably kill you. Alot. But more importantly, especially with the MISERY mod, the Zone feels like the type of place that will go on with or without you. You aren't some superpowered hero, you're an underfunded schmuck with scavenged gear and a job to do. Given the setting of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, it shouldn't be any other way.Verdict: Definitely give it a shot. And then install MISERY, and give it another 4 or 5.			"

												I love the STALKER games; they have an interesting setting and story, post-apocalyptic feel, interesting open areas to explore, lots of unscripted yet interesting encounters, horror elements, authentic industrial environments, and refreshingly unforgiving FPS gameplay.Call of Pripyat is definitely the least buggy and most polished of the series. Extremely compelling, fun to explore, and just plain awesome. Also, many of the game's locations are very close to real-life locations in the zone, and they look impressively authentic when you compare photos to screenshots (which I absolutely love).There are less side quests, but they are individually larger, more interesting, and better thought out than all the mini-side-quests in STALKER: SoC. The interface is also much improved from previous STALKERs, highlighting matching ammo when you mouse over a gun, for example. There aren't as many stashes, but the stashes in CoP can be found without knowing where they are beforehand. Artifact rarity is handled the best in CoP, compared to SoC (too plentiful and easy to get) and Clear Sky (nearly impossible to get). Emissions and equipment upgrades are the best in the series here, as well.The story of CoP is very loose, to let you do whatever you want in whatever order you want, though it's not nearly as good as the story of the original SoC. The game's ending is similar in style to that of Fallout, where it shows you short clips about people and places in the game, telling you what happens to them afterwards. I felt like it was an epic and satisfying end to the trilogy. Ironically, though, the Pripyat area of the game was the worst in terms of well-thought-out-edness in story, dialogue, and missions/quests. Pripyat is, on the other hand, really awesome because the entire area is closely moddled after the Eastern section of real-life Pripyat, with the only major difference being that a service center building is in the game where a kindergarten building is in real life (that, and all the impassible ""video game fences"" around the edges of the in-game area).There is a very active modding community for the game, as well. My favorite mod for Call of Pripyat is 'SGM', which adds a ton of content and improves the graphics.Awesome game. highly recommended if you like survival FPS games.			"

												An excellent game.The story is a bit light compared to the first Stalker (Shadow of Chernobyl).The ending was a bit disappointing. I finally got all of the godly equipment and I didn't even get a chance to use it to the fullest extent. Still, this game was pretty good.When you start out, you're going to be an absolutely garbage fighter. What you need to do is get:1) Strelok's Gun with scope and silencer in Yanov.2) Free Military Gear from Pripyat from the Army armorer.3) Find and give all upgrading tools to a technician and upgrade all your equipment for maximum durability and accuracy.4) Find and equip the Oasis and Bubble Artifacts.5) Get the best detector by trading in 3 Veles Delectors to the guy in the Science Bunker at Yanov.If you are poor, go to an anomaly zone with your detector out (Press O to pull it out), find some artifacts and sell it. You will become rich very quickly. Another way to get money is to sell medical kits and anti-radiation syringes that you'll find off of dead bodies. Everytime you go to Pripyat, bring some broken guns and have them repaired for free, and then whenever you go back to Yanov, sell those guns. This should easily cover the expensive round trip.This game is like a Russian rags-to-riches simulator.Cheeki Breeki/10			"

What I Like About This Game1.The Zone is the most terrifying place to visit in any gaming department2.Players  would be hard pressed to describe something so bleak and unforgiving3.New level of textures/lighting4.Fantastic sense of place5.Lots of tense exploration6.Numerous improvements over the previous games7.Some cool new enemies to take on8.Still charming despite it's flaws9.Great NPC interactions10.Better side jobsWhat I Hate About This Game1.Some recycled props, but no where near as many as Shadow Of Chernobyl2.Ever present ""stutter"" is still here when entering a spawn area for the first time3.Still taxing on older systems despite the leaps forward in stability and polish4.The story takes too long to get interesting5.Pripyat isn't as interesting as the surrounding wastes6.Eating mechanic is tedious7.Supplies are too available8.Predictable encountersThough it's not quite as surprising as the original, it's still a standout game that deserves to be given a chance by anyone That Follow The Series. There aren't many titles able to offer up such an affecting atmosphere mixed with enjoyable mechanics, and even if some bits of the game remain uneven, it's an experience that will stick with you long after it's over. Although i must say even this game still give me a heart pumping when playing, you do not know how you end up dying either by nature or killed by mobs. The enemy is still a bullet sponge and still hard to kill.even an enemy with shotgun can headshot you from long distance and not to say you die easily. Side quest is a must do for you to get better gears in order to survive this nuclear wasteland. Overall it is a mustplay FPS game with much to offer.(Note:You Will Bleed to death in this game unless you do not have bandage to stop the bleeding. There is no such thing as Heath Regen in this game and enemies is really insane in the damage department from the early game you start playing.) "

												I've played through this game 3 times now and this game gets better every single time i play it.  The first two were on normal and the hardest difficulty but that just wasnt enough for me so i went and installed the MISERY mod to get the real ball busting experience.How does one describe the greatest game ever made? is it the story? the world building? the game mechanics? the difficulty and responsibilities the game gives you to manage? the innumerable ways to play the game?  For all of those questions i would tell you to look no further than the Stalker franchise.  If ever a game was to be the flag ship of PC gaming THIS is the game that people should look at in reverence and awe.  Games of today hold your hand, coddle you and all but tube feed you because they dont trust you to anything intelligent  with their property....no mods, tutorials for everything and a streamlined experience so that nobody strays too far from the course like some sort of amusement park ride.  The Stalker games fly in the face of all of that and rewards you for being different and when everything that can go wrong does...finding your own way to survive in the Zone.  Finding secret stashes, managing your limited resources,  risking your life in Anomolies (elemental effects like acid, fire, wind and the like) and doing perilous quests that arent for the foolhardy.  You arent John Rambo and you dont run around with a fully automatic LMG shooting wildly like in most modern games. This game cements my love and facination with the true Survival Horror games like the original Resident Evil series before they started taking steroids. You are just one man with fear in his heart, a deathgrip on your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beaten up shotgun, a dream of seeing a rusted ship you call home and only a fistfull of shotgun shells to guide your way back in pitch black darkness.This game is the most liberating feeling knowing that your life is in your hands and at any moment a mutant could two shot you from behind.....you live by the ability to stay level headed and just how many rounds you have left in your gun(s).   This game is my pride and joy please at least try playing it its well worth $20.See you in the Zone, Stalker...			"

												This game is a gem, seriously, It's really great.The atmosphere is simply awesome,A game that is not in the United States.The night is mostly realistic and beautiful.Emisions are just so great.The guns are great to use.You need to eat to stay alive.The radiations and the environment (emission, radiations, etc etc...) will kill you if you are not carefulThis series is really great, really, and the mods make them even better.I could say a lot about the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise but there is just too much to say, the game itself is awesome.I'm also a fan of every Fallout games but Bethesda should really take some ideas from them especially in questions of realism.It's not the greatest game in terms of open world but you probably won't even notice because of the game being so awesome.Do I have to say that the thunder looks real great in this game? I'd suggest this game to anyone who likes open world, post-apocalyptic, FPS, atmospheric, survival, horror, challenging  and semi-realistic games.If you haven't played the previous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. then I would suggest you to play them, It's a real great series, you won't be disappointed.9.5/10 for the whole S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in general.Only thing that sucks is that we can't make all the characters in the game speak in Ukrainian and It's the same for all the S.T.A.K.E.R. games, when I play a game, I'd love when the characters speak in their language for a question of immersion.My personal list of recommended mods for Call of Pripyat: MISERY + The Armed ZoneCall of Chernobyl + Arsenal Overhaul or STCoP Weapon Pack (I personally play with both, different folder for Arsenal Overhaul and another one for STCoP)Arsenal OverhaulPripyat RebornThere are some small mods that you can find on Russian sites which adds weapon packs, and those are really great.

												This is the best in the series, IMO and one of my favorite games. Was made by the talented developers at GSC Game World, which later became the 4A games that made the fantastic Metro series. This game's great and even better with mods( which you can find at moddb). This is a MUST have for anyone interested in post-apoc FPS games.For new players:- Takes a while to figure out and get into, but you won't put it down when you do, so be patient.-During emmisions(storms), there will be a yellow arrow or maker on the map indicating a safe place for you to hide until it passes.-Some get confused about what you should be doing, but it's to check helicopter crash sites and see what went wrong. You can get more information about how to get to them, by asking other NPCs and the locations are marked on your GPS.- Starting weapons feel inaccurate and underpowered to me, so I suggest youtubing ""STALKER Call of Pripyat secrets"" to find where the hidden stashes are for a decent early weapon with a scope.-Start on vetern difficulty. You can change it later in-game if you think it's too hard.-For mods; I'd suggest atmosfear, absolute nature and absolute structures, which all make the game look gorgeous, but keep a pretty vanilla experience. Check out Misery after you beat it, because it's much harder and a major overhaul changing most of the game.-If you play without mods, try increasing the contrast in settings to the max, because it makes the game look much better.10/10 - We need a redux version of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.

												Buy .... Install Misery ,, Cry ..... Go back to COD .....A masterclass FPS. I owned a retail version when it was first released and certainly got my moneys worth then. After purchasing on Steam after a bout of nostalgia it suddenly occured to me just how good Stalker C.O.P really is. In an age when developers are churning out massed produced rubbish designed to grab your money and run after 6 hours worth of banal gameplay ..... Stalker despite its flaws ( including constant stutter that you wont get rid of no matter how hard you try ) remains a classic, atmospheric, masterwork shooter .... add the Misery mod and experience some of the most intense gunfights you will ever see in a game. Better than Dayz. More intense than Arma ....Highly Recommended.			"

												B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L.  :)  played with ""complete mod"". I didn't play Clear Sky as I always heard it was quite bad. This call of pripyat is a bit different from the first stalker shadow of chernobyl. Rapid transport makes things easier. Atmosphere is as thick as in the first...emissions are really scary the first times. Story, though, not so elaborate. The first was more mysterious, and thing with the wishgranter and the whole exploration until you get to Chernobyl was perfect. Here the Pripyat town could have been more immersive and complete, as it is the last map you reach. More similar to the real one...only a few empty buildings, instead. No swimming pool, no ferris wheel....but the game remains one of those games you feel bad completing it. 32 hours to do more or less everything. 85/100.			"

												Note: played these on discs for years, have just bought Steam copies as there is some compatibility issue with the original DRM and win10/skylake. . . The main problem with this and Shadow of Chernobyl, were that they were so profoundly good that no FPS has ever really lived up to the potential of these games. SOC remains my favourite of the three, but this is a close second. There aren't many games this old that I still play (Supreme Commander is probably the only one; and the STALKER series is the only old shooter I play). And I can't think of a game that does gun ballistics better, or has more satisfying shooting mechanics.  And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are some tense moments, even when you know what's coming. . . I would recommend playing with the Stalker Complete Mods (made in 2011, download from ModDB) for a first play through as they improve the graphics somewhat and fix most bugs, without changing much gameplay-wise. Only consider Misery or AA for subsequent playthroughs if you are up for a serious challenge. Hope you enjoy this as much as I have.			"

												The STALKER series was, is, and will always be one of the most beautiful and interesting game series ever created. At first glance, it is ""just"" a single-player first person shooter game, albeit a good one, which includes elements of survival horror. It takes place in the Zone of Alienation (the area in and around the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor in Ukraine, which was the site of one of the world's most shocking nuclear disasters in history.) However, in the fictitious game world of STALKER, this ""Zone"" is home to much worse than radiation and wild animals.In STALKER, the zone is a place where the very fabric of reality starts to break down. Strange mutants with unexplained psychic abilities and deadly ""anomalies"" (Areas where the laws of physics simply do not apply, leading to the creation of highly valuable artifacts) pose a unique threat to the player that makes for interesting gameplay, while the threat of encountering a group of human enemies makes simply walking around from place to place feel tense.The STALKER series is one of the very few games that manages to pull of one of the greatest feats of game design in all of history: It makes you question every decision you make. Every step could be your last. The game's level design is impeccable, based on the real Zone of Alienation. The audio design and color palette make the environment feel oppressive but beautiful in a sad way. The combat is gritty and difficult, and you will need to develop new tactics to defeat some of the more powerful mutants or large groups of human enemies. The game also has a big focus on exploration and elements of survival which fit seamlessly into gameplay. The game's lore is rich and there are many mysteries to solve. The modding community is strong, and there is an ever-present player base. The game has aged well.It is always a worry of mine that games based of of real life events (especially tragedies) will dilute the importance or impact of those events, but the STALKER games approach the real-life Chernobyl disaster with maturity and respect. In fact, the game has probably done nothing other than make more people interested in learning about the disaster that took place.All in all, STALKER has a special place in the hearts of many-including my own-and with good reason.

Challenging but entertaining at the same time.Apart from some FPS' drops (I have an old graphic card, though), the game is bug-free, cut scenes are not the best but the ending pictures are very nice (they remind me a lot of Fallout ending style).That's it, if you haven't done it already, go for a walk in the zone.

												the 91 hours ive played in this game have honestly been some of the greatest time ive ever spent, sometimes im shocked to see that 91 hours is all ive played as it feels as though ive been in the game for days sometimes even weeks. To sum it up this game is 100% one of the greatest games ever made, the atmosphere in this game is a whole new level. The whole stalker series and setting puts all of the fallouts to shame in my personal opinion. It saddens me even more however that Call of Pripyat will potentially be the last stalker made unless someone, fingers crossed decides to revive this series of pure beauty and bring it back. This game may not be the best by todays standards in graphics or physics but for a game of its time its amazing, and if the graphics are a problem for you there sseveral absolutely brilliant mods out there for this game. STALKER is something that sticks with you and you will always finding yourself returning to the gritty atmosphere with a bottle of vodka your hand on your trusty AK shouting Cheeki Breeki for internity. ill just put it like this, If you own a pc BUY THIS BEAUTIFUL ♥♥♥♥ER RIGHT NOW			"

												""Stalker: Call of Pripyat"" — perhaps, the most not ambitious project (GSC Game World) the History of its birth is similar to instructive east legend in which the arrogant and brisk young man is praised that will make a feat, but over and over again it is comprehended by failure. And so, GSC — it just that young man who was successful in a feat only from the third attempt. Having restrained an ardor and having managed to find internal harmony, developers at last achieved the desirable. You shouldn't wait for any scenario revelations: in ""Call of Pripyat"" the plot, as well as in all other games of a series, is interesting only to the convinced admirers of a setting. The main reason for which people play ""Stalker"" — opportunity to plunge in dangerous, thrown, the world impregnated with melancholy and despondency in which, it seems, still life quite recently boiled. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												Having beat the vanilla campaign and experimented with some mods, I can absolutely say that this game is deserving of the hype.  It really is just as good as people say it is.  The quests are engaging, and can make you feel.  Even just random events can stir feelings in you.  I've watched bandits and stalkers slaughter each other and feel bad because it all seemed so pointless.  Nothing is quite as infuriating as losing a gun you've upgraded and cherished to a mother♥♥♥♥ing burer.  The modding community is solid as well, and definately adds more replay value to an already great game.  Best of all, the vanilla graphics are so old my coffee pot could run this thing.  So get out of here stalker, and play this game already.			"

												Last instalment in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series of games.Game set in perviously unused locations in the Zone, with exception of part of town of Pripyat.You play as Major Degtyarev, member of Ukrainian Special Forces, sent to the Zone to investigate mysterious crash of army helicopters sent to try and capture Wishgranter.Gameplay is much less linear than in pervious Stalker games, but on other hand, game does not guide you by hand like in never titles, so it is sometimes easy to get lost or lose sense of what to do next.Although game is (relatively) old, graphics are still very much presentable, and for example, in some instances game looks much better than say, Fallout 4. When you introduce various mods into it (yes, game is fully moddable, with huge depositories online for various improvements and/or changes), game simply looks amazing.Although gameplay seems a bit more simplified than in pervious games, most of it is same. Shooting and ballistics play huge role in game, as well as weapon condition/ammunition types, so give it time to get used to it.Stalker series of games always had very ''eastern slavic'' feel to them, simply because authors of game are from Eastern Europe, and are very good at translating look and feel of post-communism decay and changes. Abandoned towns, villages, factories, overgrown roads, roaming wild animals, frequent weather changes, indescribable horrors and mutants, bandits and stalkers await all who enter the Zone. But, once you are in, you will not want to leave.			"

If you feel like going it a little deeper into the zone, try this game with the Misery mod, it adds guns, darkens the atmosphere even more, more in-depth AI, character classes, a lot of immersive game mechanics, and just makes the game feel like you live in the zone, a living hell.

												Aboslutely worth a buy. 20 minutes in and you already see how harsh this place is, even if you survive the trials against you; your fellow Stalkers don't. You see people die to bandits mutated animals, even full blown monstrosities; unless of course you get there in time to assist. Or you can just walk on by and let it happen and loot the corpses after whatever killed them has finished using their bones to pick the scraps of flesh out their teeth. What I'm trying to say with that is that the atmosphere that this game gives off is perhaps not one of a kind, but it certainly leaves you with a memorable impression. Especially if you aren't so good with horror type games (Like me)The combat, especially against mutated creatures certainly gives me the feeling of ""Holy ♥♥♥♥, I am going to die if I make a mistake"" unless of course you play on a lower difficulty; however a game like this is meant to be difficult and punishing to mistakes. It's meant to resemble a harsh world filled with creatures and people that wants to tear you apart, eat you or just blow your brains out and steal your stuff. It's also one of the only games that I actually enjoy doing the side missions on. Hell, it's necessary too in order to gain better gear, but it doesn't feel like it, they don't feel tedious.As I said before, definitely worth a buy.CHEEKI BREEKI			"

Here's to a Good Day's Work.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat = Fallout + Deus Ex + UkrainiansI know I'm rather late to this radioactive party, but I've finally revisted the Zone.For those not in the know, Stalker is an FPS dystopic horror that is known for its open world exploration, scary mutants, and almost-RPG aspects.  This is the logical sequel to the first game, Shadow of Chernobyl, but you don't really need to have played the first to enjoy this one.Call of Pripyat is set in a post-Chernobyl disaster area, the Exclusion Zone or just ""The Zone"".  Although it's forbidden for anyone to enter, fortune-seeking scavengers known as ""Stalkers"" regularly find their way in to this cess pool of rust, mutants, and otherwordly death-traps known as ""Anomolies"".  They do this mostly to dig up ""Artifacts"", strange new types of matter that display all manner of bizarre and potentially useful phenomenon, which fetch a high price in the scientific, black, and black scientific markets.The gameplay mechanics are a good blend of open-world scavenger hunts and solid shooter mechanics.  There are a wide variety of traditional weapons to use that often feature multiple ammo types, fire modes, and optional attachments.  One would think that with new Artifact-based tech, you might find more exotic weapons as well, but other than a slight exception toward the end-game, you won't find any gravity guns or psy-grenades here.I say that this game is an almost-RPG simply due to the fact that, despite not having attributes or XP points, there is still a ""grind"" flow to the gameplay and a sort of character progression through acquiring gear, artifacts, and equipment upgrades.There is a main mission to follow, which I found mostly uninspired, and a few side missions, which I found much more intriguing.  However, most of your time will be spent simply heading out to points of interests to dig up artifacts and scavenge useful or valuable items from the dead.  Then you will head back to safety when you need to take shelter from the intermittent deadly storms called ""Emissions"" and/or to sell your loot.  Rinse, repeat.  Fortunately, the game is full of interesting environments, fun shooting mechanics, and a variety of enemies that use a lot of different tactics and abilities to kill you.Enter the Zone if you...
 Played and enjoyed the first game.  Although I feel CoP lacks the scope, mystery, and even some of the scariness of the original, this is offset by better mechanics and overall polish.  Both are great and if you enjoy one you will likely want to play the other. Love post-apocalyptic themes and environments.  CoP is full of bizarre mutants, rusted out ruins, and unearthly anomaly areas. Like yourself a good open-world shooter.  This is one of the shining stars of the genre.Head back to the Cordon if you... Prefer on-rails, level-based shooter gameplay.  Stalker requires a far more methodical approach if you want to avoid getting killed over and over. Hate ""gritty"" settings.  For all the sci-fi of the Anomalies, mutants, and artifacts, the Zone is otherwise a bleak landscape of swamps, crumbled concrete, and rust.  I think it is beautiful in it's own way, but I know it's not everyone's cup of Dogolov. Want more RPG mechanics.  Stalker is definitely a shooter first before anything else.  It is no Borderlands, for example.The Bottom LineAs a fan of the original, I loved this game and in my first run through I racked up about 60 hours.  I found that most of this time was spent hoarding gear and supplies I'd never really use, however.  Where some missions were rather difficult (such as getting through the tunnel to Pripyat without losing anyone), I found that the endgame seemed almost an afterthought.  There was little reason to explore most of the areas in Pripyat, with only a handful of missions actually requring that you do so.  With a complete arsenal of fully upgraded armor, kitted out weapons, and thousands upon thousands of rounds of the best ammo, I found finishing the last few missions an absolute breeze.  Although this was a bit of a let down, I still enjoyed the experience overall and enjoyed how the ending elaborated on the outcome of many of my choices througout the side-missions.:::!!!PROTIP PROTIP PROTIP!!!:::There are a couple of important mods for this game now-a-days.  At a minimum I'd suggest getting Call of Pripyat: Complete, which overhauls the graphics and makes other great changes to the base game while still keeping it mostly similar to the original experience.If you really want to ramp of the difficulty and immersion, there is also the Misery Mod, which puts an emphasis on harsh survival and is probably the most popular mod for the game.

												Call of Pripyat is the best game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. This has the best main plot with a Fallout 3-style ending that changes depending on your actions in game. Very atmospheric with plenty of side quests that reward exploration and help flesh out the lore of the locations. Has a lot of depth with gun play and survival mechanics, requiring you to eat food while in the field and keep yourself bandaged up to avoid bleeding out. Call of Pripyat stands on its own feet and doesn't require any previous experience with the series; a must play for any FPS fans.

												Im gonna skip the amazing graphics, sound, atmosphere and gameplay, and tell you the most important thing: this game has the best AI in any game to date. The developer was inspired by FEAR in terms of AI in battles: the enemies flank you, sneak up on you, take cover, give commands. But this is not just an FPS, it is also an RPG, and HOLY CRAP! if this aint the best RPG out there, then please let me know! Thus, the AI extends outside of combat. Monsters travel in packs and engage in fights with other monsters and humans for survival's sake. If the fight seems to be in their favor, they will engage, otherwise they will fall back and move along. Squads of stalkers patrol the Zone: sometimes to defend their base, sometimes to recapture a point. Sometimes it's just one greedy stalker trying to retrieve an artifact from an anomaly so that he can sell it later.And that's another thing about this game: artifacts and their anomaly counterparts. You see, this is the Zone. Radiation has chnaged many things, not just animals and humans. You will find these mini puzzles with an expensive artifact as a reward. Sometimes it's a timed electricity trap. Sometimes it's a gravitational anomaly that holds the ground and water up in the air in an unnatural fashion.Marketing is killing the gaming industry nowadays. Sales people push developers to improve on graphics and numbers: more DLC, more weapons, more maps, more more more. And it seems like everyone has forgotten the other ingredients that make a game good. Such as AI.If you haven't played this game yet, buy it now! I have spent most of my time playing STALKER: Clear Sky (cheaper), which puts more emphasis on factional warfare. But as far as I can tell, this one is just as good, if not better.			"

CoP & Misery Mod (2.1.1) ReviewThird installment in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series and probably the most polished one in terms of atmosphere, gameplay & optimization. While Vanilla is fine as it is and probably what most would choose to play, Misery totally changes the difficulty bringing a complete overhaul to the Zone. You will have to think through every single of your move; strategy is your number one priority every step in the unknown can as well be your last. Realism is what Misery aimed at and successfully manage to hit a peak with very few features lacking due to engine limitations. If you're not a seasoned hardcore type of player that enjoys suffering mashing the load save hotkey you should avoid a first playthrough with Misery which recreates the Zone into a much crueler and starving enviroment.[✔]> npc interaction> meaningful difficulty slider> gear customization> realistic weapon ballistics> mechanic requires vodka to fulfil your requests (XD)[✘]> awkward mutant animations (probably limited due to X-Ray engine)> stealth combat lacking (AI sometimes telepathically knows if you killed their comrade)> can't purchase tracksuit as outfit (XD)Howdy ho, what are you waiting for?

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a great game in the RPG horror genre.  It's well-designed and runs smoothly, with an indie game feel.  The atmospheres are the best aspect of the game, you can spend hours just walking around and enjoying the envronment.  Only problem with the game is its lack of guidance, which may not bother some.

												*********************MAKE SURE TO MOD IT FOR THE FULL EXPIERENCE!!!!*************************One of my favorite up-to date single player free roams. I would rather play any S.T.A.L.K.E.R games rather then Far cry 4, Dying Light, and even GTA 5 ETC. This game, hence any other S.T.A.L.K.E.R has so much replay value it's insane. And if you think you've done it all, there's hundreds of amazing mods out there that you can replay your expierence. One of my favorite games up-to date I highly recommend it.Top 4 favorite mods for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series (that I highly suggest):Autumn Aurora (S.T.A.L.K.E.R  Shadow of Chernobyl)Misery (S.T.A.L.K.E.R  Call of Pripyat)Complete Series (Any S.T.A.L.K.E.R )Faction Wars/Sky Reclaimation Project (S.T.A.L.K.E.R  Clear Sky combined)Other mods suggested by other people: S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of PripyatArsenal Overhual 3 (Suggested by KaoFox)Radium (Suggested by KaoFox)Orginal Weapons Renewal 3 (Suggested by KaoFox)S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl:Lurk (Suggested by KaoFox)			"

												*Hackjob Ukrainian accent* I remember it like it was yesterday, the death, the mutants, the gunfights...Boris and I just got back to Sadovsk from doing our latest scav run, it was hot, wet, and reeked of ♥♥♥♥. I sold my aritfacts, because apparently I could find millions of them and 97% of them were basically Ruble magnets rather than useful, but I didn't complain, then we set out and it happened....Bloodsuckers, this horrible beasts that looked like Liza Manelli except the face looked like it was put through a meat grinder, ugly they were, uglier than Donald Trump's hair! They killed Boris and sucked him dryer than a transvestite going down on a rich client, it still haunts me, the sounds of them sucking on him as if he was a sodding juice box... Then they disappeared out of thin air, leaving a horrendous odor that would've made a burning tire dump smell like a rose garden.To this day, I never leave safety without my anti-bloodsucker underwear.Alright seriously this is a good game, as many people before stated it's got a great atmosphere and sound along with original music. My most loved gem about Call of Pripyat is that it captured my imagination of how Pripyat is now. (Believe me I know it's not really a zone full of anomalies and mutants, but it's my imagination and muck off if you think having an active one is bad.)			"

												Where you around, or have you heard about the Chernobyl, Russia nuclear accident in 1986?This survival-horror/RPG/Shooter game is centered around the aftermath in a fictional timeline after those events.The Stalker series is considered one of the best modern survival games of the genre.Why? Because, when you are playing them you feel like you are in Chernobyl, Russia.You feel the fear, you see the greed of your fellow man, and you get to decide what type of man you really are.Are you one who takes advantage of hardships to make your life better, to the detriment of others?Or, are you the type who does what needs to be done to survive, but you also take the time to help your fellow man?Are you there to get rich off of rare resources and plunder whoever you can?Maybe you are there to show the world that even in the darkest times, humanity can be a beautiful thing?Find out these answers in the final installment of the STALKER series.It is recommended that you start with the first game in this series, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl.The second game, Clear Sky did not get good reviews at release and many people suggest skipping it entirely as it is a prequel to the story of the first game.This is the final game in the STALKER series before the developers closed shop.There have been a few attempts to bring the STALKER series back, but as of 2016 that hasn't happened.The studio did re-open this year and released a remake of Cossacks 3 which received generally positive reviews.

												It's gonna be a long time until we get a game as interesting as this. Great survival-ish, nonlinear zone-based action/adventure FPS with incredible community mod support (and some mods that really change how the game plays, plus some that aim to bring improvements to a mostly vanilla experience). I've played hundreds of hours of these games in offline mode on top of what is shown here, and if you click with any of these awesome gems you will too. I think Call of Pripyat just barely edges out Shadows of Chernobyl but they are both unique and incredibly immersive, fun, addictive!			"

												This game is literally the love of my life.Horrifying, radiation-riddled waifu/husbando.If you have a thing for slow(-ish) and methodical FPS, survival, horror, sci-fi, and post-apocalyptic scenes, you will not regret giving this game a try.You should keep in mind though, that this game (Call of Pripyat) takes place after the ""main"" events of the game. If you care for story (you kind of should, but it's not necessary to enjoy the game), you should play Shadow of Chernobyl first. It's older and the first game in the series but it's not worse in quality.Clear Sky is the second game in the series and a prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl. You can ignore it.I have probably around 300-500 hours total in the game, but I only recently (130 hours of gameplay) bought the game on Steam for ease of reinstall. (The game has a somewhat active modding scene.)The ONLY downside this game has is that it runs on a single thread on a single core, so the game stutters on almost all computers unless they have a very strong single-core/thread performance. (Hyperthreading or multi-core CPUs won't help.)			"

												This is the game that should have been Fallout 3 or after any fallout first person to be fair . has everything you would want from a fallout series. better engine than fallout 3 by far more intruiging gamplay. only critique, unlike fallout 1/2 there is no way to beat the game peacefully without killing, only downside imo. NPC is interactive and the area you play in ""the Zone"" seems alive, like all npcs are up to something. i only wish one other thing, and that is, that more things to find in the wild place that is the zone, there are things to find but should be more, also trading system makes it sometimes frustrating to loot enemies. great game love it and also mods are a plenty and active !

												I have not played this game for a very long time, however I noticed one thing over the course of all of this time... I kept remembering this game from time to time. As somebody who is not a fan of jump scares and the ""horror""-genre, in general, I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed this game.I was all about the open world. This world is very atmospheric and it really felt like you were just trying to survive, even if in reality it did not take much to become a bad-♥♥♥ who could go in with guns blazing most of the time. There were still plenty of surprises and challenges, some of which took a while to figure-out because there were more than one way to approach the situation, however the FEELING of ""OMG, I have to stop the bleeding, find food, sell of this stuff to make money, and get ammo for my gun!"" was always present. Never have I played a game where I was actually afraid of walking out at night and actually tried to get back to a safe area before darkness... kind of how you would do in real life, right? The atmosphere, especially with the lighting effects, and the creepy anomalies, made me explore every nook and cranny. Sure, you could probably run through the main story in a solid 10-15 hours... but why? I had a blast just exploring, at times doing repetitive artifact farming just because it was FUN figuring-out the spots where you could make a profit and simply LIVING in this world.If you like open world exploration (divided into several very large maps/area) and appreciate a focus on atmosphere, you will probably be able to look past the occasional cheap horror jump-scare and enjoy the game for what it is: an exploration masterpiece that ends waaaay too soon even after 54 hours. You will remember this one, unlike the many other games you may have also played along the way to get to this one.			"

												I have just sneaked into the Waste Processing Station, which is being used by mercenaries as their camp. I have to find a notebook containing their plans and then return to Owl with the intel.I am heavily outnumbered and outgunned. If I pick a fight with anyone, I'm dead. If I get spotted, I'm dead before I can get out the door, let alone the compound. Where is the notebook? Somewhere upstairs, I'm sure.It's so dark I can't see anything immediately around me but the handrail of the staircase silhouetted against the fading daylight from outside. I can't risk using my flashlight. Hugging the deep shadow against the wall, I crouch and move silently. There's the notebook! Got it! Now to get out.Can I sneak out the same way I sneaked in? I can. I pick up a jerry can of fuel as a bonus on the way out. Not a shot fired (and just as well because ammo is expensive). Who says stealth is dead? Not me! I stop to eat before starting back, just in case I need some energy to sprint for safety.I almost make it back to the Shadovsk when I'm ambushed by a pack of mutants charging from behind. Just Flesh, so easy to handle. Mission accomplished. I'll head back to  the WPS later when I'm better armed and can hold my own against the mercs: right now I need the money that intel will get me.No hand holding. No follow the NPC leader. No warnings of any kind of impending death. Just me and the Zone.I had heard the S.TA.L.K.E.R. series was solid (and was already a Metro 2033 fan) so I bought Call of Pripyat on sale but then it sat there in my Steam library, neglected while I played other newer games. And then I heard about the Misery Mod. It sounded hard. It sounded scary. It looked fantastic. Misery 2.1 is cruelty ratcheted up several notches to the level of sadomasochism.Run out of medkits? You die. Miss your headshot and don't duck back into cover fast enough? You die. Forget to pop an antiradiation pill? You watch your health slowly bleed out (and then you get into a firefight). It is just the most awesome, scary, thrilling and realistic gaming experience I've ever had.If you want to experience a game that is as brutal as if you were in the irradiated zone around Chernobyl in real life, Misery Mod 2.1.1 is it. UPDATE: Heading out from base, whether in Zaton, Jupiter or Pripyat, equipped and loaded for a day in the Zone of Alienation (I have now been freeplaying Misery as a Recon for hundreds of hours) not knowing whether I'm going to encounter mercs or bandits, bloodsuckers or chimeras, wondering if I'm going to locate a new stash (170 looted so far) or just find a new ledge I can climb onto, or even acquire an unknown 23rd artifact type to add to my collection: every day in the Zone is a joy, an adrenaline rush, and a meditation on the beauty of the maps and excellent gameplay that the developers and modders created.If I were shipwrecked on a desert island (with my PC and a power source) this would be the game I would want with me.

												A huge thunder storm decorates the sky, a lonely man travels through the storm, carrying more artifacts than he can carry, trying to make it to Skadovsk. It is within sight, but as a veteran stalker, he knows that he can get killed even on the doorstep of the beached ship, but today is his lucky day, he makes it and sells all of those artifacts. ''Get money, survive another day in this ♥♥♥♥ hole'' mutters the stalker while going towards the ships' sleeping area. This is the Zone my friends, as never seen before, more quests, people, plot twists, more weapons, mutants and animations, this game is the ultimate stalker experience up to date. Try to do your best to survive, or die, the choice of gameplay is completly up to you, but watch out, because karma is a ♥♥♥♥♥, and she will make you regret any bad choice in spades, this game deserves a 10/10, you have to play it!

												Another game I should've reviewed a long time ago. This is an attempt to keep the Stalker feel with a new game, but since it's impossible to score a 11/10 like Shadow of Chernobyl, Call of Pripyat will have to settle for a 10/10.  This title keeps the Stalker atmosphere, with improved graphics (one of the first dx11 games), new maps (photorealistic to the areas they represent), and new gameplay and AI ""Alife"" system.  The same STALKER experience, while a slightly shorter game with fewer sidequests. Most negative review are from performance issues (try CoP Complete 2012 mod) or people that didn't give the game enough of a chance.  Try it and you won't regret it.10/10			"

												Decided to re-write this review since I don't have a limit on characters now, I don't think.Anyway, STALKER Call of Pripyat is the 3rd game of the STALKER series and in the order of chronology, it falls in last (the first being Clear Sky, the second being Shadow of Chernobyl). STALKER is a survival semi-RPG FPS game that requires you to focus on multiple areas at once. Eating, weapon and armor management, inventory management, etc. The series is loosely based on the book Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, although there are many differences. The act of searching for artifacts in an exclusion Zone is there, but the rest of the story is vastly different. Call of Pripyat's story, in particular, has almost nothing to do with the book. You play as USS Major Alexander Degtyarev, who is sent into the Zone following a failed mission conducted by the military to essentially map out the Zone for a full-scale military assault on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP). The game starts out with a cutscene that lasts maybe 5 or so minutes to give you backstory and such, and then thrusts you into the zone with bare essentials: food, bandages, first aid, and a couple guns with ammo. From there on, you're on your own. The game expects you to figure things out yourself and doesn't really outright tell you what to do. This is either exciting to you or a put off, depending on who you are. For me, it was refreshing. The first thing I did was walk up to a couple stalkers after I spawned and asked them where the nearest settlement was. They point to Skavodsk and you head there for more work. STALKER does a good job inducing a feeling of Isolation by putting you in wide open areas with very few people to be seen, except around settlements. Even then, the stalkers in these settlements will occasionally head out to gather supplies, hunt, artifact search, or just duke it out amongst themselves, so you'll find Skavodsk empty at times, aside from the merchants.  STALKER is also one of the most immersive games for me. The combination of music, ambience, and the general loneliness is so well done that it's hard to turn the game off. In Pripyat especially, there's a feeling of paranoia, as the background ambience includes whispering and quiet, soft chattering in Russian, so it always feels as if someone is nearby, and you don't know if they're friend or foe. One complaint that I have for the game is the English voice actors being really bad and making the game seem sillier than it really is. However, this can be fixed by downloading a Russian voice pack mod and english subtitle mod (I don't understand why these features weren't included to begin with but I'm glad the mods exist). Speaking of mods, there are several mods that make the game even better. Complete, MISERY, Atmosfear and many other mods all manage to make the game more immersive, difficult, fun, beautiful and overall great. Some problems with the base game are the glitches and crashes that occur, but with some mods, some of these glitches are nonexistent, although some still remain. I highly recommend playing CoP with mods.STALKERs mutants are also something to be addressed in themselves. There are mutants galore in the STALKER games. From the mostly docile Flesh, to the hulking Pseudo-Giant, to the mind bending Controller, every mutant is unique, and requires their own set of tactics in order to make it out in one piece.There's so many things I'd love to talk about in STALKER. I can't possibly put them all in one review. All I can say is buy the game and find out for yourself just how well made this game was, and how much love was put into it. Here's hoping bitComposer can help get STALKER 2 off the ground, and Survarium is just as good.			"

												Stalker is a fantastic franchise, and this game is the perfect closing for the depressive story. *nano-spoiler* Strelok, the ♥♥♥-kicker and protagonist of the first game and the most important character of the series dind't get a very good ending in my playthough... but that's the beaulty of this game. *end of nano-spoiler* What you do and what you didn't do is important in the end. This is the best of all three games technically, but it's not better than the first in terms of mood. Maybe that's just because Shadow of Shernobyl was the first one I played, I don't know. If you like FPS and RPGs, and think that the odd relationship between Call of Duty, Fallout and Resident Evil should result in a cool ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, genetically threesomely impossible, ucranian child, you will fall in love with this gem of a series. They are cheap even in full price for what you get, I asure you.And one more thing: I am a HUGE fan of Fallout series (but yeah I prefer the original. More Mad Max and less America ♥♥♥♥ Yeah than the PFS ones, but still) but S.T.A.L.K.E.R is better. You shoot, your bullet has a parabolic trajectory, it hits the head, the enemy dies. No ""5 hits in the head because ♥♥♥♥ realism and fun, ATRIBUTES AND MATH!!!"" If there is an enemy around, you see it. No ""I can't see because of a calculation between atributes and random enconter generator"" or anything. Of course, this is a matter of taste.Also, this game was almost bug free in my playthough. Perfect.			"

												THE BEST post-apocalyptic survival game I have ever played. I am returning to this series every year. Already finished series 13x except Clear Sky... maybe 4 times, because that prologue is just boring and do not compare to Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat. Very solid survival horror with its own special feeling to it. Exploring the Zone around Chernobyl with all its mutants, bandits, Stalkers, anomalies and really dangerous types of mutant creatures is a real pleasure. I heavily enjoyed the difficult and realism of the Misery mod. (Stalker difficulty level recommended people that play the series for the first time)Every year I am playing series with a diffrent mix of mods. If You are going to play it for the first time, play vanilla game, once You finish YOU HAVE TO APPLY ONE OF THE BEST MODS: Enchanced Environment Mod, Complete Mod, Misery Mod! And this is just for Call of Pripyat! Every mod has something unique to offer! You will experience game like never before, even though You finished the game. These mods just make the game fresh all over again! Thanks to the Modders we are going to experience COOP CAMPAIGN SOON. Isn't that crazy?! The coop mod is called ""Ray Of Hope"" and this mod does not introduce just a coop campaign. ♥♥♥♥♥, please. THEY ADD BRAND NEW OPEN WORLD MAP, REBALANCED AI AND MORE! So if You are a hardcore fan of such challenging survival games like me, YOU HAVE TO BUY THE GAME. This series is just the pure perfection in survival genre. THIS IS HOW ALL OTHER GAMES SHOULD BE. DayZ? H1Z1? Miscreated? They all are a bullsh*t. Developers are laughing ♥♥♥ of You paying them for these games, especially for ""FREE 2 PLAY SOON"" H1Z1. Stalker series is legendary, and I MEAN IT.May the CHEEKI BREEKI be IV DAMKE!P.S. Exaggeration at points was just necessary because I am fed of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""early access"" games that I never play because they are not even alpha...			"

												I went into this game with very low expectations. I wasn't much of a fan of the previous games thanks to a few mechanics in each one that I strongly disliked. Boy, was I surprised. I beat every quest in this game in two days (that's not to say the game is short I just marathon'd the ♥♥♥♥ out of it) and I enjoyed pretty much every minute of it. This is the first game in a long, long, time that made time pass by faster than I expected. 10/10. Easily in my top 10-15 games of all time.			"

It has a different take of an open world adventure, it constatnly keeps you on edge with it's various types of enemies and you will be constantly doing something to survive, whether it be crawling through a field of anomalies, dropping equipment to allow yourself to run fast enough or fighting the cheeki breeki bandits. This game reeks of atmosphere. To top it off this game has some fantastic mods such as the Aresnal Overhall, Call of Chernobyl and Misery. The other two games were good but this one to me is the best. Now, get out of here Stalker! "

												Best game in the series imo...... Clear Sky was just...ok,i think it wasn't so good and it would become really boring after a few hours ( at least it did for me ) but Shadow of Chernobyl was awesome,one of the best post-apocalyptic games out there and then there is Call of Pripyat.i don't even know why it's so great,i mean the story is kinda meh :D the gameplay is similar to you average FPS and it doesn't have anything unique compared to other games but there is something about this game that makes it so special....it's the atmosphere,the world and how it's shown in the game.it just feels so good to wander around and explore the world of stalker,something like Fallout ,but in a much simpler and smaller scale....if you're planning on playing the game today make sure to install Misery 2.1 ,it's a great mod and it makes the game 10 times more appealing,not the graphics and such,it improves the entire game...

												Although it was released in 2009 , but its atmosphere is indescribable.In it you can be in places which in 10 years will be wiped off the face of the earth because of the radiation.After 5 years, the generation is not going to remember this special atmosphere of the game.Personally in my opinion this game is one of the best games from 2009 to 2012.I don't understand people who write bad reviews for this game.In all parts of this series turned out just fine.I think the people who play now and who played it immediately after , will remember how they began to play, how happy they were after mnogih exciting quests and the search for artifacts.Again in my personal opinion this game doesn't have a single minus .Even those people who now love the game because of the graphics ,after playing it will forget that this game graphics 2009.I WILL LEAVE YOUR BORING AND LONG REVIEW, BUT I HOPE THAT SOME PEOPLE RECALL HOW WE ALL LOVED AND ADORED THIS GAME			"

												Fantastic game with a fantastic, very different atmosphere. It's Fallout done from a Russian cultural perspective, basically, and it is surprising how much that adds. Focused on survival and very tight gunplay, if sometimes a little frustrating. It can be brutalizing and somewhat guide-seeky, but it's worth it for the solid gameplay, story, and setting.			"

												The ""real"" sequel to SoC. Sacrifices a little bit of the heavy, suffocating atmosphere and enthralling storyline of the first game for a massive improvement in virtually every other field. Surprisingly stable for something made by GSC, more balanced, devoid of the nerve-wracking loading times, dull random quests and broken mechanics. While the main storyline is noticeably more bland than in SoC, the side stories in all three of the main locations and the related quests more than make up for it. Increasing the size and decreasing the number of the main locations has been a wise decision, and while maybe a bit less varied in features, they are still rich enough. The re-worked survival, combat, anomaly, artifact and weapon customization systems all contribute to a much smoother and rewarding gameplay while the quests that involve going ""off the grid"" and often underground still ensure the teeth-rattling, creepy experience you all loved in SoC.

												As someone who has played all of the Fallout games, and most of the survival-multiplayer games, I can see why they would use certain aspects of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in their ideas.Generally, Call of Pripyat is really fun to play, even after you beat the main story. It's good for free-roam and making choices, with just enough non-linear choices to keep the player happy. It's also linear enough to keep a good story in-tact. I do say good, and not great. This game is a great game with a great feel to it, but its story cannot be described as more than ""good"".			"

It's kinda spooky.  2 spooky sometimes.  Everyone also talks like a russian trying to be as American as he can be,  ""Howdy ho!""  The game has many things to do in it and all the missions are diffrent all the time so you always have something new to do.  Its better then fallout.  but, Then there is a mod.  A great mod.  Only it makes the game 5x scarier and even on Rookie mode its 10x harder then the normal game.  (Misery mod only for those MLG pros)  But buy this game, its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing!  so is the mod!  Just make sure you play the base game first for a bit and look up some guides or you will feel like your playing Dark Souls with guns. 11/10.  Would be lost to the zone again			"

												You're gonna want to play this game (and the other stalker games too) on the highest difficulty because the lower the difficulty, the lower the chance of a bullet hit counting as an actual hit. This means shooting an enemy in the head on easy may or may not kill the enemy, depending on your luck. Whereas shooting an enemy in the head on the highest difficulty will always kill the enemy (assuming your gun does enough damage).Not a great difficulty system, but knowing about it is gonna save you a lot of frustration.

												Call of Pripyat is the much awaited sequel of Shadow of Chernobyl, the first STALKER game. As soon as I completed SoC I sought this game out. Needless to say it took a few hours inorder to get really into it.The game starts out rather slow, though arguably all the STALKER games do. Once you get into the gameplay and fully immersed into the game world, you truly enjoy it. Pripyat is far more stable and less buggy then Shadow of Chernobyl was. Which is a major upside to the frequent crashing and freezing that game had. The gameplay feels a lot more streamlined with closer ties to sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto then RPGs.Really Call of Pripyat is well worth the price of admission. It lacks the heavy plot and character presence that Shadow of Chernobyl had, but makes up for it greatly in gameplay.			"

												Call of Pripyat definitely lives up to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. name! 10/10 obviously.These games have never failed to impress me. The Call of Pripyat Complete mod does volumes to improve upon the look and feel of this game, although without the mod I'd still say the game is damn near perfect like any of the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. However, compared to the other games I felt like this game was... smaller... mostly because there didn't seem to be as much territory to explore. The story also seemed to be lacking a bit after playing SoC, which had an incredible story to it. They made it work though with plenty to do! I'm a huge fan of both the Fallout series and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, and although I spend way more time on Fallout, I have to admit S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a way better RPG (if one can even consider Fallout to be an RPG).

												Of the 3 games in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, this one is my favorite.  CoP is great and if you use some graphics style mods for it, the looks are quite nice for a game this age.  Least is Clear Skys though SoC (Shadow of Chernobyl) has the most diverse endings possible, it's rather cryptic to play.Game play wise, it's wicked - you can and will get munched by things if you don't pay close attention to details.  I do like how when you hear things, like barking dogs or growls, you'll jump (almost nothing you hear is ""friendly"").  The story is decent and the play moves at your pace with plenty of open world feel to it.Downside:  No wait function and sleeping is only at certain times/places.  That gets annoying when you sure as hell aren't interested in going out in the dark/foggy weather in nasty areas or when you need to wait a couple game-hours for a mission.Some modes (and there are a few) help out a bit - especially graphics style mods for visuals but I'd avoid them until you've done a playthrough first. My personal favorites are Atmosfear and Absolute Nature for looks.			"

Dark and mysterious overtones, plus half of my enjoyment comes from the excellent mods readily available for all of the games.

												Absolutely amazing game with a superb atmosphere and interesting locations, people, and storylines.Pros:-Great atmosphere and doesn't overdo the horror element, but the intended parts *are* truly scary.-Unique locations, while some locations are underused, there is a wide variety of different things to look at and experience.-Interesting backstory that captures a lot of mystery. While the main plot is good itself, a lot of the best moments come from the side quests.-Enemies are well done. There is a decent range of different mutants with different focuses.-Alive world. Unlike something like skyrim where 99% of the encounters are scripted, the game's entire world has different squads and mutants shifting about. Since practically no NPCs are unkillable, this can lead to some people you have invested a bit of time into being killed while on patrol.-Better ending(s) than Mass Effect 3. While this game doesn't have a lot of traditional RPG elements, the branching endings make a lot of the questlines more meaningful.Cons:-The world isn't that big. Okay, this is probably a more extreme version of what I experienced with skyrim. After the 500th hour or whatever, you know the landscape to an extent to where the game world can't offer anything new. But yeah, the way the world is split up into three areas really limits the spaces you can visit without a guide. The earlier games handled this much better with smaller maps, but a seemingly larger space in total. Now, of course, this game does pretty much everything else better.-Bugs. It really doesn't seem that bad, but they do occur and I pretty much unconciously ignore them since I'm used to that type of thing. I would still consider it less buggy than Skyrim. I haven't ever had any quests break entirely, but I have had to reload my last save a few times.-AI. On any mission where you have to follow/lead around any AI, its failures become readily apparent. Due to some of the unreasonably strict casualty limitations to get some of the better ending slides, this can either require some save-scumming or just dealing with the worse ending. But seriously, the AI is extremely sucky against mutants and grenades. They feel like CoD level NPCs where they aren't even trying to fight properly against the enemy.-Graphics. I really don't give half a crap about graphics, but it is definately worth mentioning. Anyway, the ""Complete"" mod would be worthwhile for a second playthrough (or a first if you are particularily pedantic). It nice-inates the graphics while staying mostly true to the game. For better graphics you can try the Misery mod, but of course that changes a ton of stuff. While I have done 1-2 playthroughs with it installed, it adds instability to an already somewhat instable game.Anyway, its a great game that I would totally recommend!(Note: I got this game for free, but simply with my computer a few years back and not for any promotional thing or whatever by the devs. With hindsight, I would buy it at double price in a second)			"

												Such an interesting game. There is so much openness and discovery to this game. It's a rediculously good game. The first person perspective adds a lot to the game. There are things you always have to worry about such as radiation and my biggest enemy and fear.... the emission. You will learn more about them when you play. This game tries to be a rpg,fps, openworld game and has a great deal of horror to it as well. When this game goes nighttime, it REALLY goes nighttime so a flashlight is very necessary. And having these new zombies are very interesting. They aren't your normal zombies, you'll realize that when they start shooting you...In summary, this game is amazing especially with the Misery mod. 10/10 would Pripyat again.			"

												Most people love this game for the extreme atmosphere. It's probably the best example ""post-apocalyptic"" without actually being post-apocalyptic. The STALKER series takes place near and in Pripyat, Ukraine. In this world, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster released a magical and anomalous effect in the surrounding area named ""The Zone"". Outside of The Zone, the world continues as normal, however adventure and fortune seeking individuals smuggle themselves into the Zone to acquire artifacts, anomalous objects that are often used in and outside the zone for their beneficial properties, such as absorbing radiation or regenerating health.I'm sure you can read more about the world of STALKER in another review or on the wiki page. For this game, you're playing as guy sent into the Zone to investigate crashed helicopters. Your can also go on side-quests given to you by various fractions. Some of these quests are time limited once you accept them, so don't pile on a ton like you would in Skyrim.The combat in this game is pretty fun. You're far from a bullet sponge, specially in your basic armor. Firefights with bandits and other humans requires hit-and-run tactics, and taking hits causes blood loss which can be stopped with medkits and bandages. The Zone's monsters range from four-legged beasts that charge at you, zombies that are surprisingly accurate with their firearms, various humanoid creatures that leap long distances or attempt to control the minds of you and people around you.The graphics are dated and the firearm animations are janky; however, this game series has rather productive modding community. Check out hubs like /r/stalker on reddit for lists of popular mods (including the popular MISERY mod that dramatically increases difficulty).One thing to note, this game has more text than dialog. Most of it is optional, but on my first playthrough, I was blindly following map markers, not really knowing why I was doing the things tasked to me. It greatly detracts from the wonderful atmosphere of this game, so make sure to pay attention and read the text.			"

												First off: I played this game for countless hours on CD before buying it on steam.The third of title in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, the game doesn't offer as much freedom as the Shadow of Chernobyl, but is a much more polished and straight-forward title. The story is not as open, there aren't as many factions, but what's there, works far better without mods than it does with its predecessor.It's therefore not a bad idea – if you don't mind a few spoilers – to start your journey into the series with this one. I don't think I need to tell you about the general setting, it's already well explained in the store-page and by other reviews.What I want to tell you about instead, is my personal experience and the memories I've shared with this game:There are few games that are this unsettling on an almost primal level. I was never a fan of the Fallout-esque style of post-apocalypse and neither of stuff like Mad Max. I don't know if it's the eastern European Atmosphere, or the way everything seems so dire, but something in the Stalker series (not writing the proper name anymore – ♥♥♥♥ dots!) just tickles me in the right places.I believe there's really a sense of venture, pioneering into a dark place, that the Stalker series does so well. Coupled with an eastern European attitude towards things (if something works, it works, while the german engineer would get one aneurysm after another) that puts a glimmer of hope across the entire fictious zone. In the deep darkness of it, there's a sense of comfort. Characters may seem opportunistic (most of them are, actually) and you shouldn't trust anyone, but again – somehow I can't help but build a deep feeling of sympathy for each and every one of them.To sum it up: No rose tinted glasses, you'll see visages of monsters, people and even yourself growing accustomed to this harsh world, but everyone is bonded by the sentiment of terror towards the things even worse – the oines you're not able to see.So, travel into the zone, but be warned: It might not stay a venture, but becom a second home.

												The Stalker trilogy grew with time improving in each new chaper more, so this last one receive the benefits from the experience devs gained releasing other 2.The search for manufacts continues and is even more improved the system to find them with ultra modern detectors.The annoying emissions continue even inside this game, but this time the system was improved by devs a lot so that they're no more a problem, i completed the whole game and i never got killed one time by any of them....The improvements are made increasing the number of places you can now hide to take cover, so, wherever you'll be, you'll always find a close cover in the zone near you, you'll no more be forced to 20 miles marathons in 30 seconds like in CS.A new, great and very nice feature of this game are the Achievements, no, not the Steam ones, cause this game has none, but i'm referring to special ingame achievements, and they are not useless, each one will give you ingame various bonus, very useful to survive in the Zone, some of them will help also to make money easier so that you'll no more have that problem too and if you'll play smart you'll be rich already at 1/3 of the game ^^This was probably the first and only Stalker game where i had some real fun and less stress, but at end, with the Gauss Gun in my hands i was really too much overpowered hehe ^^In clonclusion, probably (i repeat, thanks to the experience from first 2) the best chapter of the serie, altough not perfect, but very close to be, recommended to experienced fps players and to everyone who want a challenge but without too much stress.My Final Score is 78 /100  "

Довольно интересный сюжет и колоритные персонажи, возможность апгрейдить оружие и костюмы в полной мере, единственный минус это то что врагов не так много как в Чистом Небе или в Тени Чернобыля, тоесть прикупив себе стоющее оруже и Экзоскелет вам попусту некого будет убивать маленькие локации и отсутствие должного колличества врагов делает ее не такой как предыдущие части, но по сюжету достойно и интересно.8,5/10			"

												A true gem. It's too bad it wasn't released on consoles (although the recoil might of been a little hard to use on a gamepad), otherwise more people would know about, and play these games, for they are truely fantastic. Great combat, where you need to actually take cover to avoid bullets, and guns are enjoyable, although enemies can sometimes feel bullet spongy, and don't really seem like they are being shot. A good open world, sadly not as large as the first two games, but they chose more specific side quests and sub-plots, although it does lack in story, because there isn't really mystery or discovery like the first two, because you know who you are, and your ultimate goal from the start. Although, I liked the ability to get awful endings because you didn't do one side quest in the ending slides, like an entire settlement being killed because you didn't do this one thing. Overall, an amazing game worth the 20$			"

												Welocme to the  Zone. A Post-Apocoliptic hell-on-earth. Radioactive anomalies and crazed mutant creatures. Oh yeah, and the odd bandit raid and zombie attack. Your travel agent is a moron, unless you are Major Degretev ( I just mispelled that), a USS oprative sent in to investiagate a failed operation to the Zone. In which you discover the nature and the sheer disructive power that is the excusion zone around Chyernobl. Gameplay 9/10. A solid method to a well filled nitch, some will find it similar to Fallout exept it is not 100% rediculus, also the artifact hunting is a cornestone of the game in its story and its economy.Graphics 8/10. Good for a game of this type, however I don't recommend cranking the graphics to 10 unless you have a good rig.Story 9/10. It is hard to mix story and  non-linear gameplay, but they did a good job encorpeating it.Realism 2/10. Yes I actually made this a catagory on which I grade. This, like many other FPS games are the same. You can somehow walk out into a hail of bullets in an overcoat and somehow come out on the other side and laugh. Also if any of you have burn yourself on the oven taking something out, that is about 500 degrees F, a fire anomaly here is 1000 degrees C, and you can pitch a tent there for how long you can make it before taking  a decent amount of damage.Another thing to know, none of the weapons in this game have their real names, ex Martha is the name for an M9. Overall a good game which is short on realism and difficulty, which is fine. For anybody that thinks the Zone is too warm and cuddly for you, I deeply recommend the Misery mod. It is a full concept modification that changes and enhances, well every aspect of the game. As far as graphics are concerndmore contrast and darker colors, while taking the definetion up a notch or three. ( Do not attempt a high or even mid graphics if you have a low end rig). And for gameplay and realism. Well I'm not sure if you noticed, but it is called Misery for a reason. Most will spend a few hours on it and rage quit if they do it for their first playthrough, so don't. Get some COP playing on master under your belt before playing. Also, dont do what I did first time round, which is pretend you are still a tank, play this like Ghost Recon (not future soldier) avoid detection and invest in a sniper rifle. This is not for every STALKER but is worth it.			"

												The most polished STALKER game, and unfortunately, probably the last.COP takes the best parts of SOC and Clear Sky and blends them into one game. The storyline features some rpg-esque choices and consequences, many side quests/faction content and a highly improved weapon/suit upgrade system (first introduced in Clear Sky).Graphically, the game's textures and models look quite outdated, but the game makes up for it with superb use of DX11 lighting and shaders. There are also many graphical mods available to improve the quality of the models and textures. On the subject of mods, the game still has a thriving mod community that makes everything from gameplay overhauls to total conversions.Whether you've played the previous STALKER games, or are a fan of RPG/FPS hybrids (or just FPS/RPGs), COP is well worth your time.

												STALKER Call of Pripyat was my first STALKER game and I can't quite say what I think of it. Overall the game was brilliant, despite being a tad bit dated I still enjoyed it nonetheless. It was exciting to start without knowing anything about it and then scavenging for artifacts through anomalies. You do quests for the people and in turn they offer you better deals or money. There's quite a bit of medicines to be used(but I never used them) and there's quite a bit of customization with the weapon and armor mods which allow you to adapt your playstyle. I was however disappointed when I reached Pripyat. The zone is very barren, not much to be done and seen. The whole thing is bugged for me, not letting me finish my game and despite having found loopholes around it, I still can't quite finish it. This one part completely ruined the game for me. The Complete Mod for it also seems to be bugged and has negative reviews. I also noticed no more artifacts spawned in anomalous areas after having left Pripyat and went to Zaton/Yanov. Overall I don't think it's worth 20€ in it's state. It's a good game, but requires fixing.>I'd give it a 7/10(the ending completely ruined it, I'll try to fix it and update the review if possible)>Pros: Customization, plenty of quests that affect the ending, perks/achievements, very good atmosphere, fun to discover how the game works and all it's tricks, spooky ambiance with challenging enemies.>Cons: Graphical bugs, many other bugs which might make you unable to finish the game or quest, lack of content in the end-game, my artifacts didn't respawn after emissions nor did I have any use for most medicines in the game as all of it was trivial(running through anomalies and healing up afterwards proved to be easier)			"

												The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series is one of, if not my most, favourite game series.The games all have a unique and really cool theme to them, the post-apocalyptic zone around the Chernobyl powerplant. The atmosphere from these games is something alot of games struggle to do as well as this series, and Call of Pripyat is yet another wonderful extension to it.Whilst the game is old and does show it age, with some rough edges here and there, it is the most refined out of all the games. The Russian/Ukrainian audio and dialouge is really authentic, and will have you really immersed. This game brings a sense of dread, wonder, fear, and curiosity like no other. The weather system is really well done, with everything from sunshine, rain, storms, and even nuclear emissions. Ammo, armour, and weapons are scarce, and so are other supplies. This game will not hold your hand, so first timers may find it difficult for awhile, but it's definately worth pushing through.One downside is the story element. Not that the story is bad or anything, but it can be easily overlooked and forgotten as it's not really in your face for most of the game. First time players will probably not understand anything, but if you are interested I highly recommened playing the older games, even if they are quite rough around the edges.All in all, fantastic game. Highly recommend to people looking for something different than usual.			"

												The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is one that scratches an itch that many people weren't aware they had, that of a story-based first-person shooter that doesn't skimp on the aspects of character improvement. To be fair, its narrative lacks the strength of an epic such as Half Life, but it makes up for it by presenting a plausible pseudo-scifi flair that doesn't require too much imagination to comprehend. The long and short of it is that, in the area around the Chernobyl catastrophe (known as the ""Zone""), radioactive influence has caused the birth of a number of strange anomalies, both helpful and harmful. The former come from 'artifacts', mysterious objects possessing helpful properties like increasing the body's ability to heal, and the latter is in the form of arcane occurrences such as areas where gravity is magnified to a fatal extent, or even things as run-of-the-mill as your typical postapocalyptic creatures seeking to kill you.What sets the STALKER franchise apart is the emphasis on the balance between the fictional nightmares of the Zone and the interactions with other people just like you -- fortune-seekers trying to locate artifacts for their value in the world at large, while avoiding the pitfalls of anomalies and mutants. While these other Stalkers may not be perfectly represented as flesh-and-blood people, it is entirely possible, within the scope of the games, to make alliances with one faction (say, the Bandits who seek fortune for themselves at the expense of others), which would then make others view you as an enemy.Call of Pripyat is itself the latest (five years old, mind you) expression of the series, bringing together Shadow of Chernobyl (the first game)'s narrative coherence with Clear Sky (the second, oft-panned game)'s factional warfare and open-ended nature. In CoP, you find yourself in an open world, with 3 main maps available to get your Stalker on. There is a centralized story to follow, involving your character as a special operative for the Russian government attempting to track down the cause of the crashes of an entire squad of other operatives, as if flying over the anomaly-filled Zone wasn't reason enough. But within that overall framework, you are free to either maintain your military nature and focus entirely on the mission, or you can go off and become a Stalker yourself, searching for artifacts and misplaced caches of military gear.As far as the story goes, it's a pretty linear progression. Each map has a list of things for you to accomplish in the story's progression, and at the end of those things it opens up the way to the next map. It serves a function of allowing you to explore each area, without losing track of the bigger picture always lurking just beneath the surface (unlike other open-world games where you can never complete the 'main quest' and still explore the entirety of the world). This hampers the game somewhat, though, as you as a player may feel railroaded into performing some things just for the sake of progression, even if you want more time to just float around the world.The real appeal of CoP comes from exploration. Sure, each map is, in the end, just a collection of a dozen or so ""points of interest"", each of which corresponds to a specific scenario -- here is a building that you can explore, there is a field full of Boiler anomalies that superheat the air, and so forth. But in your first playthrough, at least, exploring each of these locations feels deep enough that it feels like you're really blazing new trails into the mysterious and dangerous Zone.As far as character progression goes, there aren't any RPG aspects insofar as levels and skills -- no stat distribution screens here. Instead, a fluid progression system emerges from acquiring and upgrading new gear. And while there are certainly high and low ends of the spectrum for both weapons and armor, an interesting upgrade system performed by a mechanic NPC means that even a beginning-of-the-game weapon can perform adequately to let you handle the toughest of mutants and the most heavily-armed NPCs. The real limiting factor is money -- but, as you get more money and/or loot to sell as you do more things in the world, it functions as a sort of experience system, where getting enough money lets you buy a new suit of armor, or perhaps a few upgrades to the suit you already have that increases its survivability in radioactive environments.Moving on to artifacts: As explained earlier, artifacts are mysterious (there's that word again) objects possessing unique abilities that, more often than not, are helpful to your character. This comes at a cost, though, as many artifacts are still inherently radioactive (represented by a +# representation, based on the radioactivity), and will cause you harm if you use them for too long. Their use is through their placement in an ""artifact pouch"", wherein their effects -- both positive and negative -- will be able to affect you. Or you can always just carry them in your backpack, where they can't hurt you, but can't help you either. And thus a balance has to be struck between using artifacts that help you in the near future -- mental protection as you're about to fight telepathic mutants, for example -- and either bearing the radioactivity, using your precious anti-rad meds as a stopgap measure, or using one of the slightly-rarer anti-radioactivity artifacts (which have -# in the radioactivity measurement), the lattermost of which can negate the other artifacts, and even give you a baseline radioactivity resistance.With that, I come to the final point, which is the plethora of in-game stats that the player has to take into effect. There are eight, each with their own means of being inflicted and being protected against or healed. Roughly speaking, these stats and a brief summary are:1.) Impact -- The effect (damage and flinching) of gravitational effects (anomalies or stuff being thrown at you telekinetically), or being smacked around by mutants with physical attacks2.) Wounding/Bleeding -- Slow health loss through cuts, bullet wounds, etc.3.) Explosion -- Self-explanatory4.) Firearms -- The effect (damage and flinching) of gunfire5.) Burn -- The damage of thermal effects (fires, thermal anomalies, etc.)6.) Chemical -- The damage of chemical hazards (typically anomalies)7.) Electric -- The damage of electrical anomalies8.) Radiation -- The damage and effect (screen blurring, stamina drain, etc.) of radioactive objects and anomalies9.) Psy/Mental -- The damage and effect of mental attacks (almost exclusively by psychic mutants)As you can see, there are many stats to be concerned with, but they fall into two general categories -- combat and environment. For the most part, environmental resistances are only momentary concerns based on the current situation -- no need to worry about Burn resistance unless you're going into a field of hot anomalies -- wheareas the combat stats are all-round necessities. The trick is to balance finding armor with the stats you need (with upgrades providing some measure of balance for stats they lack), artifacts that will resist what you're about to do in the immediate future, and using on-demand items that temporarily boost resistances.In the end, the Zone is worth at least one solid playthrough, even if in doing so you explore every point of interest, locate one of every artifact, and collect every piece of gear possible. An emergent mod community has also put together mods doing everything from merely adding a handful of gear to be found, to some introducing entire new zones imported from the previous games. In the end, I would conclude that S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is worth playing, if for no other reason than to demonstrate that an FPS can have a non-setpiece story, and some aspect of RPGs, without losing part of itself in the process.

												After 53.5 hours of playing this game I finally finished it WITH the MISERY mod. I am in love with the STALKER series! I have not finished the two first games, Shadow of Chernobyl and Clear Sky due to annoying bugs, and of course these bugs had to happend at the end right before you go to Chernobyl NPP.... But I learned what happend there from the wiki.In Call of Pripyat, you play as the USS Agent Alexander Degtyarev/Major Degtyarev. You have been sent to The Zone undercover to investigate why Operation Fairway failed and what happened to the crew and helicopters. On the way you will meet Stalkers, Mutants, Anomalies and Radiation. Nothing will stop you because you have the power to quicksave! Seriously... quicksave is very important in this game.Haven't played much of the Vanilla game since it looks like ♥♥♥♥. Have tried out the Complete and MISERY mod. Never finished the story in the Complete mod but I came to the city, Pripyat. The Complete mod is for those who wants a STALKER game with less bugs and better graphics.  Misery is a very difficult mod that adds more realism and better grapichs to STALKER CoP. It's more about survival, and the start can be very tough if you have not played any STALKER games before.I HIGHLY recommend you to play STALKER with some kind of graphical mod.Pros and ConsPros-Good gameplay-Best atmosphere-Scary-Survival (Misery mod)-Good story (play the two first games and you will understand more)-Quicksave F5Cons-Bad grapichs (Vanilla)-Annoying bugs (Vanilla and mods)I will recommend this game for gamers who likes RPG, Survival and Action.

 S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat  The third and worst game in the series of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but still good in my opinion. Why? Therefore, the game is still on the old and unstable engine. In this installment we go back again to ZONA so that from the other side. The story focuses on the discovery of the causes of the failure of Operation Fairway, organized by the government to investigate the dangerous area. The main character is an agent of the Ukrainian Protection Agency, Alexander Degtyarev, which aims to investigate the cause of the failure of that secret mission. During the game, we visit three new huge areas but we won't return to already familiar areas from previous games. The game still has an amazing atmosphere, however is shorterthan previous stalkers and the story is average. Although the game can still be modified. The game almost not change at all but it's still a good production but I would recommend it to anyone who like postapo games.  "

												The game is great. Let's just start with that. I was looking for some style of survival with guns. Which is, most survivals I guess?You'll want to get some mods on the game, as it is older and buggy. Pripyat Complete for playing the game fairly normally, but, with some improvments. Or,The Misery mod which adds a buttload of items and things you can do, however, makes the game a hell of the lot harder, so you're better off playing throught the game once first.I played this in around 2 sittings.

												Honest Review below:So I just finished this game after I finished the SoC. First of, at the beginning of CoP I was dissapointed because some of the elements which made stalker games were missing, it was kinda hard to figure it out how the things and quests work, boring beggining of the game. It felt more like a full quest game like fallout 3 (my opinion). But when I've spent 3-4 hours into this cheeki game, I found it pretty breeki. *Interesting story excluding the very beginning*Decent quest system*Bunch of new features to the stalker seriesSo I rate this one 8/10 Gopniks			"

												This is an excellent game that doesn't get much attention, unfortunatelly. The atmosphere of it is excellent and so is the gameplay. It flaws only at the cheesy cutscene dialogues. Also, after beating this game once I deffinitely reccomend that you get a mod for it called MISERY. It brings an enormous realism to the game and makes the Zone the true nightmare that it was meant to be. Having to fend off 4 bandits (which now attack you on sight) with a corroded Makarov and only a few rounds is not for the weak. Take the Dark Road Beggining if you want to be a true STALKER. MISERY is regarded as one of the most difficult mods of all times. Somehow, you'll also get addicted to some russian music, even thought you can't understand a word of what they are saying.			"

												Okay, let me start this off by saying I highly prefer SoC over CoP. The reason being is quite simple:In Shadows of Chernobyl, you are a Stalker trying to make their way through the Zone with a simple task: To kill Strelok. If you want to, you can completely ignore the story and just carve out your own path doing Stalker-like things. On top of that, the Zone herself is fairly dangerous and desolate, and in an odd way, fairly beautiful as a result. However, in Call of Pripyat, you're no Stalker. You're military. You know, those guys forcing Loners to pay just to pass through Cordon without getting shot. You're -pretending- to be a Stalker just so you can safely find out what happened to some downed helicopters, and that honestly ruined the experience for me right off the bat.I really tried to like this game since it's still a S.T.A.L.K.E.R title, but that one little fact really soured the milk. Maybe I'm being petty, but after fighting against the military and seeing my fellow Loners get gunned down, I can't just switch sides. Especially since I prefer to role play while spending a few hours in this setting. And yet, here I am giving this game a positive recommendation, and that's all due to mods.I've tried Misery, and as much as I loved how it made the game considerably harder, I got the feeling attempting my first playthrough this way was a mistake, so I'm back to vanilla for now. However, not too long ago I learned of Call of Chernobyl, and holy hell did that save this game for me. Add to it the add-ons from DoctorX (Questline, Faction Relations, and Dynamic Faction Relations), and I'm now going through what I had hoped this game would have been. I'm a Stalker again. I'm a Loner. My motives are my own, and I do what I must to survive. That is why CoP still gets a recommendation from me....Oh, and speaking of CoC, I'm currently in a playthrough in which Duty and Freedom have declared an alliance.			"

												Previous games : STALKER Chernobyl and Clear Sky.I played both many many years ago.Game style : slow pace shooter meets RPG in open world environment   *A little bit of RPG.....,talk to persons, encumberance, buy and sell goods, upgrade your weapons and armor,    tweak your characteristics with artefacts, get missions by approaching NPCs   *Shooter : pistol, shot gun, sniper, grenades, rocket launcher, take cover, aim for the head   *Slow pace : most of the time you will spend on moving from one place to anotherDifficulty : played on Veteran which is recommendable as long as you take cover.Story line : Although the universe you are in is derived from a book serie, the story line of the game is poor and paper thin, like shooters mostly do.Dialogues : Short and necessary to pick up missions. Missions are not always that clear.Combat system (8/10) : shoot, throw, stab and hide in cover.bleed, use bandage or use artifactloose healing points, use med kit or artifactAtmosphere (9/10): unique setting, always the feeling of being in danger, playing during night time brings on the most joy / thrillGraphics (8/10) :ok, game is 7 yrs old but looks still fine to me. I played Crysis 3 just before this oneand was not shocked (even when standing in an electricity anomaly). Played Pripyat on the highest settingsMusic (10/10) :It's atmospheric and blends very well during gaming, not to mention the additional sound of lightening,barking dogs, howling wolfs, crows, mourning zombies.Difficulty :play at least on veteran level, difficulty can always be changed during course of the game,Bugs :this version is bug freeHello, anyone there ? : Two places, the Jupiter factory and the zone Pripyat are underdeveloped.It's just me, myself and I.To play or not to play  :If you played Chernobyl and Clear sky before, it will feel more of the sameIf you never played STALKER, go for it if you do not mind that pace is slow I hope to see a STALKER 3 in near future and some more budget to get it on a higher level			"

												Love it.Tips for Misery noobs:1. Always survey the area before making your move2. Rushing in guns blazing is never a good idea3. Conserve ammo4. Think before you leap5. Use grenades6. Keep moving**7. BATTERIES!8. Buy things in this order in terms of priority     Equipment>Weapons>Ammo*>Armor>Mods>Food*   * - You should loot these primarily, buy only if needed   **  - The AI are Olympic grenade throwers for some reason    Despite being old, this is an overall fun and enjoyable game for survival horror and FPS fans alike although it leans towards FPS and strays from the survivor horror aspect a little bit. For first time players of this game i heavily reccomend playing on Master off the bat, seriously Easy is just a poorly balanced FPS where you swim in guns and money.     While for intermediate users who prefer a challenge, you should try the MISERY mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat.It's literally Dark Souls in Chernobyl as it takes every aspect of the game and makes it significantly harder and also adds some new elements to make it even more unforgiving, For true STALKERS only.My Evaluation.Pros - Little Handholding - Do things at your own pace - Combat is not too easy or too hard - Survival elements and equipment management does not feel like a choreCons - English voice acting is horrible, russian vocals with english subs is better - Money comes by too easily* - some areas are disappointingly easy* - Radiation is redundant and pointless** - Misery Mod fixes thisI have 200+ hours on this game at least, i own a CD and this on steam.Happy hunting stalker!

												Unbelievably much much better than the predecessors, this is like the STALKER game you always wanted. It has this certain 'final touch' that all the others lacked and so you'd constantly get stuck or screw yourself over, this one is more easy and smoothly to play, while it also has the very immersive and realistic landscape of Tchernobyl, with better implemented enemies such as even creepier mutants, zombies and the works that was missing before.. At times I was too scared to go on, and coming from me, that says something. It should be noted that it is also extremely crash-happy still, so make sure to save often. It really encourages exploration and actually leaves it up to the player to how much time they really want to invest in it, and it rewards that. Very neat design.			"

												The last part of the post-apo FPS survival trilogy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Maj. Alexander Degtyarev is sent to the Zone as USS agent to examine what was behind crashed helicopter group SCAT. Game has three locations: Zaton, Jupiter and Pripyat outskirts (actually you need to use a guide to move from one to another). Arsenal isn't small. In this game is various count of different enemies, anomalies and mutants. You can choose between factions with many sidequests.Sadly GSC game world discontinued plans for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 back in 2012.MODS: I'd recommend one mods for this game so here we go:MISERY: Hardcore mod. Brings new items alike food, medical things, suits and new weapons.New graphics, everything is retextured in HD, weather is overhauled to make better atmosphere and feel from playing.Within new mechanics is included field cooking. Yeah! You can cook your hunted mutants on fuel or wooden stove.As I mentioned before this is really a hardcore mod so prepare for better AI's aim, higher prices and deadlier radiation. Good Hunting, Stalker...  "

												Probably my favorite FPS series. There is just so much going on and the world does not care about you. Everything feels alive, and I mean that every creature has a plan. Dogs will distract you to flank you. Snorks will lure you into ambushes. Blood suckers will deftly avoid your bullets and make you regret being born.The mod community for this is incredible as well, with overhauls still being released.			"

												If survival FPS is what you are looking for then look no further. I started the series with Shadow of Chernobyl, which I highly recommend to play first. Even though the two stories arent strictly linked, the game and atmosphere feels alot more developed once you play through SoC. If you decide to jump into Call of Pripyat anyways then once you get past the steep learning curve youll find yourself in a pretty large world without much indication of what to do. Basically all you need to know is that everything is out to kill you and unless youre 10+ hours into the game, everything will kill you without even giving you a chance. Hitting that F5 button is a must every 2 minutes because you can and you will die every 2 minutes in your first playthrough. Getting money to buy better gear is a must and doing the side missions just happen as you go along. Once you find yourself being able to kill bandits and small fry mutants, then you are in a position to actually start the main story and continue the game as intended.Pros of this game is that the atmosphere in this is unmatched by any game ive played since its release up to the time of this review. The gun physics is amazing as the bullets are physical objects and shooting just doesnt get any more satisfying than this, that I can garuantee. The survival elements of this game are really harsh at first but once you get mid range equipment, you should be able to get a reasonable income for items and such to keep you going. End game is mainly about exploring and the survival elements are very minimal as youre probably pretty rich by then and the stores always have enough supply. Cons are that even though the game is open world with alot of varying activities, I have to say that to me the main story felt no different than doing a very long series of side missions. Theres also the fact that once you reach a certain point in the game, the atmosphere changes from survival to just completing missions and loses alot of its immersion (IMO). On the plus side again though there is a HUGE amount of mods available for this game and trying them out gives you a new experience every time. "

												Awesome game, even better with Misery 2.1 mods but in my opinion don't switch to the mod before you have mastered the vanilla game, you'll learn a few helpful tricks. But after 100 hours of vanilla gameplay i graduated to the mod and Have been accumalating more hours ever since. And after 330 hours i finally got a mod that enabled me to spawn whatever i wanted and that aloud (I apologize for ♥♥♥♥ spelling been up for 26 hours streaming) me to see what i was missing and havent seen yet, which as it turned out plenty and that increased the longevity by around another fifty hours. So i hope you found this somewhat helpful and a interesting short read(even though I know you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything i say, you're probably just lost and looking for some free already paid for netflix accounts).

												Last of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, still the bestAs you play troughout in the Zone you will feel that creepy atmosphere, because you never know where friends are camping, or an bloodsucker is lurking.Weapon, armor and helmet upgrade and repairsystem is the best of all, weapons have realistic damage, AP ammo is really good agains armor, as it should be at any game.Enemy AI is really advanced since the Clear sky, for example: Bloodsuckers now dont approach you when cloacked, as they try to flank you and get their tentacles around your neck and suck your blood from your body.Stash system is good too, as you need medkits, ammo, armor, weapons, helmets and drugs troughout the game.The only thing matters me in this game, that you cant make own stashes, but that will be fixed in the Misery 2.0 mod.Buy this game if you like scary survival with mysterious missions.PS: the emissions are really something, as you try to run to cover you have to move fast, if enemy is infront of you you just have to run for your life, or the Zone takes your life.

												Call of Pripyat is what Clear Sky should have been. Here, the game finally offers a completely new map with new places to visit and NPCs to interact with. Also, it continues the story of the first Stalker game. You, as a stalker and agent, investigate why several helicopters crashed during their mission which aimed to scout the area so that the military could find out how exactly the Zone had changed after the events of the first game.This seems to be the most stable of all the Stalker games and it should also be noted that the only one offering you to stay once the main story is completed. It was annoying in the previous two games that I was not exactly notified that once the journey to the centre of the Zone started all my side missions would remain incomplete. Here, at the end of the game, you can make a decision to stay and complete any unfinished quests you had or explore any undiscovered areas. Also, this Stalker game seems to be the only one that rarely had any crashes when I was playing it - it is a stable version where you encounter few glitches or bugs. This is of course all the feedback on the vanilla game as the COMPLETE mod was also released for this version further enhancing the Stalker experience. Still, it is commendable that GSC Game World put enough time and effort to release a functional game that was enjoyable without having to wait for further patches on the date of release.Call of Pripyat should be picked up by those who liked Shadow of Chernobyl. Do skip Clear Sky and pick this one in its stead. After installing the game install the COMPLETE mod to have the best Stalker experience to date.			"

												Самая лучшая и комплексная часть. Объединяет все лучшее из двух предыдущих. Я три раза начинал игру заново, чтобы попробовать другой путь прохождения. А когда начал играть, спустя 3-4 часа, понял, что я совсем не продвинулся по главному заданию, а все время изучал мир и выполнял второстепенные. :) Мы играем за майора Дегтерева, которому поручают расследовать мистическое крушение военных вертолетов. В итоге, нам, по ходу игры, доступны три большие локации с открытым миром, это Затон, Окрестности завода ""Юпитер"" и Припять. И еще куча квестовых линий за разные группировки. В игре очень классно сделали разделение мира на группировки, но, при этом, есть нейтральные зоны, где уживаются все и можно со всеми поговорить.Я не хардкорный сталкер :)) А просто люблю изучать мир, исследовать все, поэтому в последнее свое прохождение немного отредактировал конфиг actor.ltx, чтобы дать ГГ двойное время бега (в игре огромный мир и большую часть времени приходится бегать, поэтому не люблю то, что персонаж быстро устает) и двойную переносимость (очень часто случайно подбираешь ружья с трупов и инвентарь захламляется, и бывает, что перевес случается совсем не вовремя...) В итоге, я получил лучшее удовольствие от этой части и может пройду ее еще раз на большей сложности. :)Моя оценка: ОТЛИЧНО. В игре практически нет минусов, все сделано очень качественно и детально.

												More mutant mayhemThe story in CoP takes up where SoC left off (although you play as a different character) so it seems fitting that I played the games in that order, missing out Clear Sky (for now). As with SoC, this is quite a tough game (no hand-holding here), although it didn’t seem quite as tough as the original. It’s also a good deal shorter, with the main storyline taking about 15 hours to complete (there are, of course, a fair few side quests, but I didn’t complete all of them). The graphics are an improvement over the original, especially if you use some of the mods available. It’s also less buggy. The voice acting is okay, if a little variable, as are the character animations. This is, in many ways, a straightforward continuation of what has gone before, and the impressive STALKER atmosphere is maintained along with the challenging gameplay. Despite the improvements, however, there is less diversity in the environments compared to those found in SoC, and the world is less expansive than it is in SoC. And the story, although more coherent, is somewhat lighter. But this is still an immersive and enjoyable game to play. 3.5/5			"

												And now, the final part of the stalker revisions...Call of Pripyat. To remind my readers, this is now based on the vanilla experience, as this will conclude the 3 stalker games' revisions. What can i say about this game? Was it fun? Yes. Was it more sandbox-y than Clear Sky? Yes. Did it feel empty and hollow? You bet. For all the mechanics that the developers improved upon they possibly refined a little too much, to the point that the streamlined gameplay somehow made the game easier. This is Stalker we are talking about here. It's not supposed to be easy.....is it? Even on Master skill this game was easier than Clear Sky or Shadow of Chernobyl on Stalker (Medium) skill. The developers improved the upgrade mechanic, to where you no longer need to fetch flash drives and bring them to the respective mechanics. Instead, you're left with finding tools in each of the first 2 maps to bring to the mechanics, and then have to travel to Pripyat to find the last of the tools. Not quite as tedious to some, but still requires you to do some work. The graphics in my opinion took a step in the wrong direction. While the lighting may have improved a little with the DirectX 11 renderer, most of everything else seemed like it was ripped from SoC in terms of quality. Maybe this had to do with the larger, albeit fewer, maps. Honestly, i really couldn't tell much of a difference at all between DX 9 and 11, aside from a little improved lighting. The characters still have the same facial animations, reload animations, etc....The sound was vastly improved,and while the sound effects still aren't of a caliber as say Battlefield, they do the job. Now, when the emissions hit, however, the sound design improves because it brings back the creepy vibe of SoC. When i first loaded the game up and experienced my first emission, just the sound of the storm brewing and approaching was haunting. I was running for cover as if I PERSONALLY was going to die. The gameplay mechanics stay intact from the other 2 games, except your character feels too much like a bullet sponge. Enemies go down rather quickly, yet, you can take several shots without too much worry, as long as you have a relatively good armor suit. The emissions respawn artifacts, allowing you to continue artifact hunting in anomalies you already cleared. However, this brings more money to you. Sell the artifacts, make a bunch of money, buy an exoskeleton suit in the first map......wait...what? That's right, you can buy an exo suit from Nimble very quickly in this game if you have the funds for it. Not really that difficult to have the funds for it with the abundance of artifacts and the side objectives having a wealthy payout. Now, i know that some gamers would say, ""then don't buy the exo suit."" Not the point. The point is, as i stated in my review for Clear Sky, what made that game so well constructed was the pacing and balance. By Nimble giving you access to an exo suit and top notch weaponry from the get-go, it ruins the pacing of the game. Some gamers may enjoy this, sure, but in a franchise that prides itself on being difficult, is this the stalker way? Is it right to have access to this equipment so soon? Ask yourself that question when you approach Nimble when you first reach the ship in Zaton....Hunger has returned, giving one of the immersive factors of SoC back. Not only that, if you find yourself hungry, it affects how quickly your stamina drains while running. Keep the food flowing to keep that stamina up. Weapons also seem to degrade very rapidly here, even when upgraded for reliability. This rubbed me the wrong way here only because it's like a false difficulty. Now, the first 2 stalkers games felt like sandbox games, but were still somewhat restricted. This game is more sandbox then the first 2 combined, yet was substantially shorter. A completionist run on Master can be completed in around 15 hours, really depending on how much artifact hunting you do. While Zaton and Jupiter (first 2 maps) had interesting designs, the new Pripyat map was where the game had the potential to REALLY shine. This sprawling city with numerous buildings that you had access to, and underground tunnels, unfortunately felt amazingly empty. You had a selection of primary objectives to do, and very few side objectives, but unfortunately, that's about it. There were only a handful of anomalies to find artifacts, and just no real reason to venture around the city. The best part of Pripyat if you ask me was the underground lab. Very creepy, claustrophobic, and dangerous....reminds me of the labs in SoC. Then, the game just kind of ends on a very unfulfilling final mission.....(NOT SPOILING).Last bit of the gameplay that many people enjoyed, but not me because of the ruining of the pace.....STASHES. Many gamers were not satisfied with the stash mechanic in the first 2 games, where you couldn't access the contents of a stash until you received the coordinates for it from a dead body. In CoP, you have access to the contents of EVERY stash in the game by default. You get some coordinates for the available stashes by completing some side objectives, but some of the stashes include very powerful weapons, food, medkits, etc. Again, while you don't actually HAVE TO access the stashes, it's just another con with the pacing and balance of the game. In SoC and CS you had to get your hands dirty to find the coordinates for the stashes, and even if you did get coordinates, they were totally randomized. If you've played the game enough to know what each stash contained in SoC, you would fight enemies until you got the coordinates for that ONE STASH you really needed. Nothing good comes easy. Gotta work for it, unlike CoP which just hands it to you. I still would recommend this game because, as i stated in my CS review, the Stalker lore grabs ahold of you. The modding community also made quite possibly the most popular Stalker mod of all 3 games for CoP...Misery. Even if this game is easier than the others, i would still highly recommend you play this vanilla first...on Master skill only. If it's too easy, try Misery. Happy hunting Stalker.7.3/10			"

												Stalker has been considered by many a post-apocalyptic first person shooter game. But it isn't, your in a Cordon zone of the Chernobyl area that has been abandon since April of 1986 due to NPP4 catastrophic failure rendering the environment hazardous to live in. Yes, the place dose exists for real, all locations are based on real locations in the real zone. Life is still going on everyday for the people out side of the zone. The Stalker game series is inspired off the book ""Roadside Picnic"", which is a short science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky in 1971. More information on this book is available on a wiki, and the book is also available in English now.  The game is a open world exploration as well as mission directive, Remember that.Call Of Pripyat is the final game of the Stalker series, it is like a advance version of Shadow Of Chernobyl. It is less buggy and very mod friendly at that. You still in the cordon off zone like a prison, but up far north just out side of Pripyat. The game developers did a very good job of brings the real locations to life in the game, I even saw a over head veiw pic of Pripyat and recognized all the locations there. There is trading with traders, and the different factions. Many dangerous anomalies to contend with, and artifact to collect and sell for money. Have to watch out for the areas that are radioactive still. One of the things to remember is question everyone and trust no one. Being skeptical with a gut feeling at times is better than a fire fight, When in this game it is important. At the end of this game you can decide to leave the zone which ends the game completely, or stay and live in it for a while. Go back to Jupiter or Zanton, take care of unfinished business if you wish.			"

												Do NOT pay attention to how much time I have on steam. I have played this game before I had steam and I must say, this game is probably one of the best games I've ever played when it comes to atmosphere. It's a hands down, must play, for anyone beginning PC gaming! Also it is best played with the Complete Mod (it's hard not to, but there is a cheat menu in the mod, try not to use it). The mod makes the game more of a challenge, and ups the sounds and graphics! Again, a must play, so stop reading this and play the game already!			"

												The best game out of a series of atmospheric shooters that has raised the stakes when it comes to a developer adopting a ""look and feel"" of a time or place. I bought this game before it was availible on steam and have found myself continuing coming back to it. It does not have the best shooting mechanics, animations, and at times it can be a little glitchy. But it makes up for it with an impressive amout of monster design, interesting lore base, and unbeatable atmosphere for a shooter. Highly recommened to fans of shooters and all things creepy.			"

												This game, as well as it's predecessors, is one of the best games I have EVER played. While there are some bugs and the graphics, as well as animations for the characters, are a bit derpy the games story still shines through. In my humble opinion, if you like post-apocalyptic first person shooters with an Open-World and RPG elements, then you will absolutely adore this game! And if you love a game with a good story then you should play the entire S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series because it will most likely blow you away. It's a damn fine game and I'd recommend it to almost everyone!			"

												A fantastic open-world post apocalyptic RPG with potentially infinite gameplay and an overworld that never ceases giving the player a sense of adventure. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who wants an RPG (literally) that portrays all the best that the STALKER series has to offer.Personally, I recommend you install the latest ""Misery"" mod to give the STALKER a much more terrifying and challenging element. It will kick your ♥♥♥ at first, but as you learn to play it, you'll find that living in the zone might just become your 'second life'.All hail ukrainian life simulator 2009 and CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE!!!

												I was introduced to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series with Call of Pripyat and then later went back and played the first and second games.

A fantastic game that only gets better with mods.

												10/10If, before playing the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, I had described in detail my perfect gaming experience, I doubt I'd have arrived at anything close to Call of Pripyat. Sometimes things fill a gap we never knew we had. Like Pascal's ""God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person"", there was a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-shaped hole in my Steam catalogue. Shadow of Chernobyl, the first game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, is often (and rightly) touted as a flawed but ground-breaking masterpiece. The second, Clear Skies, is all too often disregarded. Call of Pripyat, IMHO, is one of those rare instances when the third in a trilogy improves on what has come before. Some have pointed to a superior story in Shadow of Chernobyl, and this is a natural impression given by the novelty of the first in a series. The burdens heaped on the difficult third of the trilogy's shoulders (following an already classic first and an almost universally panned second) were daunting. That it can stand alone as a masterpiece, and take pride of place in the trilogy that birthed it, is truly impressive.The sandbox, free-roaming FPS skeleton of the game is all but flawless. Gone are the irritating and frequent zone-transitions of the first two games - the map is divided into three instanced zones, but within those zones the travel is seamless. It is a rich and believable world, but you will require a fast CPU and/or installing game on an SSD to avoid micro-pauses every so often as you move through the map. Mob AI is vastly improved upon, and, despite all three games in the series using the same ""X-Ray"" engine, CoP's graphics are an improvement beyond what could be expected. Call of Pripyat's cast of weapons and armors are as loveable, believable, and as almost-touchable as the characters. Weapons are almost all faithful renditions of the NATO and Warsaw Pact arsenals, with nods and developments to the alternate history STALKER narrates. No min/max table lurks behind the equipment; no backwards-engineered dps spreadsheet. Instead, a well-balanced cast of items, with pros and cons emerging naturally from the real-world items they reproduce.Like the two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games that preced it, Call of Pripyat mods extremely well. The modding community has developed a catalogue of astounding size, quality and diversity. As is usual for a well-modded game, some mods almost inarguably improve on the game, some add extra content, while a few simply break the experience. I recommend playing through without mods first. After gauging the experience, I recommend either MISERY, a massive and thorough reworking of the game; or if you prefer to retain the gameplay and difficulty of the vanilla game while improving on the graphics, a combination of mods such as Atmosfear, Absolute Nature and Absolute structures, and Particle Paradise will yield excellent returns. Although the ""Complete"" mods are sound for the first two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, I cannot recommend the CoP Complete Mod. It significantly dumbs-down the combat, while implementing graphical tweaks either similar or inferior to those previously mentioned.			"

												I was introduced to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series with Call of Pripyat and then later went back and played the first and second games. I found that the Call of Pripyat and it's in game mechanics are so addictive and there is so much replay value that I can't even tell you what playthrough number I'm up to now. A fantastic game that only gets better with mods. I admit that the game is rough around the edges, a number of bugs here and there and odd errors that can come up every now and then but if you have a mild to wild system you shouldn't have any dramas. I strongly suggest the Arsenal Overhaul mod, paired with Atmosfear and Absolute Nature. This game I always end up coming back to, when I dont know what else to play, I end up playing this, the only game worthy of a Desktop Shortcut on my PC. 10/10			"

												A fantastic open-world post apocalyptic RPG with potentially infinite gameplay and an overworld that never ceases giving the player a sense of adventure. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who wants an RPG (literally) that portrays all the best that the STALKER series has to offer.Personally, I recommend you install the latest ""Misery"" mod to give the STALKER a much more terrifying and challenging element. It will kick your ♥♥♥ at first, but as you learn to play it, you'll find that living in the zone might just become your 'second life'.All hail ukrainian life simulator 2009 and CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE!!!

												This game makes me feel uncomfortable because it reminds me of the years I had lived under illegal Sovjiet annexation. However, it is a fun game even though it is essentially the original game shipped with a bunch of user created mods. If you are tired of the original game then this would be a good purchase.			"

												10/10If, before playing the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, I had described in detail my perfect gaming experience, I doubt I'd have arrived at anything close to Call of Pripyat. Sometimes things fill a gap we never knew we had. Like Pascal's ""God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person"", there was a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-shaped hole in my Steam catalogue. Shadow of Chernobyl, the first game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, is often (and rightly) touted as a flawed but ground-breaking masterpiece. The second, Clear Skies, is all too often disregarded. Call of Pripyat, IMHO, is one of those rare instances when the third in a trilogy improves on what has come before. Some have pointed to a superior story in Shadow of Chernobyl, and this is a natural impression given by the novelty of the first in a series. The burdens heaped on the difficult third of the trilogy's shoulders (following an already classic first and an almost universally panned second) were daunting. That it can stand alone as a masterpiece, and take pride of place in the trilogy that birthed it, is truly impressive.The sandbox, free-roaming FPS skeleton of the game is all but flawless. Gone are the irritating and frequent zone-transitions of the first two games - the map is divided into three instanced zones, but within those zones the travel is seamless. It is a rich and believable world, but you will require a fast CPU and/or installing game on an SSD to avoid micro-pauses every so often as you move through the map. Mob AI is vastly improved upon, and, despite all three games in the series using the same ""X-Ray"" engine, CoP's graphics are an improvement beyond what could be expected. Call of Pripyat's cast of weapons and armors are as loveable, believable, and as almost-touchable as the characters. Weapons are almost all faithful renditions of the NATO and Warsaw Pact arsenals, with nods and developments to the alternate history STALKER narrates. No min/max table lurks behind the equipment; no backwards-engineered dps spreadsheet. Instead, a well-balanced cast of items, with pros and cons emerging naturally from the real-world items they reproduce.Like the two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games that preced it, Call of Pripyat mods extremely well. The modding community has developed a catalogue of astounding size, quality and diversity. As is usual for a well-modded game, some mods almost inarguably improve on the game, some add extra content, while a few simply break the experience. I recommend playing through without mods first. After gauging the experience, I recommend either MISERY, a massive and thorough reworking of the game; or if you prefer to retain the gameplay and difficulty of the vanilla game while improving on the graphics, a combination of mods such as Atmosfear, Absolute Nature and Absolute structures, and Particle Paradise will yield excellent returns. Although the ""Complete"" mods are sound for the first two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, I cannot recommend the CoP Complete Mod. It significantly dumbs-down the combat, while implementing graphical tweaks either similar or inferior to those previously mentioned.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat like the rest of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series, is a cross between the fps and rpg genres. It takes place in Chernobyl Ukraine after a second disaster which unleashes all kinds of horrific crap into the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Now i will say that the story is kind of lackluster, and the game it's self can be rather punishing for a new player, but once you get the hang of it the game offers a good balance between making you feel like the god of the apocalypse, and a scared Bunny who just want's to live though the day. But the best thing about this game is it's atmosphere, it really helped me get into the world they've built, and plus most of the in-game locations are modeled after their real world counterparts so it feels almost like you are actually walking though the dead city of pripyat. Another great thing about this game is that for the most part, you can do whatever you feel like doing, and explore a large open and mutant filled world, with alot of upgradable and customizable Guns and Suits. Well i know this review was kind of long and i probably only scratched the surface of what this game is, but i think that about covers the basics and i just want to finish by saying i loved every second of this game.

Blending a terrifying open world with survivalist gameplay to create in the player, unbridled horror. The supernatural elements are terrific, the gunplay is visceral, and the twisted abominations (and the bloody Poltergeists) will make you jump.

												The game has been out for several years now, and this won't be a review on the game itself.Rather this is a review of the excellent MISERY 2.1 mod I had installed recently.MISERY is a ""hardcore survival overhaul"" mod for STALKER: COP, which sets out to do just that. And it does.Guns that you loot from enemies are now in very poor condition, it's FAR more expensive to repair them or to buy new guns/ammo. NPC's will meet a gruesome end during emissions, which force you to take cover in a good-sized building or meet that end yourself. To top that off, emissions are frequent occurrences in the game, breaking out every 9-12 hours of in-game time.Furthermore, stealth is vastly improved, all character voices are Russian rather than English. And you can even specialize in one of 3 classes added by the mod, each with their own required playstyle.The list of changes added by the mod is too large to list here in a review, so I'll include a link to the mod's guide below.http://www.miserymod.com/?p=1462MISERY turns STALKER into an enormous challenge, and I highly recommend it if you have the nads for it :)			"

												This game is simply a masterpiece. I bought it when it was first released and have played through not only the vanilla game, but the most popular mods such as 'Complete 2009 mod' (which adds some extra flavour and gfx upgrades) and 'Misery mod' (which adds a LOT of extra flavour and turns it into the most brutal survival game in existence), and i am still playing it to this day.It is so atmospheric, this is the only game i have actually felt scared to enter certain areas, espcially in the dark! Everything about it is awesome and has some of the best lighting effects i have seen in a game to date.This is an absolute must buy in my opinion, its inexpensive and there is no excuse not to grab it! Sure it can have some performance issues with misery mod just due to its sheer scale, but these issues can easily be rectified with a quick google search and adjusting some mod settings such as Alife distances. I am running it at around 80-120 fps on my current rig, and while there does appear to be a minor memory leak after prolonged play sessions which will make you lose a few FPS, a quick restart of the game fixes this every time.One of my favourite games of all time, and there are new complete overhaul mods still being created to this day, making it worth a buy for sure. Just do it, you wont be disappointed.			"

												[Warning, Walls of text incoming, also, this is gameplay only, I had a much longer review planned]The GameplayThis is easily STALKER's strongest point. To put it frankly, it's awesome. The open world is fun to roam around, the locations are all unique, the way they handle the difficulties is very cool, and using the guns feels very nice, even if some of them do sound like pea-shooters. To go in to a bit more detail:	The game starts you off with a bit of food and medical supplies, a light vest, a gasmask, a pistol, and an AKS. All equipment has a durability meter. Now don't worry, that's just equipment, so your grenades, medpacks, and food will remain in tip-top shape. Lower durability means lowered stats, and if it's a gun, it may jam at the most inconvenient times. Durability lowers either by taking damage, or shooting. Do yourself a favor and shoot in single fire mode, as that helps you both control your shots better, and saves on durability. Your inventory consists of the storage, your helmet and armor slots, and your 2 gun slots. Do note that certain armor takes up both the armor and helmet slot, so watch what you wear. Your 2 gun slots can carry whatever you want, it's not limited to primary and pistol. You could have any combo, the choice is yours. Your inventory automatically extends, so you can carry what you want. The only thing that will get in your way, is the weight limit. At the beginning I think it's about 50kg. Going over that limit over-encumbers you, causing you to move slower, and sprinting drains your stamina really really fast. Going 10kg or above the weight limit will cause you to stop moving all-together, meaning you'll have to drop some items if you wish to move at all. You can, however, get drugs that temporarily increase your carry weight, and you can upgrade certain armor to increase the carry weight. I'm pretty sure some armor comes with a base carry weight increase, though I haven't taken the time to check that out. Throughout the game you will battle Zombies, Snorks, Burers, Blind dogs, Boars, Pseudo-Dogs, Rodents, Bloodsuckers, etc. Sure, there's Flesh monsters, but what you do to them is more akin to Genocide than Battling. You'll also encounter Anomalies. These are rather odd entities that, depending on the anomaly, can do all sorts of things. Some are simply pillars of flame triggered by movement, others do such crazy things as teleport you, or even trap an entire squad in a world of emptiness. And by the way, that's a side-mission that you can easily miss. Most of the anomalies are found in, quite obviously, anomaly fields. 	Now you might ask yourself, ""Well why would I go to an insanely dangerous area filled with the oddities of an already strange world that could practically rip me apart?"" Well the answer, is Artifacts. Artifacts are strange items scattered throughout the world. They are found only in Anomaly fields, with 2 exceptions. Exception 1 is certain scripted artifacts, exception 2 is when you get the prototype detector. With the prototype detector out, you can detect them out in the open, albeit very rarely. Artifacts are extremely useful in that you can either sell them for varying amounts of money, depending on how rare they are, or you can equip them, if your vest has the slots for it. The only downside to equiping them is they usually give a fair amount of radiation every second, so it's best to get some radiation-reducing artifacts before working on the more useful ones. The upside is a lot of the artifacts have some rather good effects, just make sure to mouse over them and see just what they are. But what do you do then? What do you do when there's no more Artifacts to find? Well, that's where Emissions come in. I mentioned these earlier, but now I'll explain what they do and what they are. Emissions are the result of the Zone basically releasing any excess energy. They happen every day at a random time, and when they begin to form, you'll hear all sorts of crazy sounds, and see the clouds forming in a strange way. Seconds later you should get a PDA side-mission telling you to find cover, along with a radio broadcast telling all stalkers an emission is approaching. You have around 2-3 In-game minutes to find cover, which is marked on your minimap, before the emission hits the land. Anyone caught outside either dies, or turns into a zombie. Another way to tell an emission is approaching is monitoring the mutant activity. Mutants spawn more often both before and after emissions. You can survive these while outside though, you just need Anabiotics. If you survive 3 emissions with these, you'll be immune to them, though they will drain your health like crazy and you will black out. After an emission is the most important part though. After any emission, artifacts have a very large chance of respawning at Anomaly fields, empty or not.	Now that I've covered Emissions, let's move on to something I mentioned while I was talking about them. Achivements. These are not normal achivements though, these ones have in-game advantages and disadvantages. One gives you medical supplies every day in your personal box, another gives you AMMO everyday, but spawns more dangerous mutants, and another spawns rarer artifacts much more often, but causes bandits to sometimes fight you. Of course there is some that are just there to be achivements and nothing more. One in particular was supposed to do something, specifically the one you get for exposing Magpie, but because of a programing error, it doesn't do anything. So far, it hasn't been fixed, and seeing as GSC Game World was disbanded, I don't expect a fix anytime soon. 	Now going a little deeper in to how the game works, everything has Stats, technically making this game an Open-World RPG. Guns have the usual stats like damage, accuracy, and even Flatness, which decreases the arc of the bullet. Armor has stuff like radiation resistance, psy resistance, armor, chemical protection, et cetera. A nice feature is that certain guns can have attachments. You know, the usual, like grenade launchers, scopes, and silencers. As for movement, it's all the usual, but with a few tweaks. For instance, you can lean left and right with Q and E. You also have 3 stances, but the last one isn't the one you expect. Standing, crouch, and low-crouch, which is basically prone but a slight bit faster. And no, there is no prone stance. For fighting mutants, and especially humans, it's best to try and get headshots, as they'll 1-shot most humans and do a good chunk more damage to mutants. If YOU get hit, you have a large chance to Bleed, which will drain your health until it's fixed. There's 3 color-coded degrees to bleeding. Green, your health goes down slowly, and you can just leave it and it should fix itself up in a couple of seconds, yellow is when you should apply bandages, as your health drops faster, and red is when you HAVE to apply bandages, as your health will be gone in a matter of seconds. The game also has hunger, so on top of the emissions, the mutants, the anomalies, the bandits, and your equipment's durability, you gotta make sure you had your mini-wheats for breakfast. Thankfully, they downplay it quite a lot, so you only really need to eat either when you sleep for more than a few hours, or if you are adventuring for a LONG time.<Score>And that's really the basics [and a bit of the advanced] of the gameplay, I don't really know what to say other than, it's STALKER's strongest point, with atmosphere being VERY close behind it. It's easily a 10/10.<Final game score>9/10This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I will continue to play it until the day I die. My final thoughts would have to be:If Fallout 3/New Vegas had a baby with the Metro Series, you'd get this.			"

												This game is, once again, very fun to play. Slighty differnt from the first one, but not so much you won't know what you're doing. You should still get the first one before you play this one of course. This game fixed a lot of the problems the 1st and 2nd games had, with somethings missing and somethings added. Overall worth the price. Now if only they could have gotten better voice actors.			"

												Call of Pripyat is a mixed bag. It incorporates the gameplay and graphical improvements of Clear Sky and introduces new and large areas to explore. It's also the most polished and bug-free of the STALKER games. But at the same time it seems to have lost its spirit: the game is very unchallenging and the Zone doesn't feel like the oppressive and bleak place it should be anymore.Despite its shortcomings Call of Pripyat is recommendable simply because it works. It has a lot of content in both items and quests, it's very free-roam right from the start and it's overall the most accessible of the three games.			"

												This game is a great survival FPS. Good mechanics, a nice range of weapons easily modifiable, and good difficulty that isn't too excessive. That's the short. Now for the long.The long is that S.T.AL.K.E.R. is a great survival FPS renown for it's excellent portrayal of The Zone, a post-Chernobyl irradiated anomaly in Ukraine that is growing day by day expanding it's influence and luring treasure hunters guns-for-hire and thieves all to it's landscape for either massive wealth or their inevitable doom. Some of you might think, ""but Wille, this has been done before. Why is this any different?"" It isn't but it's done right and that's the key difference. A lot of survival games might thrust you into an area you know all of nothing about. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. doesn't do this. Your character is given plenty of dialogue with other characters as they slowly establish this large world around you from the starting area outwards. It's done like this in all of the series' titles and that is easily their best feature. Where they don't excel in graphics they do excel in amazing story and worldbuilding among other things, and the graphics are more than passable.On to gunplay and mechanics. It's a survival game so you have your standard fare here. Heavy-hitting high recoil weapons that shred mooks and shred you if you're naked along with the typical things like hunger, radiation and the ability to bleed. Bleeding is easily stopped with twenty plasters applied on the wound whether it's a shot from a 9 mil or a crater-making blast from an anti-materiel rifle. This works to the game's benefit as it is a survival game but it also doesn't have to be overly difficult to be one. Many survival games think survival is ball-busting fun-stifling monsters teabagging your corpse death after death before you can even reach the level one safe zone. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has always given you time to prepare where other games wouldn't. For this reason alone it could get my reccomendation it could look Minecraft bad and with mechanics like this I'd still love it over anything any day of the week.Not much more can be said. The flaws could be focused on but there aren't many. Buy the game and play it.Pros: -  Excellent world spanning 3 games -  Satisfying gunplay that rewards patience and skill, without being too difficult for those lacking such things -  Mechanics that don't suck -  A wide variety of weapons and armors. The armors scale as the game goes on, but weapons are totally preference.Cons: - Graphics can be ♥♥♥. "

												I was kinda disappointed, even though they added some new great things, it had me longing for the original SoC game play. I don't think some things were 100% finnished, and it seems to really need mods to help the game play, which isn't good or bad but for me, personally, but I had a hard time getting the right mods together. In vanilla gameplay, the first things I realized were wrong were the ak-74u and the gun sounds. They were waaay to quite, kinda unsatisfyng, Thankfully theres a mod for that that isn't so hard to find. The ak-74u on the other hand just looked wierd, the ejection port was on the left side; I had to watch poorly renderd casings come out the wrong side of the gun. A.I., of course, is also bad. It needed mods. Once I got to modding I saw a lot of great mods, or from the cover they look good. A lot of recent bad reviews kept me from the bigger mods (misery, complete, ect.) so I looked for mods with good reviews. the SGM mods (both 2.2 and geo) were o.k. but still not the expirince I was looking for, So then I tried the a couple of mod packs. Some had this others had that, none were good enough. Now, I finnialy tried misery 2.0 and it was actully really good. Over all, I give it a 8.5/10 after getting misery, amazing realistic, horror survival game play.Then I got the ""killer mod pack"" now it's a 9.5/10, at least.			"

												Atmosphere. Something that is so important in many games and something that Stalker completely nails right from the start. You begin the game on a lonely hillside and (if your PC is up to the challenge) the whole bleak and scary Pripyat region opens up around you. An urgency sets in that makes you desperate to reach the dim point of light in the distance that marks one of the few safe havens in the Zone. I've played through the game a few times since its release and even now I can't quite put my finger on how they managed to make even the open daylit areas so scary - and then you reach a point were the games narrative demands you go under ground and the fear just seeps out of the game in a wonderful adrenaline fueled way. You'll jump at every noise and wave your torch about in panic. For a game to make you feel insignificant and unprotected even when you are packing an automatic machine gun and plenty of ammo is a triumph in game design. Is it a FPS? Yes, and I for one enjoyed the rather clunky combat as it added to the realism. Is it an RPG? Yes, and the search for better gear and better anomoly upgrades to help combat the Zone will force you to brave the most dangerous areas. Above all, for me, this game is an adventure survival game. From the moment I stepped into the Zone I felt that I was simply trying to survive in a way that many other 'survival games' fail to achieve. The Zone is the enemy here - and it is trying to kill youIf you like your games atmospheric then I wholly recommend Stalker - it is absolutely dripping in it			"

												Why does monolith call?I got fallout 3 right when it came out and every expansion when available as well. I thought that was the epitome of survival wasteland fps/rpg gaming. Then I find this stalker shadow of Chernobyl game and think generic knockoff. After going through stalker 1.0 with all the weird bugs however, I soon realized this was fallout on steroids.The mood of the game, the difficulty (initially), even the lighting was exceptional. Also, what I'd call the rpg elements of getting better gear felt more natural as opposed to leveling stats on my guy in fallout. Walking around the metro shooting ghouls with the terrible shotgun whilst paused in v.a.t.s. pales in comparison to going into the labs around Chernobyl. Chernobyl had zombies but also included cloaking bloodsuckers lurking behind you, snorks ready to pounce, a behemoth flesh creature, along with mutated dogs, poltergeists, and various other startling abominations.Clear sky brought in the interesting concept of modifying weapons and factions. That was about all Clear Sky offered save for an upgrade to the Xray engine. Oddly enough, the factions were lost with the next installmentNow with the most refined version of Call of Pripyat what was interesting before is even better.  Hunting in anomalies for artifacts using a detection device and throwing bolts is a very interesting way of essentially mining the environment. Secret stashes that can be found at any time without prerequisite was a good addition. Call of Pripyat also saw a better structured campaign. SoC was too loose, CS was to linear, CoP to me is just right. Though don't get me wrong the game in all iterations is open roaming, but CS felt like walking through levels and SoC had areas of no interest.I've just been playing a heavily modified Call of Pripyat and it's almost like a new game again. the mods give it a high replay ability factor. Sneaking into a mercenary base and taking out heavy geared mercs then looting everything is oddly satisfying. Then, trying to walk back in complete darkness to sell loot with all manner of hostile creatures about is icing on the cake. I recommend anyone interested in good games to play this. "

												I am so very torn by this game it's unreal. I can't love this game and yet I want to, I can't hate it and yet I want to. I suppose I was just so excited at the premise of an open world shooter set in Pripyat, the idea alone is worth so much and yet I find myself ambivalent. It's really fun to explore the dark, depressing but not tense world of post-Chernobyl Pripyat (and the outlying areas, you don't actually REACH Pripyat until much later) but it feels so sparse. I know you'd expect that sort of thing from an irradiated area but it feels like a few meagre locations interspersed with mostly identical grassland with the occasional swamp or trees or anomaly, it works from a canonical standpoint but I feel it cheapens the whole ""open world"" aspect. The almost utter lack of voice acting prbably wouldn't have bothered me so much except it makes it impossible to distinguish people. They have no personality of which to speak and whatever voice acting you DO get is at best okay (sometimes you can CLEARLY hear the same person switch between two different voice actors, one in English and one in Russian), I really feel as if the NPC's in this game are a serious impediment to the enjoyment of what is otherwise quite a fine game. Gunplay is a bit turgid, the guns don't really have much feeling to them and there's no real discernible differences in firepower within the same class of firearm. All the pistols are like peashooters to most enemies, shotguns are okay and so on, although I kind of liked the Gauss Rifle which brings me to another issue in the area of sound. Most of it is actually quite good, especially at night when it gets actually really atmospheric with rather haunting animal noises, crickets and a bit of fairly repetitive but good background music. But a lot of the audio sounds so uninspired and boring, especially gunfire (with particular note to the Gauss Rifle, it sounds terrible), item noises sometimes don't make sense and can get repetitive (although that is understandable). The ending was also really abrupt and very unsatisfactory. Yet despite its many failings this game has quite a bit to offer the discerning gamer, even if I can't quite elucidate my reasons for liking it. All I can say it's atmospheric, the world is pretty good looking if sparse and the concept of anomalies and stuff in Pripyat is interesting and quite engaging. This game might not live up to its potential but it is worth your time. I sincerely hope they get some experienced devs to make the sequel this IP deserves.EDIT: I suppose in retrospect this review looked quite negative, but this is a really engrossing game at times and the fact that there's no hand holding or explanation of which to speak means that it's on you to figure everything out and that's always a plus for immersion. If it's ever on sale do buy this game, for all its flaws it is still a good game.			"

												STALKER: Call of Pripyat (CoP)Another excellent installment in the STALKER series. I love these games - they succeed in combining FPS and RPG gameplay like no other. When pressed to describe the STALKER games, I find it easiest to explain them as ""RPGs without all the fiddly bits."" You have quests and inventory, but no stats and levels. There's no inflating abilities with experience points - everything you do, you do to move the game along, not to build a gold stash or level up for a boss fight.CoP is the most polished of the three STALKER games. Not easier, though - combat is still challenging, and ammo scarce. But the quests are more linear, with fewer distractions as you move through the story. I approve of that streamlining, as CoP has more story to tell than the other two games. Total game time here is the same as the others... roughly 30 hours, give or take, depending on how much you choose to accomplish.Why I enjoy the STALKER series so much is that they delver a plausible game world. When you explore, you will find distant locations that have no bearing on the game's story, yet are meticulously crafted. Unlike most RPGs, you don't feel like the center of the universe. Instead, you feel like a visitor to a world that has been there before you arrived, and will continue after you leave. And dangerous! Here is a game where you stay on the roads, and seek shelter at night. A game where a pack of wild dogs is actually as dangerous as it should be. Each NPC has a name, and goes about his own life in the Zone. CoP plays this to the extreme - when the game ends, you are treated to a slideshow that describes what becomes of roughly 20 NPCs that you will encounter through the game. For each character, his denoument is affected by your interaction with him. I found this very rewarding.My one gripe is that CoP plays down the faction wars that were such a big part of STALKER: Clear Sky. I missed picking sides between Freedom and Duty. But all of the familiar factions are present in this game. Freedom and Duty have reached an easy peace. Stalkers and Bandits are still two sides of the same coin. And Monolith is still a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.Yes, I do recommend this game. And as always, STALKER games are best with their accompanying ""Complete"" mod. These mods bring higher-quality graphics and sound, and excellent weather effects to the STALKER series, without changing the core game. They also minimize some of the repetitive NPC quotes you hear in the game. They are a must, even for first playthrough.

												This is my opinion.S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is like an art to me. It really captured the sense of Russia in an apocalyptic stage. It has some open world elements to is with a very good story. It might seem a little old for the new gamers but once you get in to it than I’ll think they will share my vision. The coolest part of the staler series I think is the psy damage you can take. That moment there is some kind of anomaly that makes you insane, making you hear voices and makes you see things there aren’t there. And the emisions  make you feel like you have to outrun a nuclear explosion. next to that there are more kids of damages you could receive like burns, poison damage, bleeding damage, radiation, starvation, shock damage, Rupture (from mutants animals), and explosion damage.The mutants are quite scary and you can always hear them from a far adding to the horror element of the game. Some mutants turn invisible and become visible again once close to you trying to suck you blood. Other mutants try to control you brain. And that really makes me ♥♥♥♥ bricks.Call of Pripyat is one is one of the few series that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has to offer.

												If you are searching for a great game, which offers a atmospheric and challeging trip to the outlands aswell as the crumbling structures of pripyat, your search has come to an end.I highly recommend playing this game with the misery mod, which is a complete overhaul of the main game. It deepens every aspect of the original STALKER CoP making it even better than it is. More weapons, more difficult gameplay, new game mechanics, better graphics, more usable items and even more.There are negativ aspects, like micro lags from time to time or unlikely crashes, but taking all before mentioned aspects into consideration, this game in combination with the misery mod is awesome. STALKER Call of Pripyat + Misery Mod is a ""must-play""! and in my opínion highly underrated for what it is. A great game.			"

												This game is a hunk of junk with a Gem inside of it. Those who endure the stuttering and bugs (which in a way are iconic to the Stalker series) see why this game is beautiful in graphical fidelity and environment in an awe-inspiring post-apocalyptic landscape carved by the Chernobyl disaster.As far as vanilla gunplay is concerned, it is, to be honest, a bit meh. And the variety is just a bit lacking. Therefore, I strongly recommend getting the Arsenal Overhaul mod alongside Absolute Nature and Atmosfear.You can get that here: -----------> http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaulTo have the full Stalker experience, I recommend having headphones on as it is just so immersive.

Yet despite its many failings this game has quite a bit to offer the discerning gamer, even if I can't quite elucidate my reasons for liking it. All I can say it's atmospheric, the world is pretty good looking if sparse and the concept of anomalies and stuff in Pripyat is interesting and quite engaging. This game might not live up to its potential but it is worth your time. I sincerely hope they get some experienced devs to make the sequel this IP deserves.EDIT: I suppose in retrospect this review looked quite negative, but this is a really engrossing game at times and the fact that there's no hand holding or explanation of which to speak means that it's on you to figure everything out and that's always a plus for immersion. If it's ever on sale do buy this game, for all its flaws it is still a good game.			"

												now this wont be a full reveiw upon first writing but im going over the baisics of what i want to say ( becuase ive got a dam lot to say about this game i mean look at this intro :D )The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Series as always been my favourite series of games for a number of reasons, whether it is the crazy amount of weird and wonderful guns, suits and items, or the weird and whacky storyline, i love almost everything about this game , and i will say why now.Story:one of my favourite parts about the stalker games is the story lines that always seem to have a big twist at the end or something like that. Anyway, the story in CoP is really quite cool how they made it all play out, one of the best bits is being able to see how you affected every other stalkers life while you were in the zone at the end of the game with about 20 or so slides telling you about what happend after you left the zone.Weaponry:With a decent selection of weaponry for all play styles, this game can make you play through it many times just so you can play around with the guns and ammo types ( two for each gun except the PKM, Sniper rifles and the RPG ). from shotguns to expermental gaus rifles, this game unmodded provided me with atleast 70 hours before i even thought about modding it.Suits / Armour:Stalker has system whereby you can wear suits that affect your carry weight, protection for various envriomental hazards, gunfire and can effect your mobility. CoP by far offers the most diverse Suit system by allowing the player to (with most suits) mix and match head gear and main body suits depending on your play style, (gas masks for artifact hunters, military helmets for combat, and high-end mixes of both). There is a massive variety of upgrades that can completley changes the suits performance (Servos on an exoskeleton, alloying you to sprint).Upgrading your equipment:CoP allows you to collect tool kits and gie them to technicians, who will reward you with the ability to upgrade your guns and suits more (and a small cash reward). You can turn a AK-74 into a laser fast firing assault cannon, or make it a more accurate mid range sniper.still wip			"

												I totally recommend this game, although from what I've heard it seems to be the third game in the series? Anyway, other than lack of a tutorial and you're thrown straight into the game, it's like a lower budget Fallout 3! As fun and feels as big as Fallout 3.			"

												This game is a hunk of junk with a Gem inside of it. Those who endure the stuttering and bugs (which in a way are iconic to the Stalker series) see why this game is beautiful in graphical fidelity and environment in an awe-inspiring post-apocalyptic landscape carved by the Chernobyl disaster.As far as vanilla gunplay is concerned, it is, to be honest, a bit meh. And the variety is just a bit lacking. Therefore, I strongly recommend getting the Arsenal Overhaul mod alongside Absolute Nature and Atmosfear.You can get that here: -----------> http://www.moddb.com/mods/arsenal-overhaulTo have the full Stalker experience, I recommend having headphones on as it is just so immersive.

												It doesn't have quite the oppressive, loner atmosphere that characterized the first game, but mods (in particular, Misery) easily fill in that void. This game has three very large open areas to explore and a great deal of handcrafted, well-scripted quests as opposed to the endlessly generated ""go here, fetch that"" quests that were the daily fare of the previous two games.The overall plot arc isn't as interesting as its predecessors, but it does reference them well. It also has several endings, Fallout slideshow style, based upon your involvement throughout the game, which lends towards a satisfying conclusion and encourages replayability. Call of Pripyat is the culmination of the systems introduced in the previous two games - setting, gameplay mechanics, and introduces an extra layer of attention to detail and care that pushes it above its predecessors.\I'd call it the most complete S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience. If you play only one of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, pick this one.			"

												An atmospheric shooter based in the aftermath of the nuclear catastrophe in Chernobyl, with the slight twist of mutants, lethal anomalies, warring factions and other delightful treats. The combat with humans involves high damage, bullet drop and cover to cover stressful gun battles. Mutants meanwhile, require a certain level of awareness and responsiveness as the different mutants require adapting tactics with haste. The game also includes survival elments such as hunger, radiation and the like. Exploration plays a key role in getting equipment to survive the various trials the game throws at you, as does interaction with the various factions. The graphics are a bit dated, but there are mods to deal with that, and if you find the game too easy, there are also mods to tweak the difficulty to provide a more challenging, rewording experience. Overall, 8/8.			"

												One of the best S.T.A.L.K.E.R game out there yet. This game is like Skyrim with guns and mutants, it has bugs at times but it's worth the money. Also includes a look at Pripyat in a horror and syfy perspective. The modding community for this game is for everyone, for the ones who want a very big challange or for them who would like to try an easy survival game.

												--This is a neutral review from someone who is not familiar with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series--S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a series I really want to get into because the community isn't stupid and the game looks damn good but the older S.T.A.L.K.E.R games are a bit to old for my liking so I got this one becuase its the latest.Now I tried to get into this game, I really did but Christicle on a bicycle this is hard, the game gives you a little bit of backstory and then dumps you in a field. This appears to be one of those games that you learn about the hard way, for example every now and then something called an Emission explodes across the whole map and wipes out everyone, I found myself getting killed over and over again by the first Emission until I eventually gave up and Googled it, I discovered that you have to hide underground in order to escape it...I guess this is just the cruel nature of this game because it gives you little to no information on anything, not even the basic mechanics are revealed to you and you have to study up everything just like Dark Souls.The atmosphere in this game is astonishing and I have never seen a game come even close to the dark, creepy and radioactive atmosphere that this game has, I spent most of my time too afriad to enter buildings because of the various sanity destroying sounds coming out of them.S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Call of Pripyat is a game I really want to get into but the difficulty and various mechanics that I know nothing about keeps scaring me away from it. Some people say that this game is a Fallout 3 ripoff and I find that really offensive because the developers must of worked really hard on this game and I feel like they didn't get the respect/money that they deserved because this game is different and somewhat ahead of its time.Now get out of here Stalker!

												This is an interesting game, with a great story. If you've played the other Stalker games, this is an awesome continuation of the story. The only thing I would say is bad about it, is the fact that I managed to complete the game, and do extra things as well in under 20 hours. However, I still think this is a great buy, and my favorite game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series.This game also taught me that all a man really needs to live is bread, sausage and vodka.9/10 would cheeki breeki again "

												STALKER is a game that simply entertains, while it has its bugs and issues the game is able to entertain me enough to keep coming back to it. If I were to recommend anything it'd be to get this game as well as to download the Misery modification as that modification increases the challenge in the game and certainly adds to the enjoyment of skulking around Post-Meltdown Chernobyl.Be warned, the Misery mod does change the voices to the Russian version but leaves English subtitles, if this bothers you then I am fairly certain they have an English patch for it on their site, and if not I am sure you can find one.

Summer vacations give me a lot of free time to test new games, so i gave STALKER one last chance. The controls are jerky and your head seems on a permanent rollercoaster, the combat system is god-awful with outdated animations. The characters look all the same, no female characters, 3+1 models per faction, the cutscenes are cringy and out of sync. But this game has that cheeki breeki feeling that brings you memories that you never felt before. I gave up on life and lived the life of a artifact hunter in 1 silly game.Buy it on sale			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat could best be described as a mixture between Fallout, Metro 2033, and a touch of Mount and Blade. This game does not hold your hand, you are thrusted into the chaotic world of post-apocalyptic Russia with no tutorials or even goals given. It is easy enough to figure out how to follow the main quest, and side missions aren't revealed with an exclamation point over the quest-giver's head. The gunplay is surprisingly impressive as your weapons will break the more you shoot. Enemies are somewhat creative though they can become an annoyance as they are sometimes tough to shoot. But all in all, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is definitely worth a try.			"

												CoP in an of itself is a very good game.  Mod it though and it becomes phenomenal!  Personally, I recommend Call of Chernobyl with the Absolute Nature/Structures, Arsenal Overhaul 3, and Warfare addons.  There's no story, but all the maps from all three Stalker games are completely unlocked and free to roam through.  Then, with the Warfare mod, you're suddenly in a massive faction war across the entire map vying for dominance.  It's absolutely brilliant!Oh, and also, all hail the Monolith!			"

												If Deus Ex didn't exist I could happily say that this is the best FPSRPG ever made. It just resonates with that slavic, european  feel to it. It has the amazing atmosphere, visuals that suprisingly hold up well and it probably all runs on potato peels and vodka. Also the game is very mod friendly so there's even more fun to be had with complete gameplay overhauls, graphical upgrades or you can install Misery and get tetanus from just staring at the screen.Totally worth a buy if you don't mind the russian quirkiness that comes with these games.

												When I first got my PC I had a list of games I wanted to try out, but none of them were from the stalker series. Infact I hadnt even heard of these games until one day I was exploring the store and this little gem caught my eye. What almost immediately stuck out to me was the review score being overwhelmingly positive. After seeing that I read some reviews, watched some gameplay and eventually it came down to either this game or Half Life (The Original) and in the end i choose this game but its hard start had turned me off of it in the beginning so i let it sit for a while. Fast forward to a random boring day when it was raining and no internet connection and i gave it another go. I couldnt have made a better decision that day. On top of some nail bitting gameplay and fun exploration this game is one of the most immersive experinces I've ever had while playing a video game which wasn't even apperent till my brother had come to get my attention and when he tapped my shoulder i nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my self. But I dont want wasste anymore time making people read this so  the negatives:-Emissions are annoyiong and kinda pointless-Having to travel from one zone to another just to access a stash, also very annoying.-the game has a learning curve in the beginning, but once you get passed it, the game can get pretty easy.- the story also is kinda none exsistent, but on the flip side to that the factions are interesting and have some pretty cool interactions in the world.positives:-really fun combat and survival mechanics.-interesting world with some deep rooted lore, but it can be a little vague on the details (and not in a fun dark souls way).-Focus on exploration that keeps the player on thier toes.-Fun quests that dont get boring even the fetch quests felt less like a chore and more like and objective.-one of the most immersive experiences ive ever had (Though Headphones or earbudds may have helped that a lot).Overall even with the list of negative things they end up being just some minor complaints in the end and they are pretty easy to get over but if you have at all had any intrest in the game or simply just wanted to have something to get away from the crappier games coming out now  I HIGHLY recomend you give this game a try it has been an amazing joy ride for me.

												I have more than the 50 or so hours that Steam claims I have. I can tell you it's closer to 300. This game is my Skyrim!The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is by far my favorite franchise of all-time. With everything the modding community has done, it's not hard to fall back in love with this game. An open world survival horror shooter... It doesn't get any better than that! If a first time PC gamer came to me and asked me for a recommendation for a PC exclusive, this is the game I would tell them to play. While it may be slightly clunky, the atmosphere, the gun play, the creatures, the story, and the mechanics are perfected. Play this game with mods like: Atmosfear [Detailed weather storms(This blows Fallout 4's weather out of the water)], Complete mod (graphics overhaul), Arsenal Overhaul (100+ Nato, RU weapons, and realistic damage), and MISERY (hardcore Dark Souls mode). The game will not disappoint.Rating:96/100			"

												Arguably this is the best of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, either this or clear sky. Clear sky is longer, but more flawed.  This game is shorter, and is only 3 areas (really, REALLY big areas), but the game feels more alive.  The quests are better overall, and for once you get to form a group of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, although only for one mission (nothing like the zombie mission from Clear Sky).  The mutants are scarier than ever, and the new chimera is a fearsome beast.  The origins of the monolith faction are finally clearly explained (although clever players knew what was up already).  If you haven't beaten clear sky then the true origins of the zone will remain a mystery to you in this game, with a cursory intro and a couple of dialogue options here and there being your only explanation (although it is not at all central to the plot).  The plot is fairly weak, but fun so it doesn't really matter.  what is really good is the world crafting, it is really fun just running around collecting artifacts, hunting mutants, and completing misssions.  Collecting and upgrading different guns can also be really fun, but experienced players will quickly find some guns are Much better than others.  The atmosphere and sound is top notch, I highly recommend if you like environmental horror games and fps games.			"

												This game is absolutely incredible. Put aside the bugs and stuttering. Even with the latest ssd and skylake processors the stuttering is unavoidable, but is NOT game breaking. looking beyond that, the game is a masterpiece made by a smaller developer that should be thanked for the quality and feel from an open world game that even Bethesda games have failed to give me. GSC Game world needs our support so they can continue to create such fantastic games. Even at 6 years old, the mods keep it fresh looking and up to par with recent open world games and can still bring your 980ti to its knees with textures and details from mods. A must Get game.			"

												It is a good, survival horror, first person shooter that aims to drop casual gameplay for an intelligent, hardcore challenge which requires a change of play style. The AI is intelligent (sometimes a bit  too  intelligent), the enemies are tough, and the game has a controllable, rewarding, pace.It is only 7 years old at the time of this writing, but the graphics seem a bit older. Although if you enjoy games for what they truly are, this won't bother you. This game was the last installment in its series a few signs of rushing were shown. The previous game had better graphics (although horrendous shooting mechanics) and the sights are misaligned on many guns. This isn't a problem though, as  many  mods are available (almost all of them fixing this issue). Other than that, I can say this was perfected for the type of game it was when it was first made.Coming back to mods, you may notice that this game, out of three part series it's in, probably has the most mods of all. Almost all of them great (I personally prefer Misery) and provide fixes, tweaks, and improvements. From simple things such as the ballistics, to full-scale modifications ( Some even including the story! ).I really suggest that you read up some non-spoiler info on the game before starting it, as it provides no hand-holding tutorial or hints throughout itself.This info may be a bit bias, but in my honest opinion this is one of the greatest games I have ever played.

I was surprised to see the end come up when I had only completed about 60% of the side missions. The other reason was the character development from the first two games made me want more. What I loved about the game was how the end stories were the result of what you did or didn't do in the game. I won't spoil it but it seemed to know what tasks were completed to give you the final story of certain locations or characters.Just a couple of technical comments.

												Call of Pripyat's a brilliant game that's definitely worth the 20 someodd hours it takes to beat it. It's an often intense, very dangerous shooter that actually forces you to use your head and pay attention to the game. Every enemy is incredibly dangerous, and the details are all quite well thought out. The game is also completely gorgeous and feels pleasant. You have a ton of freedom to pursue any and every goal at your whim, as you're dropped into Ukraine with nothing but a map, a mission, and some basic gear. There are plenty of ways to deal with your problems, and plenty of actually worthwhile challenges to take on. All done and bored with this game? There are a ton of mods to look into, most notably being MISERY. I haven't tried that as of yet though. Definitely worth a gander considering the price.			"

I could ramble on for days about this game series, a series that I played while it was still bugged and broken, way before it was reviewed by idiots like IGN, and way before it had hopes of staying mentioned, and of course before it was on Steam. Even with how buggy it was, the series gets a solid 9/10 with gameplay and fun factor of 10/10!

Call of Pripyat fixes all these problems admirably and delivers a far more focused and streamlined version of what is already my favorite PC game. While it's not quite as ""Special"" as the original, CoP is a superior game in almost every way when compared to its predecessor. The game is as stable as a brick house, the upgrade system is simple yet satisfying and worthwhile, the story is more involving and fleshed out, and while several quests do repeat, their only purpose is to fatten up your wallet which, thanks to the rebalanced economy, is entirely optional (no more 200000 RU Exoskeleton!). Furthermore, your actions really do seem to bring a measure of change to the Zone.			"

This operation was planned to take the the Chernobyl NPP by force from the current forces holding it known only by the name ''Monolith''. The operation was a failure and all the stingray helicopters crashed in a suspicious way. So there you  are and you're mission is clear, but as you advance in the story it gets everything but clear, the pilots that are dead or killed all died in an extraordinary way except for those who died by the impact of the crashing helicopter, and some of the helicopters appear to be disfuctional even before they hit the ground. You're mission is a solo effort to find out why Operation Fairway was a failure, but as you progress through The Zone you have to work among the local stalkers which are the people wondering around and exploring The Zone brought there by various reasons. You may choose to work alongside the stalkers or rob them as a bandit either way you will have buddies. Stalkers make the most money, which is a luxury in The Zone, by hunting Artifacts which are items formed in an anomalous area, after getting artifacts they sell them to traders who trade them to the outside world. Artifacts have strange abilities like healing abilities. The Zone is a strange and dangerous place which makes the majors mission anything but easy. The Zone is full of dangerous anomalies, radiation, bandits, madmen, criminals and even mutated animals and people!You're mission leads you to the center of The Zone to city of Pripyat where you meet up with the remaining soldiers from Operation Fairway, There you can choose to do something about the Monolith and soon find out more about how the helicopters crashed. As it turns out the monolith have a secret weapon which works with electric energy from artifacts and uses batteries for ''magazines'' the weapon is called Gauss Rifle and the helicopters were shot down. in the end you are given a option to leave The Zone or to find out more about the Gauss Rifle and the Monolith or about The Zone, so the story is only so good how mutch time you put in to it. Like any other game you can just rush it out or take time with it and S.T.A.L.K.E.R is one where you should totally invest some time otherwise it's easily looked over because of it's graphical issues and it's cheap look, but the truth is S.T.A.L.K.E.R is anything but cheap! It may lack a perfect story but the atmosphere and feel is like any other, S.T.A.L.K.E.R has many intersting side missions and stories and the fact that it loosely is related to reality and has a realistic feel to it makes it an unmatched expirience in this kind of genre. Gameplay:Gameplay of S.T.A.L.K.E.R is very unique in my oppinion, it combines FPS gameplay with survival elements such as hunger and radiation sickness and the need to sleep with horror and even RPG elements such as simple stats, different weapons and armor, economy, side missions and exploring. Combined with the enviroment the gameplay fits like a glove even if it has a few downsides. The downsides are mostly minor things such as repeated lines from NPC's and buggy animations, other than that it's O.K. All in all the gameplay is something quite different from other compareable games and in a good way! S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat can attract fans of many genres. Multiplayer is nothing special, you're typical DM, TDM witch areas from the singleplayer.Graphics:The game was first released in 2009 so the graphics are a bit old but i wouldn't say that they look terrible, they aren't the diamond either there is a lot of room for improvement in here but especially in the animations. The game uses the X-Ray engine and has been updated to version 1.6 with DirectX 11. The games graphics can be enhanced with several mods that are avaliable through the web. I haven't found any major problems that mods have not been able to fix.Other:One thing that must be said about Call Of Pripyat is the large quantity of different mods that are avaliable, apparently S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans are loyal to game and have made a lot of great mods for people to play. Allmost every problem and aspect of the game can be fixed/enhanced with large or small mods. I recommend playing the game with one major mod before declaring it a piece of trash.Verdict:S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat is  allmost a ground breaking title. Call Of Pripyat lacks the appearence to catch peoples eyes but is a beautyful game in many aspects. S.T.A.L.K.E.R in my oppinion has no problems the mods can't fix. All in all it is a refreshing title and a great expirience for a fan of any genre and has a feel and atmosphere like any other. Story is nothing special but keeps you interested to the end plus S.T.A.L.K.E.R has many great side missions. You can easily put 40 to 50 hours to this game and still not have played every little bit, depending on your difficulty and playstyle of course. S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat is excellent singleplayer expirience!9/10			"

												When you're going into The Zone, you know that you might not come back.  But if you do, you might just get rich.In the utter wasteland of Chernobyl things are getting worse.  And strange.  Mutants and monsters roam, the very laws of physics bend and break and the sky rains death in erruptions.  In this horrible place dubbed ""The Zone"",  military, rogue and secret factions war  for the secrets the zone is hiding.  Secrets that could free or end the world.STALKER Call of Pripyat is the finest in freeroaming wasteland adventure.  The non-scripted nature of this game will feed you a constant stream of emergent storytelling.  Don't miss this game.Also, read the wonderful Russian short story this series is based on called ""Roadside Picnic"", which is a free download somewhere.			"

												The third STALKER game finds itself as the first one I played the entire way through. The polish is actually there, the guns are much improved. Mission design isn't actually bugged and the game can be much easier than previous entries. I much prefer to recommend it to others over the first two, because it follows a more Bethesda-RPG path and is a bit more open world, with 3 major maps and 6 contained zones. The meeting areas in the ship, train-station and laundramat bring back the whole comfort in numbers/fear in solitude dynamic that Clear Sky messed up on.Though, the broken messes of the original's demise seemed to suck a bit of the STALKER magic from the game. Every location is played out on the map and seems to all share a purpose, some more obvious than others. I wish loners would populate some of these areas after the threat has cleared, it sometimes feels some of these were just left fortotten.Duty & Freedom find themselves with reduced numbers, with control only over Yanov, so the large scale fights feel very toned down. Even in the game's third act in Pripyat I was really expecting some sort of large scale battle, because the shootouts in Pyripyat in ShoC or the assault on the Freedom HQ led themselves to some of the highlights in prior games. X-8 played situational horror more than anthing more subtle in prior labs, or the huge army of monolith in X-19The graphics are stunning in a very bizarre game. Its 6 years old and I've yet to see more involving shadow effects. Some may be technically more subtle but none actually change the enviornment as much. The new Chimera can be one scary ♥♥♥♥♥ to find out in the open.Well the third act was lined with disappointments the endgame of actual freeroam is a haven to players who loved the RPG aspects over all else, and they included enough of a threat to not suck the fun out of the game.9/10			"

												The third installment in the series and clearly the superior in manny ways. The only problem I have with Call of Pripyat is the lack of exploration, and since I played each STALKER game in order I feel that this one reverted from the progress they made from 1st to the 2nd game in the series. I feel like there is much less to do but much more cluttering side stuff. It feels like an RPG more so than the previous. I still however recommend this highly due to the general feeling of the game, smaller but more packed. Mods are also quite supported and I will recommend that you do a second playthrough with the ""Misery"" mod installed.Overall: Same as all the other games in the series a must have  but it feels very distant due to the missing of actuall chernobyl for some reason. 9/10...

												I think that (without a shadow of a doubt) that this is the best game I have ever played. FACT. I've played many games both on PC and on console, but really the whole S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is one of my favorite game series of all time. As soon as I bought the game and started playing it, I was in love with the game.I love how the game is EXTREMELY atmospheric. I think if it had Occulus Rift compatibility, I would definitely break some windows with my screams of terror. The AI is a little (ahem) crazy, but there are many modded overhauls for this game, such as MISERY, Call of Pripyat Complete, and more. If you want a challenging, atmospheric, IMMERSIVE game, I'd say that every S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game is going to be perfect for you.The downfalls of really each of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is the lack of multiple weapons. There are only a good few weapons in the game, but getting the MISERY mod overhaul will definitely add several weapons to the game. The graphics (texture-wise) are pretty good for its time when the game came out. However, the lighting, especially for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, is PHENOMENAL. The lighting uses DirectX 11, to bring the most satisfying lighting effects for any game, maybe even for some next-gen console & PC games.To make this all short:Yes. Buy the game. This series has what some components of Fallout should've been. Once you play it, you'll see exactly what I mean.			"

												Great game, nearly as good as the orginal game. It's been awhile since I've played the orignal but I only have fond memories of it. Playing 'Call of Pripyat' let me relive those great memories but in a new game. If you liked the orginal I can almost guarantee you'll be happy. Solid 4 out of 5 stars! I hope to see a remake of STALKER some day.Pros- Very much like the original (from what I can remember)- Challenging- Variety of ""Shooters"" to give you playing options- Shooting mechanics tweaked. I remember the original having an annoying problem of bullets flying too random and never straight.- Enemies do a good job of keeping you on your toes. Always loved the idea of psychic dogs- The survival aspects add to the game but are not overwhelming (Bleeding, eating, weight management, etc.)Cons- World is maybe a little small; could use a little more variety- More enemy variety- Why do zombies shoot so straight- More anomolies & artifacts- This is an older game so graphics are dated and somewhat kills the immersion. It's hard to believe that when playing the original I couldn't get over how good the graphics were- The same oddly shaped pink ""diet sausage""...  could be Pro...?			"

												Probably the best unmodded Stalker game. You can't go wrong with this either. The atmosphere is still there, and it can still be very challenging on Master. You don't really need any gameplay mods for this on your first playthrough, but you can use Atmosfear, and Absolute Nature and Absolute Structures to improve the visuals. Make sure to turn off Nuclear Fallout and Psy Emissions in Atmosfear, those are crap. If you want a much harder early game experience, try the Misery mod.

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat:S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat is a sequel to S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow Of Chernobyl, but has very little to do with the prequel except for the gameplay similarities and that they both are located in ''The Zone'' which is the irradiated area  surrounding the nuclear power plant Chernobyl and the city of Pripyat in Ukraine, needless to say, other than that the whole scenario is fictional. S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a Horror/Survival FP Shooter game developed by GSC Game World.General Information and story:You start as an USS Major Degtyarev and you are sent in to ''The Zone'' to investigate a failed operation called ''Operation Fairway''. This operation was planned to take the the Chernobyl NPP by force from the current forces holding it known only by the name ''Monolith''. The operation was a failure and all the stingray helicopters crashed in a suspicious way. So there you  are and you're mission is clear, but as you advance in the story it gets everything but clear, the pilots that are dead or killed all died in an extraordinary way except for those who died by the impact of the crashing helicopter, and some of the helicopters appear to be disfuctional even before they hit the ground. You're mission is a solo effort to find out why Operation Fairway was a failure, but as you progress through The Zone you have to work among the local stalkers which are the people wondering around and exploring The Zone brought there by various reasons. You may choose to work alongside the stalkers or rob them as a bandit either way you will have buddies. Stalkers make the most money, which is a luxury in The Zone, by hunting Artifacts which are items formed in an anomalous area, after getting artifacts they sell them to traders who trade them to the outside world. Artifacts have strange abilities like healing abilities. The Zone is a strange and dangerous place which makes the majors mission anything but easy. The Zone is full of dangerous anomalies, radiation, bandits, madmen, criminals and even mutated animals and people!You're mission leads you to the center of The Zone to city of Pripyat where you meet up with the remaining soldiers from Operation Fairway, There you can choose to do something about the Monolith and soon find out more about how the helicopters crashed. As it turns out the monolith have a secret weapon which works with electric energy from artifacts and uses batteries for ''magazines'' the weapon is called Gauss Rifle and the helicopters were shot down. in the end you are given a option to leave The Zone or to find out more about the Gauss Rifle and the Monolith or about The Zone, so the story is only so good how mutch time you put in to it. Like any other game you can just rush it out or take time with it and S.T.A.L.K.E.R is one where you should totally invest some time otherwise it's easily looked over because of it's graphical issues and it's cheap look, but the truth is S.T.A.L.K.E.R is anything but cheap! It may lack a perfect story but the atmosphere and feel is like any other, S.T.A.L.K.E.R has many intersting side missions and stories and the fact that it loosely is related to reality and has a realistic feel to it makes it an unmatched expirience in this kind of genre. Gameplay:Gameplay of S.T.A.L.K.E.R is very unique in my oppinion, it combines FPS gameplay with survival elements such as hunger and radiation sickness and the need to sleep with horror and even RPG elements such as simple stats, different weapons and armor, economy, side missions and exploring. Combined with the enviroment the gameplay fits like a glove even if it has a few downsides. The downsides are mostly minor things such as repeated lines from NPC's and buggy animations, other than that it's O.K. All in all the gameplay is something quite different from other compareable games and in a good way! S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat can attract fans of many genres. Multiplayer is nothing special, you're typical DM, TDM witch areas from the singleplayer.Graphics:The game was first released in 2009 so the graphics are a bit old but i wouldn't say that they look terrible, they aren't the diamond either there is a lot of room for improvement in here but especially in the animations. The game uses the X-Ray engine and has been updated to version 1.6 with DirectX 11. The games graphics can be enhanced with several mods that are avaliable through the web. I haven't found any major problems that mods have not been able to fix.Other:One thing that must be said about Call Of Pripyat is the large quantity of different mods that are avaliable, apparently S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans are loyal to game and have made a lot of great mods for people to play. Allmost every problem and aspect of the game can be fixed/enhanced with large or small mods. I recommend playing the game with one major mod before declaring it a piece of trash.Verdict:S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat is  allmost a ground breaking title. Call Of Pripyat lacks the appearence to catch peoples eyes but is a beautyful game in many aspects. S.T.A.L.K.E.R in my oppinion has no problems the mods can't fix. All in all it is a refreshing title and a great expirience for a fan of any genre and has a feel and atmosphere like any other. Story is nothing special but keeps you interested to the end plus S.T.A.L.K.E.R has many great side missions. You can easily put 40 to 50 hours to this game and still not have played every little bit, depending on your difficulty and playstyle of course. S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat is excellent singleplayer expirience!9/10			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat could best be described as a mixture between Fallout, Metro 2033, and a touch of Mount and Blade. This game does not hold your hand, you are thrusted into the chaotic world of post-apocalyptic Russia with no tutorials or even goals given. It is easy enough to figure out how to follow the main quest, and side missions aren't revealed with an exclamation point over the quest-giver's head. The gunplay is surprisingly impressive as your weapons will break the more you shoot. Enemies are somewhat creative though they can become an annoyance as they are sometimes tough to shoot. But all in all, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is definitely worth a try.			"

												If you like horror games, and you like RPG's, and you dabble in FPS, this is the game to get, hands down. Turn your lights off, your volume up, grab a bottle of vodka and get ready to become a hermit, because this game gets intense. While not your brain-numbing FPS like Call of Duty, where nothing really excites you any more because everything is an explosion, this takes a grittier, darker approach. With a wonderful combat system, an implemented RPG-like system (inventory control, some story focus), and some real scary ♥♥♥♥ thrown in, you'll play it a second time around and still get scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you're trekking through the marsh when it's pitch black, you've used your last bandage, your flashlight battery is almost dead and you start to hear footsteps quickly chasing behind you.

												Great game, nearly as good as the orginal game. It's been awhile since I've played the orignal but I only have fond memories of it. Playing 'Call of Pripyat' let me relive those great memories but in a new game. If you liked the orginal I can almost guarantee you'll be happy. Solid 4 out of 5 stars! I hope to see a remake of STALKER some day.Pros- Very much like the original (from what I can remember)- Challenging- Variety of ""Shooters"" to give you playing options- Shooting mechanics tweaked. I remember the original having an annoying problem of bullets flying too random and never straight.- Enemies do a good job of keeping you on your toes. Always loved the idea of psychic dogs- The survival aspects add to the game but are not overwhelming (Bleeding, eating, weight management, etc.)Cons- World is maybe a little small; could use a little more variety- More enemy variety- Why do zombies shoot so straight- More anomolies & artifacts- This is an older game so graphics are dated and somewhat kills the immersion. It's hard to believe that when playing the original I couldn't get over how good the graphics were- The same oddly shaped pink ""diet sausage""...  could be Pro...?			"

												This game is a jewel of the genre of apocalyptic games, and escpecially S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. UI is practical and simple, storyline is very good (but wish it was longer), new graphics engine really brings the game to the table. And that atmosphere....This is why S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games have fans all around the world. The atmosphere in this game is simply amazing, it makes you want to put hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay even after you finish the game.Great thing is that this series has also a very big modding community, so it is always interesting to play. Be that a graphics/weather mods (i.e. Atmosfear 3), arsenal mods, overall improvment of the game (Complete mod), or global mods which create an entirely new storyline. There are easily a couple of hundred hours on this game. I would recommend it to everyone, especially people who like post-apocalyptic genre, realism, atmosphere, and simply a well made game. My rating: 15 out of 10.			"

												Call Of Pripyat is the third (and newest S.T.A.L.K.E.R.) game. Gameplay is great, solid and fun. I've played through it three times and have never been dissapointed. Stalker's got one of the most active modding communities next to games that need the mods to run. (*Cough* Skyrim *cough* Fallout)Although different from Shadow Of Chernobyl, Call Of Pripyat is a fun and atmospheric shooter game that'll reel you in faster than you can die of radiation.			"

												One of the most polished of the three games in the STALKER series, Call of Pripyat does not fail to deliver on gameplay and story unlike Clear Sky. Though there are still many bugs present the modding community has managed to improve the quality of the game even more.If you do find yourself to enjoy this game head over to the GSC forums and look for mods by me, Alundaio. :D			"

												Probably the best unmodded Stalker game. You can't go wrong with this either. The atmosphere is still there, and it can still be very challenging on Master. You don't really need any gameplay mods for this on your first playthrough, but you can use Atmosfear, and Absolute Nature and Absolute Structures to improve the visuals. Make sure to turn off Nuclear Fallout and Psy Emissions in Atmosfear, those are crap. If you want a much harder early game experience, try the Misery mod. If you want tons of added content, use SGM.			"

												Hands down the best entry in the serie, i've enjoyed it a lot more than the original. Taking all the best features of Clear Sky and Shadow of Chernobyl on a single package, they got all the elements in the series just right with this gameGraphically it looks the same as Clear Sky with some improved effects and texturing, and yeah it plays the same than previous stalker games but adding a lot of great features. Also, its bug free compared to clear sky, the game is definitely polished in all areas and does the one thing a game in any genre should do... and that is the grin factor. How much does it make you want to play again and again. They also refined various elements that add value, no more fast money for selling ♥♥♥♥, you can't sell items below 75% damage. At the start you may find this a real pain and seek some kind of mod to reverse this, after playing through I feel it benefits to the desired role of artifacts and weapon value in the story.I hope there may be some light on the horizon called S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 in a near future, its a shame cause they were doing it right My veredict.. 9/10, amazing game.

												Unlike Clear Sky, CoP features all-new locations, which is one of its greatest strengths. It also features refined core mechanics, making it a true and worthy sequel to SoC in most ways. My only real criticism when comparing this to the other games in the series is the story. I won't post spoilers, but I felt as if the eerie and unsettling mystery that you unravel in the first game utterly trumps the story in CoP, and while the game certainly looks and plays better than SoC, the story falls quite flat by comparison. Which, given that (like the other games in the series) CoP doesn't hold your hand and other than the narrative there's not much to assist your sense of purpose in this open, desolate environment, means that I felt like I had less direction in this game than in both previous games. In saying that, it's a far more polished experience than Clear Sky, both in terms of the basic optimisation of the game and in terms of the game world. On top of that, the sound design is as fantastic as always (voice acting excepted), and the creatures are still ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying. So while I don't think this is the best game of the series, it is certainly my second favourite after SoC, and is absolutely a worthy sequel, and worth your time if you enjoyed any of the games before this one.

												The third and last in the series (both by release date and chronologically), Call of Pripyat is by far the most polished vanilla game in the series. Unlike the prior two, in which a vanilla playthrough of the game was... bearable, while mods made them excellent, Call of Pripyats vanilla playthrough is perfectly fine, although mods still greatly improve the game. The story continues, and although starts a separate storyline (of sorts) it does tie in to Strelok's own storyline, and with that it indirectly ties in to that of Scar's. Much like the previous two, mods can absolutely change your experience with this game, whether you're just downloading mods to help optimize the game or change it completely, Call of Pripyat has far more complete overhaul style mods than the last two, almost turning it into a different game. Misery, for example, is probably one of if not the most well known of then, which turns Call of Pripyat into a hardcore survival game that will truly test you. This, again, not  only allows for a user to tailor the gameplay to their preference (and its performance to their rig), but also adds a ton of replayability.Much like the last two in the series it is excellent with tons of replayability and a great story to boot, worth every penny.

												Fallout 3 has always been my favorite game of all time. If you're a fan of the recent fallout games then you will fall in love with Stalker Call of Pripyat. This game honestly blows me away (Litterally, in-game). The atmosphere is wonderfully eerie, especially at night.Pair this game with the Call of Pripyat Complete Mod and you will ejaculate on your keyboard while crapping your pants. The mod will enhance the atmosphere and gameplay greatly! Night time will actually be pitch black darkness and the only thing you'll see is the silhouette of the hills against the night sky. The only way of being aware of your surroundings is to crank up your volume and listen out for the horrors that might be lurking around you as you trek through this open world. Your flashlight is your best friend at night and can also be your enemy, as it will reveal what is in the total darkness and cause you to crap your pants. Night vision goggles/scopes are a huge help. After installing the mod, i never went back to the vanilla version, and it made this game into a horror game. It's hard to play the game at night (in-game) cause i found it wayyy to scary. I've played my fair share of horror games, but this was a little too much for me, thanks to the Complete ModFYI, the mod is PURELY a graphics mod. It visually enhances the game to add more ""realism"" and i highly recommend downloading it20/10!!!! This game is pure addrenaline and survival when paired with the Call of Pripyat Complete Mod! The Vanilla version would be a 10/10 for me. This game is amazing and needs to be put out there more. It's rare that games will forever leave an impression on me and this is one of those gamesGet this game, download that graphics mod, start up the game, and head over to the abandonded city of Pripyat at night. Prepare to Alt+F4 when you get there			"

												After spending more than a year playing the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games I finally completed the trilogy.  It took me so long, I think, because I was almost afraid to play the games sometimes.  Not in a scary game sort of way but in a I-never-want-this-to-end sort of way.  I didn't want to proceed until I felt I'd fully absorbed certain elements of the story.  The choices you are forced to make in the games are compelling and have had a lasting effect on me.  I'm am a little sad that the journey is over for now.CoP seemed to differ from the previous games in that it was a fair amount more approachable to newcomers.  The first two games were unforgiving and had a marginally tough learning curve.  GSC prettied up the HUD a little, which made managing your character less of a chore.  But the gameplay was still the awesome gameplay from the first two games and the story was just as compelling as SoC.I can't recommend these games enough.  Play them now.			"

												This is aside of the Borderlands-series the only open world-game I really enjoyed and that didn't start to be boring after a certain amount of time. It manages to capture this postapocalyptic feeling in a much more realistic way than for example the Fallout series and the constant feel of danger. As, how the game puts it: Not the factions or the mutants are your true enemy here. The Zone itself is what truly wants to kill you, spit on your corpse and kick you out again. And this hostile environment is in no other game better captured than in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. Especially the beginning until you have your first ""real"" gear the zone will toy with you like your a dandelion seed in a hurricane. PROS:+ So far the perfect example of ""hostile environment""+ Manages to convey the dullness and loneliness+ Gun play is good+ Incredible amounts of mods - recommend you to go to modDB since they should have most mods up there+ Due to being quite old it also runs on potatoes+ Graphics can be pushed with mods to look decent even nowadays, especially ATMOSF.E.A.R. - a weather mod does a tremendous job CONS:- Especially on higher difficulties (and with difficulty-increasing mods) very unforgiving- You will die a lot in the beginning as the game has the same concept of a ""tutorial"" as the Souls-series (none)- Nothing for those with problems with jump scares - not as much as the game does it on purpose, but you WILL sometimes just hear a mutant a split second before it is on top of you			"

												Do you like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, but hate all the crashes, the inability to repair items, the wonky bugs, repetitive quests, the generally random-yet-static game world, unbalanced trade system, semi-useless factions, unintelligible story, confided customization system and the frequent loading screens? Call of Pripyat fixes all these problems admirably and delivers a far more focused and streamlined version of what is already my favorite PC game. While it's not quite as ""Special"" as the original, CoP is a superior game in almost every way when compared to its predecessor. The game is as stable as a brick house, the upgrade system is simple yet satisfying and worthwhile, the story is more involving and fleshed out, and while several quests do repeat, their only purpose is to fatten up your wallet which, thanks to the rebalanced economy, is entirely optional (no more 200000 RU Exoskeleton!). Furthermore, your actions really do seem to bring a measure of change to the Zone.			"

												The third STALKER game finds itself as the first one I played the entire way through. The polish is actually there, the guns are much improved. Mission design isn't actually bugged and the game can be much easier than previous entries. I much prefer to recommend it to others over the first two, because it follows a more Bethesda-RPG path and is a bit more open world, with 3 major maps and 6 contained zones. The meeting areas in the ship, train-station and laundramat bring back the whole comfort in numbers/fear in solitude dynamic that Clear Sky messed up on.Though, the broken messes of the original's demise seemed to suck a bit of the STALKER magic from the game. Every location is played out on the map and seems to all share a purpose, some more obvious than others. I wish loners would populate some of these areas after the threat has cleared, it sometimes feels some of these were just left fortotten.Duty & Freedom find themselves with reduced numbers, with control only over Yanov, so the large scale fights feel very toned down. Even in the game's third act in Pripyat I was really expecting some sort of large scale battle, because the shootouts in Pyripyat in ShoC or the assault on the Freedom HQ led themselves to some of the highlights in prior games. X-8 played situational horror more than anthing more subtle in prior labs, or the huge army of monolith in X-19The graphics are stunning in a very bizarre game.

The new Chimera can be one scary ♥♥♥♥♥ to find out in the open.Well the third act was lined with disappointments the endgame of actual freeroam is a haven to players who loved the RPG aspects over all else, and they included enough of a threat to not suck the fun out of the game.9/10			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ranks easily in one of my favorite games of all time. It's an unstable, bug-laden, often-mistranslated with cheating AI piece of game, but god does it do something good.The ambience, the stress, the setting, the mechanics... Everything that makes an open-world survival game great, way before the recent survival craze on steam. The game is hard as balls by concept, and would have it no other way. If it reminds you of the Metro series, well, there's a good reason: much of the same people who worked for GSC Game World fo the Stalker series went to do Metro for 4A games. In a sad turn of events, GSC Game World screwed over its employees, and has basically died since this game has come out, so we might never see a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game again.Call of Pripyat is arguably the best game in the series due to it relative stability and more mature gameplay mechanics, where Shadow of Chernobyl feels rough around the edges and Clear Sky is just instable and buggy as balls. The main character story was more interesting in Shadow, was utterly uninteresting in Clear Sky, and is mildly interesting this time around in CoP due to a few other characters,,,You like FPSes, survival games, getting out of here stalker, open-world games, russians swearing, looking at X-Ray engine crash dumps, and crouching in radioactive mud because you're being sniped at midnight by bandits? Buy this game. Now,			"

												Gritty, hostile, and downright unnerving at times, Call of Pripyat is a worthy sequel to Shadow of Chernobyl compared to the trainwreck that was Clear Sky.

												By itself, Call of Pripyat is alright and mostly recommendable - way better than Clear Sky, but still far from delivering on the original promise of the STALKER concept. As all of them, CoP is genuinely at its best when you're left to roam freely, explore, scavenge, pick your own battles and soak in the atmosphere. The linear parts of the game are forgettable and the graphics, well, I guess there the engine is starting to show it's age. But it's pretty alright.However, the Misery mod for Call of Pripyat makes it an absolute hardcore survival masterpiece. It is by far the toughest, most fully-featured, and mercilessly dreary single-player survivor shooter out there - nothing comes even close. It always walks that fine line between jaw-droppingly challenging, frightening and just kind of stupidly insane, and that definitely makes it not everyone's cup of tea. The name doesn't lie - you can say a lot of things about Misery, but it's hard to call it ""fun"". It is a game out to murder you, both with bullets and monster claws, AND with its complex inventory/item/health/trade system which forces you to think about a lot more than just armor and bullets. Maintaining your health, stamina and the state of your gear isn't simply a matter of walking up to a couple of stations and spending some currency - oh no, this game throws one of the most arcane inventory/item/stats management systems out there at you while providing virtually no instructions, charts or stats bars, only vague indicators. For every new nifty acquisition there is a price - cheap food is radioactive, suits with gas masks constrain and muddy your vision, and carrying more than just bare necessities makes you constantly run out of stamina, even from just walking. It gives you few cues on who is friend and foe, and foes will drop you with deathly-accurate fire from long range. You will die. A lot. But in the process of making you miserable, Misery inspires not just respect and curiosity for the Zone (like STALKER games are wont to do), but sheer awe and terror of the place. It's a game that, many times, made me basically forget everything I was doing and RUN for my (virtual) life, as far as my realistically-puny stamina would allow - not through scripted setpieces like horror games do, but through sheer incidental immersion in the gameworld, which I knew at that moment just happened to be randomly trying to murder me. Even after many days of play, it repeatedly turned me into a lowly scavenger, hunting mutated pigs for something to eat, racing NPCs to a dead bodies just to get some loot off it before they cleaned it all up, and spending as much as 2 weeks of game-time just to scrounge up enough cash for a brand new gun that - gasp - actually works and doesn't jam all the damn time!So yeah, while I think Call of Pripyat by itself is just barely recommendable as an alright game, I give a very hearty recommendation to the Misery mod - with the warning that it takes a certain kind of masochistic player to properly enjoy its hatefully hardcore survival charm.

 Originally posted on December 26, 2010 After being let down by Clear Sky's unfinished gameplay, I was wary of Call of Pripyat, and although the game is beginning to seem a bit dated, it is still tons of fun.Graphics-The game looks both technically artistically brilliant. While the engine is beginning to show its age outdoors at long distances, the lighting effects, foliage, clouds, and especially the decaying urban environments all look fantastic. I have only played the game maxed with DX10, so I can't attest to how great the DX11 features look. However, even so, the game looks and plays phenomenally.Sound-The music and atmospheric noises are as good as ever, and the voice acting is decent, which is good for a game from Ukraine.Gameplay-They've really integrated features that worked from Clear Sky with features from Shadow of Chernobyl. You can upgrade weapons and repair them, using special calibration tools (which are a bit too difficult to find), but ballistics feels much more like it did in the first, and the focus is much less on combat with humans and much more on exploring and finding mutants. Factions are in place, but no one will attack you on sight unless you've made an enemy of them. Even bandits. This makes for some interesting interactions out in the wild. There are now blowouts which require you to hide indoors or you will die. Gone is the wonky factional combat from clear sky, and perhaps most importantly, gone are the bugs, glitches, crashes, and other instability issues. That stability is what makes Call of Pripyat so refined.The story is weaker compared to the first, but it is still quite good, and the atmosphere of the game itself is great. If you liked STALKER, you won't be disappointed by Call of Pripyat. That being said, I'm expecting big things from STALKER 2. They've had plenty of time to refine their formula and train their skills. Now it's time to shine.			"

												The last piece in the Stalker trilogy. The Zone is ever so dangerous, and emissions happen every now and then. In this final chapter the game isnt so different. Although the gameplay area is totally new consisting of three big maps (it is smaller than its predecessors, so the storyline is shorter), there are few other changes since the last game. Call of Pripyat is propably the most stable one of the three, which is a good thing.The Protagonist is part of a military investigation, but he is not considered enemy among other stalkers. The main storyline mission is about finding the remains of crashed military helicopters, and determing what happened to them. Of course there are lots of side missions, and places to visit just for laughs. The CNPP is not involved in the game, instead the final destination is the city of Pripyat.There are less mods made to this game, probably because it is the newest in the gameseries, but most of the mods are compatible with the steam version, and they will enhance the gameplay experience quite a bit.Definitely better than Clear Sky but cant compete with Shadow of Chernobyl.

												Fallout 3 has always been my favorite game of all time. If you're a fan of the recent fallout games then you will fall in love with Stalker Call of Pripyat. This game honestly blows me away (Litterally, in-game). The atmosphere is wonderfully eerie, especially at night.Pair this game with the Call of Pripyat Complete Mod and you will ejaculate on your keyboard while crapping your pants. The mod will enhance the atmosphere and gameplay greatly! Night time will actually be pitch black darkness and the only thing you'll see is the silhouette of the hills against the night sky. The only way of being aware of your surroundings is to crank up your volume and listen out for the horrors that might be lurking around you as you trek through this open world. Your flashlight is your best friend at night and can also be your enemy, as it will reveal what is in the total darkness and cause you to crap your pants. Night vision goggles/scopes are a huge help. After installing the mod, i never went back to the vanilla version, and it made this game into a horror game. It's hard to play the game at night (in-game) cause i found it wayyy to scary. I've played my fair share of horror games, but this was a little too much for me, thanks to the Complete ModFYI, the mod is PURELY a graphics mod. It visually enhances the game to add more ""realism"" and i highly recommend downloading it20/10!!!! This game is pure addrenaline and survival when paired with the Call of Pripyat Complete Mod! The Vanilla version would be a 10/10 for me. This game is amazing and needs to be put out there more. It's rare that games will forever leave an impression on me and this is one of those gamesGet this game, download that graphics mod, start up the game, and head over to the abandonded city of Pripyat at night.

As you play it seems like theres less and less lag expecially if you hang around relatively the same areas. I read up on what causes the lag and it's supposidly the AI activating and deactivating as you move accross the map.But even with the momentary freezing and lag its still and epic game alway keeps you on edge and aways a fun challenge trying to survive the horrors of chernobol.

												The STALKER series is notorious for being an amaziing immersive astmospheric mix of FPS, RPG and Horror. Call of Pripyat is by far the best in the series when it comes to guns and ccombat. Finding a gun you really like and being able to upgrade your weapon to how you want and putting your life and trust into one gun to help survive out in the harsh world of STALKER makes the atmosphere and immersion far beyond any FPS game has ever even came close to. The world of Pripyat makes for a great RPG and creepy atmoshere. Creeping around at night in the dark with all the horrible sounds going on around you makes you really appreciate a good atmosphere in a game and also that your gun is fully loaded and your reflexes are fast enough to be ready for what could be coming at your through the darkness at any moment. Open world and plenty of side quests and NPC to make for a great RPG and enough guns to keep you playing for hours. Although the story starts off pretty good, it ends pretty weak compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, which has an amazing story with 13 endings! DDo yourself a favor and buy the whole series and then download STALKER Complete for each game. These are bug fix mods and tweaks. They fix most if the major glitches and problems the vanilla games have. Also, check out LURK ffor Shadow Chernobyl and Misery for Call of Pripyat for the best possible way to play STALKER - Shadow of Chernoyble and STALKER Call of Pripyat.			"

												The third installment in the series and clearly the superior in manny ways. The only problem I have with Call of Pripyat is the lack of exploration, and since I played each STALKER game in order I feel that this one reverted from the progress they made from 1st to the 2nd game in the series. I feel like there is much less to do but much more cluttering side stuff. It feels like an RPG more so than the previous. I still however recommend this highly due to the general feeling of the game, smaller but more packed. Mods are also quite supported and I will recommend that you do a second playthrough with the ""Misery"" mod installed.Overall: Same as all the other games in the series a must have  but it feels very distant due to the missing of actuall chernobyl for some reason. 9/10...

												An open world with great combat. There's really no other game like it.I'd say CoP is the best STALKER of the series. It's the most polished of the bunch. Less glitches, better combat, just about everything is an improvment over the first two games. And don't forget to download the STALKER Complete mod. It improves the graphics and other small things without changing the vanilla gameplay.http://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-pripyat-complete "

												This game doesn't have best graphics, nor engine. But it has that sort of vibe, that no other post-apocalyptic title, has ever surpassed. In Zone, you can be killed at any time, by almost everything, and that makes STALKER's atmosphere. Played this game on disk for over a year, and so far i don't think i wasted those 20 euros for simple post-apocalyptic shooter.PS - Also recommend using Call of Pripyat Complete or Call of Chernobly modification for more addictive gameplay.

												STALKER is basically Fallout's perpetually-grim alcoholic Ukrainian cousin who happens to have an avid, borderline-obsessive interest in mutated animals and bloated psychic dwarfs clad in oversized robes. (Believe me, they're a lot more intimidating than you might believe!)Essentially, STALKER is a highly atmospheric FPS sandbox with a lot of survival mechanics (the need to eat, manage wounds and radiation sickness, etc.) that also includes some horror elements. (Although I believe the original - Shadow of Chernobyl - was focused on horror more than CoP is)Overall it can be a very tense experience. I would certainly recommend picking this up if you like shooters that go off the beaten track and have quite a unique world to explore, as Call of Pripyat has done exactly that!			"

												The third STALKER game finds itself as the first one I played the entire way through. The polish is actually there, the guns are much improved. Mission design isn't actually bugged and the game can be much easier than previous entries. I much prefer to recommend it to others over the first two, because it follows a more Bethesda-RPG path and is a bit more open world, with 3 major maps and 6 contained zones. The meeting areas in the ship, train-station and laundramat bring back the whole comfort in numbers/fear in solitude dynamic that Clear Sky messed up on.Though, the broken messes of the original's demise seemed to suck a bit of the STALKER magic from the game. Every location is played out on the map and seems to all share a purpose, some more obvious than others. I wish loners would populate some of these areas after the threat has cleared, it sometimes feels some of these were just left fortotten.Duty & Freedom find themselves with reduced numbers, with control only over Yanov, so the large scale fights feel very toned down. Even in the game's third act in Pripyat I was really expecting some sort of large scale battle, because the shootouts in Pyripyat in ShoC or the assault on the Freedom HQ led themselves to some of the highlights in prior games. X-8 played situational horror more than anthing more subtle in prior labs, or the huge army of monolith in X-19The graphics are stunning in a very bizarre game. Its 6 years old and I've yet to see more involving shadow effects. Some may be technically more subtle but none actually change the enviornment as much. The new Chimera can be one scary ♥♥♥♥♥ to find out in the open.Well the third act was lined with disappointments the endgame of actual freeroam is a haven to players who loved the RPG aspects over all else, and they included enough of a threat to not suck the fun out of the game.9/10			"

												STALKER is...well, it's very Russian. If hilarious accents, bad translations and a ruthless difficulty (for the first 3 hours) turns you off, this will not sit well with you. Otherwise, you will enjoy the open gameplay, the strange creatures, and the zone itself. The shooting is solid enough, and has a decent weapon customization system, all tended to by a man you must first liquor up before he'll preform any upgrades. This is a game designed for those who want challenge, and the freedom to go anywhere and do anything, without someone holding your hand constantly. Very nominally a survival-horror FPS, it's not all that scary; however, the atmosphere will suck you right in, if you'll let it. This is a good entry for folks new to the series - easier than the previous two, and much more user-friendly. I recommend it whole-heartedly. There is also a rather large mod scene that I would suggest folks look into (after the first playthrough, of course).			"

												Do you like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, but hate all the crashes, the inability to repair items, the wonky bugs, repetitive quests, the generally random-yet-static game world, unbalanced trade system, semi-useless factions, unintelligible story, confided customization system and the frequent loading screens? Call of Pripyat fixes all these problems admirably and delivers a far more focused and streamlined version of what is already my favorite PC game. While it's not quite as ""Special"" as the original, CoP is a superior game in almost every way when compared to its predecessor. The game is as stable as a brick house, the upgrade system is simple yet satisfying and worthwhile, the story is more involving and fleshed out, and while several quests do repeat, their only purpose is to fatten up your wallet which, thanks to the rebalanced economy, is entirely optional (no more 200000 RU Exoskeleton!). Furthermore, your actions really do seem to bring a measure of change to the Zone.			"

												After spending more than a year playing the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games I finally completed the trilogy.  It took me so long, I think, because I was almost afraid to play the games sometimes.  Not in a scary game sort of way but in a I-never-want-this-to-end sort of way.  I didn't want to proceed until I felt I'd fully absorbed certain elements of the story.  The choices you are forced to make in the games are compelling and have had a lasting effect on me.  I'm am a little sad that the journey is over for now.CoP seemed to differ from the previous games in that it was a fair amount more approachable to newcomers.  The first two games were unforgiving and had a marginally tough learning curve.  GSC prettied up the HUD a little, which made managing your character less of a chore.  But the gameplay was still the awesome gameplay from the first two games and the story was just as compelling as SoC.I can't recommend these games enough.  Play them now.			"

After beating it at least once, give the MISERY mod a try; it makes the game much harder, much more realilistic, and dramatically improves the atmosphere. Even seasoned stalkers will jump every so often at a sound from the darkness.			"

												I have smashed out over 100 hours on this game, but not recorded on steam. This game, while somewhat shorter than Shadow of Chernobyl (what I found anyway) is also a lot less buggy, very few in fact that I encounted. Very smooth and this game also has a tight story that is put together well and has great weapons, characters, as well as voices being good and of course you have choice! You learn quickly not to just shoot on sight and also there are moments you need to get into cover, makes night hunting a little more nerve racking, because of emissions that can kill instantly. I really enjoyed the stealth and weapon modifications as well as the side quests and character quests. Also, there are amazing mods that just massively improve the gameplay to push it to the most amazing experience possible! A great ending if done right.			"

												Great Game. It combines some of the better features of Shadow of Chernobyl and Clear Sky, such as the unique weapons from Shadow of Chernoybl and the weapon/armor upgrades and repair from Clear Sky.  While not as long or having as many areas as either of the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, Call of Pripyat is still a great game to lose yourself in its atmospheric setting.			"

												Like any Stalker game I started out confused and overwhelmed. I was not sure where to go or what to do exactly. After a short while I began to figure things out and was noticing nice changes from the previous games. The story this time around is much more coherent than the original. The missions are similar to the other Stalkers but they seem to guide you along better. The original game would give me missions and no map marker for them, or the marker would be wrong. That caused many frustrating hours. I played through the majority of the new missions without any problems at all. It was quite a relief.The inventory system has been overhauled. It is a much cleaner interface and your weapons and armor are upgradeable. Also there are onscreen notifications if your weapons or armor start to wear down. Unlike the first two games you are able to repair items in CoP. The health system functions the same way, with bleeding and ruptures. You can also find and use many artifacts that give you certain bonuses as well as a nice dose of radiation. Though the artifacts were not nearly as prevalent as they were in the first two games.A lot of the same enemies make their way back into this sequel but are deadlier. The most memorable occurrence was my first bloodsucker encounter. It actually grabbed a hold of me and began to drain my blood. A truly frightening experience when it is pitch dark and the creature moves around invisible.The Stalker series is definitely not for every one. It is dark, gritty, and can sometimes be anxiety inducing. Yet I would still recommend it to anyone interested in shooters with some rpg elements. Once you get over the sleight learning curve it is truly a satisfying experience.			"

												Third part in the STALKER series. STALKER Call Of Pripyat brings out into the light Major Alexander Degtyarev.The protagonist is an agent for the Ukraine Security Service and his(your) task is to investigate the failure of the mission ""Operation Fairway"". You start undercover in a new area of The Zone and you're immediately sent into surviving since there is a long way until your first objective and safe area.The game picks up from where STALKER SoC left it and has improved graphics,map size and keeps all the changes Clear Sky had. In CoP the devs removed the quests for data required for upgrading your gear and they added tools that the mechanics can use(read the quests for instructions where to find them or Google it ). The user can easily explore and he can find hidden stashes no matter if they have or don't have the coords on his PDA.The game has only 3 huge areas with good quests, achievements, underground laboratories, new weapons and new information the military has left behind.It's your decision what to do with the information found and who do you want to help. At the end of the game the user encounters a familiar face that brings the knowlege of The Zone.Pros-Exoskeleton can now be upgraded and the user can run. ( later in the game )- Wonderful quests and new beautiful areas.- More nice stuff you don't want to miss- Work for what you want.Cons- Only 3 areas-Almost impossible to achieve good ending final mission being too hard.A true STALKER has no cons.I recommend that the user does all the quests for the full experience Call of Pripyat offers and I also recommend that you play this as vanilla for the best STALKER experience then you can mod it and have fun.Order of gameplay - STALKER CLEAR SKY -> STALKER SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL -> STALKER CALL OF PRIPYATOrder of appearance - STALKER SHADOW OF CHERNOBYL - STALKER CLEAR SKY - STALKER CALL OF PRIPYATWatch your back STALKER !

												I've replayed this game maybe 3 times now. It is a DAMNED good game in terms of creating a world that can really immerse you. Many times I've found myself wandering the Chernobyl wasteland and believing that I was actually in this depressing and dangerous world that STALKER has created. The graphics are dated (one of the first games to utilize dx11) but definitely not enough to take you out of that immersion. Some mods have added more graphical aspects that will immerse you even more so I recommend you look them up. The game itself runs pretty well and it does a superb job of setting up the atmosphere.For example, there are many decrepit buildings and sites that are riddled with strange and sometimes paranormal entities waiting to kill you, from zombies, bloodsuckers to ""poltergeists"" and even giant mutant things. This game will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you on many occasions. The world feels ""alive"" and many events happen as you pass it by (by alive I mean the ♥♥♥♥ out there waiting to kill you is palpable). This and the first STALKER really set the bar on how to make an immersive world using the nuclear disaster setting. You will find yourself replaying it after a while because the world is THAT interesting and many events can happen differently every playthrough. Pick it up on a sale, or buy it cause it really is that good of a game!			"

												Fun game. Pretty difficult (I'm playing on the second highest difficulty), but the ""huh, that tactic doesn't work against mutated slavic hillbillies that can kill me telepathically; let's try again!"" kind of difficult, rather than the ""I will rip a small child in half if I have to do this quest again!"" kind of difficult. It's pretty spooky, but not because of scripted jump scares- it's all about the atmosphere. How close was that mutated wolf-bear thing that just howled? What's up with all the gunshots? Was that thunder or- *neck bitten by vampire-cuddlefish thing* nope, those were footsteps. The story isn't really central to the game, but who cares about that when they're immersed in a three way player-vs-bandits-vs-mutants shootout in the middle of a radioactive anomaly field? No one!PS, I'm running this game on Windows 7 and it has some issues with lag and framerate drops; based on Youtube videos I've seen, it works better on XP.			"

												Right from the get-go, it should be said that this is a different game from Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl. In Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC), the entire game had a sense of mystery about it, a kind of unanswered questions vibe. It was a question of surviving the endless horrors of the Zone, of loud rain and calamitous thunder at night, and of breathtaking sunrises in the morning, as one gazes out at the brooding wilderness. It also encompassed a sense of massive and epic scale, as the player struggles for mere survival while the Monolith elite jealously guard the entrance to the Sarcophagus while the Ukrainian Military pours in all their best fighters, special forces armed to the teeth and guarded from above by a fleet of Mi-24 Hinds, to force their way through. Unsettling screams and distant gunfire at night, beautiful blood-red sunrises in the barren hills near the Army Warehouses, the haunting soundtrack of Cordon filling one's ears as stalkers wander aimlessly through the irradiated meadows, vengeance, melancholy, fear, and grandeur. THAT is the essence of SoC. Call of Pripyat gives off a different atmosphere. From the moment the player spawns, as he gazes out over the beautifully rendered swamps of Zaton, one gets the sense of opportunity. The Zone has been tamed, and there's money to be made here. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does somewhat lessen the more emotional experience of SoC. Soundtrack was good. Weapons were unique and fun each in their own way, with customization available for most (they weakened my dear Ots-14! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah!). Armor was plentiful, with many choices to pick (although no Merc Suit or Skat 9M). Characters were well-rounded, combat worked like a charm, the missions were sometimes tedious but on the whole more varied than the original game. I also particularly enjoyed the Factional Strife which one could get involved in in Call of Pripyat. I only wish that SoC had it. Playing the Loners and Bandits off on one another, or eschewing both in favor of the shadowy information dealer Owl makes the game much more lively, with some high-stakes plays to heighten the standing of your favoured faction. It is a pity one could not join the Mercenaries under Hatchet (what a swell guy!). I also liked the very idea of working with a fellow whose trade is the bartering of information (a valuable commodity in a place such as this!). I enjoyed the fact that some of these missions helped give one a sense of the scope of the Mercenary activities in the Zone, for they are without a doubt the most secretive faction.  Apparently they have some influential friends/allies. On the downside, I did not enjoy the fact that each weapon needed to be repaired before selling- this made the game much more difficult, especially since one needed to buy certain items in order to progress in the game. On the whole a fantastic game- not quite SoC, but worthy in its' own right.9.9/10			"

												ok sit down this is gonna be a long comment i have never played a stalker game but this one caught my eye and i bought it and thought well this will be good let me now rank that up to amazing ok my first day in the zone i spawned in a forest type area i walked forward and saw tow guys there so i ask them i saw the option can you get me to and i hit the first dafe zone you go to skadovske or how you spell it i went in talk to the guy named beard  talked to a guy that said i had to go retreive his case he hid in a car went to the place then i saw the first terriying enemy storks holly kittens on a pigstick they were scary they crawled on the ground with gas masks so i went in got lost found the stash went oout got back talked to him he gave me a couple of items and that concludes what i did in the first hour of the game a amazing game havent finished it yet i will though it is my duty			"

												Between the mods, the community (or crazies) that live and breath this game, and my own immutable curiousity of this title, I quickly realized that this was a solid purchase. I cant compare it to anything because nothing comes to mind. It feeels like a predecessor to Metro but I think that is only because they are both Russian. So thats not fair. But its precisely because it cant be easily grouped in with other games that you should buy it. Here are the mistakes I made that you should avoid. Do not immediately mod the game. It will be tempting. The All-In-One mod pack with AtmosFear 3 and Absolute Nature are just great. But without playing it vanilla first then you cant fully appreciate the mods. Dont spend your time making numerous saves because you arent sure what to sell and what to keep. Just go with it. Trust your gut. Move on. The game will be more fun. Also, pay attention to what people ssay. I lost focused during a few conversations fairly early on and I think I sold something that I needed to progress. Maybe I didnt. But I was stuck...somehow. And it was all because I got distracted by my GF yelling about something in the other room. It turned out to be a boy and now we are all very happy. I just wish she wouldnt distract me when Im trying to concentrate wheen its something she is perfectly capable of handling herself. The game is a classic. If you dont own it, get it. If you refuse to buy it get medicated and do not send me a friend request, ever.10/10 - would ignore a living room birth again			"

												Incredible atmosphere, challenging but not artificially difficult, impressive AI, and did I mention the atmosphere?The base game is great. The ""Complete"" mod is great for a first time player, and MISERY raises the immersion to levels where you are truly trying your best to survive in the Zone, hunting with your fellow STALKERs at the beginning to make your earnings by selling meat.There are few moments as memorable in gaming as my first contact with a controller, and this game will forever be remembered as one that did everything right, but appealed to too narrow an audience: players who like to take their time, get sucked into a world, and carefully plan their journey and reap their just rewards.

												First, Buy this game, Play without mods, complete game.Come back later on and then play one of the mods, one of the overhauls would be good (I forgot the name) think Complete one,Then finish that, if you like it, cool cool. if you don't.Go play MISERY Mod, once you've played misery mod, good luck trying to finish the game.Start with the option of having NOTHING, JUST A KNIFE.You normally start, or i did, surrounded by Zombies with a knife and flashlight that doesn't work, and then cry for an hour while zombies shoot you to hell.And have russian language setting, makes you feel like you're there.Obviously once you're out of that area, enjoy the mindset of ""OK!

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is a mystery to me. There are SO MANY problems with it, and yet I still enjoyed playing it. Is it a great game? NO. But is it a good game? MAYBE. I have seen other reviews claim CoP is a better, more challening Fallout, but this is simply not true.VISUALSEverything in this game is repetitive and ugly. I have seen multiple reviews, even professional ones, claim that the visuals in this game are great, and I absolutely do not see why! I am not talking about graphics, which are so obviously below standard it's not even worth criticism. No, I mean atmosphere and appearance. First, every area of the game has the same open fields, short hills, boring trees, bushes, and grass. There is nothing in the natural scene that is beautiful or scary (I even installed Atmosfear, which is a beautification mod). Every building is square and industrial, filled with empty, useless rooms. This, far and above, is awful to look at. CoP is FILLED with identical buildings! Second, the oft-cited tense and scary atmosphere is present, albeit rarely. Truly scary or tense moments are governed by the RNG and therefore often missing. One of the ""strengths"" of this game, similar to Skyrim, is how independent the world is. Monsters and NPCs will spawn semi-randomly and often collide with the player and each other. However, this also means that the chances a creature will appear in empty building #127 that you exploring is actually very rare. Often I navigated a creepy abandoned factory (they're all factories, remember?) at night, with only a flashlight to guide me, all the while expecting some monstrosity to come at me, and NOTHING HAPPENED. I would find my loot, and go back to the safe zone, yet again. Boring. The best creepy moments, were the scripted ones at the end of the game! (which were few)COMBATThe second thing this game is known for is the FPS combat. One positive element of the game is that almost any enemy can kill you all by itself. Supposedly, this means you have to be very cautious in any combat situation and fight tactically. In reality, combat is the simplest rinse-and-repeat affair I have seen in many other games. Human enemies are a great example. If you are within firing range they WILL hit you (apparently every fool in the zone is an expert marksman) and kill you in a few shots. So, what is the strategy to defeat them? Easy: 1) hide behind cover, 2) pop out and headshot him, 3) consume a medkit to recover any damage. THAT'S IT. These three steps are pretty much the same for every enemy in the game, except for one that can go invisible (which is actually EASIER to kill). Headshots do very high damage (as they should in any serious FPS), but the moronic AI just stands there and shoots like a British Redcoat, so there is nothing stopping you from dropping enemies like flies. I have put hundreds of hours into TF2, so a headshot on a non-human player is like shooting fish in a barrel for me. I have literally stood in an open field, without cover, and killed four human attackers (NOT zombies) all firing at me without dying. Then, I just popped a couple medkits and waltzed away.WEAPONS/ARMOR/ITEMS*SPOILERS: I mention the names of weapon items, so if you want to learn them on your own, skip this section. *SPOILERS*There are many weapons in this game, however, half of them are nearly identical, many of them are completely useless, and the good weapons are both rare, and hardly used. First, all pistols are useless and can be abandoned in the first ten minutes of the game once you kill a single human enemy and take his rifle. Second, the first three assault rifles that you have access to are nearly identical, and the most common one you come across, the AKM-74/2, is a superior weapon for more than half the game. You can attach a scope and a grenade launcher to it. The next best rifle that is encountered in the second area of the game, TRs 301, is the literal successor to the first one. It too can be upgraded with scope and grenade launcher. This or the SGI-5k, will serve you for the rest of the game. Finally, all you need after this is a shotgun and again, the second shotgun you will likely encounter, the SPSA-14, will serve you for more than half the game. I easily beat the entire game with this assault rifle and shotgun combo. I never needed another weapon. There are several stronger special weapons, but the big problem is, you don't have access to them until you reach the final level, which is something like 80% into the game! So you get these cool new weapons, and no time to use them. BOO.Another note about weapons/armor. You can upgrade your weapons with technicians in safe areas, however, you have to find tools to give them to get access to the higher tier upgrades. It was an absolutely STUPID choice to put the final-tier tools in the last area of the game! Also, there is absolutely NO HINT where they are located, so you just have to exhaustively search every building in the final area to find them. What does this mean? Well, first, you will encounter every major enemy in the third area and kill it BEFORE you get the tools! Therefore, you will have fully explored the final area of the game BEFORE you can upgrade your weapons to the highest level! What that hell good is that!? What good is the amazing targeting scope on my sniper rifle when I already killed the 12 enemy fighters in the apartment building BEFORE I got it!? This is even worse with the armor. The best armor in the game does not allow you to run while wearing it until you have the final tier upgrade for it. Once again, this armor is completely uselss for 90% of the game.MAP LEVELSThe final frustrating element of this game is the map itself. So many players completely overlook that this game is really just a walking simulator. There is NO transportation or fast travel in this game. YOU. WALK. EVERYWHERE. Or more accurately, you sprint, walk, sprint, walk, eat a sausage, sprint, walk, sprint, walk, everywhere! You spend SO MUCH time walking! It's enfuriating. This game is not like Fallout/Skyrim where interesting events happen to you while you travel. At best you may happen upon some humans fending off a mutant attack. Honestly, the best strategy here is just to watch, because usually the mutants kill the humans, and you can loot their bodies. Otherwise, there is no reason to waste hours walking. To make matters worse, because your primary source of money in the game are special items called artifacts that are located in the far corners of each map and that respawn at random every few days, you will do A LOT of backtracking. Furthermore, the map is divided into three levels that you can only travel between by use of a guide. This ""guide"" is basically fast travel, since you talk to him, pay him money, and then you are instantly transported to the next area. You CANNOT access the other areas of the game on foot. You must PAY a guide to take you EVERY time you want to change levels (which is a lot). The reason for this is so obvious: the developers needed to separate all of the assets in the game so it wouldn't completely overload our computers. Finally, the third level of the game, which is really your primary goal, is both small and extremely short. What should be a climactic final level, is over in a handful of quests.Honestly, there are so many other things I could complain about, but I still choose to recommend this game because you can pick it up for nearly nothing during a sale. This game barely registers in the positive for me at a 6/10, but if you have a couple extra bucks come the next big sale, you may want to give it a try just to see what all the fuss is about.			"

												They really need to make another STALKER. A head shot is actually a headshot. Full body armor but no helmet? Yeah, shoot them in the head. Drop like a sack of potatoes. Enemy AI is pretty cool as well. Actually had an enemy fire directly at me while his buddies tried to flank me instead of just coming straight at me. The accuracy of the weapons are spot on as well. Your bullets dont seem to fly in a straight line especially if you're spraying lead like most other games. Searching anomilies is dangerous but fun. Ran around an anomily while running from a snork just to watch it try to run through it and get torn to shreds. It's a pretty amazing game. I would love to see another one made. Bigger, better, and with just a few more weapon and armor options. Just as long as the core game play stays the same. Someone needs to get STALKER 2 rolling! It's been long enough!			"

												Great open-world game. If you like Fallout 3, then consider the STALKER series Fallout on steroids. Combat is intense, against both humans and mutants alike, and a single headshot from an enemy is enough to take you out. You have an absurd amount of freedom in this game. If you want to shoot the guy giving you a mission, you can. If you want to shoot the guy who just rewarded you for completing a mission, you can. I've already been playing this game, CoP for about 15 hours and haven't even started with the mainline story missions, there's so much else you can do.Not to mention this game is so DYNAMIC. Enemies get into firefights if they're in opposing groups, or mutants against humans. Bandits and other stalkers will loot dead bodies after killing them. Wounded enemies can either be healed with one of your medkits or executed. Wild packs of mutants will kill human AI and drag their bodies off to be eaten. And anomolies don't discriminate against who they destroy. These are things that were in all of the STALKER games, mind you.If you do decide to get this game, be sure to download either the complete (better graphics, improved gameplay, bug fixes) or the Misery (same as Complete only a LOT harder) mods. They're a good pick for even a first time run through, though I would only do Misery if you are really patient and don't mind dying a lot.			"

												This game is great! Its pretty much Fallout in Russia from what I gathered. However, a true man doth not have felt difficulty until doth had played MISERY. This conversion for CoP is incredibly difficult and is not for the weak. However, the original game is still great, and MISERY adds tons more fun in terms of a much larger weapon variety and the need for acutal survival skills and good aim.			"

												S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat is an amazing sequel to the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series!Soo get your Vodka and your Aks STALKER!After finish all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R games(with no mods) i certainly love Pripyat the most.- The story is quite decent and the ending is not bad but its not as good as Shadow of Chernobyl- Theres tons of new cool features like achivements, a better upgrade system, sleep mechanic, and many more!- The animation and graphic certainly looks better- There is only 3 areas you can explore but the areas are bigger and i don't really mind that, in fact its better then waiting for annoying loading everytime you want to go somewhere- The new areas looks awesome and much more realistic- The Side quest i think is the best thing in this game - Theres tons of abandoned buildings and anomaly caves to explore!- weapons and armor can be repair and upgraded!Overall S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat to me is the BEST S.T.A.L.K.E.R gameMainly because theres tons of exploration and awesome side questI also feel like CoP is the easiest S.T.A.L.K.E.R game that or maybe im too good :vThe S.T.A.L.K.E.R games is a very amazing series and very underated in my opinion I never felt such unique and amazing expirence with these gamesWith each S.T.A.L.K.E.R games has their own main focus Shadow of Chernobyl (Atmosphere/Story), Clear Sky (Combat), and Call of Pripyat (Exploration)S.T.A.L.K.E.R could be my Favorite game series of all time!Now i'm taking a break after the feeling of being scared in SoC, Constantly getting shoted in CS, and Wander aimlessly hoping to find something in CoPAll those times i drink vodka to cure radiation and getting aimboted by bandits was great ahh good timesAnd now to Play the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series again with MODS!

												If you can ignore a few little technical problems here and there, this can be an immensely immersive, difficult, yet ultimately fun FPS-RPG. Unfortunately, this is the last of the 3 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, but it goes out with a bang. Great mods available too.

												One of the best shooters I have played. I highly reccomend to anyone who loves radiation based survival games and just over all shooter fans. Mutant animanls, zombies, the Russian military, mercenaries, and scavers called stalkers are what inhabit irradiated Pripyat. The game takes a little to get used to, but I love games that do not hold the player's hand.			"

												While an enjoyable game on its own, this game can support various mods to greatly expand its horizons. Suggested mods - 1.    MISERY - for its challenge and great amount of added content.2.    Call of Chernobyl - for all the locations added from each game, although quest content is low, there is still plenty to explore, collect, loot and shoot, with the mod creators updating it periodically. This is a freeplay mod, essentially.Both mods can be found on Moddb.Both of the above mods make the bloodsuckers almost always invisible when engaged, with no shimmer.This game does have some unintentional jump scares.The only drawbacks are the infrequent game crashes.I would recommend this game.

												Like Stalker SoC ( The first one to come out ) this game is primarily a fps game with rpg elements. Also like the first game I had a lot of enjoyment with it. Lots of areas to explore and things to do. Has lots of improvements over the previous game and  thus also does not have as much bugs.Like SoC you can easily spend 30+ hours playing it, possibly even more. It also has mods for it like SoC that improve gfx and so forth. Overall like SoC its a good game and I do recommend people to try both of these games.			"

												The STALKER* games are amazing. There is so much atmosphere. Imagine you are walking alone on a rainy night. Something is following you but you can't quite see it. You can sometimes hear it over the thunder and rain. Occasionally when there's lightening you see a silhouette on the ridge above you. You can't tell what it is. And you don't know if you have the firepower to kill it. So you keep moving towards your base. Glancing over your shoulder. Waiting for an attack that might not come. It's awesome. The weapons are great and the shooting mechanic feels incredible. It has a good story with many interesting locations. Highly recommended. *Shadow Over Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat are amazing. STALKER Clear Skies is just pretty good.			"
