												Personally I hate the thumbs-up or thumbs-down review method.  I clicked do not recommend because I myself would not want this game recommended to me.  Not because it is bad or broken but because I don't enjoy it enough to warrant the price.It is very well-polished, stable and the graphics are top-notch.  The UI is all click-based (think touch screen design) and easy to use.This game however is very simplistic and is not a deep game with lots of variety or replay value which is a hallmark of Rogue-like games.  Personally I would not call this game “Rogue-Like” at all as it has only passing similarities. Primarily it has procedurally generated levels and the notion of progressing through multiple levels but that’s about where the similarities end.  I guess you could be generous and call it Rogue-Lite – very lite.The game was designed as a mobile/tablet app and as so is intended for quick game play in between flights or while waiting at the doctor’s office.  It is not a “sit down at the PC for a few hours and build up your character game”. There are only 3 stats for your character (Strength, Wits and Luck) and two gear slots (weapon and head).   From these stats and items are derived your attack, dodge, defense and critical ratings.  Plus you have hit points.  That’s it – that all of it.  All of the equipment is pretty similar stat-wise and basically offer some combination of modifying the 3 stats and may offer specific damage type or defense.  There are 60 melee weapons and about 20 ranged ones.  There are 60 head gear items, many of which have the same stats and just different graphics.There are a total of 5 “classes” to choose from that you unlock while playing.  Their starting stats are all the same but each one has a unique ability they gain for a period of some moves when starting a level.  You level up each class separately. So in effect you are slowly upgrading each class over the course of the game – which is really the point of the game I guess.The levels are very small – you usually can clear each one in a few minutes. They are basically a few “rooms” (maybe 5-7) with some hallways connecting them.  Monster variety is limited with 28 different creatures.  Gear occasionally drops from creatures but “potions” can be found here and there on the ground.  The potions are unknown at start and you basically burn one to find out what they do.   On each level you will also find two resources scattered about. Metal which is used to level up the strength, Wits or max HP of a class between level runs and crystals which are use to randomly generate head gear and weapons between levels. It appears that all the available gear can be randomly generated and there are no unique items only found as drops. Monsters wander around levels and when they get close enough, or are attacked by a ranged weapon, move towards you and attack.  Then your only option is to click the monster and go back and forth taking damage until one of you dies.  Killing monsters has no benefit other than they may drop some gear (rarely) or metal (often).  Some of the monsters are not hostile and can be completely ignored. On many levels you can make it through the entire level without having to fight a single monster.There is no perma-death.  In fact there is no real death since you are a clone. You keep your character the entire length of time you play the game.  The only consistent aspect from session to session is the stat upgrades you purchase for each of the 5 classes between runs.  The entirety of the gameplay is to explore a level to try and grab as much metal and crystals as you can before proceeding to the next level.   Do this until you run out of life and die. Then respawn grab two new pieces of gear and do it over.  Just keep grinding metal and crystals to increase the stats of your classes.  Your gear is lost when you die (but it’s not a big deal since you can generate all new gear between levels) but any stat increases made on each class is kept. In summary if you are looking for a quick, low-depth game that centers on quickly grinding through as many small levels as possible before dying just to slowly build up a few stats without much power creep then you will probably like this game.  If, like me, you are looking for a deep game with lots of stats and equipment and skill options where you build up your very customizable character to progress as far as possible in a single dungeon then give this one a pass.

												Despite roguelikes being just about my favorite genre around, I am admittedly not the best at them. They generally require a level of dedication and persistence I'm just not able to give, but that's what had me so addicted to Shattered Planet. The game has a very simple and seamless one-click control system for movement and attacks as well as an incredibly clean and easy to use UI. Armed with only your headgear, trusty weapon, and a plethora of helpful and sometimes unidentified and dangerous items gathered along the way you'll be tasked with exploring deeper in to the broken pieces of this strange and ancient planet collecting as much resource as you can for your next trip. You will die and lose your items. A lot. The only question is how far can you make it before you fail, passing this heinous task onto the next unsuspecting clone?This is easily the most accessible, easy to get into and just plain fun roguelike of recent memory and yet still offers the same complexity and depth of other top games in the genre in terms of the huge scope of items, classes, events, and enviroments. At the center of the game is the Science Lab your cloned characters seem to be born from acting as the hub for your journey. You have tons of options here to prepare for the oncoming descent including the Clone Vat you're spawned from giving you multiple class and character appearance options, a shop to gamble crystals away for new equipment to save for later trips, a training console for using your hard-earned scrap to increase stats, and a pet cloner for storing DNA of found companions all unlocked through your progress on the unknown floors below.There are a multitude of modes to tackle all featuring engrossing procedurally generated alien landscapes, starting with the Explorer mode which is a progressive journey that slowly edges you deeper into the fragmented shards of these broken planets as you earn more scraps to better prepare yourself for each consecutive run.  Players also have three challenge modes of varying difficulty to test your wits after prolonged practice and equipment hoarding and last but certainly not least the Daily Challenge which gives everyone a new planet generated every day and predetermined gear to try their luck with.Shattered Planet is gorgeous and absolutely pleasing to the eyes to play, thanks to the stunning hand-drawn artwork and organic backgrounds that make you feel as though you've stepped into some otherworldly painting. The game has a very engaging sci-fi setting with a dystopic tale of impending human extinction, and while the overtone and story of your hundreds of re-cloned human explorers is mostly serious there are some very humorous moments in your adventures. For example, going into battle near the beginning of my career as an explorer with nothing but my Cabbage Helmet and a rolled-up newspaper as my weapon felt great everytime.Shattered Planet breathes a fresh breath of air into the roguelike genre and is easily recommendable for players of all skill levels, whether it be casual explorers looking for a relaxing bit of discovery and progression or more hardcore roguelike veterans who want to go for that perfect run on the daily challenge.

												Binary reviews (thumbs up or down) are not ideal for cases like this, but all in all I can't recommend Shattered Planet. While it's technically competent and visually attractive, with a nicely articulated sci fi theme, it unfortunately has little depth and a progression system solely based on grinding. I wasn't aware of the game's tablet roots when I picked it up, but they show through clearly in the design. The game is a roguelite in the truest sense of the word ""lite."" The mechanics, stats, and equipment system are all very rudimentary, with character progression limited to three attributes and a couple of additional skills. Equipment is limited to a helmet, active weapon, and a few consumables. Progress is made by playing the game, dying, then spending earned points (scrap metal and crystals) to upgrade these basic stats and purchase new starting equipment. In practice, this means playing slightly remixed versions of the same few levels over and over again while slowly building up the necessary strength and resources to progress. Skill and tactics don't really come into it, it's all down to a repetitive turn based grind to slowly push through to new material while constantly replaying the old. All in all, there's little to recommend Shattered Planet over roguelikes of greater depth and variety. It was fun for an hour or two, but by then I'd seen all of it that I cared to.			"

												Shattered Planet is a fine rogue RPG type that unfortunately, is designed for mobile systems in mind. Even so it is still a lot of fun to play on the PC but the lack of any keyboard integration is annoying to say the least since the game could easily be played through it. Also the inherent focus on the mobile market for this game makes it a tad less deep than the game could have been but for the price, it's still a pretty good game that offers good value for what it charges.The game is very easy to get into and is fun to play, at least for a while, most games don't even get this far so if you are a genre fan, check it out.

												I don't mind permanent unlocks in my rogue-like, but this isn't how you do it.In traditional ""proper"" rogue-likes you could win the game on your first attempt, but you won't, because you lack the knowledge required that comes from your previous attempts.In Shattered Planet you could never win on your first attempt, because you need to unlock permanent stat upgrades that are acquired by playing, collecting a few resources to buy upgrades, and then dying and starting over again.This fundamentally breaks a large part of what makes rogue-like games compelling, your skill and knowledge counts for nothing against the need to grind.The graphics are quite nice, and I like the idea of being perpetually pushed forward by the encroaching corruption, but the mechanics ruin it.Maybe you can reach a point where you have capped the stats, and then it's just your wits vs the game, but I'm not prepared to grind it out to find out.See also Vinraith's Steam review.

												A perfect example of a rogue-lite with procedurally generated levels. Progress is tied to finding new enemies,events, items, etc which then unlocks new characters. Most of the actual character progression happens via upgrades after a run which is similar to rogue legacy. Problems are a lack of information and deeper mechanics to get into. If you're a hardcore fan of Rogue-likes, you may find this too simple to really get into. But it's good for people looking for a rogue-lite that's relaxing or something to introduce the genre to a new player to.			"

												I like the humor of the game, I like the art. But I can't recommend it because of one glaring problem: there isn't much game.There are some different classes and a range of abilities. The problem is that everything is gotten through grind and that there's only about two tactics: walk up and bash things that you have to while avoiding others or manage to get a gun and kite things. The first way is the way you go because you don't have a gun. You try to survive as long as possible and die due to attrition. Skill is not going to save you here. If you have a gun and a shovel on the other hand you can survive anything. You'll eventually die simply because you get too bored to keep paying attention.A level basicly goes like this: enter a level, get as many goodies while taking the least possible damage and find a teleporter to get to the next level. If you're successfull, the game will quickly run out of things to throw at you. Expect to see the same levels and enemies time and time again, just in a randomized layout (which doesn't really change much)The only thing that stands out in this game are the random event tiles. Stones or stumps that look slightly different. If you click on them, you get an event, followed by a choise and a skill check. This is the best part of the game.In the end, the game relies a lot on grinding and doesn't offer enough variety or gameplay depth to back it up. You can have fun for an hour or two. You can pick it up at a very low price, but I recommend you quit playing once it's starting to feel a bit boring because it's not going to get any better. Don't buy this at full price.			"

												Going in blind only to find one of the most unique roguelikes I've ever played.  Story: 7.5/10The story is interesting and new for a roguelike. You are a clone generated on some sort of space station. You teleport to planets on a quest to scour and repair these shattered planets. You also have an alien scientist that helps you learn and explain the situation along the way -- I don't want to ruin any of it. xDGameplay: 8/10All you need is a mouse to control this game, and it's incredibly functional. There are multiple types of classes to choose from, at first just the Renegade and the Assassin. Each planet you travel to has increasing ""distances"" or levels, that each get harder, to collect items, scrap, and crystals. You mostly use scrap to level up stats and crystals to craft or buy items. You can also recycle items for scrap. You move around and attack by clicking, with only two equipment slots -- a helmet and a weapon. Your inventory can consist of health items, projectiles and potions.Graphics: 8/10An appetizing take on graphics choice for this type of isometric view. It's very reminiscent of something like Shadowrun, but a little more cartoonish. The different sprites for customizing your clone is very dynamic as well. Definitely a unique style.Sound: 6.5/10The atmospheric music fits the game well, but for a game with a pace like this I'd expect a little more action in the soundtrack. Still the mood of the music is so very appropriate for the melancholy of the worlds you're immersed in. The sound effects are a little repetitive and could be expanded upon as well.Overall: 7.5/10A solid game with lots of replayability and character customization. For any fan of roguelikes this is definitely a title you need to pick up and take a look at for a slightly different take on the genre. I think with maybe a few DLC releases, possibly some new music and weapons/armor/worlds, this could become a definite standout game. You won't be disappointed in this title.			"

												While this game might have some neat systems, it does fall flat in its core, which is surprisingly dull.Pros:-Good looking world, tiles are crunchy and very pleasing to look at-Fair amount of customization and replayability-Discovery system that rewards many actions keeps you willing to explore -Decent soundtrack-Very polished, feels a bit refreshing in a world filled with unfinished games-You can play as a robotNow for the bad part, which I feel outweight the good stuffCons:-While it does have a beautiful environment, character animations are awkward and clunky-Combat is crazy uninspired and unsatisfying; click to hit enemies, they hit you back, and then you can hit them again or away while they just follow you again. Several similar turn-based tile-based with single-character games handle this sort of combat miles better than Shattered Planet. Items can be used for various effects such as displacing them, damaging at a distance and so on, but the core is basically clicking and and clicking, with little tactical maneuvers to be done other than try to use narrow passages so only one creature can hit you at a time. It's just not engaging enough and I felt tired for just about 15 minutes of doing this.-Pets can't be controlled at all -Item gamble should've been only divided into weapon and armor rather than by tiers which are useless since you can keep gambling for the highest tier literally after five minutes and the other two are there just for show. Even then, after about 10 tries I got 9 headgear and a single weapon, which made runs fairly more annoying.-The game bases itself in exploration of planets, but in the end there's just very little to find from exploring other than a slightly different enemy that behaves exactly the same and a new tileset to a map that feels the same as the last oneOverall 4/10			"

												An invasive, shadowy substance known only as “the Blight” is creeping its way across the universe. One research vessel, outfitted with a mostly-naked Gekkian scientist, a random equipment generator, and an endless supply of clone explorers, has set out to understand and stop the Blight before it completely takes over. A nearby planet, shattered after a long-dead explosion, is putting off a Blight-resistant signal. Your assignment, as clones one-through-infinity, is to survey the planet, seek out the signal, and deal with any other bizarre challenges sent your way. There will be plenty.As a randomized survival RPG, Shattered Planet thrives on the unexpected. From the armor your clone wears down to the planet to the results of enemy encounters, nothing is directly under your control. A typical trip begins on your spaceship hub, where you can use R.O.S.A., the equipment generator, to create weapons and armor.  But you can only tell it what value of equipment to produce—bronze, silver, or gold—not specifically what item. You can also buy consumable items from the “Crystalobot,” a friendly vending machine that sells a variety of randomized goods ranging from healing items to pet companions.Once satisfied with your clone’s loadout, you send her to the planet’s surface to tackle either a limited-scope mission or an endless survival run.  Both play out in similar fashions, pitting your clone against a series of procedurally generated and progressively difficult levels connected via teleporters.  Missions end after a certain number of levels and goals have been met, while survival lasts as long as your clone does.  Depending on your gear and experience withplanet-exploration, that could be no time at all.There are a staggering number of ways to die in Shattered Planet, some more obvious than others.  Most of the local wildlife is fierce and unfriendly, hunting your clone as soon as they lay eyes on them beyond the fog of war.  The Blight itself, ever-oozing across the land, damages both health and fauna by turning creatures into deadlier versions of their former selves. Random encounters that might provide rewards just as often result in a surprise attack, curse, or other malady that degrades your clone for a short period. Luckily, since all actions are turn-based and time stops when your clone does, you have plenty of opportunity to plan ahead and either prepare for or avoid the dangers at hand.Encountering those dangers, taking the risk, and possibly earning a reward is half the fun, though. Slain enemies regularly drop golden scrap, which is used to perma-upgrade your clone as well as purchase consumables. Valuable items and crystals are often waiting just beyond those sharp-clawed crablets.Growing physically—by improving your Strength, Wits/Evasion, and Health—and mentally—by learning from your mistakes—allows you to travel further on the next run, earn more goodies, and keep the cycle going.The constant progression, rewards, and dangers keep Shattered Planet‘s gameplay engaging. But it’s the kooky inhabitants, unexpected encounters, and sheer charm of its world that will encourage teleporting down again and again.Shattered Planet has landed in the sweet spot between learnability and surprise that keeps each trip new, fresh, and entertaining. It’s packed with loot to discover, use, and inevitably lose as you fall victim to the many random and wild ways to die. Although each run plays similarly, you’ll never know exactly what you’re in for when you step on that teleporter—except a fun, ridiculous space exploration that can’t possibly be your last.			"

VERDICT: Shattered Planet is a fun, enjoyable and for the most part non-taxing casual rogue-like-lite. Though its an iOS port With a simple formula, its solid design and addictive gameplay offer a range of unique experiences ensuring the somewhat repetitive nature of gameplay doesnt detract with each playthrough.  With multiple game modes and a host of research items to discover it will keep your interest high for weeks if not months.  If you enjoy taking a character to explore small randomly generated maps, exprience many unique events, collect a vast amount of unique items, while fighting off enemy monsters then this could be something for you.  With minimal RPG elements, basic character skills and inventory management the game is a great little time killer between those larger budget games you no doubt play.... More info below ...01. GENRE: 2.5D Isometric, adventure, lite rogue-like, mobile port.02. SETTING: From your starship orbiting a strange unsurveyed planet, you take on the role of an expendable clone  created to conduct exploration missions and discover what is on the planet below.03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Once you step into the teleporter on your ship you are beamed onto the ground below.  Your mission is to explore the different areas of the planet which are split into levels. Arrayed across the map you will meet the indiginous people, an assortment of random and varied enemies to defeat, items to collect, events to experience and obstacles to overcome.  Your aim is to discover and catalogue serveral hundred elements unique to this world and in some modes reach the end level of the mission.  Standing in the way of progress is the deadly invincible blight, that follows you from the beginning of each level ready to infect and overcome every living being in its path.  To avoid succumming to its effect you must locate and reach teleporter that will transport you to the next level.04. GAME MODES: There are four types of game mode: the basic quest - Daily Challenge (10 levels), the Exploration Challenge (150+ levels) and the two harder Signal and Old Blood Challenges (10 levels).  All with their own objectives.05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Though the games biggest draw is the element of exploration resource collection and harvesting plays a big part.  Perhaps the game's greatest strength is the numerous gameplay mechanics included with its uncomplicated design.  Numerous playable archetypes(character types), several recruitable allies; melee and ranged combat with dozens of varieties of weapons, armors for protection, resistance and immunity to certain elements, collectibles for healing or boosting character stats and abilities.  The starting area of the starship contains several consoles and dispensers from which you can setup options such as character archetype, starting inventory for the next game.  They also allow you to upgrade character stats, choose your ally and, buy weapons, armors and item from dispensers using two resource types.  Resources include metals to upgrade stats and minerals which can be used to make other purchases.06. ENEMIES/OPPONENTS: There are too many to name here but the variety of enemies means it will take you a while to discover all of them and what their weaknesses are.  Sometimes you will not have the perfect weapon or item to quickly take care of them, so you will either have to improvise or flee.  The most common enemy types are: Crabs, Robots, Humanoid Natives and Plant-life. 07. LEVEL DESIGN: Levels consist of four or more areas defined by terrain.  Areas can number from four upwards depending on the game mode or the depth of level entered.  Terrain can be destroyed with weapons.  Levels are covered with events and collectibles provide the player with tough choices.  What to do or what to keep in order to remain intact and progress as far as possible.08. A.I: The A.I controlling the various npcs and enemy monsters does a good job of randomingly sending them towards or away from you so until you get too close they seem to be oblivious to you.  Unless you attack them of course.  As there is little interaction by the computer controlled critters the A.I is basic but good enough for the job.09. CONTROLS: Good basic keyboard and mouse controls.  For an iOS port, mouse control is up to the standard you would expect for PC games.10. GRAPHICS: The graphics are well-drawn and cute, if rather basic.  Overall the aesthetics are functional and nice.11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: A simple repeating melodic tune which changes when combat starts is the mainstay of the games sound.  Its apt but nothing to write home about.12. VOICE ACTING: Minimal but used to good effect during the tutorial and at key levels during certain game modes.13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: The game has a useful tutorial at the start.  Progression is measured almost perfectly with a learning curve that will match most players commitement to the game.  In addition achievements mark significant events so if you go after them you will learn more about how the game mechanics work and what you should be doing.14. PROBLEMS: Only a very few which required a restart at most.  More annoying than game-breaking.  Sometimes the tooltip for held inventory items can become stuck and take up part of the screen.  Only moving the mouse pointer over the item fixes this.  A few minor bugs with interacting inventory when buying items from the randomly located robot trader.   Sometimes this will lock up you game and you will be unable to move.  Can be fixed by restarting the game but any progress for that level will be lost.  Annoying but not game-breaking.  15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Actually a great mix of achievements.  A few teach you the games basics. Most though can be categorized as: Kill x y z; Complete each game mode; Complete n amount of research or upgrade character stats.  Just be warned that two to three achievements will need many hours to grind - at least and most likely more (2x kill 10000 critters).  Be aware that one achievement is unobtainable.  Complete ALL research is bugged with and events items not in the game. Unfortunately the game looks abandoned so dont expect any fixes.EDIT: 16 Mar 2016 - broken achievement removed.  Now 100% completeable.16. DLC: There are no dlc and none planned.  17. PLAYTIME: You could play most of what the game has to offer in around 25-30 hours.  That includes the 4 major game modes.  Though you would probably need to play around 50 hours to get your character up to the sort of level you will need to get to level 50 and beyond on the Exploration mode.  I have 100 hours with 70/71 achievements, the only remaining one is the bugged research probably requiring many more hours to get all the available research items. Something Im not bothered with.18. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  There is a massive amount of longevity and replayability in this game.  Yes the nature of gameplay is repetitive but which game isnt...  the game seems to be designed around this (as you'd expect) to a certain degree as its a mobile port.  19. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Anyone who likes rogue-likes or doesnt mind good mobile ports will enjoy playing this.  Though if you dont like casual games of a somewhat repetitive nature then it wont be for you.  Even though it has lite RPG elements I dont think there is enough for players who may want something deeper.  It really is something you can play for 5-15 minutes each day but no more than an hour or so.  Short spurts of fun.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Excellent a full price even if you only play twenty or so hours.  In a sale its a bargain.  If you intend to play this well-made game for longer then you'll get many weeks / months of entertainment for peanuts - no sweat.			"

												If there’s one thing that remains constant in Shattered Planet, it’s that you’re going to die, and die a lot.  Indeed, in this particular subset of the RPG genre, it’s not a matter of if you’re going to die, but just a matter of when.  Shattered Planet, as a space themed dungeon crawler, embraces the inevitability of death, taunting the player to conquer just one more floor before sealing their impending doom.As an isometric rogue-like adventure, Shattered Planet looks and plays very well.  The character sprites and environments are beautifully detailed, though the game lacks variety somewhat in the number of tile-sets and enemy types.  Similar to other games in the genre, combat is turn based, with the usual array of weapons, armor, and potions one would expect.  The main game mode, Explorer, throws the player into an infinite dungeon, and though each floor itself is short, the descent into the dungeon is effectively endless.  When the player succumbs to their inevitable death, all items found in the dungeon are lost, though currency is found on each run to spend in the waiting area on upgrades and character development, or the player can spin a random item wheel with 3 potential tiers.  Unfortunately, there is no real crafting system present, nor the ability to sell accumulated junk to for currency.Being an adaptation of a mobile port, the micro-transaction currency shop has been removed, though the mobile version is marketed as free to play.  At times, collecting currency to upgrade can seem to be frustratingly slow, as once you are teleported back to the main area, you will more than likely spend that currency obtaining new weapons, armor, and items for the next run.  The class variety is also somewhat narrow, with the only differentiation being a different starting bonus that wears off rather quickly.  While players receive experience and items for “identifying” new things found along each new run, it’s apparent that the variety of dungeon types and item-sets is limited.  After a few runs, everything begins to blend in and seem a bit familiar, leading to that undesirable tedium so often loathed as the “grind”.That’s not to say Shattered Planet is not a fun game in its own right.  Despite the lack of variety in the content, what’s there is well done and quite polished.  You might see the bulk of what Shattered Planet has to offer fairly quickly, but it’s enjoyable along the way.  Though there are five different player characters, they’re all similar enough that they essentially only differ in character sprites.  Of course, you could play through multiple times with different characters, but there doesn’t feel to be any reason to do so without more clearly a defined delineation between the classes.  The lack of a crafting system in Shattered Planet really feels like a missed opportunity.Though it has its roots as a mobile game, Shattered Planet is a surprisingly fun for what’s there.  While it may be one of the more stylistic rogue-likes to come out recently, the game would benefit greatly from additional content at its current $14.99 asking price.For more game reviews and in-depth information make sure to visit Feed Me Pixels[www.feedmepixels.com]. -Evilhippie "

												Roguelikes have consistently been a niche sub-genre despite their fervent fanbase, but their popularity has exploded with recent titles such as FTL: Faster Than Light, Rogue Legacy, and Dungeons of Dredmor. Joining the ranks is Shattered Planet, Kitfox Games' debut title. With smooth, vibrant graphics and an isometric layout, the game certainly holds an appeal its less graphically-inclined predecessors lack, but how does the gameplay hold up? In Shattered Planet, you play clones that have been created to explore alien habitats for science. Each area is randomly generated and has a teleporter that leads to the next ""distance."" You can choose to map out the entire location or move on as you see fit. In dire times, it's possible to jump down to the next distance from certain spots on the map, but at a high health cost. A blight grows from each spawn point per turn, and it threatens to consume the entire area. Blighted tiles deal damage when you walk across or stand on them. This creates a time factor to consider, as they can cut off paths. Enemies touched by the blight morph into more difficult versions, and they likely take the closest path towards the clone. You can go on general explorations to discover new locations, enemies, items, and events. Unlike the other missions, where dying results in the loss of all items, daily missions let you retain the provided starting gear if the clone makes it to distance 10. The galactic federation provides item boons as knowledge of the various worlds is unlocked. While traversing the land, the clone collects scrap and crystals, both a form of currency for different benefits. Scrap, often lying around or gained from killed enemies, enables upgrades to the Attack, Fate, and Health stats of clones across missions. Additionally, each of the five clone types has unique powers and a special activatable ability that can be upgraded for power or frequency of use. For example, the robot's abilities are: cross bridges for free, items are cheaper, and send an item back to base during a mission. Crystals, which are rarer, are used to roll for bronze-, silver-, or gold-rated headgear or weapons for future missions, to buy discovered items from the shop, or to bring an enemy clone as an ally on the next mission. Limited to one headgear, weapon, and three additional items per mission, it would be wise to choose carefully. Healing items are rather rare, but locations spawn potions of different colors, and their effects are a random roll each mission. They run the gamut of healing, damaging, buffs, and utility, and the effects are unknown until at least one use. So, the clone or an enemy could be a test subject, but my favorite choice is the ground. Events, which are often clickable objects that look out of place, provide two decisions to choose from, and often result in an ally, buff, or item. A shop is also available on each distance, which offers one fixed and one random item for scrap. Ultimately, the game is a gamble between how far the clone can survive exploring while coming out on top in items — losing too much health is an inevitable death sentence, but maybe, just maybe, there's a healing potion right around the corner from that big, nasty plant... only one way to find out! As Shattered Planet operates on an isometric grid, players click on the tile they wish to move to, and each tile advancement counts as a ""turn"" in the tactical meanderings of the Blight and enemies. The game automatically paths and displays the clone's potential movement from point A to B, but it is so poorly calculated that even if the same number of steps in a different manner will result in avoiding a blighted tile, the pathing will curiously land the clone right there. The alternative is to carefully plot points when such hostile environments exist; certainly not game breaking, but this could result in unintended damage when accidentally or hastily selecting a tile. Precisely because the game is reliant on clicking, rather than arrow keys, there lies a tendency to click on the furthest visible tile in a straight, clear line rather than inching forward, during which an enemy may spot the clone from the revealed shadows and attack before the pathing is even complete. Certainly, these gripes can be avoided by simply playing cautiously at all times and bludgeoning the devil in your head that goes ""LEEEROYYY JENKINSSSSS!!!"" My biggest issue with the game is its lack of data for practically everything. An accessible compendium provides generic descriptions and occasionally amusing blurbs regarding all maps, items, events, and enemies, but it has little to do with gameplay. Does an enemy do electric damage? What kind of enemies spawn here? How long does this effect last? It's thematic that no ""information"" will be collected until an enemy is killed (for dissection, I suppose), but when the game provides items that give elemental damage and resistances, it would be nice to know exactly what they are useful for. Considering that the clone doesn't start with or come across many weapons or armors in a mission, there is absolutely no way to try to engineer a better solution. Granted, the advisor on the ship occasionally quips helpful advice like, ""crablets are sensitive to blunt-type damage"" but he doesn't cover them all (I tried), and weapons are not categorized as blunt or sharp (surprise!). Item descriptions are fairly straightforward aside from those finer details, but everything else is a hit or miss. In spite of these shortcomings, the game is an addicting, enjoyable experience. The graphics are pleasing and the enemies so thematically crafted for each background type, such as grasslands, deserts, and tundra, that it barely matters that both background and enemies are frequently reused for different ""locations."" Each attack lands with a satisfying chunk, and I love the sweet, futuristic whir of the teleporter whisking the clone away from danger. Generally pleasant but forgettable, the background music fits the location's theme, and is often overshadowed by the sound effects. Shattered Planet aligns itself more as a rogue-lite rather than rogue-like, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. With polished graphics and engaging gameplay, it warrants an exploration for science. After all, who needs to live forever when you can just clone yourself!Recommended "

												This game isn't a masterpiece, but if you look for certain things you'll find them here.So, what can you expect?Solid content, everything works and is nicely crafted.Roguelike approach: you send clones to explore planets knowing they’ll horribly die, but on death you’ll lose only your items, not your coins, and you’re allowed to spend them in between runs to permanently improve your stats and skill and buy new items, so death isn’t too punitive, and the game can be hard, but never frustrating.Different kind of clones for different classes, you can switch between them during game and permanently power them up, this makes the game pretty grindy (rogue legacy like). I like it, but someone could not.Potions’ effects are randomized at the start of every run, so you have to try them to know what they do, and there are a lot of items with active or passive effects.Random events.Destructible terrain tiles, but only if you have certain items, I think this should have been a core mechanic, the game could have been a lot better.Exploration and discoveries, everything you do is rewarded, you unlock data for new terrain types, enemies, items, events, and every 10 new ones you get a reward.Elemental damage and resistances, so you can combo them on your equipment and items to unleash a hell you are immune to.Humor.Conclusions: There are a lot of things, but everything is pretty basic and already seen. The tactical gameplay is simple, click to attack plus some active items, the format become repetitive after a while and the total lack of a story doesn’t help it. The game is cool for some hours, and a nice option to entertain you while you’re doing some other stuff, like working or studying, so I think the base price is too high, but if you can buy it on discount it is something you could want in your game library.

												Love this game. I rate it 4 out of 5 sciencesI had some time with the Pre-Steam version and I am very happy to say that even in Early Access stage, SP is shaping up to be a great game. To put it simply... Shattered Planet is a lot of fun. You will explore.You will research.You will fight.You will die.All in the name of science.You are able to permanently level up the stats of your clone to make future expeditions a little easier.I've found that one of your biggest keys to success is chosing the right combo of weapon and headwear. There are tons of weapons, items, and headgear to choose from.  Some with interesting perks and nice stat boosts.Getting a pet to fight by your side is also a big help. Especially once you get further along on an expidition and the enemies get really brutal. Shattered Planet is a  gem in the current flood of rougelikes. "

												Warning, 1) This is a mobile game recycled for PC!2) There is absolutely NO SKILL involved in playing this game!3) The whole game is about grinding! You die and die again to accumulate ressources and level up, and leveling up is not interesting at all since all you gain is health and damage4) This is NOT a rogue like! With rogues there is a wealth of diversity in items, situations, exploration, and sometimes skills. This game has none of that, just a flat progression and grind, very bland!The game is not ""bad"" per say, but there is no reason to spend your money on this instead of something better. Grab it on a big sale, for a couple of dollars maybe, but full price this is a waste of money and time.			"

												This had the potential to be a really cool game. Nice graphics, sound, ambiance music. If it only possessed some content and a battle system that is more than ""go next to enemy by clicking, now... click on him"" Turn based is great, if you had options? You can if you were lucky to find any, heal of course, and then there's running away. Although running away means you will have an enemy one step behind you until you leave the level. The first hour or so, you think this is kinda cool, yeah you die alot and loose you weapons and items, but you find enough loot to make more so it doesn't matter, and leveling is quick even though it doesn't excactly make you feel that much stronger. But after awhile, it feels that when you're level 15, the first level you've been playing over and over should be pretty much be a walk in the park without getting injured. But a little bad luck with the item you generated before this run, and you get injured enough to know that you won't make it any farther this run either. So all you can do is try to find as much loot as you can, hoping it will be enough for 1 more level and weapons that won't suck so hard that the next run is a waste of time too.This started off great, but quickly got old, with no real story progression, the levels may change in design, but enemies are the same. The weapons you get really feels like playing a one armed bandit hoping for an item that makes the next 10minutes interesting and not, ""oh, well, die and try again"". And on your runs you can find bottles of unidentified liquid which does something different every time. The red liquid from last run that healed you, may now boost an enemy. Which isn't worth it, so me, I stayed away from using them fairly quickly, because they simply don't do enough that you should gamble a run you might have a decent weapon on.This game needs more content, a better battle system and something that makes a run feel a little more unique. The run can't be doomed to end earlier than the last from the start, you should feel that you can make it, with a little luck. I simply can't recommend it as it is.4.2/10			"

												Very nice rogue-like game where exploration is fun and rewarding above all else.  Adorable art style and object references,  Smooth and interactive gameplay and UI, solid mechanics and RPG element, it is a very enjoyable game.Shattered Planet's biggest strength and weakness is its progression system.  Between each run player can and should purchase permenant upgrades which increases the raw strength of the player.  This provides consistent progression after each run which can be very exciting.  However this also incentivise grinding to obtain more power in order to face tougher challenge instead of relying on luck and skill to overcome obstacles like a true rogue-like game.  Since the upgrades do not change the way you play, the game can become stale quickly.  Also the system imposes a cap on the game; you'll only play to purchase all upgrades and explore all of the contents.  The result is you receive a more finite experience than other rogue-like games, which can be a good thing for some players.All that said, I would still recommend this game to just about anyone.			"

												Shattered Planet is the kind of game I would not recommend to anyone. Without a doubt, I have fun with it, but after some hours, it feels kinda repetetive. You play as a clone (or rather many of them) and try to discover the ""shattered planet"" as good as you can. On each stage (distance) you have to find the teleporter to the next one, and you will encounter stronger and stronger enemies doing so. Money and resources you find while you are out on your mission are stacked into your bank, and back on the ship you can use it to craft items and develop your characters. The varieties of items is good, but after four hours of playing it, I rarely got a new one.There are some small things, that make this game different than others of his kind. For example the pets you can clone, the potions you can find and you have to discover them each mission again, cause they swap properties or the daily challenges.It is a really nice game to play in a break or play for ten to twenty minutes. But play it too long, and it gets a bit dull and repetetive.The controls are good, but you can see that it fits more on a mobile device like a smart phone (and yes, it is available for those ones, even for free if I am not wrong). Pros: - daily challgenges - potion system - challenging Cons: - no story - very repetetive			"

It's clean, I love the art style. It's quick - something I can jump into at any time and not be too concerned how long it might take me - great for those bits of free time I get between other things. Death is permanant in so far as you lose the items you were carrying, but really it's more about bringing back crystals and scrap metal, neither of which you lose on death.I like that I don't have to be TOO careful if I don't feel like it. Sometimes I speed run a game just to see if I get some lucky finds quickly - other times I take it slow and see just how far I can get - either way works depending on the mood I'm in.Throw in the item variety (though I could always use more), world randomization and persistance of your ship upgrades and you have something that works very well for me.

												Great UI. Great music. Good variety of items, from glorious to plain silly. Descriptions are often humorous, as are in-game events (Hitting enemies with a rolled up newspapers grants a bonus to Wits/crits. Because you are better informed... and i wont even mention the time i sang a song to a hatching egg).Gameplay is slick. True, it will get repetitive after a while, but it will be a good while and the ride is fun while it lasts. The visual presentation and lighthearted athmosphere keep the game going and you might struggle to put it away. Rougelite elements include equipment unlocks for future playthroughs, so-called permadeath, inability to pick exactly what items to start with, and several character classes to indipendentely level-up. As a nod to SOTS, diffrentely colored potions have diffrent effects on each playthrough.On occasion the game struck me as overly simplistic, but that may be because of concessions made to touch-screen devices. Gameplay is well designed and above all, fun! I thought i'd get 5 minutes of fun before moving on, but it's better than that.Strategic depth is not as great as other similar games, but the flipside is faster-paced gameplay, less confusion and a learning curve more focused on fun aspects of exploration. You won't need volumes of crafting guides for this game, and that may be a very good thing.Lack of tooltips has been mentioned in some reviews. Feedback is there it's just implemented another way. Damage types are color coded for example. While more information on damages or resistances would be nice, the game designers choose not to clutter the UI or make it too complex. Most of the time detailed information is not needed, as you would expect plant lifeforms to burn easily or robots to be vulerable to electricity.Overall, the gameplay is rewarding and fun which ofsets some simplistic design choices. Level layouts are fairly simple and screenshots do not present the game too well. I have no idea why it has no demo on Steam or anywhere else. Considering the asking price, it's a very good game.Recommended.			"

Death: Fully expected, often amusing!This little Roguelike RPG by Kitfox Games is what I think of as a great indie filler title to be played between bigger things, or for when you simply don't have the time to crack open a new AAA game.  Shattered Planet came out for mobile platforms first but holds up just fine on the PC.  It's genuinely refreshing & fun to play.That's because of the roguelike formula in Shattered Planet: not only is it no big deal to die & start over, but it's fully expected & incorporated into the design - those deaths can be entertaining, to boot.  As one expendable clone in a long line of alien fodder, you get beamed over to a new planet with every playthrough, & your clone doesn't leave, period!Progression is very straightforward: explore, fight & loot in order to earn training points for upgrading future clones & currency for purchasing new gear to equip newly minted clones.  The RPG upgrades are permanent & include the usual parameters for boosting health, damage, resistances, etc.  Grow more powerful, obtain stronger gear, explore more dangerous alien habitats, defeat deadlier enemies to earn more loot...the clone consuming cycle continues!The roguelike element is what you'd expect.  There are some mechanics in play to create urgency in your missions to explore & tame the alien wilds.  You'll find a nice variety of weapons, hats, consumables, enemies, events; a real sense of humor shines through the item & event descriptions.The overall effect of game design, the progression system & the lighthearted humor is a refreshingly carefree experience, moreso than I recall in any other roguelike.  You fight like hell to survive & explore as far as possible with each venture then spend your resources to start anew stronger (& hopefully better equipped) than before.  Sure, you lose all your gear, but buying new stuff is super simple.The game has a clean, sharp art style that I enjoy & enough variety of environments, creatures & weapons that it has some replayability.  I have only scratched the surface in regards to unlocking all items, planets, encounters, etc.With only a handful of hours logged I feel I've already got the game figured out, simple as it is; yet I foresee myself continuing to enjoy this long into the future, whenever I'm looking for a quick bit of fun.  Recommended for all.			"

												So I've played quite a bit of Shattered Planet, so I thought I'd give my thoughts. I've taken the Mercenary class up to level 60, and almost got all the items and things. For anyone that likes a simple, elegant game that you don't have to pump hours and hours into to play, then this is something you should try. Nice class system, beautiful landscapes and wonderful creature designs too. At first I thought that the small range of world types and short levels would become tiring, but because they are procedurally generated the awe of discovery is always there. I love that the mystery fluids are randomised each time, because you have to develop efficient and safe ways of trying them, or take the risk of using them blind! Having the daily challenge feature is AWESOME in my opinion, as it gives you a reason to come back every day, which then sets you off for another 45 minutes of fun. I wouldn't recommend playing this game LOTS as the set pieces and quests begin to lose their value, but play a little bit each day and you'll find yourself looking forward to the next daily challenge, the next quest! A few small gripes however, I wish there was a way to naturally increase fate that stays between adventures, as it is a little annoying to have a super powerful, 60 strength Mercenary fail an objective as I only have 5 fate :/ ah well. Even if it was suuuper expensive or something like that, it'd be worth it! I also think it would be cool to have some feature where you could quest for particualr weapons/items/encounters that you don't have somehow, as simply farming ROSA gets reeeeal old, especially when you don't know what quality weapon you are after.tl;drGAMEPLAY: 8.5/10REPLAYABILITY: 7.5/10- add in those weapon quests, and you've got yourself a 10 :)ART STYLE 10/10- just lovely to look at!STORY: 4/10- the blight is mysterious, and could be delved deeper into. It's not currently a game to play for story (in my opinion)OVERALL ENJOYMENT: 8/10OVERALL REMARK: if you're looking for a lite relief between story-heavy RPGs, give this little number a go.

												I always like to have a game on hand that I can play for a few minutes in between other games. Caves of Qud was that for a long time (at least until I got good enough to spend hours on it), Hero of the Kingdom was perfect, and even hidden object games have filled the bill at times. Coffee break games are a fine and necessary tradition, and Shattered Planet makes a strong showing in the genre. There's no telling how long it will stay strong for you, but it's worth diving into for as long as it does.Shattered Planet has you investigating a planet that has, well, shattered. You beam down from your tiny survey ship onto randomized islands suspended in the atmosphere, and wander around looking for the teleporter to the next bunch of islands. Along the way you'll come across alien life forms, strange liquids, bits of equipment, and all sorts of random events as you keep ahead of a blight that's consuming what's left of the land. You'll keep chugging along until something inevitably kills you, only to be re-cloned back on your ship for another go.During your sojourns you collect two kinds of currency, scrap metal and crystals, which can be spent on your ship. Crystals can generate random equipment (by default you start with nothing) and purchase pets to accompany you, and scrap buys consumable items and permanent upgrades to your class. There are five classes to unlock and over a dozen pets to capture and add to your menagerie so you have plenty of options for making each run a little different.Gameplay-wise, it's a lighter version of very traditional roguelikes. You navigate along a grid by turns, bump into enemies for melee combat, and use the scant items you find to survive as long as possible. Equipment isn't a common find in Shattered Planet (since you can generate your own on your ship) so the main finds on your expeditions are going to be vials of liquid. There's maybe a dozen of these, all different colors, and their effect is randomized and hidden every run. Some might heal you, some might poison, some might permanently strengthen, and some might explode. This is a holdover from classics like NetHack where you had to experiment with unidentified items but here it's just a pain, because it means the first vial of each color you find is either going to be wasted on testing or gambled on yourself. Another holdover is the blight, which functions like a timer on each level as it consumes tiles, but serves no real purpose because within the limited mechanics there's nothing to exploit by hanging around for too long.There's a multitude of biomes to explore, each with their own indigenous life and random events like haunted tree stumps and angry natives. Every time you encounter something new it gets added to a codex of the game's content, and at certain discovery milestones you get rewards. This is the real progression of  the game, filling out this codex, and I admit it can be tempting to push on for another run or two when you just have a few discoveries left to the next level. However, this is the ONLY progression in the game. There are no bosses, and no end to the main Discovery Mode, so your enjoyment of Shattered Planet is going to last as long as your interest in finding new things is.You do have a few options besides Discovery Mode, like the daily challenge with fixed equipment and the three scenarios that task you with specific objectives. They extend the lifespan of the game, but only so much. It's a bit of a cheap-feeling game as well, with stiff vector graphics animated in Flash style and a pretty limited spread of enemies to face. The sound design is fine, especially the music which fits the coffee break chill of the game perfectly. Shattered Planet doesn't aspire to much but does what it does well, and as long as you keep chasing the game's secrets you'll have a fine time with it.			"

												Oh man, this is so wonderful. I've played a whole ton of roguelikes over the years, and although I'm still quite early into it, I think Shattered Planet might be one of my favourites. Imagine Dungeons of Dredmor crossed with Outernauts, and you're sort of in the right ballpark.

												Reasons I love the game:Sci-Fi Setting!Cool Weapons!Daily Challenges!Pets!Random Loot Generator!Sci-Fi Setting! (Again!)I think the art style of this game is fantastic, and if you haven't guessed from the list above, I love sci-fi settings/game worlds. It allows for the artists and devs to create something cool and I always feel more immersed and exploritory when i run around in a futuristic universe. I enjoy the generation of the levels and progression. The main exploration mode involves fighting down randomly generated levels to find loot and kill creatures. The farther down the greater the risk and reward. Upon death, weapons and armor equiped are lost, but scrap (money) and crystals (shiney money) and kept to be spent leveling your stats, buying items at the vending machine and spending crystals to randomly generate loot. You can also unlock various classes which have different skins and abilites/buffs. You then gather your upgrades, equip your weapon, trusty headgear and pet and voyage back into the unknown. Kill more stuff, discover new events (which give crystals upon discovery) and enjoy the randomly generated worlds until death. Rinse, Repeat. (Did I mention you're a clone?)The daily challenges give me more incentive to test my skill, wether for a short time or for longer sessions. Daily challenges give the player a certain set of equipment to start with and the goal is to see how far one can get before death. Shattered Planet is a  highly enjoyable game made by highly responisive and interactive developers. Would highly recommend!			"

												Pretty though it is, as a roguelike, Shattered Planet should be judged primarily by its gameplay, which is sadly lacking.  You can equip only one weapon and one piece of armor, plus whatever consumables you can find (and you won't find many).  There's no concept of activated or even passive skills, either; gaining experience buys you stat increases only.  As such, combat - and the game in general - is nearly devoid of strategy, infrequently rising above mindless clicking.			"

Recommended: A somewhat slow and difficulty-prone meta progression doesn't stop Shattered Planet from being a pretty fun game. Much akin to something like FTL, there's as much fun to exploring this strange world as there is to the actual completion, and there's plenty of variety to be had in different playthroughs.  Well worth a look for someone looking for a short-run roguelike that's akin to actual rogue games rather than just being a shooter with procgen or the like.Read the full review here[www.highlandarrow.com] "

												This game feels like it has less to offer than your standard flash game.There is no depth, no story, and the combat is just ""You hit them, then they hit you.""Your character has one ability that they can use once during a run. (Unless you pay a hefty sum to upgrade) The abilities are not anything interesting. Heal yourself 30 hp. (You start with 100) Deposit an item for the cost of a large sum of money, ect. Just boring and uninspired. The reward you get for completing or dying in a run are shards which are used to buy a temporary item to use on your next run or money which is used to upgrade 1 of your characters three stats. (HP, Strength, or Dodge)This game entire gameplay is about seeing all of the items and enemies once. All this game has to offer are pretty sprites. Nothing more. Not worth the try.			"

												Too simple and game progression feels empty and meaningless. The first few play sessions will see you upgrade your helmet and weapon once or twice before you die. But soon you'll be dying with the equipment you started your play session with, as new equipment rarely drops and its even rarer that its any better than the stuff that you already have. You'll have the chance to permanently upgrade ""Strength"", ""Wits"", and hitpoints of your character before heading out, but it doesn't feel like it has much immediate impact. Over the long term those upgrades are sure to add up, but there isn't enough compelling content in the game to keep me going until that happens.If you happen to see this on a deep discount it might be worth picking up, otherwise there are much better ""rogue-lites"" on Steam to spend your money on.

												Very simplistic and repetitive game. Fun for 2 hours, but after that there is no variety to speak of.  Can't recommend this game even for free when there are free games out there that have more depth and variety than this game does. One to name would be Stone Soup, it has way more depth and variety than this game. Has greater replayability, more roguelike gameplay and more features. Only thing going for Shattered Planet is the art and look of it.   So all in all, look elsewhere if you want this type of game. Don't buy this even at 75 % off sale.			"

												If you can get it cheap enough, it's good for at least 5 hours of play.The level up system is strictly a grind that is only accessible after you die.  It is very underpowered and requires hours of grinding before noticing a difference.Unlike hardcore rogue-likes, you only lose your inventory when you die.  Generating equipment doesn't feel very randomized and you end up with the same garbage over and over again.  You only have 2 equip slots; 1 weapon and 1 helmet.  You can choose a character to play, but they level up independently and have very little and sometimes insignificant differences.  Usually they have 1 passive (which is generally an insignificant stat boost) and 1 ability (useful in most cases, but can only use a limited number of times depending on how often you level it up).The only things you need to get through 30 floors is a shovel and multiple teleport guns (which are easily found).  There is little incentive for killing mobs (very little loot).The overarching ""goal"" of the game is to fill the archive with information such as mobs, items, weapons, helmets, terrain and guns.  As an example of how frustrating this is, I looked at the guns section and found that I had discovered 33% of them after 10 hours of gameplay.  The problem is that I've seen every version of those 33% at least 10 times each.  There may be a ""secret"" to finding other guns, but the game provides little guidence.Mobs do a lot more damage than you recieve healing items.  Some of the larger mobs are pointless to fight because of how much damage they do compared to the little to no loot they provide.  They are better off getting teleported over the edge.  There are weapons and helmets that can grant resist and immunity to various damage types, but good luck gathering them all.Mobs have terrible AI.  If there are a couple hostile mobs after you, as soon as one is on a 1 square wide bridge; the other will halt because it can't find a path to you instead of following the other mob.  Companion mobs wont try to position themselves to help you fight and there is no way of controlling them.Once you get deep enough into the dungeon, there is zero worth to killing enemies.  They either have too much health or defense.  The best strategy at this point is to teleport them over the edge and avoid them.The interface is relatively impressive considering the only controls you need are mouse movement and left click.  This is allowed because of the games simple design and lack of depth.Overall, I can't recommend this game to enthusiast of rogue-likes because this game is too grindy.  I feel that rogue-likes should provide reward relative to your progress whereas this game took away active leveling, diverse skills and intricate equipment.			"

												As others have mentioned, I feel like it's unfair to give this game a ""thumbs-down."" It's a solid game, with nice graphics. It's got quite a bit of content to explore, and the persistant upgrades to your character provide an incentive to keep playing, as each playthrough on its own would be a bit boring. Overall, a nice casual experience.It falls short on a few counts, however: Firstly, $15 is far too much for a game that is little more than a pleasant distraction. Shattered Planet doesn't hold up to other games for the same price in terms of fun or engaging play time. Secondly, past a certain point, a lot of the content feels a little pointless.For example, there are countless ""events"" in the game that give the player a choice between two vague options - they might find a skull and choose to ""bury"" or ""study."" They can ""eat"" an alien egg, or wait for it to ""hatch."" But there's often no way to predict the outcome of an event, making choices arbitrary. Trying to disarm an unexploded bomb rewards you with a piece of chocolate. Eating a strange mushroom grants you an increased critical chance. There's no real connection between what you do and what happens.Buy on sale if you want your casual roguelike fix. Otherwise, your money would be better spent elsewhere.			"

												I'm pleased to find that Shattered Planet is every bit as enjoyable on the PC as it is on my phone. There's enough new content to keep things interesting for players who are already familiar with the mobile version of the game (though getting beaten up by crablets again is a little... humbling, haha). For new players, the basics of the game are pretty easy to grasp. Just remember that you're supposed to die, and don't get too frustrated when it happens. The price made me hesitate at first, but then I thought about how much enjoyment I have gotten (for free) from the mobile version, and about wanting to support the developers. And in the end, I honestly think the game is pretty well worth the cost.			"

												Shattered Planet is a very well made Sci-Fi Rogue-Like.  The story is interesting, and the concept of playing as a series of clones, sent to your sure death in the name of Science and Exploration, is pretty great.  As a warning - this does mean perma-death, for those who don't like the mechanic.  There are a few different ways to play the game (including a daily challenge-type mode) and none of it feels unpolished.   There are loads of unlockables, as well as several environmental and enemy types that have varying interactions.  I had a lot of fun discovering all the crazy, deadly and bizzarely adorable content in this game.  This game really is lacking in very few areas.  It does rely more heavily on RNG than any Rogue-Like I've ever played.  The difficulty (for me) eventually ramped up so hard that I couldn't begin to finish the game.  I have a suspicion that playing with one of the unlockable characters might have helped, but the idea of re-raising all of your stats (which carry over from clone to clone) turned me off.  I had spent way too much time just upgrading the one character I had started with.  As much as I enjoyed the game, I couldn't see playing through everything I'd already done all over again, just to get a chance to finish the content I had remaining.Still worth the price, and a fun way to spend some hours.  Give 'er a go.  I also found out that Shattered Planet is available on mobile.  As a turn-based game, with such depth, I actually would have prefered having it for my tablet.  For no particular reason, other than because there are so few games like this on mobile that are worth a damn.			"

												Shattered Planet leaves a lot to be wanted, as the mechanics of the game are very enjoyable, but the execution is incredibly poor. Although you may have fun with this game for a few hours after you purchase it, you'll find that during your later gameplay, you'll be feeling a lack of depth that doesn't really deserve to be there. Like another user said, binary reviews like this are bad for games like this, but I'll have to give it a thumbs down until other things are implemented.For those who don't know, Shattered Planet is a rogue-life, turn-based strategy game in which your character travels to distant planets. These planets are the equivalent to dungeons in any other rogue-like; you find items, gain currency, and inevitably die only to return and do a little better each time. To Shattered Planets strong points, this game has several things to collect and playthrough, but that's the extent of depth you'll end up getting.Pros:- Very visually pleasing. - Comical lines of dialogue.- Level design is great.- Extensive amount of gamemodes.Cons:- Not enough items.- Small pool of abilities.- AI on companions lack-luster.- No crafting stations.- Expensive upgrades.- Sometimes dull grind.The things that Shattered Planet does right is in its visuals. The game deserves to pride itself on how aesthetically engaging it is, considering the variety of biomes you can explore and the massive level design that continues to produce original and fun maps over the several hours I've played. I've not once felt annoyed to go into a certain point in the level because no specific artwork bores me, unlike other games like Tales of Maj'eyal and Dungeons of Dredmor.However, there is a massive shadow looming over this game that makes it not enjoyable after a certain amount of hours. You can experience this with the substantial lack of items, small pool of abilities, horrible companion AI, and almost zero ability to craft your own items or at least upgrade them to a better weapon. This can sometimes make it a very difficult grind because, without much customization, the game falls flat quickly.When you first play the game, finding all the weapons are pretty fun. All seem to have their own traits, like increased punctured damage or critical hit, but that's about all the depth you'll get with the weapons. It would be nice if the developers would add a crafting bench, another currency sink other than simply spending tons of money on static weapons from the store.I imagine that adding this bench would allow you to spend currency in order to put different upgrades on your weapons or smelt them in order to get different resources in order to make your own weapon. Since enemies in the game have specific weaknesses and they appear on predictable levels of the game, having this type of crafting bench would be very important for people wanting to breeze past the first levels. Right now, you'll struggle through every run-through, which can be dull.There's also a very small pool of abilities. What I mean by that is, you don't have any active abilities, the characters that you choose have passive abilities. Some are much more strong than the other characters, which almost defaults you to a couple of playstyles, which sucks for a rogue-like. It would be great to add some more abilities, even active ones, that players could use to enhance their gameplay. Right now, all you do is chop with subpar weapons and try to take as less damage as possible before going to the next floor.AI's suck. They're supposed to be companions that attack for you, defend you, and stop you from taking damage. 9 times out of 10, they don't listen and they rarely attack unless you force them into a position to attack by moving several spaces. It can be tedious, especially when you're surrounded with tough enemies and your companion is doing nothing but snoozing in the corner. You'll die because of this - several times, and that just adds to your misery. ...and this all adds up to a boring game, giving you very little for what you're putting in. With how expensive some of the upgrades are (health, dodge, and attack) and how insignificant they seem to be in-game, you're going to find that you'll get bored of grinding the first few floors until you just switch the game off and uninstall. The only reason I haven't done this is because I'm an achievement hunter and look to collect them all, haha.All-in-all, I don't recommend this game just because of the systems I wish were added. The weapons are simple, the characters are simple too - it just leaves so much to be wanted and it's unfortunate for a game like this, a game that is very pleasing and has so much potential, but falls flat on its face because of developers that aren't attentive to quality designs. Find another rogue-like to play, mates, this isn't a good one to sink your time into.			"

												A fantastic fantasy/sci-fi, rpg, rogue-like. If you are a fan of procedurally generated rogue-likes like Risk of Rain, Binding of Issac or Nuclear Throne then you will probably like this. It is a little bit more methodical and slower paced than these games but still has the thrill of perma-death, randomly generated worlds and crafting loot. If you are still not sure then I recommend trying it on a tablet first if you have one, as I'm almost certain its free on ipad. I feel this kind of game works better on PC though and fully recommend it.  "

												Shattered Planet is a gorgeous and simple to pickup roguelike game. The art is stunning and the design of the characters, monsters, etc. is quirky and quite original.As I said, it's very easy to pick up but should keep you busy and interested with its great number of items and events. There's also a Daily Mission option, which definitely helps giving the game even more longevity.It is a roguelike but it isn't as punishing as other games in the genre. That, coupled with the great art and music, and all the jokes and references you can find, makes for a very relaxing kind of fun.(I'm credited in this game, so you might think my opinion is biased, but on the other hand, the fact that I volunteered to help might tell you that I genuinely believe in the quality of this game. This, by the way, also accounts for my very short playtime, as I played it a lot before it was launched on Steam)			"

												Mechanically the game's very basic. 1 Weapon, 1 Armour, no skills, and a very rudimentary stat system (choose between damage or hit/dodge rate). A basic damage type system too but it's basically a no-brainer that quickly boils down to don't use the type enemies are immune to if you have the choice.Some entertaining flavour text, but there's too little depth to keep you coming back. All character types unlocked and about 1/2 the pets in the first 2 hours and they're all pretty samey and don't add much extra complexity.The movement system is just a little too clunky and unresponsive to make the mindlessness enjoyable, frequent missteps and missed commands provide enough frustration to take you out of the mood quickly. Unlocking the research entries is mildly satisfying for the completionist, but not really worth the enjoyment/time investment IMO			"

												A very welcoming and graphically polished roguelike with a one-click system which works well for both beginner and veteran roguelike players. I definitely enjoyed most of my ~20 hours of playtime, which was enough to finish story mode and make a 39-floor run through explorer mode. However, there are some caveats. This game has some depth, but not as much as it seems to, and balancing the usefulness of items is a problem. In terms of depth and mechanics - both elemental attack and defense are extraneous; I've found only two monsters in the game that attack with pure elemental damage, and all the rest are primarily physical based. If you want to fight, you'll more often than not ignore elemental rock-paper-scissors entirely (I'm not even sure it exists, as monster entries in the compendium only list resistances, not weaknesses) and settle for bashing your way through. However, fighting becomes unnecessary if you find two other somewhat gamebreaking items in a playthrough. One removes the enforced time limit from each stage if used correctly, and the other means instant death for any monster (but no drops) as long as you're positioned right. Both have timeouts and may take some time to find (and the second one seems bugged and will not affect certain monsters adjacent to the player), which limits their power slightly, but once you have them there's practically no other strategy that's as effective as using them. Unfortunately, this lack of viable alternate strategies makes the game less playable in the long run, and I hope the devs address this.			"

												Shattered Planet is a traditional roguelike in the sense of turn-based movement and random level generation, and my first reaction was “great, another roguelike, not as if we have too many of those already”, but I had no clue what Shattered Planet had in store for me and I was actually pleasantly surprised.It is a very enjoyable roguelike where it only really suffers in terms of its simplified combat system, that really could have made the game something special, if it had that extra depth to it. The aesthetic is utterly gorgeous and the presentation is fantastic, with some brilliantly designed environments and overall world design. The game has a decent amount of game modes that will keep you coming back for more and it has a surprisingly large amount of weapons and helmets to acquire with some very interesting designs. While the random generation for the levels may be great, the random nature of the potion in game are often far too risky to bother using on yourself and throwing a buff on an enemy is never a good idea either which makes them feel a little unfairly balanced in terms of their effects.Summary:+ Gorgeous and well-designed aesthetic.+ Highly varied and interesting environments.+ Large amount of well-designed weapons and helmets.+ Decent amount of game modes.- Combat is very simplistic.- Potion randomness far too unbeneficial.A video review is below if you wish to hear about these things a little more depth.

												DIdn't spend much time on this game so far but found it pretty solid. The game lacks a bit of complexity I admit, but I like the look and feel of the game. The spreading goo idea on every floor is pretty clever, forcing you to find the right balance between looking for more loot and hurrying up for the next stage. Besides, it's so hard to find a good-looking roguelike, that alone makes it a worthwhile purchase in my opinion. Have fun!			"

												You're a clone and your life is expendable in the name of science. So go out there, explore stuff, and probably die and loose your stuff. The difficulty of surviving goes from insane difficult to too easy with know-how; what gear to take with you, when to play it safe as opposed to take risks, who is worth picking a fight with, and how to position yourself with that teleport gun. Once you beat the 3 story campaigns, chances are you've figured out most if not all the game's got to offer.

												Really enjoyed this Roguelike. You start with nothing and find out quick its easy to die, at least at first. You can either do explorer mode where you try and get as far as you can but eventually you die and lose all your gear but keep the money and exp that you accumulated during your run. Or you can play 1 of the 3 current missions which if you beat you get a reward and teleported back to home base with all the gear you aquired. It was fun grinding explorer mode for a bit then figuring out each mission. Now that Im done the missions Im probably done with the game till they add more missions.

												For a mobile port Shattered Planet is a solid game in my eyes.It feels a little light sometimes and can be quite challenging but it is worth your time. The amount of items and collectables is massive, every time I play I always find something new or I rediscover an older tool that I had forgotten how amazing it was. Thats the true beauty of this game, going down to the planet with some random gear you crafted out of the random gear generator and seeing how far you can get while discovering new gear - locations - enemies - and choices to be made.What do you do when the skull of a long lost being asks to make out with you? What do you do when a robot requests you explain love? - Answer: You kiss them.In all honesty though a lot of what sold this game to me is the art style combined with the turn based gameplay and the sense of real discovery you get in this game. It really feels like you are exploring, trying to find some new gear or a new choice to be made via the random interactions this game gives you. This game may feel a bit cheap but as long as you don't pay a whole lot for it - it has my vote. Grab it on a sale sometime you won't be disappointed.			"

												Shattered Planet is a charming rogue-lite in which you play as a disposable clone sent to discover and explore fragmented Alien worlds. The core gameplay loop is simple - Click to move, click to attack, and wander around the map discovering new items, enemies, and events. You will inevitably die, losing all of your equipped gear and items and hope you earned enough resource to upgrade your stats, or unlock a new pet or character class. Then buy a new set of random gear from the vending machine, and head out for another run. Shattered Planet captures the spirit of a classic rogue-like, but it’s extremely simplified mechanics, soft-core difficulty and lack of strategic depth will leave fans of the genre wanting more. I give it a thumbs up, as it held my attention for a good few hours.The Good:The sprites and art style are clean, consistent and fresh looking.Item descriptions and flavor texts are clever and well written.Menu interaction and combat feels responsive, polished, and smooth.Large variety of world tile sets, and item icon art.Progression feels rewarding, with stat increases and unlocks coming at a slow, but steady pace.Pets are a nice addition and a very important ally.Random event tiles are rare, but exciting. They present a choice between two options, where a skill check determines if you found a new item, a new pet, or spawned a monster, etc.DNA menu shows all the monsters, events, items, and tile-sets you’ve discovered through an easy to navigate, slick looking UI.Daily quest with random gear set provided for free.There is a free Android version available, and while it has less features than the Steam version it could serve as a free demo.The Bad:Shattered Planet has a REALLY slow start. For the first few hours expect to fail constantly, get one shot, and not feel like you’re progressing. Farming scrap to get your stats up, and unlocking a pet will get you over the hump.Moving around the map feels slow and clunky due to a slight hitch or animation pause at each tile.Pet AI is insanely, atrociously, bad. The pet is so extremely important to your survival since it acts as a damage sponge, but 90% of the time it stands there, refuses to attack, or moves away from enemies.Only 2 equipment types: Weapons, and Helmets. And only 3 player stats: Strength, Wits, and Fate. Gearing your character just isn’t interesting when there are only 2 slots. Before a run you just slap on a helmet with the highest star rating, and a weapon with a proc and go. There aren’t enough interesting or strategic choices when it comes to gearing your character.Equipment doesn’t feel special since you lose it after every run, and even the best item is only marginally better than an average item.Stats feel inconsequential. You don’t feel any more powerful after increasing your stats, or wearing an item with a stat bonus. The power curve is too subtle.90% of the items you use will come from a vending machine in home base which spawns items for a resource. It’s just not very exciting to push a button in a safe zone and have items pop out. I’d much rather loot these items when out in the field, or have the top tier items ONLY spawn out in the maps.Some mechanics are poorly explained. Like how recycling items is one of the best ways to gain scrap. Or what exactly defense does.Locked rooms require you to find a key to open, but rarely contain anything special.Enemy variety is lacking. Sadly many of the enemy sprites are just minor variations of each other, so a lot of them end up looking and feeling the same.Potion identify mechanic inspired by classic rogue-likes doesn’t fit well in such a “lite” game. There should be some way to permanently identify potions, after say using it 100 times, or paying lots of scrap (resource).Confusing goals and win conditions. NPC buddy says I’m supposed to map out each world which gives the impression that I should fully explore each map. But mission UI says rewards are given based on how deep you reach not how many tile’s you explore.Shattered Planet would be 10x better with a healing skill available to all classes. There are some consumable items you can use to restore health, but they are both extremely weak and rare. The last character class to unlock does have a heal skill, and he feels extremely overpowered compared to the other classes.Stat training costs increase sharply which means it’s far more efficient to level the cheapest stat rather than specialize in one. This discourages specializing in one stat, makes all the classes feel the same, and feels like poor design.Shattered Planet is fun in short bursts, and slightly addicting. The engine and art style are fantastic, so they really could do great things with this game if they continue to support it. But as it stands, the lack of depth and dumbed down mechanics don’t hold my interest for very long. I would say Shattered Planet is worth a buy at around $10, or if they patch in a new content update. If you do give it a go, be sure to stick with it for at least 2-3 hours to get past the slow start. "

Watch some videos, check out a stream or something WYSIWYG but it's pretty fun for what it is. Plus as an added bonus the french translation is apparently perfect if you're interested in that type of stuff.Gameplay is the traditional roguelike though.

												After playing close to 40 hours with this game, I am torn between recommending it or not, but decided to support the developers and provide feedback that would help the game. In bulleted fashion, here is what I liked about the game:- very polished look-and-feel- decent soundtrack- a sense of growth of your character, via the pernanent upgrades- interesting concept- cool weapons, helmets, and itemsAnd what needs improvement:- The different clones are not really that different. After the first 200 turns, it’s the same clone. Eventually, your clone is going to become so powerful that the initial advantage that a particular clone grants you (regeneration, sneak, etc.) would be meaningless. - Not enough variety. The daily challenge is nice, but after you beat it, you are left with the three “return with all items you found” quests, which are fairly repetitive, especially if your clone is of a high level.- No procedurally-generated weapons or items (a la Diablo, if you will). Not sure if it’s a fair criticism, but it was problematic for me.- On my final exploration, I reached close to 60 levels of depth with a possibly game-breaking combination of items (another reviewer pointed that out, too) and the fun was gone. I was just grinding for gold and each monster was so powerful that it could one-shot kill me... which happened eventually. Past a certain clone level, you will find yourself grinding for gold as well (or items, if you do the side quests).For now, I will lay off playing the game, but I sincerely hope the developers improve it and you guys support them by buying it or providing helpful feedback.

												Shattered Planet offers a simplistic and very friendly user interface, solid if simple mechanics, lots of variety, and light humor. It's quite a good game all in all, but it tends to fall flat in places where it has so much potential. The story is basically nonexistent, and those hungering for some sort of story to latch onto will find themselves clinging to the pathetic shreds of the missions.The simplicity ends up working against it. At a certain point, one might feel that they are simply blazing past the first few levels then suddenly hitting a wall where the difficulty is ramped up so much they are one shotted. But til that point, strategy is minimal anyways.I recommend this game, however, because it still offers quite a fun time. It is amusing to learn, fun to watch, and easy to pick up, do a quick run, and drop when something else comes up. The dev team, too, is great, lightheated and very responsive. They are truthful as well, and basically everything a gamer could want from the developers.The game is definitely worth getting, if not just for the gameplay, then to support the devs. I am also hoping they will add more content in the future, as this game and mechanics seem to have a lot of potential, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys a simple, Rogue-lite type game to bring out every once in a while.

												A Good-looking, solid, isometric turn-based rogue-like that casts you as a cloned space-captain with an infinite supply of fresh clones to maim. Your avatar follows the Christopher Columbus method of exploring, which entails killing everything that moves, annoying the natives and stealing everything that isn't nailed down, while spreading a virulent blight everywhere you go because you never seem to remember to wipe your shoes before getting in the teleporter. Fun/10.It looks and plays suspiciously close to how I'd imagine a ""Toejam and Earl"" remake would go, so if you enjoyed that masterpiece, Shattered Planet is a must-buy, though I'd still reccommend it to any rogue-like lovers; good momentum, very rewarding gameplay, very rarely feels like a grind.

They are tiered so a 5 crystal item will be pretty rough, a 50 crystal one may be rare/epic etc+ a different daily challenge to get thru a series of levels with a unique set of starter gear= fairly challenging, like most roguelikes it punishes small mistakes= graphics are decent= sound is good enough- level/scenery variety is a bit limited- no real options to build your own character (tho there are various starter builds with unlockables)- you can end up almost in a dead end if you spend crystals too quickly9/10 "

												So I got this game for about 2.6 € as I already owned other good rouge-likes from the sale :)I find the game too simple for longer runs but extremely good in twitch bursts. Because it's turn based and small, you can leave it running and play in between other things, be it chatting, downloading or waiting for the rest of your party to kick some buttz in your favorite MOBA :)I do like the graphics and also the hilarious item descriptions. It's indeed an exploration game, you even level up by discovering new stuff, which is absolutely great concept as opposed to increasing experience variable by repeatedly slaying same stuff.As you'd expect from an exploration game, the fun comes from discovering new stuff. There's quite a lot of fun stuff to discover, but you always start from distance 1, so you discover new stuff with bigger and bigger lag... But I haven't seen it all.It's simple and good. Grab it in sale if you can. Or not, I'm not your mum.			"

												Shattered Planet is a turn based rougelike based on exploration. Much in the way that rogue legacy has, each life you are collecting resources that you can use to improve your characters (I feel this game improves on this by allowing you to keep resources between lives). I really enjoy how the game is exploration driven, you get points and progress through the game by discovering new items, enemies, and environments. Another fun element you explore are ""events"" where you are given a choice and that affects your game play. For example, in one event you encounter a strong enemy who is injured and you're given the choice to kill it or heal it. If you heal it, then it becomes a companion animal and attacks your enemies. The game has a great sci fi flavor, the art is great (and not pixel art which is nice), and most of all it's really fun to play. Roguelikes are all ready about adventure (mostly loot based) but this is the first game I've seen that actually makes the adventure the primary drive for the game. Definately worth checking out.			"

												A casual roguelike that has a odd combination of rewarding exploration and getting through the area as quickly as possible. The different character classes are unlocked by finding enough new stuff. Each enemy, item, area, and event are recorded in a journal of sorts, and after discovering enough, your Research Level will increase, which unlocks the characters and gives you a randomized bonus item. You play as a clone, and when you die, you get 'resurrected/cloned' back at the base.The classes, of which there are 5, are mostly a different skin with a different passive ability and a limited use skill. For example, the Assassin has better range with Guns(which is this games version of Wands), and increased damage with them, along with better unarmed damage.The Items themselves are not randomly generated, they're all premade, though what you'll find and where is still random. All of them have a unique appearance, along with a description that often proves amusing. Also, a lot of them reference something: Like Master Chiefs Helmet, a Lightsaber, and a Stormtrooper Helmet. As for types of items, there's consumables, which come in either food, or Canisters. The Canisters work exactly like Potions in other roguelikes, where there's only so many different types, but in the beginning of each run their appearance and name is random, and only by using or tossing them will you discover their uses, and btw, the food is for healing, though there are healing canisters too. Guns work like Wands, in that they do certain damage and/or effects.Equipment is kinda limited in my opinion. Well there's certainly a lot of different ones, but their restricted to the Weapon and Helmet category. They DO appear on your character visually, but I wish there were body armor and boots/gloves to deck your character in. Also, once you die in a run(which the default mode has no end, so you WILL die eventually), you lose your equipment, including the ones you brought on the run with you(you can equip your self back at the base/ship). This isn't too much of a problem, since there's enough items of good quality to acquire fairly easily.You have a home base. as Ship in orbit, that you return to between runs. This is where you get most of your equipment, upgrade you character, etc. before a run. There are 2 currencies in the game: Scrap and Gems. Scrap is used to permanently upgrade your clones stats permanently, and btw, upgrades are tied to each of the classes, so if you buy 3 Strength Upgrades for the Assassin, your Renegade wont get those unless you buy them for him too. The price of the upgrade scales at a set amount, so first upgrade is 25 Scrap, second is 35, etc.. Gems are used for the R.O.S.E. machine thing in the base. I forgot what the acronym stands for, but it randomly generates Weapons and Helmets using Gems. Each equipment in the game is rated from 1 to 5 stars. At the ROSE, the Tier 1 generates 1-2 Star Items, Tier 2 generates 3-4 Star Items, and Tier 3 generates 4-5 Star items. They're fairly priced at 5/20/50 Gems respectively.You can also have companion pets that help in battle, which are created/cloned at the base for Gems.The 'get through level quickly' mechanic I mentioned earlier is sort of Creep/Corruption, called Blight. It's a black goo that slowly spreads through out the level, which hurts to step on, eventually spawns Blight Creatures which are fairly strong,I'll stop rambling now, but this is definitely a fun casual roguelike with nice graphics and and SFX/Music. The $15 price tag is a bit steep for the quality of the game, personally I feel it would be better in the $5-$10 range, but it's a must get on sale.			"

												Not quite a pure rogue like, but that works well for me.It still gives you good incentives not to die, it still has a nice variety of ""stuff"" to find/collect, it still has random maps for each world, but dieing doesn't wipe out everything you do, you get to keep a small handful of rare items and any scrap you find when you die - meaning while still painful, you are able to slowly upgrade your character with each play through.And that works so well for me, as frankly I'm not that great at rogue likes.One small con, no keyboard controls for movement.

												I really like SP. It's easy to pick up and play whenever you feel like a short run, or a long one if you want. SP plays a little like a Rogue Legacy, or perhaps Enter the Gungeon etc, in that you die and you have to start your run over from the beginning, but you retain money gained and experience and have a collection of found items which keeps growing. The gameplay is turn based one-square-at-a-time movement, which takes a minute to get used to but is also nice for not having to worry about in real time. The levels are small to medium 'islands' connected by paths where you have to find the exit to the next level down, kill stuff along the way, find items, and run into random event encounters which could be bonus or negative. Your stats will affect what happens in a dice roll. There is a surprising amount of depth in the items you find, and they usually have a funny or witty reference... nothing new, but it's well done I think. There are 5 or 6 different class types to unlock and play as, they are not very different but have slightly different perks which could make for slightly different playstyles. I find myself enjoying the runs down and seeing how far I can go before dying (I have not gotten to the end yet). I actually really enjoy this game, and most people are surprised about hearing about all the features when I tell them about it... because no one has heard of it xDWith a very low price (especially at 80-90% off!), this game actually gets a very high recomnedation from me, You should totally get it, and play it.

												Shattered Planet is a fun little roguelite (quite light) with a nice mechanic of ever-encroaching blight to keep a little tension.  Levels are very quick to complete and have a nice 'one more level' flair.  Itemization is fairly diverse in flavor, but limited in impact.  There's a ton of random events, but unfortunately (again) they have little real impact (temporary stat boost).  Progression is tied to boosting stats based on resources collected during runs, and the needed amounts increase exponentially.  After about five to ten runs, you'll have more or less effectively maxed out your character.  This is a fine mechanic while you're still progressing, but the wall comes too quickly and too hard.Unfortunately, the game is its own worst enemy, as the mechanics break in really stupid ways.  Blight adds tension, but a common item makes it completely trivial and avoidable.  I enjoyed the game 100 times more when I didn't realize you could stop blight progression.  Also, enemies are easily teleported off into space, instakilled no matter the strength...what's the point in fighting and developing stats if you can just safely kill everything without a fight?  More importantly, anything past a certain level WILL one-shot you if you try to attack, no matter your stats.  Again, why bother with combat at all?  And finally, resource collects increase by level, so the best strategy is to simply teleport everything, get to the next level and collect random dropped items.  It's far more rewarding than doing it the 'right' way.For the list price, I wouldn't say it's worth it.  I got it in a bundle (as the only thing I wanted in said bundle, but it was substantially cheaper) and am quite happy with that purchase.  I would've been much happier with it had there been an expansion pack (it's a little repetitious, even for a roguelite) and if the game was better balanced.  I did really enjoy it for a few hours.  Good setting, fun graphics, some interesting things to unlock earn it a reluctant thumbs up.  But ultimately, it's a bit too shallow and self-defeating for any lasting appeal.			"

												I really like this game. But in no way do I love this game. There are many reasons why, and I would love to keep this review to being short and sweet.PROS:- I love the weapon and armour system in this game. The random piece of armour or random weapon that you get really adds to the ""Rogue-Lite"" feeling of this game.- The vast amount of levels. Playing this game has never ceased for me to find something new that I have either; stumbled upon by complete accident or spent minutes grinding.- The range of enemies. The amount of enemies in this game is actually friggin' jaw-dropping. I always fall upon a whole new, sometimes hardcore, enemy. This makes the game seem like it could be played forever due to the fact that there's always something new.- The Daily Challenges. The fact that this game gets new dailies... Daily, is amazing. The way that you can play the game every day and get a whole new run that everyone else would be doing. This also adds to the whole ""Rogue-Lite"" feeling.- The pets!! I, myself, am an avid animal lover. The fact that you can get animals in this game to fight alongside you and to kill your wildest foes is beyond happiness for me. I love picking out my cute, sometimes horrifying, pet. Cons:- The biggest problem I see with this game is how GRINDY it feels. Okay, sure, that's to be expected of a ""Rogue-Lite"" but in no way should it be as grindy as it is. I find myself constantly trying to get that whole new weapon that I need or the final piece of armour that I need to complete my collection. Apart from the grinding, there's really nothing else I can flaw about this game. Sure, the actual gameplay gets some getting used to, and the fact that some of the missions seem very repetative, this game is really good.I would really recommend this game if you're on the hunt for that new Rogue-Lite to keep you on your toes for a few hours or maybe days. Solid game with solid elements and solid gameplay. I must-buy for you avid Rogue-Lite fans. "

												First off, I need to say that this is my favorite game I've found on Steam, so I'm a bit biased. Jumping right into what you want to know:Gameplay/Story: Simple; easy to learn very fast. Choose a clone, each with their own skillset and buffs, and traverse the ever-changing shattered pieces of an ancient planet crawling with monsters and tribals, littered with loot and new weapons to help you on your way as you progress onto harder and harder levels that are different every time. See how far you can get before the flora, fauna, or your own mistakes spell your end. You will die. A lot. But don't worry; your clone can pick up where you left off to start the adventure all over again with all the information and levels that your last one was able to earn before his untimely, and probably sudden, demise. But you're not always alone in this, you might sometimes also find it in your favor to either purchase or tame a companion or pet to help fight with you on your next trip to the surface. If you'd rather have a goal to reach instead of pushing the limits of your clone endlessly, there are 3 other difficult missions for you to complete with cool rewards for each, but you'll fare better practicing in endless first! Grab some scrap and crystals (money) in there to buy yourself some fancy murder-tools before pushing your luck in the missions. Travel a lot and you'll find it lying all over the place!Graphics: Clean isometric environments come together with soft, painterly-esque textures and crisp characters to make for an interesting but pleasing-to-the-eye adventure. Animations are smooth, but your clone's walk cycle usually seems a bit short or abrupt, but it's nothing too jarring. Waddle on, fresh meat.Sound: Adjust sound and music to your preferences or turn them off completely. Tranquil and sometimes ominous music follows you on your travels, each pretty decently set to match your current environment which changes every few levels you progress through to mix it up and give you different enemies and events to find. Every time you stumble into a fight, though, you'll get a more rambunctious action clip to keep you on your toes, though this one only has a few variations based on the enemies you're fighting. I like the music in this game a lot and it's not too invasive or annoying. The fight music does sometimes make a jarring jump in volume compared to the other tracks, however.Controls: The controls were obviously made for mobile platforms but everything is, thankfully, operated with the mouse. There are no key binding options, which is a shame as right now you need to click every tile you want to travel to and you can only see so many ahead of you. This game would greatly benefit even from simple arrow-keys or WASD walking controls, but the clicking-to-walk isn't really a deal-breaker; it's just a little annoying until you get used to it. The camera keeps your clone the center of focus, though, and sometimes I find my eyes feeling a little dizzy the way the environment moves but I stay riveted in the center of the screen, which probably isn't a problem for most people. Think Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.Notable/Other: It pains me to say that right now, several in-game items and events are bugged in such a way that you cannot find them through legal means. Since one achievement in particular banks on you being able to come across everything at least once to add it to and level up your data-log, that little bug makes this one achievement impossible to earn, along with one or two bugged events. They just seem to not be coded into the game to unlock the achievement once found. There is more information on this in the steam forums, but it seems that until the developers (a small team of 4) finish with their other, newest game-making endeavor, these achievements will remain broken. Achievement-hunters be advised. - The devs removed the achievement that required finding all the items, some of which were broken and undiscoverable, instead of fixing the broken items, but that works, too, I guess.Overall: The game is fun, addicting, and easy to play; other than a few tiny annoyances, I feel Shattered Planet is well worth your time and attention, and even a few broken achievements don't make it unplayable. Believe it or not, some players enjoy a game with or without achievements. Personally, I love achievements, so it's a disappointment that a handful of them are broken, but truly, that's not going to keep me from playing this and having fun. I recommend nabbing it on sale.

												I have just played this game for two hours. I highly recommend it. This is a roguelike that doesn't punish you for dying, *Sure*, you lose all you nventory each death, but you also gain in-game currency no matter what.Aside from gameplay, this is a very well ported game. Audio is stellar, effects are good, and the interfacce is clean and simple to navigate. I would like to see some sort of in-game world ranking with the daily-challenge, otherwise this is a solid game well worth supporting.			"

												It's relatively fun; very similar to the Pokemon mystery Dungeon games in feel (as well as parts of the Binding of Isaac).However, at times it's really hard and doesn't feel as rewarding as isaac in terms of loot. Also, if you get a shovel, you're pretty much golden (it's a one-hit kill, on a quick recharge, and you can use it to stop the ""blight"" from following you). So the item balance feels a bit off at times.			"

												I don't know what some of the other reviews are talking about; this may not be the best rogue-like if you're a R-L snob, but I found it pretty entertaining. I got it bundled with a few other games, so it was a steal, really.Basically, you're exploring the surface of a planet that shifts every time you visit it. There are loads of different items, and events on every level. Somewhere on each level is a portal to take you to the next 'distance', and on explore mode every three distances gets you more points for buying better equipment/upgrades.You can also find the means to upgrade/buy equipment on each distance. There are potions that you pick up as well, but each one has to be tested by throwing it or quaffing it, each go around, because the effects shift. This adds a strategic layer, because some of the potions can be very useful. For instance, there's a darkness that grows and gradually consumes the whole level as it follows you, but one of the potions will blow up a few square blocks - you can use this to stop the darkness' progress for that distance, and give yourself the freedom to explore the whole level at your leisure.I also found the events pretty interesting. You usually have two ways to react to the different events you run into, each with stat checks - so you can end up with some nice bonuses, or a title that follows you until you die.Anyway, I think that it's a pretty interesting game. If you're looking for an absolute blockbuster, this isn't it, but it IS a really well put together, beautiful indie game that is fun to play.			"

												Not much strategy to this game. As far as I can tell, it's a huge grind with minimal tactical or strategic complexity. Enemies are all equally fast as you and all do the same thing: charge and attack. I have yet to meet one with any special ability besides the monster spawners. Most of them are just critters with claws. The first boss can be beaten with a gimmick that would be almost impossible to figure out, but makes him a complete pushover once you know it.Your weapons mostly just do raw damage, with various elemental effects and resistances, but ultimately they boil down to ""click until dead."" There is very little tactical variety in the weapons, with the one exception being the fire weapon (you have to run away from the burning ground afterward). There are also poisoned weapons, but they do so little damage that it's hard to say why the effect was included at all. Armor is even simpler -- almost all of them are just some numbers + a resistance type.What use items there are break down into healing items (boring), guns (boring), and potions. Potions randomize, like in Nethack, but there are so few of them and the missions are so short that you are unlikely to find out what they do in time to make good use of them.The levels are randomly generated, but identical with the exception of monster distribution and textures. Very samey.The toons are the same except appearance and a temporary buff that lasts for the first 200 moves. The Emmisary is the sole exception, in that he has a permanent boost to his stats, and is therefore mathematically better than the rest except in the very early game.I can see where they were going with this, but there simply isn't enough depth or variety to hold my attention. The game has more in common with Diablo than it does with Nethack or the vast majority of the rogue-like tradition. I do not recommend this game.			"

												This has the makings of a great game.I have seen 40% of the things in this game [according to the game's tracker]and put in just under three hours before the game lost it's appeal.Now I'm grinding really hard to progress at all,and playing the main portion of the game feels pointless;so I ended up running the first mission repeatedly,until I felt comfortable doing the second one and etc.It seems like it might be fun to just try the daily quest,maybe do a quick run or two once or twice a day.HOWEVER, when you know that just grinding wouldallow you to ""progress"" faster, it all seems pointless.TLDR: Pretty good premise, not executed so well.

TL;DR: Surprisingly good rogue-like with almost unique mechanics.As far as rogue-like goes, this is the most random one I ever saw, I think. And definitely one of the most enjoyable.So, you have 5 classes to choose from (2 are available from the start, 3 are unlockable), three stats to raise (strength, hitpoints, evasion), and two slots (headgear and weapon). Now, it certainly does not look like a lot to play with, but trust me on this -- it quite is.I don't know if there is a certain goal to the game -- I didn't get that far, to be honest. Your main gameplay is exploring some planet, moving from square to square, and jumping from region to region (closest thing to floors in any given rogue-like here).Levels are generated procedurally, of course (this means you get to play a randomly created level each time you start over). There are also random events, like encountering some crab's nest, or finding some stash, etc. There's even something like a roll, when it happens -- if you fail to roll a certain number, you'll fail the encounter, and some negative thing would happen (like, instead of coming with you, crab will attack you) -- just like in some tabletop RPGs.Character customization seems a bit weak at first -- I mean, what the hell, why only two slots?! I want boots, gauntlets, a necklace, and a pantyhose or something! Or greaves. Yes, greaves. Of course, I meant greaves... But after some time playing, you'll notice that these two slots is basically all you'll ever need -- items are dropping a-plenty, plus you can forge a random item at base, choosing from 3 qualities (low-tier, mid-tier, or hi-tier) with prices varying as well.Another significant part of the gameplay is unlocking new content for your journal. Every item, every location, every encounter and every defeated enemy give you a new entry in your journal on your first encounter, and you get addicted to unlocking new entries quite fast (especially if you have OCD, like myself). Also, you raise a special metric by unlocking a certain number of entries -- consider it your explorer's level, with each new level unlocking something new.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Do I need to buy this game?If you're a fan of rogue-likes, don't hesitate to buy it for full price. If you're not, wait for a sale and buy it with a discount.			"

 Original post here [jatdragon.blogspot.com]I obtained Shattered Planet through a free game giveaway, and those types of games - as we all know - are usually just plain BAD. However, I like to give every game I own a try, so I went ahead and installed it. I must admit, I had no idea what this rogue-like turn-based RPG game was, so I was quite surprised with the graphics and music quality right away. Once I started, I discovered that the game had a lot of dynamic gameplay (due to the variety of enemies/items/weapons/etc.) with loads of replay ability. In conclusion, I think this would be a great game for lovers of dungeon exploring games and rogue-like games, and a definite steal if found on a sale. Overall Rating 7.5 Graphics 8 Sound 6.5 Story 6 Gameplay 8 UI / Controls 9  The graphics of the game are quite nice. It is a 2D game, and the art-style seems hand drawn and creates a very warm atmosphere. I have read that some users complain about ""clunky animation"", however I didn't notice any such problems, since the game is indeed a turn-based RPG. The music is obviously well-made, you can tell right away. The sound effects are also appropriate and high-quality. However it seems like the soundtrack you hear while exploring (most of the gameplay) is quite repetitive. The same song gets played in every biome and intensifies when in combat. Also, all melee weapons make the same sound (regardless of the enemy too), making listening to the game quite tiresome. Initially, you have no idea how the game works. The helper/scientist hints that you are definitely going to die, which to me sounded like intimidation tactics to make you play more cautiously. You later learn that you are simply a clone and will keep re-spawning, losing only the items you had equipped. The objective is obviously to explore, since it is heavily encouraged to experiment more, but not much background is given. The dialogue with the scientist doesn't reveal much about why you are doing this, what your goal is, or what sent you on your mission. However, even though the story is weak, I don't think it is important to this type of game anyway. The gameplay of this game is definitely its main advantage. Personally, I love game that involve randomization of game aspects (which results in more unique, less scripted experiences), so I found this game very enjoyable. There are many types of enemies, items, gun, armor, and biomes, which are all logged as unique entries in your discovery catalogue. You even get to encounter unknown substances that have unexpected results and you can chose to use on yourself or throw it (cross your fingers so that you don't poison yourself, heal your enemies, or corrupt important tiles). After death, you get to explore again and replay in a random new world with new mysteries (and even get special levels and daily challenges). The UI is quite well-designed and simple, with a reasonable amount of options. The controls are quite basic and easy to learn. Not really anything revolutionary, but it is important to make sure that users don't get frustrated by a good game with bad controls.Pros: +Nice graphics, soft and aesthetic +Very enjoyable to play and  immense replay potential +Can change play styles with different characters, weapons, upgrades, pets, etc. +Daily challenges allowing for more higher level runs +Big variety of weapons, armor, enemies, biomes, etc. +Cheap (listed for $15 on Steam, but found for about $1 on markets due to the giveaway)Cons: -Repetitive clicking to attack enemy. Boring combat, even though there is elemental damage, tactics are usually not important early on. -Enemies tend to repeat in the first stages of any game.Notes: It would be interesting to have some story elements being discovered with every exploration to slowly reveal a grand narrative. Also a BIG improvement would be Steam Workshop integration, allowing for variety and arsenals to increase massively.			"

												a roguelike-lite game. simple controls, minimal customizations, although plenty of items to discover and use. obviously this game was designed with mobile in mind.still, there's plenty to like, from the simple, but yet nice graphics, the quirky creatures, and funky items scattered through the game.probably not so much for the hardcore roguelike game fans out there, but would better suit people who wants a more casual experience, to slowly explore and discover the world.

												Pro:-Many items-nice idea-i like the graphicstyleCon:-no real story-items are set at the start of a run and mostlikely wont change during it-items often dont affect the gameplay, since there is nearly no use in fighting you will always be on the run and while fighting you just click on the enemy until they die.-very grindy(to get more HP,  Attack etc.), but since there is no real target it never pays off-levels are filled with bottles which have a random effect (anything from making you invincible for a period of time to just killing you without a warning)-got bored after roughly 2 hrs of playingIf you want to play a good rougelike you should by a game like the binding of isaac, which is superior in about everything.

												I was new to the roguelike genre when I picked up Shattered Planet on a Humble Bundle deal.The game is a roguelike that focuses on exploration, progession across a shattered, austere, galactive environment while discovering unique breeds of enemies, different kinds of companions, new items, flora, fauna, landscapes, and novel experiences/events. These are all logged in a Datalog, which is curated and worked on by a scientist (who is the only other character you get to interact with.) The premise of the game places you on a spacestation/research lab as a disposable clone that can be upgraded with boosts as you play, hopefully increasing your survivability. Your goal is to get as far as you can, and collect/experience as much as you can. The standard mode has endless replayability, but it may seem to get repetitive if you're new to the genre. However, as long as character progression continues, you will oftentimes break farther and farther into the shattered planets, and hopefully uncover new things!There are alternative game and challenge modes, and endless litte things to discover. The game has an enjoyable art style, with a laid-back and humorous attitude. The music goes mostly unnoticed to me, and I find this a relaxing sort of experience to play! It may not stand up to hardcore/serious roguelikes, but its an enjoyable way to pass some time!			"

												There is nothing overly bad about this game, except that it is boring.  Between expeditions, the game gives you the option to spend discovered resources from previous expeditions to buy random items, rent-a-pet and improve your character. However, the process of expending these resources has little strategy or intrigue. Some people may like gambling via purchasing random items, but it simply leads to a cache of stored items for your character to choose from and turns from gambling to hoarding. Likewise, the linear progression of character advancement is dull, but a necessity in order to explore the planets: the grind certainly feels like a grind. The game has some humorous aspects to it in the form of your boss’ dialogue and the zany items. Also, the colour pallet for the planets’ are visually appealing, but the repetitive narrow paths connecting each location lends itself to a successfully repetitive strategy for dealing with the monsters and advancing throughout the planet. After quickly finishing the first of three planets in “story mode,” getting bored with the daily’s, and finding the second story planet equally as dull I decided to uninstall the game. If you enjoy grinding character advancement, bad humour, and rogue like explorations then Shattered Planet is the game for you.			"

												mehhave to die a lot to be able to progress and this kind of progress is minimal.the consumables you come across have no description and they can either damage or give buffs to you. this can often get you killed. there is no reliable way to heal yourself early on unless you spend the resources (that you are supposed to use for equipment or training) on some healing items... and these resources take rather long to get if doing content meant for your level. enemies will still use those bought potions quickly because their damage can be very high.wouldn't recommend just because it's frustrating to ""die to progress"".

												Shattered Planet is a fun little turn-based roguelike when you first begin playing. The setting is interesting -- you play a clone who has been sent forth to a mysterious planet to map the terrain and relics found on the planet... or, more likely, die trying. The planet is the game's single dungeon -- it consists of a series of randomly generated levels which get progressively harder. Items can be found scattered throughout the levels and are generally interesting. You also collect minerals and golden triangles that serve as currency to make your future runs easier. When you die on the planet, you keep your currency but not your equipment, and you must use the currency to buy future equipment, permanent upgrades for your future clones, as well as monster companions to help you.There are two main things that make this game not very enjoyable. Firstly, the game is seriously unbalanced. Between dungeon runs you can buy different levels of gear: bronze, silver, or gold. When you buy an item this way, you get either a weapon or a helmet at random (the only two equipment slots in the game). Gold gear is the highest tier in the game, and it's cheap enough that you can buy this gear after a run or two while completely ignoring the bronze and silver tiers of items. You're guaranteed a high quality item that will allow you survive long enough to buy many more gold items after additional runs, so the pleasure of finding better equipment while exploring the dungeon is very low as you walk in with some of the best equipment right away (although you can still find nice usable items and guns).The second problem is that you'll quickly find there is not a lot of strategy to the game. While the items are generally nice to discover, they add little depth to the gameplay, which generally consists of explore/whack monsters/ collect loot/repeat. Once you amass a number of guns in your inventory, instead of whacking monsters you shoot them. While there are a few things that you can do to protect yourself and take less damage, none of them feel particularly clever, usually just tedious (like waiting for your guns to recharge ammo after a battle, which takes time).Overall, the game is pretty fun at first. But it doesn't last too long, and gets old quick.Pros:Cool itemsNice sense of exploration with random eventsclean, easy interfaceCons:Not much variety in level designNot much room for strategy, good strategies can be tediousAccess to high tier equipment comes way too fastVerdict: It's not a bad game, and I enjoyed playing it for a while. But I don't think it's worth more than $5-$8.			"

												I want to put a nuetral review for this game.Unfortunately, going into this game, when I saw roguelike, that's what I was picked thing.It actually belongs to a sub genre of games I refer to as ""rogue grinder"".

And you have to do this quite a few times, before you start to see any ""new"" content.I'm not a fan of grinding games. I picked up rogue Legacy on a whim, liking the sound of the idea of it, but ultimately I didn't enjoy it.

												Starting out feeling I'm gonna be bored with this game, but as it turned out, this is a very fun game to play. You just keep wanting to try another run each time you die. Definitely worth the money I spent on it.Pros:- Simple rogue like game with a nices cience fiction back story.- Easy to pickup. Not too hard to put off casual players, but tough enough to keep it interesting.- Loads of interesting items to find. Love the nods to great sci-fi franchise like Star Trek and Star Wars.- Random events (finding books, nests, etc) that gives you reward if you pass the stat check.Cons:- Doesn't save bottles description. How many times do I have to rediscover the purpose of that golden liquid anyway?Will update as I progress further into the game.			"

												Action games are great but sometimes we desire to play more relaxing games.  This doesn't necessary mean the game can't be challenging but it should instead focus on strategy over reflexes.  Shattered Planet is wonderful example of a fast-paced, exciting, game that does not require split-second decisions.  This modern-day rogue-like is an excellent example of how to make a turn-based game exciting.  The core gameplay is extremely straight forward but beneath the surface is a hearty amount of depth.  Anyone looking for a more laid-back challenge with the variety of procedural generated content needs to check out Shattered Planet.The story, if there is any, revolves around these worlds that are being ripped apart by the Blight.  Every time you transport down to the surface the Blight slowly grows out from the spot you start on; in turn tainting the wild life and spawning monsters.  Its your job to scavenge as many tools and resources you can while you search for the exit teleport pad.  If you die you'll lose all your items however you will keep any experience and scrap you find.  The aforementioned items can be used to upgrade your stats or purchase new equipment.  Between constantly learning from your mistakes and having stronger, better equipped, characters you should be able to get farther and farther when you set out to explore new planets.The gameplay is where this game really shines.  The level are laid out in a grid format with small chucks of land connected via a couple of thin bridges.  You can only see so far and the levels basically become a maze as you search for the exit.  Whether your just moving around or fighting off hostile creatures you just simply click each time you wish to move a space or attack your enemy.  Since this game is turn-based everything else will only move when you do, giving you all the time in the world to think and strategize.  This is really helpful when you are trying to flee from and enemy or just avoid combat all together.The procedural generation in this game is incredible.  Although the level layouts don't vary a ton there are still many different planets and you still never know what you'll find.  There a many different enemies and even some friendly natives.  You'll come across several different colored capsules and you won't know if they are aids or weapons till you use one; even then the colors are randomized every time you play.  There are also many objects or people you can interact with that will give you a scenario with two different choices.  Usually the right choice, if there is one, isn't obviously or sometimes the choices just offer two different rewards.  This a game you can play for hours on end and not find everything it has to offer.If you are looking for a deep and relaxing game to play after a hard days work this is it.  Shattered Planet is easily one of the best rogue-likes since Spelunky and that is saying a lot.  This is one of the most fast-paced and exciting turn-based games I've ever played.  The progression of your characters stats along side your ability to play well means every record you break in the endless mode is very satisfying.  Even with the tremendous variety found in this title the core gameplay can start to get a bit repetitive because of its simplicity.  That being said I believe the developers made the right call because there is already a flooded market of really deep RPGs.  Shattered Planet is laid-back gaming at its best with near perfect balance of pacing and challenge.			"

												As a gamedesigner, i think this game succeeds immensely on art and small features, but fails on the core aspect of the game.It is confusing and difficult due to a design mishap imo. Hear me out cause its tough as ♥♥♥♥ to describe. You start. Gear up and move in a tactical point and click way. So the map is square divided, like xcom, fireemblem etc right? but.. its not turn based, so basicly its real time point and click with the fluidity of a tactical/board type of game lol.Confusing? well, to make things worst, when an enemy spots you, he moves square by square as if in a strategy game lol, but to attack him you have to spam the mouse, because the more you click the faster you atk?!? Plus the tile real time point and click movement, is frustrating as times, since you end up walking around what you want to interact... a confusion of genres that makes no sense...Not only that, but the art is just perfect for an rpg, a tactical rpg, which in a way i was led to believe. But no, this game can be described as half strategy, half rpg, half roguelike and bigger half confusion and lack of direction.... as a ""upgrade on death"" type of game, this game fails for me. Because simply put, you gear up for a playthrough but when you die, you lose your gear. Ok. But you playthrough to make new gear... Wut? where is the upgrade? i see 1 cycle of never ending difficulty, confusion and♥♥♥♥♥♥ There is a stat upgrader, which just adds to the mess and pile of ""dont understand doesnt feel right""...Sry but it feels that they were heading at a great classical rpg/strat game (fireemblem style) with modern art touch and made a turn into action ""bastion"" style game.... The product is a waste with great graphics.			"

												Total lack of content and repetitive oversimplified and unbalanced gameplay.but mostly, it was fun for a while, about 1 hour, then it became repetitive and some kind of grind-fest. Until I got a shovel and a gun that pushes enemies away.. by that point I had the choice between doing repetitively some thousands of times the first few floors of an endless dungeon until I had enough hp to survive one hit, which wasn't going to happen; and using the shovel to prevent some floor hazards/get rid of enemies, and the other gun also to get rid of enemies. Since there is nothing significant gained by defeating enemies, why bother? just push'em offstagefor those who'd still buy this game, know that the way the game is designed this way:- if you walk toward a monster you die, so don't. Jump offstage instead if you are to do that(skip level but lose hp).- if a monster walks toward you, you may survive if you kill him first. no rewards for it.- the only reason to stay on a floor  for any amount of time are finding potions and small, stats increases.with the exception of something like the first 3 floors, so maybe a 10 minute gameplay experience.

												I think it's difficult for me to recommend this game wholeheartedly for a number of reasons, the main one being that I was not actually a purchaser. I'm a Let's Player who was given the game for promotional reasons and as a result my sense of value may be skewed. That being said, I think that Shattered Planet is an attractive Rogue-lite that does a lot of things well. It doesn't break the mould as far as I am aware and it seems to require an awful lot of grinding to achieve anything, a possible holdover from the fact that it was once an iOS title that has been ported. There is not any depth to the story, but the writing is consistently amusing and some of the random events are absolutely great. I would love to have seen more of that, so take note Kitfox.The game presents its challenges interestingly and if you're a fan of the genre I think you'll get something out of it. Anyone else might want to consider their options carefully.If you want to see the game in action, you could always check out my series on it *nudge* at

												This game is just about grinding.you going into a new area get money and die.you make your character a bit better with the money you got and you go back into another randomly made area and get a little further.thats the game.""Explore a dangerous planet that's different every time and try to survive!""no you dont try to survive because everything is just random so theres absolutely not skill involved and to make your character better you have to die first.I paid $2.99 for this and im getting a refund for it because im never going to play it again. I really would hate to of spent $15 "

Hello Ladies and Gents! FyreNyxie Here!Shattered Planet gets a 2.5/5. I liked how it looks and the idea behind it, but it got very repetitive very quickly. This is one of those games where I wish there was a ""so-so"" button. It would be best to grab it on sale if you want it.-Graphics: The game looks really nice and I like how the tiles dip under your weight.-Sound: The ambience is nice, but it's noticeable when the music loops back and starts over.-Story: You're a clone sent down to the ever-changing planet to gather specimens and samples and explore as much of the planet as you can.-Single-player/Multiplayer: Single-player.-Controls: Simple. Click to move, click to attack, click to investigate objects.-Setting: I enjoy the randomized planet and the blight that starts spreading when you show up forces you to move along, but doesn't panic you.-Characters: Five different character types to choose from once you unlock them all.-Gameplay: You won't need to employ serious strategical tactics since this game is fairly simple and casual. Every once in a while you come across an object that gives you a little event, but overall it's pretty basic.-Customization: Each character has five different heads to choose from.-Dialogue/Well Written: Not a lot of dialogue. Mostly just the alien making little quips or giving you tips on the ship.-Tutorial: Not much of a tutorial, but the game is also not very complex.-Other: It would be nice if you could command your pet to attack an enemy instead of moving around in the hopes that it will get the message and fight for you.-Worth the price tag: I waited until it went on sale before I got it and I recommend you do too.Have Fun Gamers!

												Please do not waste your time on this, even if it is on sale.Everything about this game is lacking and boring. I could really get over the horrible graphics, lacking animations, missing music, dialog, story or immersion. But what I cannot get over is that that game mechanics are so boring. There is literally zero thinking involved, you do not have any spells or special skills whatsoever. You simply have a melee weapon of varying strength. You run up to the foe and click it. That's it. There _is_ the occasional drop of a special item. But the game manages to completely ruin this mechanic as well, in that the effect of that item is random and can only be found out by experimentation. Urgh...If you want a good roguelike go for Rogue Legacy, FTL or Dungeouns of Dredmore. "

												Before you consider this review a valid relfection of the game or not based on total gameplay hours. The game has been completed, but most the time was spent offline: I would consider this a good game if my criteria for a good game was A) Introducing the rogue-like genre to a childorB) Doing the same thing over and overThe game in a nutshell is popping up on planets that are more or less identical and hoping to find loot that will enable you to go to planets that are harder in order to find better loot... You get the idea.If you want a casual rogue-like to pass the time and can snag it on sale then GO FOR IT!If you're looking for a serious thought provoking rogue-like then I suggest you go elsewhere (such as ToMe, ADOM, NetHack, etc.)			"

												This game is a good experience at first, some nice references and a lot to discover. But things get boring really fast when you understand how the game works, and that's not hard to do.I would rate the game a 5/10, just for the art, music and the experience I had on the first few hours. But I still not recommencing because of the lack of replayability and shallow mechanics.			"

												All you do is die all the time, and everytime you die, you lose everything you're carrying. I died around 10 times in my short time of play, and there aren't enough med pack dropped to keep you alive.Afte you die, to teleport back to your ship, make new items, up your stats, go die again. I had some armor on, still took the same amount of damage.You pick up fluid that you don't know what they do, unless you happen to have used one before and remember the bottle color, and you survived it.Seems like a endless grind game.I really don't see the fun in this game.

No regrets at $3.00.  I've played a fair amount of roguelikes and this one really just didn't grab me and pull me in.  The graphics are what they look like in the pictures.  Not amazing but not terrible.  The pacing is just slow for a rogue like.  If you try to rush you'll kill yourself in record time.  If you slow down and not mad dash into trouble it's slow paced and meh.Overall on sale I give this a yes.  Not on sale I give it a no.			"

												Wicked Sci-fi Rogue that rewards the player for distance & death, ""Shattered Planet"" offers tons of variety through randomly generated dungeons.  The graphics are pleasent, actually adding to the atmosphere of a game that would be almost just as enjoyable in ASCii.  The music is quite good ambient, switching to the battle theme when proper.  Crafting, alternate advancement, tons of gear, unlockable alien races, & grat fun exploring thus far.  In theory, anyone could beat the game eventually if they jut keep throwing themselves at it like a JRPG;  (^_^; )However, the game keeps adapting...  Fiendish & fun, this rogue guides one gently by the hand and then kills them relentlessly.  Good for beginers, yet enough insane items and powers to make it fun for the advanced dungeon h4x0r.			"

												Dont buy it. this game is as good looking as it is front loaded. you run out of things to do very fast. It is as if the developers made the game *look* full of content just for people to buy it. Needless to say, the little there is falls short within a couple of ours of gameplay.This is more pernicious than it looks: this kind of endless procedure generated game (alla dundgeons of dredmor) got a reputation for its replayability. this game has none whatsoever. instead, they lock you into a tedious rinse and repeat play style awfully poor on resources from the startthis is a trap specially if you consider its price.now, if you dont mind the mindless playstyle, go ahead and make yourself confortable with this game.

												Pros:-There is a wide, WIDE range of items to collect, each one having their own strengths and weaknesses.-Multiple play modes, including the main ""exploration"" mode, three ""story"" modes, and a Daily Dungeon.-A good amount of humor, particularly in the post death-quips.-Its a Roguelike, so there are MANY ways to die horribly, and have fun doing it.-Sucessfully capture the important Roguelike feeling of triumph when you clear a depth you've been stuck at for ages.Cons:-Actual content in terms of enemies, zones and events are somewhat lacking.-This is more of a personal thing, but in my opinion the Blight (essentially a timer to complete the zone) spreads WAY too fast. I know that many Roguelikes have similar systems to ensure the player doesn't waste too much time exploring, but the Blight's speed can make it extremely hard to backtrack if you wind up at a dead end well into the zone.-Crystals become harder and harder to find as you continue to discover new log entries, and since Crystals are your main method of acquiring gear, it can be a hassle.Overal score: 9/10			"

												Pseudo turn based strategy game where there's not really any strategy.This is a rogue lite à la Rogue Lagacy. You play multiple run to upgrade your character and go a little bit farther each run. That would be good if the things you needed to do to get better stats/equipements were challenging.All you do is move around and collect metal scrap. When you encounter an enemie, you click on it until one of you dies. There's no tactic or strategy, it is entirely based on stats. The only strategy is, do I explore more of the level or the I exit the level right now...			"

												Shatted Planet is not very good. Yes the typo was intentional. It's light roguelike, aka roguelite game with some persistent upgrades that you buy in between the missions. Basically you just grind stuff and levels until you can manage worse enemies and there's absolutely no way to finish the game without it. In that sense the game plays out like Rogue Legacy: you grind until you win. Rogue Legacy was funny and more interactive though since in Shattered Planet you just move around, grid based, turn by turn, clicking enemies few times more to kill them, die, upgrade and repeat. It's quite nice game to look at and simple enough to entertain for couple of hours but after that it's pretty useless.			"

												This game really is a big let down for me.  You get to choose only a weapon and a hat and they are pretty bland across the board. Nothing feels special from item to item.  Attacking is simply left+clicking with no special skills. You might get lucky and get a companion early on but it also falls short of making the game more interesting.  I wasted $14 on this as an impulse buy.  I enjoy rogue-likes very much but this is just bland and not very complex. You will die, a lot.. and its not enjoyable and you start wondering why spend another minute clicking aimlessly.  I feel the art is good except for the sprites. The character/mob sprites feel cheap to me.  Its a shame to see such clashing things across the beautiful looking map/terrain.  This is just a dumbed down rogue-like with no goal other than trying to make it as far as you can. No special abilities. No special awe-inspiring items.  Just click click click until you're dead.

												AVOID THIS.The game's UI and graphics are very polished and the game is easy to learn. Unfortunately it gets repetitive about half an hour into the game. It's nothing but a grindfest--and a mediocre one at best.The leveling and combat mechanics are broken. During the course of a level you collect resources which are used to increase stats. Increasing stats have minimal effect on your character and gathering enough resources for the next stat upgrade becomes increasingly time consuming. With well-made roguelikes you can say to yourself, ""I learned a lot from that run, I'll do better next time."". Or maybe, ""The RNG gods were against me that time"". Not so with Shattered Planet. Shattered Planet forces you into the grind by always throwing impossible odds at you, requiring you to die, and requiring better stats/equipment to advance.  "

												After awhile, I realized why I couldn't recommend this game to my friends. Its simple, but not so simple as to draw me in. The games challenge really has nothing to do with how good you are at any point, it mostly has to do with grinding out scrap metal and crystals until you randomly purchase good enough gear to make it further, rinse, and repeat. Its a ""roguelike"", but every level will seem pretty much the same. Always. Certainly not a bad game, but also not worth what I paid for it.			"

												This is no Dredmore or Don't Starve.  This is not a quality rogue-like.  Because I have re-reviewed this game my time played has been reset.  Closer to 18-20 hours.  This game is a dumpster fire.  There is very little to do.  You just wander though a bland tile-based world until you die.  Then -- you do it again.  And again.  And again.  Then you have a few dollars to upgrade your stats.   Then you head out to the same place, again, and get 2 stages farther.  Then you die.  And do it again.  And again.  Repeat until your face melts.  This game isn't worth 5 dollars.  15 is a violation of the rules of gameplay.			"

												Sorry but I own about 100 Rogue games. This one sucks♥♥♥♥♥in an almost exclusive way. While the foundation of Rogue-Like games is here, the actual game play is awkward and clumsy. Meaning you cant plan your actual walking route if you need to. If your happy clicking one tile at a time and taking all day in even the earliest levels of this game, so be it, but the game offers nothing spectacular except a serious lack of reward and a tasking, time consuming progress that is all too often wiped away. The worst part being is that you never actually start with a weapon unless you buy one, which is done RANDOMLY. Not only that, but you arent guarenteed to even have a weapon even then. You might have a piece of very useless armor, a hat, or some food. So you suffer through punching everything for the first few maps until you get lucky enough to find some crystals THEN afford a weapon. Which rogue game do you not start with a weapon based on your class? None, thats right. There is a good reason too. While I like this game in concept, again, the execution is terrible. It basically suffers from that ""We dont really give you much of a chance to even see the game much less enjoy it"" syndrome most bad games have. I didnt have to play long to understand it was far far less about skill and more about gear and stats in this game. Gear that is far far away form being in your hands and all too easily discarded and lost due to this games stat progression.Let me give you an example: Rogue game Maj'eyal, A similar move to start time type ""turn based"" game. You get to talor your starting stats, can avoid mobs that are too strong, and have the ability to survive through skill and skills as much as gear. Hell, it even includes a magic wand you can use to teleport out of a dungeon if you run into trouble. You also identify items on pick up (or by hovering over them via mouse pointer)This game: Start with random whatever, have no class based skills so if you dont have any gear you basically try to avoid everything just to explore and pick crap up. Stas and putting points into stats only applies LATER in the game, not at the beginning of it. Meaning that if you put stats into your 'clone' they wont actually be usefull until the parts where you pick up armor and defense enough to survive three encounters. Until then you run a lot, hope you find healing♥♥♥♥♥♥ and wish you could identify anything that you had in your inventory. They tried to make a rogue-like but ended up just making a hack.			"

												Not recommended at all. I bought this game at 50% off, still think it's a rip off. Should be priced around 2 dollars at most. I've played this game in and out, maxed out all the stats and completed 90+% of the achievements (there are crazy achievements like killing 10000 monsters that I decided to ignore). This game is fun at first, but it gets repetitive soon enough. The thing that bothers me the most are the enormous amount of bugs. Reporting the bugs don't help, since the forum is flooded with advertising and apparently they have given up on updating this game.			"

												If you find it on cheap, this is a good buy.  Unfortunately the more you play the easier all future play becomes, giving the game a fun half-life.  Every time you play it will be less enjoyable than the last.  Now, this can be said of any game, but the reason for this half-life is built directly into Shattered Planet.You take on the role of a genetically engineered clone sent to investigate a planet blown apart by some unknown event, and with your play through you earn two distinct resources.  And when you complete a mission or die you make use of those resources to improve your stats for the next mission.Maps are procedurally generated and a great deal of events and items are entirely randomized, so you never end up with a map which becomes entirely boring.But even as playing through the endless gamemode where enemies consistently become harder to kill you can play until you become bored.  All you need is a shovel and a couple teleportation guns and the game is easy.I would not say the game is a dud, I would say it is easily better than The Pit, but that it does not hold a candle to the blaze of Dungeons of Dredmor, a far better rogue-like title.Shattered Planet is not a bad game, it is a game that loses its edge rather quickly however.

												The game is a lot of fun, and the development team is definitely one in which I am quite happy with. The game itself is a turn based, map exploration game with an RPG level system, but the main point which will draw your time and interest is the number of captivating item names, descriptions and art. This game isn't afraid to run headlong into satire, making use of pop culture such as Friday the 13th, Star Wars, Valentine's Day/Cupid, among other points. One point of note, is that the developers are still willing to make changes to the game and fix bugs as they appear, even years after the game is released. Most notably, an achievement that was unobtainable was fixed; most triple A titles wont give that kind of support this long into a game's release, and yet, this company took the time to do so. Good game if your into rogue-likes/rogue-lites, of if you simply wish to support a small development team which seems to be doing what it can to resolve the stigma of bad support, bugs and DLC that other, bigger companies have created in gaming.

Pros -Grid based landscape [Love FFT and Disgaea so it's like that]Excellent rogue-like gameplaySo much to see and exploreGet rewarded for seeing new things [landscapes/enemies/gear/events/ect]Unlock new characters as you playPermanent stat increases means you'll be able to go further the longer you playTakes some thought to get farther [don't get  surrounded and bring some items with you]Easter eggs. Easter eggs everywhere!Cons -Thought it would be MORE of a strategy game [only con and it doesn't take away from gameplay]Other thoughts -Don't get this game if you only like sports games and shooters. If you like any other type of game, you may as well pick it up. It's worth the whole $15.... hrm... and then some! I'm surprised it's not a $20 game. If you see it on sale there is no reason not to get it!You lose your items when you die. Be aware of that. Taking in great gear can help you get further but you might end up losing it. That's where the strategy really comes in. "

												Fun game that could have been so much more. It's a simple rougelike with an interesting theme, but sadly there's no substance to it or any meaningful gameplay choices. Mechanics are about as complex as ""let the enemy move to you and therefore waste their turn"", beyond that it's just a drawn-out game of numbers as you try to sustain through endless levels that don't really get any harder.Problems:-The pet AI is horrible and doesn't even seem inconsistent. I've died several times because my pet baited me to death, until I learned to just carry around 5 of them so I could let them occasionally die of their stupidity without also losing because of it. The pets will aggro and suicide on enemies you wanted to just walk past, or sit around doing nothing in the middle of a fight. The option to give them directions would cure half the frustrations of this game.-There is basically no item progression. You'll go into your run with top tier equippment every time after the first couple runs, and then when you get to a certain area you'll pick up some slightly better equippment that always spawns on the ground in plain sight, every single run. I didn't even bother checking the shops because of how absurdely unlikely it is to find anything better than what you started the run with. Therefore when an enemy drops an equip item, you're pretty much always just going to toss it.-The secondary items are hilariously unbalanced. There's a whole character built around using guns, but the only useful one is the teleport gun (which is an instant kill because of how easy it is to teleport things off the paths, has the lowest cooldown of guns, and I find it most every run). That's fun for a while, but gets dull once you have two of them and never actually have to fight anything again. The Shovel, the most basic item, seems completely useless until you realize that you can use it to quarantine the spreading time constraint mechanic on every single level. So we have those two, and everything else seems more or less pointless.-Eventually the levelling system just stops being rewarding. Once you've unlocked the characters, it just gives you pieces of gear that you'e already seen and might even have handy, and which you can only use once.-No endgame. Once you've pulled off 3 or 4 solid runs you can level up your character and just rampage through everything. The main game mode is endless, but it's more a challenge of attrition and there aren't any ultimate legendary mythril items to keep it fresh.The good:-The flavor text is hilarious.-The turn-based format is the best-executed I've ever seen.-The atmosphere is well doneReally, this game could have been amazing, it just needed to be balanced better and have more sustanence.

												(05/10) - At least PlayableI give up on roguelikes on steam...This one is actually nicely done, but it lacks soooo much, that it´s a shame it is a roguelike.Equip? Weapon and a helmet. Heck thats all u get... Enemies? Recycled enemy spammed through the entire game. Strategy? Nope! No items to be found that would be usefull plus a ""hectic-design"" via having to hurry up not to get into the corruption which slowly spreads. Oh, then there are keys which you can find. What do you mean, they should have a purpose? Sure, they open the door.... which leads.... nowhere.... more expensive weapons always better? why would you think that? some even kill you flat out. makes sense, right? level up, purchases and ""customization"" (there rly is none) outside of the level. what? that makes it no real roguelike? oh bless the gods.....Just don´t buy this game...

												I got this game for $2 at Chrono.gg and I love it. I don't care if it's Rogue-like or Rogue-lite or what have you. I just know it is a great little game you can play while doing other things like watching tv or chatting, etc. There are tons and tons of things to unlock and every run is different. It even has daily quests.			"

												Basically ""Baby's first Roguelike"", with good graphics, and easy, well-designed UI, but not a lot of depth. It's makes for a fun few hours, but you probably won't want to come back to it again later.If you're new to roguelikes and like the theme, you could do worse than giving this a try when it's on sale.

												Nice game to do some timewasting in. Get it on sale though, it's not worth the full price.			"

												Splendid little timewaster. Pretty laid back in that it's turn based, no huge penalty for dying; I mean, you lose all your stuff, though you keep enough progression elements for that not to be a problem. This is one of those games I'll probably always be nipping on for small sessions.			"

												archetypal roguelike: you die, you wont reach the end. items all lost. thankfully, some upgrades permanent , like rogue legacy (but not as much)game has a lot of shortcomings. mostly becasue it was written as a movbile game, and thuis was balanced for being free to play.it still feels at some levels , for example with the resources , as one of theme was supposed to cost real money.AND still has some bugs, btw beware when you buy abilities: have only the amount and no more. will empty your wallet.BUT it has that ""just one more run"" feeling.i cant seem to stop. i get frustrated, i alt tab, play other games, and bang. got the calling. i must come back, and try another time. which, will of course fail, as you cant win.tip: play the mission relatively quickly, contrary to what the game says, its not difficult, and you can keep your items.(dayly challenges are hard , but you dont lose anything) "

												As yet another addition to the seemingly endless slew of roguelike / roguelite games of recent, Shattered Planet doesn't do anything extraordinary to distinguish itself from most of it's predecessors.What it lacks in originality however is matched by a sizable amount of content variety, some good humor and characters, and levels that feel genuine and fun to explore. Staying closer to the older, tried and true trifecta of roguelike mechanics - turnbased gameplay, permadeath, and random generation allows Shattered Planet to focus on achieving a balanced and refined experience, and it's a lot of fun.If you're looking for something new and out there, this is not likely to satisfy that thirst, but if you're looking for a roguelike that is honest about what it is, Shattered Planet is a good place to look.

												Unlike more complicated rouge-likes, where you have a bajillion stats, Shattered Planet gets right down to the attack / dodge stat mechanics, with an emphasis on randomly rolling equipment as rewards, and rewards for completing the pokedex.I'm a big fan of turn based dungeon crawlers, and was enthused by the level of polish and unconventionally simple approach.

												Fun game that could have been so much more. It's a simple rougelike with an interesting theme, but sadly there's no substance to it or any meaningful gameplay choices. Mechanics are about as complex as ""let the enemy move to you and therefore waste their turn"", beyond that it's just a drawn-out game of numbers as you try to sustain through endless levels that don't really get any harder.Problems:-The pet AI is horrible and doesn't even seem inconsistent. I've died several times because my pet baited me to death, until I learned to just carry around 5 of them so I could let them occasionally die of their stupidity without also losing because of it. The pets will aggro and suicide on enemies you wanted to just walk past, or sit around doing nothing in the middle of a fight. The option to give them directions would cure half the frustrations of this game.-There is basically no item progression. You'll go into your run with top tier equippment every time after the first couple runs, and then when you get to a certain area you'll pick up some slightly better equippment that always spawns on the ground in plain sight, every single run. I didn't even bother checking the shops because of how absurdely unlikely it is to find anything better than what you started the run with. Therefore when an enemy drops an equip item, you're pretty much always just going to toss it.-The secondary items are hilariously unbalanced. There's a whole character built around using guns, but the only useful one is the teleport gun (which is an instant kill because of how easy it is to teleport things off the paths, has the lowest cooldown of guns, and I find it most every run). That's fun for a while, but gets dull once you have two of them and never actually have to fight anything again. The Shovel, the most basic item, seems completely useless until you realize that you can use it to quarantine the spreading time constraint mechanic on every single level. So we have those two, and everything else seems more or less pointless.-Eventually the levelling system just stops being rewarding. Once you've unlocked the characters, it just gives you pieces of gear that you'e already seen and might even have handy, and which you can only use once.-No endgame. Once you've pulled off 3 or 4 solid runs you can level up your character and just rampage through everything. The main game mode is endless, but it's more a challenge of attrition and there aren't any ultimate legendary mythril items to keep it fresh.The good:-The flavor text is hilarious.-The turn-based format is the best-executed I've ever seen.-The atmosphere is well doneReally, this game could have been amazing, it just needed to be balanced better and have more sustanence.

												First bought this game from the Google Play store. Loved the game so much, I got it when it came out on Steam. Consider this:- It's a solid port from iOs/Android systems to PC.- NO PAY TO WIN!- NO MICROTRANSACTIONS (like some candy based match 3 games I won't metion names)- Fairly simple gameplay mechanics.- lasts from 1 minute to about 10, depending on what you're playing.- Lot's of replayability.Only thing better would be if I were paid to play the game.

Product received for free
												My initial reaction was to be blown away by Shattered Planet's menu page and the ethereal space music, but I knew I had to click play eventually. Fairly soon I started receiving incoming messages from an alien creature on the bottom of the screen, which informed me of the gameplay basics before I arrived on my first world. What is really great about Shattered Planet is the overall play structure, as players can select levels ranging from fairly easy to virtually impossible: Explorer mode (varying difficulty), hard, very hard, and crazy hard. The higher the difficulty level, the higher the reward, which is another neat element of the game.Punching aliens in the name of science never sounded so good.Full preview here: http://indiegamemag.com/shattered-planet-preview-world-shattering-strategy-rpg/ "
