												Having played Nemesis, versus Jack the Ripper, and Testament of...Holmes, I have a soft spot for these games.  I've liked the style since I first played Ripper and continue to enjoy every game that I get into from this series.Nemesis finds Holmes pitted against Arsene Lupin, (a character of Maruice Leblanc's writings), the gentlemen thief.  While one could argue this way and that to the justice to the true character of Lupin, I think that misses the point.I found that the puzzles in this game are more enigmatic than those of the other games I have mentioned solely because Lupin is such a character.  I feel that the puzzles and tasks that lay before you as a player are cerebral and push you to observe everything.  In a sense, it is pushing you to be Holmes.  Though I may have groaned at another failed attempt at a puzzle, the sense of reward after finding the answer on my own was exceedingly gratifying.What Holmes game would you want to play that readily gives you all the answers?  I don't want one of those.  I'd rather sit and ponder art puzzles or move around a giant library to find the clues I need to complete each mission/task.If you're looking for a game that is easy and entertaining to pass the time, this may not be the game for you.However, if you are looking for a game that's going to push you and test you, have great history, and by chance have you learn something in the process, then you should give it a go.

												I've just completed the game and had fun with it, as there were some very good puzzles and I did like the story as well. The graohics are pretty much the usual for this series but they set the scene well. The audio is good as well, nothing out of the ordinary though. My two complaints about the game are too many MATH puzzles and there seemed to be too much retracing steps at every scene almost.  More than the usual. The map jump feature helps, but I actually thought I was going to lose my mind at the museum. Other than that I recommend the game as the story is good. Now I may move onto The Last Testament of Sherlock Holmes.			"

												I ""recommend"" for the people who like solving puzzles but I didn't like this game. Well, if we compare this one to the others, this one is a ""light game"". Different from ""Sherlock vs Jack"", ""Crimes and Punishments""... There's no dead peoples, murders... It's only about this famous french theft: Arsène Lupin. However, I think that Lupin is an annoying ""villain"". Since he decides to mess with Sherlock, he became some sort of ""The Riddler"", making you (Sherlock) read paper after paper, make puzzle after puzzle just find an object to solve another puzzle.... to find another puzzle... to find another paper... to make another puzzle...(in the same scenario) to find another paper to know where it will be his next theft... zZzIn my opinion, he annoyed me so much.  And the ending wasn't so exciting...However, there were things in this games that caught my attention. The puzzles in this game are way more difficult than the puzzles on ""Sherlock vs Jack"" for example. And as there's no such thing as to find out who is the killer, there's no deduction menu, so they increased the number of puzzles (and Lupin's annoying letters).And don't get fooled by the ""hints"" on the menu. They are the most useless and laziest hints I've ever seen in a game xD Really.			"

												Although this entry is a step above the previous low points in the series, I can't recommend it to even the greatest Sherlock Holmes fans.The writing, while not bad, cannot be considered good - it's simply boring. Watson is made to be an imbecile (as per usual in the Frogwares games), and Holmes goes on postulating and grandiloquising about five times more than he should do in his numerous speeches.Virtually every character that you meet is either eccentric or idiotic, the locations are *too* large when you are forced to find tiny clues and objects to further your progress, and the quiz that you occasionally have to answer fluctuates wildly between incredibly specific and unspecific answers.As with the other games, you can't collect items unless there is a reason to do so, which can be especially infuriating in situations both where the environment is huge, and when Holmes randomly decides to just start picking things up, breaking the gameplay style that you have been forced to play by for the past hours.On the plus side, while excessively large, the locations do look nice, and the first time that you hear the short endlessly looping soundtrack, it isn't unpleasant on the ears.Ultimately, Nemesis isn't a bad game, just one of the dullest point-and-clicks that I have ever played.

												I am playing and reviewing Frogware's Sherlock Holmes series in chronological order of the games. This is the fourth game in the series. I want to get this out of the way and say, that this felt like a fan fiction version of Sherlock Holmes. This is a cat-and-mouse game of Sherlock Holmes versus Arséne Lupin, a gentleman thief written by a Frenchman Maurice Leblanc which was written while the Sherlock Holmes books were being written. Historically, these two characters are not strangers to each other with Leblanc writing books about their opposition. But was forced to change those names for copyright issues.  I have not read any of Leblanc's works so I do not know if Arséne Lupin is being presented correctly, but I am confident that Frogware have done their research. I had alot of frustration with this game. While playing I spent alot of time stuck in the British Museum part of the game. Walking back and furth between puzzles that Lupin set up felt like a time sink, and in the story it was, but also confusing when trying to figure out which part of the massive museum has what in which section. This game just felt very tongue-in-cheek about the entire thing. At some parts it was hysterical but removed me from the immersion.Even though I felt like I was being dragged through the mud by Lupin, knowing that regaurdless of what I did I would never hamper Lupin until the very end of the game. I did have fun with this game expecially near the end. If there were slight branching paths with solving the puzzles or figuring out conclusions, this versus would work very well.There are parts in the game that made me smile. There were some clues left by Lupin which I, the player, had to take note which the game purposly avoids. They foreshadowed a later crime committed by Lupin, even further than the game wanted to offically mention. But I could not use this knowledge to make a trap for Lupin because of this limitation. There were also nods to the previous game, Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, which I was happy to understand. And some of the other characters are fun to interact with expecially a lady in pink, I forget her name. I never experianced the Creepy Watson which this game is famous for, so who knows if you will experiance it too.In summary: This game is good but not great. It is fun to deal with clues designed by a guy who want to get caught. But the middle part of the game is slow and bogged down by frustrating puzzles and being forced down a linear path until the VERY END. Get this game on a sale if you are unsure, it helps elevate any negative feelings. This game is still better than Sherlock Holmes and the Mystery of the Mummy. Even though I bash this game pretty hard, I still recommend it for those who want to complete the Frogware's game series.			"

Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis	Remastered		* 7/10A thrilling new adventure For Sherlock Holmes And The Good Doctor Watson! This time they're threatened by the dangerous and subtle creativity of the Master thief himself: Arsene Lupin!After The dark atmospheres seen in the previous chapter it's an astonishing step forward to live this new adventure in the magnificent locations of London.A challenging letter from Lupin to Holmes anticipates the plan for his future thefts. Lupin's fame isn't underestimated so Holmes and Watson, together with Lestrade will work to chase Lupin in a 5 days long hunt.Lupin will obviously Steal his targets day by day leaving every time clues in shapes of riddles. The idea is clearly brilliant, I loved the contrast of such an antagonist like Arsene Lupin, with a mastermind that can really rival Sherlock Holmes. I liked the riddles through the game but some sections end up being a bit repetitive, as some of Lupin's clues wil lead to other riddles that will lead to other riddles that will... Well, You got it, right? This will make you go back and forth a lot of times in the same locations. Somehow it didn't weight too much, though, but it might just be me.The music takes again the classic mood, with some previous tunes and other classic melodies which will accompany your puzzle solving sessions.Though in the original game it was designed to be played in First Person View, in this remaster we can constantly switch between a classic interface and the original First Person View. Sometimes one will be more comfortable than the other, depending on the situaions. Anyways the interface and menus are quite intuitive and a little improved. +++PROs+++ ENVIRONMENTS. In this chapter we'll be visiting some of the main building in London and they are really built and decorated with great care, so the impact is very strong and pleasant. Really god job. Unfortunately I had the impression there were quite few locations. ARSENE LUPIN. A perfect character to incarnate a great nemesis for Sherlock Holmes: clever, subtle, creative and still a gentleman. MUSIC. As usual pleasant tunes will accompany you in the game with some melodies used in the previous titles, new ones and classical pieces.---CONs--- REDUNDANCE. Some riddles will make you go back and forth all the time to move ahead and this scheme might prove to be too repetitive sometimes. Not to mention the re-used model for both the British Museum and The National Gallery directors, which was something quite unnecessary as they did a good job with other models so it wasn't much of an effort to make a new one, I guess.

												One of the hardest and most time consuming detective games, the hardest of the sherlock  holmes series, let me tell you something, without a guide this is impossible because the game doesnt require logic or mathematics (sometimes it does like all Sherlock Holmes games) but it requires lots of historical knowledge, you need to know things like when napoleon lost the war and where, who wrote a specific poem,etc and you'll never guess these if you dont already know them so use a guideAs for the story itself , it was really interesting and surprising, there's a nice plot twist involving Lupin in the game. I am a big fan of Arsene  myself, i have read his books and i have his pic as  my avatar, he is a very interesting character and you trying to catch a master thief makes it very interestingThe only problem i have with this game is sometimes its obvious how Arsene is gonna get in and where but the game just wont let you do anything about it, i would recommand it to puzzle solving lovers, arsene and holme fans			"

												Decent mystery game with a fairly fluent story and an atmospheric game world that seems too clean for London at 1895. The option of switching between first and third person view was necessary for a couple of moments in the game. The puzzles themselves were fun for the most part with a couple of real stinkers in there - with some points requiring that you switch areas, the clues need to quite clear regarding this or you'll spend pointless time examining the nearby environment.

												Ah, ""Holmes: Nemesis"". In fact, who the heck is Arsene Lupin? Isn't Moriarty usually Holmes' nemesis? Ah, well.This game is different from all other Holmes games, in that you know who the culprit is, you just need to catch him.As such, you pretty much spend your time playing his wretched 'game' of cat-and-mouse, where Lupin deliberately leaves clues to his next hit, and you have to follow along.Like ""Holmes: Awakened"", you get standard features like Holmes Vision and Teleportation, which are very handy in the game. But, unlike other games, this game involves a lot of mathematical work. AUUUGH. Maths.How much Maths? Not a lot (i.e. counting, decrypting, mass conversions, etc.), but it gets rather repetitive and painful, especially in the library-museum part.And a lot of the time, you'll be following these cryptic rhymes to decode what the heck Lupin has installed for you.In terms of characters, some of them are quirky, like the museum curator, and some of them a bit of a pain in backside, like Watson. Darn it, man! Why do you have to be hungry at a time of crisis?But the Queen and Lupin part -- I don't think I'll ever get that out of my memory. Not that it was mesmerising, but it was -- ""unorthodox"", to say the least.Interfaces haven't changed a lot since ""Holmes: Awakened"". But you can certainly do a lot more things this time, with the amount of activity Lupin forces you you to complete. This means great variety in the puzzles in the game. But I still don't like the text-response puzzles.Plot-wise, not too heavy. I mean, you already know who the culprit is, so I guess this one's a more action-adventure than an actual story driven game. Good thing? Well, different.So, I'll give this one a 8/10. Could be better, but is alright where it stands.			"

												This game is fun and challenging! Voice acting is pretty good. Graphics are great. Puzzles are challenging but not impossible. Characters are interesting. Love the ability to play as Holmes, Watson, or Lestrade. (however, the game decides when you play each character) I really like the music choice, fitting for the game and quite pretty!

												I got this as a part of a pack in a sale. It was definetly worth the money. Overall, it's nice looking (bit aged though) and entertaining. Some funny scenes here and there. The puzzles are rather hard, and some of them probably unsolvable. But the built-in help function will get you over that (IF you figure out how to use that, lol).  From time to time, it is a bit too much running back and forth searching for and fetching items. And most of the time, you cannot get something if you don't now yet that you need it, meaning places you have already searched change their state and reveal that things can now be picked up because you watched a cutscene etc. and what seemed to be just part of the scenery can be picked up then. Anyway, overall, that is just a shortcoming, still enjoyable.			"

												I believe this to be one of the most painfully boring games I have experienced. I must say that unless you really love Doyle, math, and the Queen, this really isn’t the game for you. Unfortunately, being American and not particularly fond of algebra, I felt completely unprepared. I am sure that if you are British then you learned the necessary history required to understand these puzzles in fifth grade; I however had no idea that the security of the entire country depended on ravens, nor am I particularly well-versed in the Napoleonic wars. Review your history books if you don’t intend to cheat.I would suggest that if you have a child in fifth grade then this is a great opportunity to inflict countless algebraic problems on them and pretend that it’s fun. They’ll also learn a lot about British history, places of interest in London, and observe lots and lots and lots of artifacts. However, I would hardly call this a game for a child since it has several mature references and innuendo and…art—so I do -not- in fact suggest giving this to your child.Lupin is a fun character, so I had high hopes for this story. However, the voice actor for Lupin was even more annoying than Watson. But not quite as annoying as his poetry.All that to say, unless you really love Frogware and are feeling particularly patriotic , might I suggest a different pastime—like Sudoku.  "

												This is a ""Do you recommend this game?"" Yes AND No.Puzzles are overall not bad, a lot with math (too many IMHO), which is good and worth a playthrough but...The plot is not so good as it could;A good chunk of puzzles have inherent backtracking in a zone to solve it (toward the end it becomes annoying to do even with fast travels);Some moment are useless to even exist (ex: ""Watson, go get a hansom"" );A crap tons of locations exist for NOTHING, just deceive and add things to the London map (and they fail in their job of deceiving you);Definitely not the best Sherlock Holmes game made by Frogwares, if you really want it wait for a good steam sale.

												I realise that Nemesis was released almost a decade ago but if an older game is going to be re-released onto any digital marketplace then I would expect the game to receive the bare minimum in optimisations in order to perform adequately on modern hardware.The video setup says it supports a wide-screen resolution of 1920x1080 yet everything appears to be stretched and in lower resolution. Certain graphics options are locked to minimum or are set to off, the option for highest detail and shadows will not activate, even with multiple restarts it just won't stick.With a GTX 1070 I'm experiencing severe FPS drops when looking at certain objects or locations, such as the red and white curtain in Sherlock's home or much of the gallery. It's quite unexpected considering my PC specs and how undemanding the game is, yet the game will often drop to 30FPS, this is with v-sync limited to 60FPS.I'd also noticed quite a fair amount of missing textures, particularly on interactive doors. There will be times where doors and cases will appear closed but remain open, allowing me to clip through them.The keybinding settings are odd. I can't rebind the inventory, I can't use keys like left-ctrl. There's no notice explaining what's reserved until I'd discover them later in-game.There are a small number of spelling and grammatical errors but it's not a huge deal, as there isn't much immersion left to break after experiencing so many visual glitches.Sometimes I would notice that dialogue audio ended abruptly, most notably with Sherlock during conversation. It was only a few milliseconds but noticeable nonetheless. Though I can easily tell that certain character's lines are over compressed and that a pop filter was not used during recording to protect the microphone.It feels like mouse smoothing is present. Combined with the FPS drops makes for a sluggish experience.To me it honestly sounds like every character is voiced by David Mitchell doing a terrible David Mitchell impression.I often found that one of the most difficult challenges in the game was opening the door in first-person mode.I do wish there was an auto-save function, fortunately the game never crashed, unlike other older point and click games I've played recently.Despite all this, the main aspects I do like are how involved I needed to be with discovering and solving clues. It can be very engaging until the ""moon logic"" starts creeping in. I also very much appreciated the the in-built hint system, that I relied on heavily, and I also played the majority of the game in first-person mode as I found third-person camera angles to be too janky.

												Even though this game is titled Sherlock Holmes - Nemesis nearly everywhere, the game's actual title is Sherlock Holmes vs Arsene Lupin, which was changed in several countries for some reason; I can understand America, since as we all know Americans are cultureless swine who would have no idea who Arsene Lupin is, but the reasoning behind changing it for the UK and Australia is a mystery I'll leave to Holmes. This game is most well known in the series due to the Creepy Watson effect, in which Watson follows the player by constantly teleporting behind them due to lack of a walking animation, but what I didn't realize before was that this was actually tragically removed in a 2010 remastering of the game, putting an end to creepy Watson's legacy. It's still a very good adventure game, though, so I'd highly recommend picking it up. The puzzles in between each of the big events can get a bit tedious at times, mainly at the end, but if you can deal with the game showing its small budget every now and then it's well worth getting for fans of Sherlock Holmes.

												Sherlock Holmes and Arsene Lupin... this game should be great, yeah? Well this is just as good as fries with pasta, you might enjoy both but mixed together are horrible. That is because the plot is really terrible : Arsene Lupin tries to steal British treasures in an effort to prove French are better. Never mind that Lupin in his canon is an anti-hero, i.e. a character that performs acts that are normally immoral (theft) but does so towards a good cause. Also, let's forget that the French and British empires had put their differences aside and in less than a decade after the timeline of this game, they would form an alliance (Entente). Even if you are willing to disregard these, I guarantee you that you will be disappointed by some of Lupin's escapes which seem more like out of a child's cartoon than the witty adventures of Arsene. And finally, the ending is the biggest let down of them all, with some ""gentleman"" non-sense going around, completely disregarding pretty much everything that has happened previously in the story.The puzzles and object finding are tedious and not really interesting. A redeeming factor are some great settings and voice acting in locations such as the London Tower, the British Museum and the National Gallery. Unfortunately, those are not enough to save this title.Avoid, unless you are extremely bored.			"

												I gave the game a chance. I'm willing to read a bit and listen to some chat but the tedious-awkward point and click walking was getting to me in the museum while going through the dozens of paintings trying to see if the game wanted me to listen to holmes find a clue.  All very good if you're into art as he gives a full rundown of each one but dont expect to have a good view as you're stuck in the camera.  What made me uninstall the game was when asked what the painting depicted and the ridiculous answer you needed to give which I fouind out by googling.  Then you're asked to go back to look at a specifric painting again. I've never uninstalled a game so fast in my life.			"

												Sure this won't mean much to many people but sadly Arsené Lupin is not well portrayed. No longer is he his gentleman self but in this game is commiting crimes to apparently prove how stupid the English are. Very unlike Arsené Lupin.			"

												For anyone interested in playing this game I do not recommend it.I see there are trolls everwhere... and their comments here are off the subject....I did and do play all sorts of games and have played many years worth of adventure and games like the Sherlock Holmes series,,, and I really started to enjoy these .... but eventually the game was getting really tedious and not any fun .... hench the bad review.I still think this game is a waste of your time to attempt to play....period.

												What can I say, I REALLY like this Sherlock Holmes game series. Therefore I recommend this game to Sherlock fans, or Lupin fans, or even to hidden object game fans. Just get ready for running around back and forth all the time (thank god for map shortcuts) and solving way too many math puzzles. Those were very much not my favorite. This game is also lacking dead bodies, but at least you get to see pretty art everywhere. Worth it.			"

												I'm a fan of the Sherlock Holmes games, but this one let me down on more than one occasion.- You can see the plot twists coming from a mile away.- Paradoxally, some of the puzzles are so remote and hard to figure out you can't possibly do it without the included guide.- The voice acting is awful through and through. More than usual. Very disappointing in a game that relies so much on dialogues.- The soundtrack is very limited, and apparently almost entirely made out of classical music. That's okay, but it's still limited.- The mise en scene/cutscene direction is laughably bad in more than one occasion. Also more so than usual in this series.Only redeeming value is the recreation of a few iconic London landmarks in lovely detail.			"

												The writing is a little dodgy here and there (if you explain the main act of the magician, suddenly all the small but nevertheless impossible tricks become so trivial that no explanation for them is needed...) but I liked the final revelation. Unlike many other Sherlock Holmes games (and that is also an unwelcome trend in crime novels in general), there was no detail revealed during the big monologue at the end that turned the whole story upside down. It all made sense with the information you already had from during the game.The gameplay is enjoyable. With the interaction highlight and a very indepth built-in hint system, anyone can finish the story.Thumbs up!			"

												Nemesis is a great addition to the Sherlock Holmes series. The story of Holmes rising to the challenge of a criminal adversary is familiar to any fan, and this time it's the gentleman thief character Arsene Lupin. Lupin is a truly interesting character, which makes solving his thefts a fun task. The story does have its weak spots near the end ( The ridiculous thing with Queen Victoria, not to mention what happens when you actually catch him...) but they aren't enough to take away from the game's overall value. Personally, I think Nemesis is the best game of the series so far.Graphics and gameplay wise, Nemesis is nearly identical to Awakened. The hint system is much better though, which is helpful since the puzzles in Nemesis tend to be more math related. Though math puzzles may sound daunting, the puzzles are actually quite fun this time around, and the option to use hints eliminates any ragequit frustration. There is quite a bit of backtracking in the museum section, but you can use the fast travel system to get between areas quickly.Also, Creepy Watson has been fixed, (un)fortunately.			"

												The game pits Holmes against Arsene Lupin, who leaves clues for the detective to allow solving his preposterous crimes. The entire premise is honestly little more than an excuse to have the player solve extremely contrived puzzles. While the game works well enough as your standard point-and-click adventure, I was glad enough to be done by the end.			"

												I really liked it!It wasn't as exiting as some of the other Sherlock Holmes games, because of the lack of murders, but the riddles and puzzles were a LOT trickier than in the other games.Unfortunatly, the endgame is mostly guesswork.So not very much Mystery, but if you are a puzzle geek as I am then you are going to love it!

												Probably one of the few mystery/puzzles games that I was banging my head on the desk in frustration! I've never met a game that truly pushed my buttons like this one did. The voice acting was really quite bad and the game mechanics themselves was really poor. Admittedly this is a rather old game so that is to be expected but I just can't find myself enjoying this game a second time. If your for that kind of game....have fun. Now please excuse me as I put some ice on my sore forehead.			"

												Upon first installing this game I was disappointed it wouldn't run at all, or even stream from my newer PC.  :(But luckily, after a little searching here on the Steam Discussions, I figured out to install the latest two PhysX Nvidia drivers and now all is well.  Yay!For anyone new to this franchise:  play the demo first to decide if you like this type of game.  I only payed $2.49 during a sale, so my wife and I aren't terribly disappointed.We've played other Frogware games like this one so are familiar and usually happy with the gameplay.  It's too bad there doesn't seem to be any controller support for it, which is yet another negative.Our main complaint is, unlike some previous games in this series that were enjoyable, Sherlock: Nemesis quickly became quite tedious.  There are almost no ""puzzles"" at all; rather, you point-and-click on every possible item in hopes that you find something you can pick up or interact with.  Then, you almost randomly search every room or area for some unknowable item to help with the current linear quest.  We found little logic to what items we were supposed to be searching for and therefore had no way to play the game without using a Walkthrough.  At that point, the game is pure tedium and not worth playing if you're looking to solve puzzles and use your brain.  We quit before even reaching the halfway point in the game.Not horrible, but certainly not the best Sherlock game in this series.			"

												Incredible. Certainly an installment that is not to be missed. This combines the best parts of the two previous installments: the improved engine of Awakened, with the good writing, proper Sherlockian theme, great classical music, and sumptuous locations of the Earring. In fact, said locations consist of well-known London landmarks such as the National Portrait Gallery, The Tower of London, The British Museum and Buckingham Palace. If you have ever visited London as a tourist, or lived there, you will be amazed at how similar the in-game renditons are to the real thing.Bad parts? The British Museum section drags on for far, far, far too long. Also, there is still something off about the writing. Unlike the Earring, which took itself almost completely seriously, this game is rife with puns, innuendo and as many references as in a Pratchett book. While funny, this somehow doesn't seem appropriate for the setting. I still think the Earring did it best.			"
