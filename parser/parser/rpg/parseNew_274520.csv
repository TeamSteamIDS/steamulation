Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!I'm about one... maybe two good jump scares away from being institutionalized. Playing as an Indonesian schoolgirl with a magic phone, an archeologist with amnesia, and a toddler with diapers full to the brim has had an ill effect on me. My heart just can't take it – my mind just can't take it. The filaments that hold my fragile psyche aloft are pulled taut, straining as each frayed fiber falters and my sanity slips closer towards the cold, dark depths of derangement. Which isn't super great, really. But I'll gladly surrender my faculties for a game as fun as “Darkwood.”“Darkwood” isn't a “Slender” or “Amnesia” clone. This is a game in the vein of old school horror where atmosphere was king – you'll hear lots of comparisons to the “Silent Hill” series. The key to good horror is cultivating a crushing, foreboding world environment... one that fosters paranoia and unease the whole way through. Sure, jumpscares are necessary to finally break the tension, but the best horror games are dripping and oozing in atmosphere. The whole world should FEEL hostile, not just the denizens that inhabit it. This game doesn't want you playing it, no. It wants to play you.Here's what you can expect playing “Darkwood:” your hands should be clammy with an itch you can't scratch, not now. Your face should be inches from your monitor, blinking only when necessary, scanning wildly back and forth for something, ANYTHING, to betray the game's ill intent. As you talk with each bizarre NPC you should feel nervous, wondering when the conversation will go from benignly creepy to malignantly violent. And when you finally encounter an unspeakable horror, you'll have to make that gut decision whether to run or stand your ground. I recommend running. Like with all survivor horrors, you are at a notable disadvantage. You'll also be able to set up hasty barricades... rocking back and forth as claws scratch and jaws click outside, tearing your defenses down piece by piece.There are a lot of cool things happening with this game. Your vision is funneled, forcing the aforementioned wild scanning. You can see the world generally in your “peripheral vision,” but you have to be looking relatively dead-on to see any actual threats. They'll be effectively invisible otherwise. You'll inject yourself with concoctions extracted from fauna and flora that provide mutations. They will grant a boost in one way and a hindrance in another. There's a crafting aspect that's pretty basic right now but feels natural... rough and raw. Besides health you have a stamina meter, one you'll have to keep an eye on when deciding whether to fight or fly. Graphically speaking, “Darkwood” isn't exactly next gen, but it is highly stylized and creepy. It's a beautiful, dark, Gothic painting – like the ones where the eyes follow you wherever you go and it talks smack about your mother. And the music will chill you to the bone. If the environment and enemies start to give you a little break, don't worry. The music will swell and put you right back on edge, or the heavy creaks and sudden cracks of the sound design.Like any good horror this is a challenging game. I do recommend playing with permadeath on. Adds to the spook factor! Anticipate shedding lots of your own pixelated blood. My biggest gripes? It's hard to determine sometimes (between how dark the game is and how... generally dark the colors are) what  I can search and interact with and what's just a creepy thingy. The controls also take some getting used to, but that seems appropriate considering the genre. Now seeing that this is an Early Access title my recommendation is tentative and subject to change. But at the moment there is nothing out on Steam quite like this. Every day you hear people bemoan the death of “true survival horror,” myself being one of them. Well folks, it wasn't dead. Just waiting for the right moment to sing its siren song... and draw us in at least once more, into those dark and dreary woods where light dares not penetrate and your screams can't quite escape.

								<Subject to change>My first few hours in Darkwood were certainly very interesting, after the impressive prologue I decided to go speak to an NPC i was advised to find. After I did this I realised daylight was running out, and here's what happened next:-Returned to my safehouse and pushed a wardrobe up against a gaping hole in the wall.-Panicked because I didn't bother to collect the tools necessary to barricade the house.-Everything is now pitch black, my cone of vision is   tiny -I weep as I slowly walk myself to the 'front lobby' room because it has no windows to reduce the chance of being spotted.-I hear the moans of some unknown ethereal horror-Check both the exterior and interior door to ensure they are closed-The moaning gets louder-The action prompt for the front door now says 'close door', meaning it has been  opened -My cone of vision is still 2-3ft btw-I quickly close the door-The prompt changed to 'close door' again-I close the door again-Moaning is still extremely loud-Continue in this pattern for 60 seconds in sheer terror before the door finally stays closed for a while.-I sigh a breath of relief-Something swiftly moves past the far edge of my cone of vision-* very loud moaning continues  *-The monster was in the lobby with me for the whole night-I'm sure i'm going to die-Suddenly Daybreak-*Day 2*			"

								Dear Journal: I keep coming back to life, despite my best efforts. I thought death would be a release, but it's only a continuation of the torment. In what I'm sure is a futile effort to keep my sanity, I will try to catalogue my various deaths.Death 1:No weapons in sight and night is falling rapidly. In a misguided attempt to make the animals friendlier towards me, I've brewed a strange concoction from the local mycological flora and injected myself with it. The only effect I've seen towards my original intention was that the rabbits have stopped gnashing their teeth when I approach and have opted for a more subtle, indignant sideways glance. Night fell and I drank the well water as I was told by the nonchalant wolfman (nonchalant in that he seemed to have no compunctions that he was a freak of nature) that woke me up. The generator has failed and my only light is the mocking phosphorescent glow of my last flare. I hear things approaching. Hungry things. I've pushed my wardrobe in front of the window in the hopes that it would stop them. It did not, and a howling naked man has bashed my skull in and, presumably, eaten me.Death 2:Woken up by the wolfman again. He doesn't seem to remember me. I show him the dogtag as before and, as before, he tells me to seek out the chicken lady. My travels this time have been more fruitful. I've discovered several nonfunctional vehicles nearby, each containing a substantial amount of fuel. Hopefully this will help me keep the generator running this time. I've also found enough material to fashion a crude weapon for my inevitable self-defense. On top of that, I've found a bear trap with which to lay a trap for any more au naturel forest men that want to avail themselves of my sweetmeats. Once again, night falls and I drink from the well. I'm somewhat prepared this time. Again they come. I catch one in the bear trap and proceed to beat him into submission. Shortly after, another bursts in behind me, catching me by surprise. A pitched battle erupts, with me barely surviving to fell my opponent. I'm bleeding badly, but have enough rags to fashion a welcome, if somewhat unsanitary, bandage. Eventually morning arives and I stride wrecklessly back out into the forest, perchance to happen upon more provisions and survive another night in this hellish place. I happen upon a corpse, seemingly hidden under a jagged thicket. Immediately upon poking it, it explodes and I'm slain by its cadaverous stench.Death 3:Again the wolfman comes. I think he's mocking me. Is it a he? It sounds male. I have little luck in finding anything useful in my wanderings. The woods are crawling with wolves (the normal kind... I didn't think to stop and check their gender), and I have to skirt around them constantly. I find some alcohol, rags, and a lighter, but little else. At least I can keep warm with this, one way or another. Night falls and I drink the water. I'm beginning to wonder if I should be following the wolfman's advice at this point. For all I know, it's the well water that's keeping me here. I can do nothing but sit in my dark house, hoping they don't find me and tear me limb from limb. My hopes are completely unfounded. Having no other weapons, I quickly fashion a crude Molotov cocktail and hold it at the ready for when something crashes through the window in front of me. Alas, one crashes in behind me. Panicking, I drop the freshly lit incendiary at my feet, immediately catching myself and the wildman ablaze. I'm not sure which of us died first. I can now officially say that immolation has been my least favorite way to go.Death 4:Banshee... or witch? I'm unsure at this point.Death 5:Pack of wolves. Gender unknown.Death 6:%$@&ing CORPSE BOMB!Death 7: Ok, this is getting a little ridiculous. I'm just going to sit in my house and pretend I'm dead. Maybe the universe, or whatever cruel deity placed me here, will forget that I exist and move on to torment some other poor soul... Nope.Ten out of ten. Would die again!			"

								So, I invested 31 days (in game time) to one world, thinking I could go through it and get some of the many endings this game provides. On the 30th day I go into a hellish pigshed and find a monstrosity that no words can describe, the only way of ending said creature (besides being insane and fighting it directly) was to electricute it.In order to do this I needed a particular cable that was sold by a good buddy of mine called Piotrek, whom I had just given all the items to for the rocket he was building.At the time he was really excited about this and told me that by tomorrow he was going to fly to the moon or something of that sort.What was unknown to him was that I had allowed the Wolfman to see one of the components to his rocket (I had no clue that this would cause the ship to explode, sadly.) So the very next day I walk to  Piotrek's house only to see him dead on the ground, skewered by the many pieces of shrapnel that came out of the exploding pile of junk.In a flood of sadness and fury, I head over back to the wolf camp and began talking to my partner in crime, whom was sh*tting himself in laughter after seeing the explosion.Once I realized that I wasn't able to finish off the monstrosity, I stride behind the Wolfman, brought out my pistol and put a bullet into the back of his head.I then promptly loot the dead man's body and walk out into the middle of the meadow as I waited for the time to tick away.As the sun set I felt my body begin to corrode away until my heart stopped, and I fell to the ground dead.I'm sorry, Piotrek.

								This games makes a great impression in the prologue and in your first night out of the tutorial.Mine went like this.-I was able to gather a bit of resources and boarded up a door and a window-I turned on the generator since I moved a lamp into a room I thought would be perfect-I moved the lamp to the window which was boarded up so I could see outside as well as inside-As the night got darker I see creatures outside through the small cracks within the boarded up window-Moans closing in and sounds of furniture moving in the room next to mine-The generator dies and everything is now pitch black-I sit for a while in the darkness-When the door opens and this THING enters-I was luckily able to kill it with my plank with nails in it-Close the door and hold out-Day 2 starts and I leave the room I was in-I check the house to see how it got in-NOTHING was moved from its original spot and no windows or doors were brokenSo...how did it get in?

Place them in a bowl and douse them with a gallon of Silent Hill's thick, foreboding, dread-inducing atmosphere.4. Pour all ingredients into a blender; set to ""puree"" for 10 seconds.5.

								got to The Old Forest, found my new home and had all the supplies to move in. fixed up the well, was able to blocked up all the windows and fortify the doors i needed to, moved the furnature into one main room to cover the doors and windows at night (extra protection from the locals, just in case) and got all of my supplies put away and prepared for the great night i would have in my new home.and what a night it was.after about 30 seconds after getting my late night drink from the well, walking back inside and pushing the wardrobe over the door again, the fun began. they started with the windows. i watched in horror as almost all at once, my window barriers started to explode in showers of splinters in the rooms surrounding mine. i could hear the abominations  climbing in, roaming the halls, smashing my doors off their frames, and hunting for my flesh while they screamed out in anger. oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ now they were at my doors, both being broken into at the same time. needing to react, i choose a door and held the wardrobe in place with my body the best i can, while i wildly unload my handgun at the first one to break in. a second broke through the window in my room, got past the furnature and came after me. i drove my axe into its horrifying face over and over again until i cut it in two. sadly it was still not dead, as its severed torso crawled after me and i cleaved its head open with an overhead swing. afterwards i realized i forgot to hold the wardrobe in place and another was squeezing through, while another came running in through the first door. luckily, my terrified self accidentily came up with a great idea! i grabbed the wardrobe and used it as a shield as the two pushed against it, pinning me into the corner of the room. at this point  i realized how ♥♥♥♥ing stupid i was for getting myself trapped in a corner, but at least they couldnt get at me, right?you bet your sweet♥♥♥♥♥they could still get methey were smart, the two of them, they really were. must have went to evil mindless monster college together. one of them had been pushing on the left corner just enough that the right side started to open a crack. by the time i saw this i was already too late, before i could pull that side completly shut, the seconds giant maws started snapping at me, as i held the corner against it. realizing i could no longer hold it off, as the crack was slowly getting larger, and those awful teeth got closer, i had but one option. i let go of my shield and began chopping at it with the axe, with all of my might. and as it fell, the most beautiful thing happened. the sun rose. and the remaining monstrocities left. if life has taught me anything, its that monsters are ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and are afraid of the sun.after that terrifying encounter,  my hands were coated in a layer of sweat, my stomach hurt from the tension, and i may or may not have actually♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. maybe just a little. ok i didnt, but i feel like i might have. needless to say, the house is a wreck, none of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s dropped loot, and i really needed a better plan for next time. i havent had a game do that to me in a long time. i absolutly love this game, i am completly addicted and if you are looking for a survival horror game you found it11/10 ""Its Ok"" ~ IGN10/10 ""I may or may not have actually♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. maybe just a little"" ~ Me			"

Early Access Review
								*Early Access Review - Subject to ChangeI backed this game up from Indiegogo and I am happy to say I am 100% satisfied by what it is at this stage and the things to come. Creepy, immersive, rogue-like and  top down horror game with sounds,art and gameplay that will keep you on the edge of your feet, you'll also die alot. because this game is absolutely brutal with permadeath on.To start off you'll have a couple of save files you can choose from with the ability to skip the entire prologue or play it. You'll also be able to turn on or off permadeath, the real way to play but that is up to you ;). The game starts you off with explaining to you about a man with a dream, You'll be treated with some seriously scary art and  you'll be  very confused. You'll search around a bit to find an axe to break a passage but at the same time find your dog dieing and you'll have to make a choice, to end his suffering or to leave him. Now back to the  log and you'll learn the tutorial of the game, the basics of attack and how to craft and the things you need to create to survive int his horrible hell. As you head south you'll find a cabin and there you'll meet a man inside which will begin the entire story of DarkWoods.Darkwood is very immersive and scary, You'll feel it as you move your character around this living breathing world. The sound is downright phenomenal and done brilliantly to give  so you can feel the world. It will scare you when you turn corners in this game. From the winds blowing across  the trees, to the moving shadows, and the eerie noises around the woods. The characters you'll meet in this game is also very creepy, with well animated features  drawn with personality combined with decent dialogue.The gameplay is a survival top down game horror game that takes place in the woods somewhere in russia where theres day and night cycle with items and locations in the woods randomly generated and randomly placed. The story and building layout is usually the same, so are the quests but the amount of randomization is enought to keep you satisfied. Everything is done well to give you the feeling that everytime you step out its never the same. Also read everyone's dialogue or read your journals, yes Dialogue will give you hints of location changes of certain npcs you'll want to take advantage of, especially the wolf merchant. The further you go out into the woods the darker and more dangerous it'll get So keep your base in check because the map in this game doesn't tell you where your position is. You'll have to remember the way back. Also BE WARNED OF THE WELL MECHANIC YOU MUST DRINK FROM THE WELL TO SURVIVE EACH NIGHT or you will suffer death hence forcing you to return to base every night. The goal of the game at the moment is To explore the quest and survive. The game mechanic works by your character facing a direction you'll see a frontal cone view,  You can only see where you point your mouse and whats under certaint trees with the cursor on it, even if an enemy is behind you you'll have to look behind otherwise your vision is obscured. You also can't see past trees or buildings which will give you  you immersion and realism. You'll also have to be on your feet and aware at all times. The top left displays your health in red, stamina in grey and buffs along with debuffs go the very top left. Use up too much stamina and you'll move at a very slow rate so sprint wisely otherwise become easy target for monsters. Also at the same time the crafting and inventory is limited, but as you progress in the game you'll be able to discover recipes to craft things such as  barricades, torches, traps, healing items and weapons and collect mushrooms to inject yourself so that you can improve your trait, later on with this feature you'll have to sacrifice a certain trait to gain a new one. Some will help your vision, some seems sorta useless at the moment.You'll also be able to interact with objects to move it around like book cases to cover door etc or pick locks or even break down doors. To attack you'll have to equip an item into the limited 3 hotbar slots and then hold down right mousebutton followed by pressing left mouse button so the controls feels very unique and fits the game perfectly. It will take time to dig into your inventory, pull out an item and to actually use it, Also note to set up a trap it'll take time to set up along with searching large cases or items. Everything in this game adds to that realism and hardcore of survival games.The game is hard, the elements of the woods will get to you, There are things you can accidently step on such as mushroom and bodies that will poison you if you don't watch your footing, patrolling  monsterous  dogs and creatures from the very depth of your nightmares which screams in the middle of the night out for your blood.  When day turns to dusk it is time to go back to base and hold out as long as you can until morning to continue  your survival. Currently the best way is to probabaly cut line of sight from monsters in the dark and pray that they won't find you. Probabaly will need more work ont his mechanic to give it a little more to do than just hiding in corners especially on permadeath mode.This game is a survivalist horror hardcore dream and it was worth the wait, it is currently in alpha 1.0 and it is pretty solid gameplay save some bugs here and there and the fact that it is unfinished. The woods might be very dark and seeing things might require a gamme adjustment, Inventory is very scarce so be ready to horde since many items do not respawn so it can be tough to find those supplies. Be warned that you will die. I've played  hours and only survived 4 days, most of my friends are stuck at 4. You'll be playing this game quite a bit my friends but that is what makes it so great.+ Phenomenal Sounds that is immersive, the heavy breathing, the monsters and the woods itself gives it life and horror at the same time really powerful sounds and brilliantly done.+ Rogue-like environment placement of items and places of discoveries+ Realism from what you do, searching, crafting, setting up traps, learning to fight your enemies, the interaction between items. Also the + Creepy, animated art from the nicely designed characters and the map itself, everything is alive including the trees waving, grass blowing.+ The difficulty of this game is Hard, Brutal, and you're absoulutely dieing.+ immersion level +++ - Need more ways to fight back monsters, Corner surviving at night in corner with vision blocking is fun and scary but can get really overplayed.- Multiplayer!- Game still in beta, things in work- Dark, too dark hard to tell if you throw something off sometimes.- sound is a little loud, even when turned down but its damn  good- Game isn't done so don't expect to finish the main story.- Bugs here and there but very minor- Characters should have voice acting to those dialogues, creepy voice acting.- loading time in the beginning takes a bit of time, due to generatings of the rogue-like environment even for my pc.- Needs auto Check for skip prologue, sometimes forgetting to hit it is annoyingCurrently trying to pass day 4 on permadeath			"

Early Access Review
								I'm gonna be honest, at first I wasn't so sure about this game. Due to all the positivity from reviews, I went ahead and bought it, started a permadeath file, and jumped straight in. The first thing I noticed once I booted it up was that it looked absolutely astounding for a top down game. It oozes atmosphere from literally every crevice, and darkness looks and feels like a living thing, like it's out to consume you. However, once I got past the equally atmospheric prologue and was thrown out into the world to fend for myself, I started to worry. I went out and got some supplies during the day, and once night came along, I ran back to my hideout and hid. Then I did the same the next night. And the next. And the next. By day 5 I started to get bored from the constant repetition. It seemed like the only thing I had to worry about in the day was wolves, and once you get over the initial fear of being attacked, they're pretty easy. Then I'd just stand in a room in my house for a few minutes and rinse, repeat. It seemed like as long as you hid in your hideout, you were free from harm. However, not long after, the game showed it's true colors.              During the 2nd night of my 2nd playthrough (the 1st playthrough had ended from a moment of panic and a badly misplaced bear trap), I heard something shuffling around in a room next to the one I was in. With the only light source in the whole hideout being a flare on the ground, I decided the best idea would be to go into this completely dark room to look for it. It was so dark in there that I couldn't see anything even inches away from me, which was all the distance the zombie-like creature needed to slash me in the face and take away about a third of my health. I freaked out and ran into the other room, slamming the door right in the ugly ♥♥♥♥er's face. It then proceeded to casually push open the door in less than a second. I had no intention of fighting it, so I ran away in a panic, not really registering that there was literally nowhere to run except past my flare and straight into even more darkness. Once I passed the flare my running devolved into blind stumbling, and before I could stop shoving my face into the wall trying to find the doorway, the monster hacked away at me from behind and and I fell to the ground. Dead on day 2.   All the playthroughs after that, at least one monster got into my hideout by day 4. It's basically inevitable that something will get in, I just had literal beginner's luck, and got to enjoy a few extra days of life before my so very inevitable demise. Once you realize you're not safe in your hideout, the game really succeeds at the classic survival game goal of turning you into a paranoid schizophrenic. Even in daytime, the game basically becomes 360 turn simulator 2015, with you constantly looking around to make sure there's no bear traps or wolves nearby, obscured by trees or your own narrow vision cone. And before long (like ""before the first week's even over"" long), you'll start to run low on supplies in the first section of the map, and will have to venture out into the more.... unsavory areas. We're talking areas where all those creatures that hack you to pieces at night occupy the WHOLE place during the day. And this isn't a game where you can level up and laugh in the faces of the enemies that used to give you trouble. Oh no, this is one of those games where you're always feeble and weak, and you either find a better weapon so you can stand a better chance against ONE enemy, or you hide from and outsmart them. Although the combat's very fair, and gives you small openings in enemy animations to attack, it's by no means easy, and you can't just murder everything in sight once you've got their patterns down.            Last, the game has an amazing sense of discovery, also due in no small part to it's incredible atmosphere. Since the world feels so threatening, but you desperately need supplies, you get a mix of elation and anxiety whenever you find a new point of interest, and exploring these new places is one of the most tense parts of the game. Whether what you find in these places want to kill you or not, you'll always find something interesting and unpredictable.              All in all, if you're looking for a horror game where death is actually something to be afraid of, unlike, say Amnesia, where the murderous creatures managing to kill you only lowers your immersion, then this game is a gift from the heavens. And don't let the early access label scare you away, this is the most complete feeling early access game I've ever played. As it is, the game could be released right now and feel complete. It's definitely worth the buy.               And yes, it is scary.			"

Early Access Review
								It’s 2:30 AM and I had myself backed into the last small and desolate room of my home base.  My flashlight trained, not on the sounds of wet acidic undergrowth that has taken over what used to be the foyer to my hideout, but the splintering door hanging to its frame on the far side of the room from me.  The only taste for flare in this room is a stool I have jammed against the door as one last final barricade.  This was my last stand and I’m ill equipped to face the horrors that have been tearing their way after me all night.  In Darkwood, the night is a stressful 5 minutes of gameplay where you shore up your defenses and hope that the creatures of darkness don’t tear you to pieces before day breaks and you are once again free to unravel the mystery of the plague afflicting these lands.  Your only clue, a doctor who still lives somewhere nearby with the forlorn mission of curing the local villagers of their blight. The most respectable villagers’ bodies have rotted and their minds have frayed.  Their gruesomely drawn images are ghastly warning s of what happens to those who linger in the Darkwood too long, a thought that scratches at the back of my mind with each passing night spent in your hideout.  To survive you consume odd mushrooms and tainted meat which granting powers to cope with the cruel forest in which even the trees seek to claim you by clawing at your line of sight with crow laden branches.  Your tainted new powers come with a price, nauseating side effects and warped hallucinations that could be clues to what went wrong in these woods or signs that your mind is decaying like those around you.   Darkwood is a cruel game but no more than a true horror game should be, it challenges the player with every encounter but if you really want to get the full effect play on permadeath.Dawn is almost here now, I think that I should be able to make it through the night when the doorknob turns and the door creaks ever so slowly open and rather than raining open in a hail of splinters like the horrors have done to the rest of my house.  Monsters are wiggling their way through the crack and pushing my barricade effortlessly to the side I aim my pellet gun in hopes that I can survive through one more night in the Darkwood. "

								Eight months after my initial purchase and after 48 hours of total playtime, I've finally decided to write a review. This is also my first review for any game, which should give a hint right off the bat of how strongly I feel.The most common complaint I've seen is that Darkwood is too hard. And this game is, in fact, HARD.HARD.HARD.Got it? Good. I'm not joking! Unless you play stuff like Dark Souls (a direct inspiration for this game), then this will likely be the toughest game you'll ever play. Period. It will also likely be the scariest. Playing on perma death only, it took me 40 hours just to beat the game. And I've yet to turn over every rock, discover every secret.But I don't think that it's fair to give the game a negative review because it's too difficult. If Darkwood was any easier it wouldn't be Darkwood. It would be Flaccidwood, and it would be boring and not very scary.If you play the prologue, you will not be in the Dark (pun intended) when you first awake in your little hut. Granted, you will need to move quickly, explore locations as you find them, and avoid anything with teeth, BUT you will be able to do so with a grasp of basic mechanics and controls. Just make sure to return to your hovel before nightfall. Believe me, I've played games with far less introduction and instruction.Now that that's out of the way, it's time to talk about the game, the real meat-and-potatoes. The concept is simple -- escape a little slice of densely-forrested rural Poland. Standing in your way are packs of roving mutations, insane NPC's, and a whole lotta beartraps.There's a lot of ways to die. Mauled by ravenous dogs, mauled by *bigger* ravenous dogs, beaten to death by naked dudes with sticks, pelted with rocks, torn in half by creepy-crawlers with a whole bunch of teeth,, poisoned by shrooms, stepping on beartraps, and, if you're like me, you'll probably end up setting yourself on fire a few times.But it's not all bad news. You can cook the indigenous mushrooms growing around the forest and shoot them up to improve your skills and such. Well, I mean, you'll suffer from terrible drug-induced nightmares in the process, but now you can put more stuff in your hotbar! Hooray!Oh, and did I mention the Banshee? Yeah, wait till she pays you a visit. It took her about 35 hours to find me, but when she did, I didn't sleep for a few days afterwards.Anyway, Darkwood is really, REALLY scary and unique. So pick it up. And say hi on the forums :). The devs are very active there and are always looking for suggestions.-- UPDATE #1 --Wow, it's been a while. I knew I would have to update the review as development progressed, but I decided to wait until a huge update before adding on. Well, this is the time!Darkwood is now in Alpha 7.0 -- 3 versions past the build this review was written for.The changes are simply too numerous for me to point out in this review. So, I will instead try to give you, the potential buyer, an idea of the sheer scope of this game's continuing evolution:-- Entirely redone and rebalanced crafting that now revolves around your workbench-- Complete overhaul of the (previously unstable) weapon balance-- Complete revamp and expansion of NPC dialogue and the story-- New minor locations-- A new village area with a ton of NPC's and background story-- New nighttime eventsSmart money is betting that Chapter 1 is nearly finished, and thus Chapter 2 could be coming shortly. Better yet, with all of the groundwork and mechanics finished, work on the following chapter(s) should progress quickly.Darkwood is a prime example of how EA should be done -- a dedicated dev team taking the community's feedback and continuously using it to build the game up. I look forward to what the future of Darkwood holds!			"

Early Access Review
								The Darkwood forest is infested with all sorts of vile creatures, mysterious friends and foes, an eerie atmosphere, and a sense of dread like you drank contaminated water out of desperation and regretted it instantly afterwards.  You are alone, but you are not truly alone.  All of the inhabitants are after you, want something from you, or haunts you with their presence.  All are ravaged, infested with darkness, except for rabbits that hop in front of your path, scurrying away because they know too well that Darkwood is not a safe place.  It is not something you have figured out yet, but soon, you will become one with Darkwood and all of its manifestations.  One nightmare after another, you wonder if this is all a nightmare that you manifested in your mind, or is it all real?  You embark in this dark journey to put the pieces together, scavenging to survive through the night and one night only, because that is your main fear.  Darkwood is a survival-horror, roguelike, sandbox game with a story.  The player can choose to venture into Darkwood using permadeath or no-permadeath.  It is highly recommended to play Darkwood with permadeath.  It increases the tension, vulnerability, and sense of dread which all add more to the atmosphere and overall experience.  Darkwood is unforgiving, merciless, and it is not for players with a weak heart.  It is important to note that Darkwood does have a story.  The player can explore, unravel secrets, and the other mysteries in the dark forest.  In your dark journey, you will meet the inhabitants of Darkwood.  The residents of Darkwood consists of different, unique, twisted individuals.  You will meet characters that you would never expect to meet in all shapes, sizes, and forms, equipped with unique personalities.  Some are informative, some of them may want or demand things in return, and some work on incentives.  They make some of Tim Burton's creations seem tame.  The visuals, art style, and graphics in Darkwood are easy on the eyes and they lend themselves to the atmosphere. The visuals are up to standard for an Indie game and especially for this particular type of game in this genre.  While walking through the forest, the shadows create imagery that look almost like hallucinations.  ""Am I really seeing this? Or is that a corpse that I am seeing?""  In Darkwood, trust your instincts more than your vision.   The color palette suits the environments and the atmosphere.  It creates a dark tone and an overall sense of dread that looms over you.  Dark areas can be lit up with a light source such as a torch, a match, or a flare (items so far in the game).  They light up the path for you to explore and gain access to new areas.  But explore with extreme caution - you do not know what is around the corner.  You may step on troop of mushrooms and become poisoned.  Wander too far and you may become lost, run out of any light sources, and distance yourself further away from your base and safe haven.  But is it really safe?  Darkwood is played from the top-down point of view with a cone of vision.  While the cone vision is not a light source, it does show the player what you ""can see.""  If a ""horror"" is chasing you and you are running away from it, your cone of vision will be in front of you because that is what you can only see while you are running away.  The enemy that is chasing you from behind will not be visible to you; not until it is inside your cone of vision.  Even if the foe is out of the range of the cone of vision, it will not be visible either.  This adds suspense and it makes it more challenging when you must ""fight or take flight.""  In Darkwood, you will need to pick your battles.  You may wonder: If it is from a top-down perspective, wouldn't you be able to see everything?  And wouldn't that reveal all of your surroundings and everything in it?  No, that is not how it works.  Your cone of vision gives you some visibility, but you will need your light source to penetrate the darkness and light your path.  The rest of the areas that is not within your vicinity will be dark.  It is not as dark as an auditorium with a spotlight on a person, but it is really dark.  Often times, you will not see an object until you get really close to it, even with a light source.  So far, there are several items that you can loot, a few weapons, and crafting recipes in Chapter 1.  I have found three weapons so far - plank with nails, an axe, and a shovel that are melee weapons.  Other helpful items that could be used as weapons or hunting, is a bear trap.  You can also make molotovs.  And with glass bottles, you can break it into shards and use it as an immobilizing trap.  One of the coolest game mechanics that I found very interesting was the use of mushrooms or cooking mushrooms turning it into a drug/chemical substance.  When you explore the forest, loot all the mushrooms that you find.  Gather them and you may have enough to fill a syringe.  Once the syringe is filled up, use the injection and it will grant you a new skill.  I thought this was a really unique game mechanic and I cannot recall it ever being used before from my knowledge of many years of gaming since the 90s.  It certainly took me by surprise and I just loved it.  Further, there are recipes hidden throughout Darkwood like a recipe to make a ""lantern"" that I found along the way.  This of course will require you to explore and search for the materials to craft and make a lantern.  In your inventory, you can experiment and try to combine items together to create a new item from that combination.  Just a tip:  you can eat mushrooms!  They heal you.  Also, drinking water from the well at your base will heal you as well.  Some of the most essential items are wood logs and mushrooms.  Loot them all the time.  If you find yourself running out of inventory space, craft what you can craft, and store away items at your base in the crates that you do not need at the moment.  The movement, movement speed, and combat feel fluid and responsive in Darkwood. If there is one gaming pet-peeve, that is clunky controls. You can sprint, but your character uses up stamina or endurance.  In combat, you can hit harder by simply holding the right mouse button (RMB) to pull back and swing harder.  It uses stamina as well.  You can click LMB without the hold to make a light attack.  With careful timing, while strafing, you can time your attacks while dodging attacks (there is no dodgeroll, don't worry!).  So far, I have only used melee weapons and the bear trap, although I have found a gun clip and materials to make a molotov.  Combat was surprisingly satisifying for a top-down game.  You can hear (audio, sound) every thump with every hit you land on an enemy.  Weapons do deteriorate indicated by the item going from white to red on the weapon icon.  I have found one NPC that you can trade items with and make deals.  Since there is no money currency, because why would you have any, trade is on a barter system.  For instance, if you find a piece of valuable jewelry, you can trade that for an item that you may need, or you can trade it in for information.  Other NPCs will want information as well, so you may have to search and uncover information that you could trade for an important item that may be of aid.  Darkwood works on a level design system of randomly generated levels.  The audio, sound design, and soundtrack are fantastic.  The music sets the dark mood and tone.  And every crack of a melee weapon can be heard with authority. There is so much to talk about and Darkwood is barely in Early Access with only one chapter!  As you can tell, I am very pleased with the content that is available at the moment.  It not only has surpassed my expectations, it already has me hooked with its dark charm and vast potential. I genuinely hope that they continue to support and add content to the game well after the final release.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm alone in a wood house that somehow lost its front entrance. I push a cabinet on the passage, to block any of those things from coming in at night. Then I lock myself in a room I previously barricaded the window, and put broken glass outside, in the living room, to hear when something is attempting to enter. I hold my plank with nails as if it was a saint.The night is alive, the house creeks as it breathes the unnatural night wind, a feral dog that almost killed me during the day is barking outside, as the devil himself was smiling to him. Then the dog dies with a loud screech. Something otherworldly feminine screams...  The cabinet is pushed back with a loud noise. And the only sound that will make me lose it is the broken glass being stepped on. I can't see anything in the dark, but I desperately try to, with my back to the wall to avoid unnecessary danger. Then I hear the door opening, and my hair follicles erecting on my arm tell me that something is in the room with me. It didn't make any noise on the broken glass, because it floats. It's a ghost, and its scream is hellish.Darkwood is one of those rare games, that when you purchase, you will feel an experience you'll never have, to be in another world, to suffer things that don't exist. You will suffer physically, your heartbeat will go up, you'll get goosebumps and curse outside noises for interfering with the game.			"

								I got this game late October 2014, and I fell in love with it. I still love it, but I feel like it's not going to come out of alpha.They said they would release a new alpha every month. They got close to it at first, but... almost two years later, we're only on alpha 7. Probably 8 soon. This game really hasn't made much progress, and its STILL on the first chapter. I want to revere this game, but I can't, not until they start making serious progress with the story.11/04/16 Edit:They added chapter 2, which is very nice. It still took two years. I'll probably (not, knowing myself) end up playing it again sometime, but currently I'm too engrossed in Skyrim Special Edition. If they get Ch3 out before May of 2016, I will change this review.

								I backed this game during kickstarter so I got my hands on it a few hours earlier - here are my thoughts.This game is in alpha stage, so if you want finished product, just wait.This game is HARD. I mean like your blood everywhere hard! Very good for hardcore players, not so good for casual ones :). Overall gameplay is really good (crafting system, random map, fighting, barricading etc.)Atmosphere is excelent (alongside with really good music)! Creepy and sometimes even really scary.Story looks interesting as well.Just to let you know, my first hour of gameplay went a little bit like this - A few minutes in, I died like 3 times. Then I crafted plank with nails - time to beat that **** *** enemies! (I died 2 times, not killing a single one XD) Then i found abandoned house - Yaay! Some monster guarding it killed me... Time to make molotov! Missed while throwing molotov - died. In conclusion - If you like hard games, where you have to cry blood to get somewhere, this is for you.			"

								In the traditional spirit of Steam game reviews: I really wanted to like this game, and I did and still do.Darkwood has been in early access for a long time, but it's been more than playable since it first came out. Never encountered a game breaking bug. The content updates are not weekly or even monthly, but it's already a great game, and they're mostly balancing it out. Personally, it's always been for the best.Darkwood is a great mix between linear progression and randomization.The devs keep changing the game mechanics here and there, but it's never a bad thing. They want to keep you on the move, while keeping you on your toes.The atmosphere of this game is just incredible. During the day, you watch every single footstep you make. You never know when there's going to be a creep, an angry animal or just some poisonous mushrooms for you to step on. Some people don't like it, I love it... it makes you watch your every step... every step of the way.During the night, you'll wish you scavenged enough wood to board up the windows that got destroyed the previous night, and just hope to god or whoever you believe in that it's going to end soon.While the learning curve is not always easy, the game doesn't force you to move on to more difficult areas. You can stay in the beginning area (the Meadow) for as long as you like, and come back to it and spend some time there as much as you want. But know this, the further you progress in the game, the darker the woods are going to get...			"

								Let me draw a scenario here, based on the experience I've had.It's the tenth day surviving in this scary, haunting world. Monsters are everywhere, and gathering firewood becomes a frightening task. By now, you'd suspect I'm getting used to nightfall. This day I'm more prepared than any other. I've found a fireaxe on the floor of a crazed pig lady's house, and all I had to do is kill her to keep it. In this world, I'm growing used to not have sympathy for anything. In her house, I loot a bear trap still in good condition, some empty bottles, and mushrooms growing in the corners. I know by now that it's more useful to leave broken bottles on the floor as traps than thinking of carrying water. With a few belongings, I head back to my home, where the story requires me to drink from a fountain before nighttime if I am to survive.I begin preparing for the eventual nightfall. I had half a gasoline jug left, and I pour it into my generator, only for the comfort of light and electricity during the night. As for defense, I keep a room fully barricaded to keep myself safe. There are three windows, and a doorway to the rest of the house. All the windows I have covered in wooden planks, but the door I leave open, if I need to make an escape. To keep the doorway defended, I dragged over a filing cabinet from another room and placed it in front of the doorway. In front of two of the windows, I have other things blocking the way along with the wooden barricade; that being a stool and a safe. Not the best at blocking the way, but it's all I have. I scatter broken glass in front of two windows, and the bear trap on the third.Dusk is now turning the world red, and I begin the final steps of preparing for the night. I turn on the generator and the lamps inside all switch on. As of now I'm still uncertain if light attracts the monsters or not, but I feel safer if I have a lamp with me. The night comes, and the well water level has risen far enough for me to take a drink. As soon as I drink, I run through the now dark house and bunker myself in the room. I push the cabinet in front door, turn on the lamp, and begin to wait in the corner. At first, the night is quiet. I believe that this may be a safe night, and no curious monsters will want to come for me, but that soon changes. I can hear creaking coming from the hallway, and then, a knock on the door. It starts to bang, the whole room shaking, and I run as fast as I can to push against the other side of the cabinet and begin to push. Wood starts to splinter off from the door, again and again, until the door bursts open. The cabinet is still in the way. It begins to push as I push, me trying to keep it steady. Then I start to hear another windows barricade getting attacked as well. I lose control of the cabinet, and it begins to slide sideways, as I push too hard on one side and it pushes on the other. It's now in the room. I back up, turning towards the bear trap in hopes to get it caught. Then I see it, a humanoid beast split down the center, from the head to its belly, filled with blood and teeth. It's the first night that I see these types, and my strategy for them has to be learned on the spot. I raise my axe and get a direct hit. Then another hit, but this time it knicks me too. I step back, and as it leaps to me, it falls into the bear trap and gets itself killed. I didn't feel safe just yet, as the crashing from the window was over, and as I looked to the side of the room, all I could see was a broken, open window, and my piles of glass, now filled with blood, with no dead monster. It jumps me from the side, taking out half of my health. As I turn around to fight it, there turns out to be not one, but two humanoid split beasts, too much for me. By now, my heart is pounding out of my chest. I run out the door, trying to shut doors that I can, some sucessful, some not. Outside is pitch black, thundering and raining, and hopelessly I try to reach the shack with the generator. I manage to shut the door behind me. I'm bleeding out, and I left all my bandages in the room. The generator turns off. A monster hiding in the room kills me from behind. I wake up.Day 11 begins.Every single day of this game is a thrilling nightmare. From exploring and trying to survive, you're always on the edge of your seat, worrying just how you're going to get killed this day, and how far can you push along the so far intriguing story. It's the first early access game that I can truly reccommend, and it is totally worth buying today.			"

Early Access Review
								****Early Access****  Introduction            	Darkwood is an atmospheric and insanely hard survival game. It is in Early Access and this means many of the features are missing, but the developers have said they will be adding plenty of more features in upcoming updates. Putting the fact that the game is not finished aside, I really can find much wrong with Darkwood. One of the main things is that I would like to see controller support. I like playing top-down games with a controller, but this doesn’t mean the keyboard controls are bad. (They are rather good) The Developers answer the question  “Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?  with this  “About a year (counting from July 2014), although that depends on a lot of things which will become clear during Early Access.” . With this info in mind, they have a long way to go in a short amount of time.  Pros                Procedurally generated maps Crafting Combat feels impactful and smooth Leveling system  Decent amount of graphics options  The main concept of Darkwood is very promising  Amazing atmosphere    Cons               No controller support  Feature are limited in this stage of development (Will be fixed in the future) No tutorial (Devs say this will be added soon) May be too HARD     Conclusion                 	 Darkwood is a very promising, atmospheric and insanely hard survival game. If you are into the super hard/rouge-like games, Darkwood is definitely for you. Before you buy this game, just keep in mind that it is in early access and it is missing a large amount of content at the time of writing this review. If you are okay with waiting for the rest of the content, you should get Darkwood. It is a very promising Early Access game.  Video Review

								So far Darkwood has been kinda like that long lost uncle in the family; dark and quirky and even tho your mother said to stay away you are somehow transfixed by it.  Only a few hours in and it's everything, thus far, I've wanted it to be.  The controls are like butta and in fact maybe too much at times when you over-run something important or ""teethy"".First hours were spent exploring the general starting area to get an idea of what and where I was placed which led to quite a few moments of enjoyment as well shock and awe.  Like any good survivor I took my licks and pushed forward.  My last rest stop was with a curious old lady and an inspiring musician.  I fear I may not get back going this far as the night is quickly coming.The game continues and likely evolves and if you have the time and the scratch (money for those younger gamers) it may be something you would like to pick up.  Optimal setup is a darkened room, quality headset and gamma set appropriately; not pumped way up in an attempt to defeat it.  Let the darkness in, let it sweep you away..[Will soon update for Alpha 3 gameplay!]			"

								ALPHA 1.1 ReviewI normally refrain from buying Early Access titles these days, you never really know what state the game is in or even if it will be finished ever. In this case, wanting to support the studio and having followed development for a while I took the plunge and bought it. And even it's current state I'm not disappointed but there's ample room for improvement.The game evokes feelings that I haven't felt since my first playthrough of the original silent hill, the atmosphere is thick and unsettling, the player character is a little helpless but not defenseless (sometimes) and just around every corner lurks the threat of the unknown. The game succeeds in building tension and the narrative is sublimely creepy. If you like horror, the kind that creeps up your neck and lurks just outside your vision but with it's claws embedded firmly in your neck then you'll find a home in Darkwood			"

								Journal Entry 1 I get up from my desk, the room is pitch black but my light emits a small wave that brings everything in front of me into view. The room is small, old newspaper clippings are scattered everywhere, its a mess... more like a work of art in the eyes of an obsessive lunatic... did I do all this?  Journal Entry 2 I walk out of the door and into what appears to be the living room, there are 2 large cages on the floor and blood soaked on the ground beside them, I find an old camera and a picture that's very distorted... Is that a face... nah just the distortion, better not get myself spooked. I can see that a room across from me has a light emitting from it. this is my room?.... I quickly raid the wardrobe and find a key to open the other door in the living room. Journal Entry 3 I am able to turn on a lamp in the corner of the living room and also able to drag it around. I unlock the door and then drag the lit lamp, pushing it through ahead of me... upon exiting a find a dog laying on the ground writhing in pain.. I push the lamp next to his doghouse to give him some comfort, I look around for something to help him. I am unable to find any bandages or aid... The dog is in serious pain and suffering badly... I found a large axe... I can't let him suffer like this... goodbye old friend... Journal Entry 4 Now upset about whatever did this to my dog I tear off onto a path that leads into the woods. I aggressively Paul Bunion apart a tree that has fallen and blocked my path and continue outward. The forest is dark, foggy and very ere...it feels like something is watching me but nothing is willing to present itself at this time. The path is narrowing ahead, crows caw and circle the area... something feels wrong but I must proceed.. Journal Entry 5 I find an old corpse of a man that has been decaying for what looks like months.. I search him and find a few supplies. The path ahead takes to a new level of darkness, The very light from my current device is engulfed by the blackness. It's similar to shining a light into the water on a dark night, its completely absorbed... I craft a torch from the supplies I picked up, now that I can at least see a bit I can proceed onward. Thick black branches reach over the path creating a canopy of sheer ere terror, I feel like there is no edges of this path, everything past the edge of my light is darkness... I keep moving Journal Entry 6I've now come across what looks like an old fence leading up to the side of a building, I can see the window but its too dark to see whats inside, I swing around the side to get a closer look. The building has been overtaken by tree roots and the very walls are becoming part of nature again.. this place won't help me, gotta keep moving.... I wander on down the trail further when suddenly I stop.... Just ahead I can see a man lying on the ground shaking... I approach and do something that I wasn't expecting at all			"

								I've played a couple hours, and thus far my opinion is this: I'm impressed, and I recommend the game.  Note: This review is a cross-post from the community forum.Given it's an Alpha release, I know that a lot of the features (and bugs/errors, obviously) will change over the course of development. But as it stands, I think Darkwood really delivers on a Retro-tastic, creepy video game, complete with great atmosphere, chilling cut scenes/NPCs (come on, the violin kid?!), and great music/sound.Spending the night cowering in the corner, hoping that the monsters outside won't notice your ambient light and attack barricaded doors/windows, does lend to something of a lengthy pause between ""action times;"" But, unlike other posters, I don't feel that the suspense is completely diminished during this time. I've had nights where nothing happened (other than creepy ambient noise throughout the night); I've had nights where something decided I needed to die, and a battle ensued.I actually like the random map feature, if only for the replay value. Sure, you'll have bad spawns where things are too clustered together, but thus far my key locations have been very well spread out (I'm STILL looking for the church in my latest game). I also like the permadeath is an option, because during a first-impression kind of session I want to see as much content as possible without replaying the same early days -- later, I'll enjoy permadeath mode.I am 100% satisfied with my purchase of the game, and the hours I've already logged. Given a LOT of Indie games I've purchased on a whim, that's 100x better than the recent experiences. I fully intend to play tomorrow and beyond, and along with the updates, while giving feedback and enjoying (or even ranting about, depending on the situation) Darkwood with my fellow players on Steam, Twitter, and elsewhere.Do I think it's worth buying? Absolutely! Do I think it has a ton of promise, moving into further development? Without a doubt. Do I think you need a little patience, a love of creepy survival-horror style games, or a nostalgic love of Retro titles to enjoy this? Not necessarilly -- but it helps (as with any other top-down, RPG style game with ""older style"" graphics). I happen to love all these things, but Darkwood manages to deliver with a nice, intuitive interface and play style that improves upon those classic titles.Honestly, I love it, and I can be a VERY snobbish when a developer releases ""Retro"" inspired games. I do wish the map was a little more useful, but at the same time it lends to the desperation/time management/frustration of wandering aimlessly through the woods. The crafting supplies (and general supplies) are not hugely abundant, and the combat isn't too easy to be challenging nor so hard that permadeath is a little too hardcore.Tips:*Seriously... respect the mushrooms. This game could also be called, ""Mushrooms -- my precious.""*The second alternative title could be, ""Where the @#$% am I?"" *Don't assume that you can recover items you use prematurely; don't waste supplies, because unlike some games there isn't an abundance of everything you could need.*Bugs are going to happen in Alpha -- be patient, and send feedback. Come enjoy the process with the rest of us!*Embrace the fantastic atmosphere: Turn off your lights, turn up the volume, and listen to the troubling noises lurking in the shadows. "

								I've been waiting for this game for oh so long and now I've finally gotten my hands on this.Darkwood's a top down, rogue-like survival game with overencumbering horror elements and by overencumbering horror elements I mean the proper ones. No ridiculous jump scares, no overused appearances. Just amazing atmosphere and the fact that once you die, it's all over, just like in most rogue-likes. It's unforgiving and punishing, challenging and at the same time very immersive and eerie. Every house you go into is a possible death trap for our dear, faceless protagonist and the game lets you know that very well. You are not the hero here, you're not the tough guy. Every single enemy poses a threat and no, not the type that scratches a tad of your HP. I'm talking about killing you easily, from simple wild dogs to deformed walking monstrosities. Even though the game is 2D, the artwork is wonderful and the characters you meet and engage in dialogue with feel very alive. The writing is good and the animations, both while in dialogue and in combat/walking/inventory management and so on are of high quality. Even though it is 2D, do not be tricked, you know nothing of what is going on and it will take keen and careful observation of your surroundings in order to live to see another day.The story is very interesting and can easily catch your attention, although progressing through the story is not easy, as the tasks to success are packed with things you'd rather not see.The developers have done a truly amazing job and even though the game is currently in alpha, it is very much playable. I can only imagine what they have in store for us with the finished product.			"

								I bought this game during the Autumn Sale and I am very pleasently surprised. When I first got into the game it was a little weird to be because I've personally never played a game with this perspective before, but once i got the hang of it and found myself venturing into the creepy woods, I saw how immersive this game was. With the creepy noises of stepping on branches and the barks of rabid dogs I found myself scared for my life. This game also has a really nice crafting system where you can find abundant items like clothe and wood and mix it with some more rare items found in chests to make very useful items to use to your advantage or sell to the wolfman for ammo or other items. The lighting sysetm in this game is genius as well, where in a house your flashlight only shows a little of the room but when u turn on a lamp it brightens most of the room where you are looking. And when you explore the woods your light grows dimmer and dimmer the further you go until you need to craft a torch to see anything. some minor bugs were found in the game but you must expect that from a Early Access game. With all this in mind I give this game probably a 9.5/10 in its current state because of how amazingly done this game was. The immersion effect of this game is close to if not better than the Amnesia series and even the Slender games. Thanks and I urge you to pick this game up while its still on sale.			"

								Darkwood - top down view horror/survival game, with an interesting and captivating story.The artstyle is disgustingly horrific, the ambience and music is quite well done for the horror style and overall it's a well POLISHed game for an alpha release on Early Access.The developers did a nice work on the first days of the release by fixing major bugs and the game has lots to offer for the player to do. During the day you are given the choice to explore the vast forest map to find a way out of it(simply by going one way without stoping will be your certain death by some evil beast), NPCs will give you clues and quests to complete in order to continue the main quest to escape, and when the night comes, you better be already on your base, because beasts come to get ya.There are some simple base fortification mechanism at the moment, you can barricate windows, doors, set up bear traps, dip benzene on the ground and light it later to burn predators, use baits and combination of others. The sound effects makes nights very scary in my opinion, I had to hug a corner and pray for the day to come to survive.Given the quality state of the game, and how much more the devs are working on, I highly recommend this game.

								Take your worst nightmares of plant mutation, genetic mutation, and monsters from The Thing, splash it up against Don't Starve. Darkwood dosent hold your hand at all, you will die, you will run, and you will feel scared when night approaches. You can barricade your shelter. you can smash bottles to alert you of enemies when they walk on them and set traps to keep them from getting you for only so long. But what you WILL do is wish for night to end, pitch black, noises rustle in the darkness as things bump in the night. The game gives you a perfect sense of living in a nightmare and needing to keep yourself in check at every twig snap and distant growl. And when things are quiet the twistedness of the game never ceases, you will be forced to take companionship (or not) in the few mutated characters that remain ""sane"" and friendly towards you allowing you to trade and share gossip about the world you will be staying in. Of course you can kill these people at you leisure, but it never realy helps to kill the few things that seem sane, if not ever so slightly. The game allows you to choose how you wish to handle things.Durring the night sagments the character must go home to not only seek shelter from the chaos of the night but to drink from a well to stay alive or they will die slowly and painfully from ""the thirst"", the well however is a mystery as to why your character needs the water from it. While you're at the house you will be able to combine the mutated mushrooms you find in the wild to inject yourself with mutations to give you new abilities (and weaknesses later on) that allow you to pick and choose what you think will help you best as your body changes for the ""better"".The crafting system is pretty deep even for Alpha, allowing yout to craft molotovs, pellet guns, laterns, torches, bandages, The typical survival stuff. oddly enough the character dosent need to eat so cooking food and crafting that isent a thing. (Yet?)My first time playing was pretty nerve destroying, I ended up getting attacked by an enemy (You're no tank of course) and going into a bleeding state, so my first instinct is to run the hell away leaving a massive blood trail as they swarmed me. Some sort of mutated crab things. Paniced I ended up running through some poisonous mushrooms to further add insult to injury. Coming up upon the games starter house I took a sharp turn around a tree, got caught in a bear trap. My character freaked out and tried his best to remove his foot from the thing, Night time approached as my characters vision cone was gone, busy looking at his feet to get the trap off. Before I knew it I was swarmed in the darkness. And thats the end of the first time I played. "

This game is exactly what i always wanted to play. It's contain all the most important things: sound, game design, mystery story and nervous gameplay. Lots of interactive items and options. Awesome characters and creatures, nice weaponry arsenal. It's playable now, and i am glad that it's only alphaThis game is GoodYou know, i always want to have own half-ruined house in CREEPY GOD DAMNED PLACE among forest. The start place is dark and depressive as f*ck, so i didn't even expect that it's REGULAR DAY. I was running around my house trying to grab everything that i can find, when suddenly it seemed to me that environment gets darker. Then i ran to sawmill, then to my room,then i start to barricade door and near windows in panic. Generator wasn't turned ON. I sit over 10 minutes in fear, awaiting some sh*t, and i get it, as soon as i understand that i sit whole DAY here! I am goes mad when it's start to  REALLY GETTING DARK !I won't tell you what the sh*t actually happens at night, but it's f*king creepy. Don't even know. You never know what will come to you, together with night.. Will it's just big dogs or mutants, that will crush your barricades and rip you? Okay, you always can barricade yourself pretty, and keep surviving to get serious weapons and light sources.. But what if this night you will be visited not by monsters, but something other? Something, that can go through doors, windows and lights? Listen to the silence of the night... Look through barricaded windows and fog behind them... Can you hear whispers, quiet cry of lonely woman?But don't worry, man with wolf's head and AK47 will help you, and also, give you some bullets. For half of your poor inventory, of course. Even in alpha, every night prolongs game pretty good. Hope developers will continue to make this game. There's only 1 chapter in game right now. The chapter contain 3 big locations and 2-3 additional.Developers, please, don't throw it away! It's very important game, not only for me. "

 An unnoticed game which has a lot in it. Up Sides--The mechanics are really good,very responsive and accurate.-There are many many ways you could play this game, you could either play with traps alot or consumables or just weapons, whatever way you like playing goes in this game really.-Very good balancing, nothing is to weak, nothing is to strong as long (as you have an idea of how to use the items)-Very tiny puzzles and thought challenging events/locations  (get into the game you will see what i'm talking about)-Has a dedicated developer that really cares about the game. this guy won't give bad content on updates he just consistantly keeps putting out good updates-This game is cheap and is full of content-Challenging but forgiving,you could die with out having insane consequnces if you just play on normal,of course if you want a challenge you could easily get that from this very challenging game-The story will not let you down even a little its nice, its fresh, its shocking.-lost of costumization in options menu. this might seem obious but not all games have this so I decided to add this Neutral points -This game can be scary [if you absolutely hate horror don't get into it, but  if you hate horror a bit but not on an insane level this game isn't actually that scary its kinda just for adrenaline and some rush.]-Art design. I liked it some might not Down Sides! -This isn't a game you play for graphics, the game is by no means bad but its not a visual novel don't expect a purple super explosion with everything you do.-Requires patience to get deep into the story if your looking for full on excitment game go away.-The game is complex and challenging. if you don't seriously try to fight against what the game throws on you than this isn't going to be very fun for you. I probably missed some things but thats ok I might edit them in if someone comments on my review Thank you for reading this long wall of text, if you read through all of it just buy the game you seem to be interested.

								I gotta say, this game is quite unique, its got potential to be amazing or be bad dending on what the devs do with it.Here is a few pros and cons.Pros: 1: OK who ever worked on the sound for this game is a flipping genius. I'm not kidding everything about the sound for this game is 10/102: Its a 2D game that made me slam me knee into my desk because of a jump scare, dude bonus points. like how does that even happen?3: An early access game that is actully fun and the devs care about so it will get better.4: NPCs and differnt locations5: A interesting level up system (This is also a con) with the ability to choose various perks, both negitive and positive.6: I dig the graphics on this.Cons:1: Remember the negitive perks I mentioned? Well the first negitive one is ruinous to the game, it is down right horrible. If you're in the dark to long ""Shadows"" start damaging you. In a game where light source is limited this is a horrible idea. The looping sound effect and forcing you to be in the light completely takes away the scare factor. The devs NEED to ditch this idea.2: Poisonous mushrooms. OK this one is right up there with the shadows in the ""Devs why on this good green Earth would you do that?!"" department. They are EVERYWHERE and touch them and BOOM, you're either gonna move slower or be somewhat blind. On top of that you will be poisoned, do we really need all these exploding mushrooms?3: There is so much blur and bloom in the distance its almost light having poor vision and it kinda hurts your eyes a bit.4: I have played this game for 4 hours at this point, so I dunno I have prolly been through I'd say around 8 nights. Never once has something tried to attack me in my hideout. No busting down doors, no running, no fighting. Although once I heard something murder a dog outside the door (Which was freaking creepy and fantastical by the way.)5: For God sake man, let me at least punch. I mean for real, he has been given a fist for a reason, use it.6: Not being able to harvest items is a really kind of frustrating but I would assume we would be able to in the future.7: Due to number 6 con, the crafting system is a pain.The Con of every horror game ever made: The protagonist being quite out of shape, only being able to run 20 feet without wanting a whopper.Mixed feelings: The well mechanic of the... Each night you must drink from ""The well"" to keep yourself from decaying each night. While I like that it forces you to go outside each night I hate the fact that I have to get to it in a short time of when ""The thirst starts."" As I said I love that you can't be a weiner waiting for dawn inside, but I want to explore at night. Like if there was night only quests that would be awesome.In short, its early access, its already fun. I can almost say for certain the devs will improve this game. (Step one less mushrooms and remove the freaking shadows.)I'd recommend this game and I'd say it a good idea of how EA should work. Unlike those acursed atrocity of a game Starforge and ""The tower.""6/10			"

								After over 130 hours played on this game since when it came out, I have seen it go through many different versions and I got to say.....it is getting better and better.I played this since release and was so excited for it a few months before release and i was not disapointed.DarkWood is a top-down horror survial game and its one fo the best ones out there if your into horror survival.Yes you do get a few massive bugs, glitches and game crashes but they have improved on them and fixed them over the course of this games release. If you compare this game now to when it was released you can not only see a massive difference in game stability improving but a whole lot more of content and more promised to come by the devs.The crafting system could be improved but is still really good.The nights in the game are really creepy and full of dangers and that adds to the game's atmosphere as a horror game which is a huge plus.The sounds and music are capturing and immersive, making the game so cool when you have high bass headphones on.The story is still in devlopment but still really good as it is now and encourages the player to work with NPC traders and gather supplies and upgrade through leveling.and many more things i cant think of right now.I love this game.The nights are the best part of this game, never knowing what will try to eat you next, barricading youself in a small room with planks, nails and cuboards and clutching on a fireaxe.I cant wait to see what the Acid Wizard's do with this game in the future, knowing they promised to include a lot more stuff in the next following updates.Honestly I give this game a 9.6/10the missing 0.4 is beacuse of the minor bugs and glitches but still really well built and immersive overall.

								Darkwood is a top down, 2D horror survival game where you play a guy who is trying to survive while trying to escape a forest. You do this via gathering resources, crafting and upgrading items and weapons, exploring, talking to and completing tasks for other characters. There is a day and night cycle - the daytime is when you need to go out and explore, gather materials and resources. Night time is when you have to be back at your hideout, hunker down and survive. And thats when the game gets really quite scary.There are multiple areas to explore, all of which are a good size and randomly generated when you first create a new game. Each have their own hideout (some have 2 hideouts), of which need defences put in, such as boarding up windows and fixing doors, and setting up traps. You can also move stuff around to block entrances and exits. The recent update, Alpha 8.0, has added an entirely new area to explore. What I really love about Darkwood is it's atmosphere. Sure, the graphics will not amaze you, but the game knows how to creep you out. Everything from the superb sound design, to the characters you meet, I found myself being immersed into this wierd part of the world that is cut off from the rest of humanity, following a disaster that you slowly learn about during the course of the game. The night times are fantastically scary - some nights are quiet and go without any problems, some other nights are just outright frightening, especially the further into the game you go.I bought Darkwood a few days after EA release, and while we are now 2 years after that release and we are still in Early Access, the developers have been very good at releasing updates and keeping in touch with the community. Plus, each update has added some cool new stuff every time so I have enjoyed the EA ride with Darkwood (unlike some other EA titles I have purchased in the past). I find it quite difficult to list any negatives about the game, only that it really is challenging. But if you go into it knowing that, and you don't mind the dated looking graphics then honestly you may find some enjoyment out of this. Controller Support was added, aand while its OK, Darkwood plays much better with keyboard and mouse. I tried Steam Controller too with custom settings, and...well, I still found keyboard and mouse the better way to play :)It would be great to see custom stories and / or mod support, but as it stands now, Darkwood really has got better and better during its development and I still love it now. Highly recommended!			"

								This game makes Don't Starve look like a walk down a spelunkhole. When I first played this game, it scared me so beyond my wits' end that I didn't play for another half a year. Implying that I played Darkwood again (credit goes to my girlfriend who just loves horror games - and seeing me die a little, ongoingly), I reinstalled the game and began tackling this monster.Honestly, I adored Don't Starve for its unique gameplay and mechanics but I always felt like it lacked optimisation; Darkwood hits the genre right on the head and then doubles on that in its atmosphere. Darkwood is brutal. Darkwood is complex. Darkwood is full of intrigue, plot (which is unique in this genre), very interesting combat mechanics as well as stealth mechanics, mystique--but mostly, Darkwood is tantalising~. The only catch is: you'll want to read a community guide for the basics - the game is still in Alpha (I can't believe that there's more content and polish to come...), so it doesn't have a tutorial entirely.Buy this game--it's damn cheap for one of the best games you'll ever play.

								Early Alpha review: A lot can be said about games funded on kickstarter and indiegogo, especially with the controversy surrounding some games changing their initial promises after the end of the funding campaign. Darkwood I feel has delivered what I bought into with its indiegogo campaign, an atmospheric topdown 2d survival horror game. This game has the atmosphere of stalker, with amazing sound design and oppressive lighting the moment I started the game I could feel the game assaulting my nerves and playing with my mind. The woods are amazing it constantly feels as though the woods themselves are your primary antagonist and your deadliest enemy, not the monsters you encounter in them. I can’t wait to see what future updates bring to darkwood but from what I’ve played so far I can safely say acidwizard studios are well on their to delivering the game they promised so long ago!			"

Do NOT buy this if you want an easy experience, because this game will drag you through the mud. And you will love it. If there is one word to describe this game, is Disturbing.UPDATE: Alpha 8 is here, and it's the best update ever.			"

http://www.acidwizardstudio.com/?p=667This game HAS NOT been given up on. People who are saying it has simply haven't even bothered to look.This game is made by 4 people, most games of this quality and size are made by 10 to 30+ people. Have some patience.Now. My Review.TLDR.I have not had any bugs, glitches or crashes in my 8 hours of playing. For £12 or $15 I reckon I can still get ALOT more hours out of the game and it isn't finished yet. It is 100% worth your money.Pro'sTerrifying NightsCombatDifficultyScavengingStoryCon'sRage inducing (Sometimes)Hard to find certain items (Kinda good and bad)Full Review.I played this game for about 4 hours a long time ago and loved it but recently started playing it again and put 8 hours into it, in a single day. This game is a survival horror game where you scavenge resources to power your generator for the night time to survive. The game during the day is difficult, you will need to learn how enemies attack and how to dodge them whilst still being able to attack back. However during the night time, this game becomes terrifying. I have not played a game that has made night time so tense and scary since dying light. You need to board up windows, set traps and prepare yourself for any events or attackers that may want to kill you for a place to stay during the night or possibly be prepared for any paranormal encounters you may find yourself witnessing. Or the game will continue to build suspense but have nothing happen, equally terrifying.This game isn't all just this however. It has bloody terrific writing and story, which is still being developed.			"

								There you are, alone, in your safe house with nothing but the darkness for company. Then all of a sudden, you hear a scream, and what's that? Your furniture is moving all by itself. It's ok though, you're safe, in your barricaded room and there's only another few minutes of night time left. Oh, wait, they're knocking on your door, you can see the barricade splinter...It's fine, daylight will save you. Argh, but here they come, relentlessly banging on your door and it's one hit away from being broken. Phew, daylight is here, but you have no wood left to barricade yourself in when night time comes again. You have no weapon so you need to go out into the woods to scavenge and prepare yourself, but you know they're lurking out there too.Darkwood does this brilliantly, it builds up so much tension that even when nothing is going on, you're still on edge. Sure, there are a few bugs still in the game, but it's an early Alpha release, and the devs have acknowledged that a few things here and there need to be fixed.Don't let the bugs take away from what is a stunning survival game, and a survival game that builds up the horror through it's atmosphere like no other that I've played recently. Reminiscent of the old Silent Hill games in the way that it builds tension, it builds you up and then knocks you down but it's not frustrating.  You don't mind meeting your maker, even though you lose your precious mushrooms, because you learn a little each time you die.The game looks beautiful, the lighting is glorious and really helps set the tone when you're out to discover new things.  Your cone of vision can either help you out or destroy you if you're not vigilant enough, but it's something you get used to after a while.The crafting system works nicely, and is clear and easy to use, but sometimes the amount that you can carry becomes a little bit of a problem, that said, it doesn't take away too much from the experience.  If anything, the frustration is outweighed by the fear that you won't have enough to survive the night, making the game more tense.The world is randomly generated on each play through so you will never get tired of exploring the same old places again and again.The characters in the game thus far have enough depth to influence how you behave toward them, but enough mystery that you never really know what to expect from them the NPCs are great fun to come up against whether you're ready to fight them or not.Darkwood is something that any survival horror fan should try out and if at first it seems a little slow, I'm sure that it will grow on you and eventually you will approach each night filled with terror and worry that you've missed something and they can get in your safe house while you're completely defenseless because you didn't have time to craft a new weapon before you had to lock yourself in.If you're still unsure whether to get the game or not, then please check out my playthrough and see how I experienced the night terrors (and the day terrors for that matter) and then form your own opinions, and hopefully learn from my mistakes if you do decide to get the game!

								Every morning three tree beards show up with a sack full of garbage to collect my recycling.A survival horror game with strong atmosphere and a solid mystery.  Allies, enemies or neutral NPC's are all richly crafted with impressive art styles.  Even the clues you find around the world are often unnerving.  It's in Early Access with only one chapter available but the game offers hours of intrigue and 'side quests' to complete each with their own rewards and/or consequences.  Each one feels like a new faustian deal.All enemies are potentially lethal but with the right knowledge and preparation they can be ended just as fast as they can end you.  But one mistake can cost you dearly.  Surviving the nights and managing your resources carefully in a hostile environment adds to the tension of your imprisonment with these monsters.The game also offers a double edged perks and flaws system.  The more you dose yourself up with the mutagenic flora the more potent perks you gain access to but with those perks come equally debilitating flaws.  The choice of how deep you wish jump into this doomed progression is completely up to you.As a long term fan and writer of supernatural thrillers and atmospheric stories I recommend this game to those also interested in such.  Despite its simple appearance and modest development team it follows through.			"

								In it's current state, I can honestly recommand this game for it's $15 price tag. But be warned, this game isn't for the faint hearted. But if you're looking for a great blend of survival and horror, this game may be what you're looking for, even in it's early alpha stage the game has quite a lot of content and replayability for you to enjoy.The thrill of this game comes from a blend of sources, one being your own paranoid fear. The game has absolutely amazing atmosphere and uses a mixture of sounds, graphics and in-game mechanics to trigger and sustain a terrifying sense of forboding. Every day is spent preparing, preparing for the coming days, preparing for your future expeditions, preparing for the terrifying night to come and each update brings with it, it's own small sense of dread as you wonder whether or not it'll be a small fix or something that adds another horror for you to expeirence.What little titbits of the game's universe I have expeirenced thus far have helped to produce a fractured but vivid scene of horror and mystery. Playing this game I feel compelled to save and quit, shelf it for another day due to the eerie vibe and horrors, but my curiosity gets the better of me and promotes me to push on for just one more day and since surviving each night, despite it's lack-luster tasks needed to do such a thing early on in the game, feels like an over-whelming achievement at first, it's hard to not take advantage of the day light you've just 'earned'.I maybe over-selling this title with cheap emotive writing, but I have a love and bias for horror games with a terrifying atmosphere and this game fits in that category perfectly. Regardless, if I've interested you in any way, I strongly suggest you take a look at a more objective review of the game before deciding, as my goal with this review was to give you my emotive perspective after enjoying the title for a bit rather than my objective perspective. As always, knowledge and experience is a fear killer, so try to avoid looking at spoilers and playstyle guides until you get to experience a few days in-game by yourself first! Though if you're anything like me, the thrilling sense of forboding will always be there in some form or another.			"

								Darkwood is thrilling, unsettling, and at times down-right terrifying. I never would have thought a non first-person game could be so immersive... But it is. Maybe it's the hand-crafted artwork that blends itself so seemlessly into the setting, maybe it's the writing, or the world itself: twisted and yet so familiar. Nevertheless, I find myself time and time again cowering in the corner of some walled-off room, heart pounding... ""What was that?!""Also, this early access game has been faithfully updated over and over again by the small team of developers, who are in contact with the community and, yes, definitely still working (hard) on the project. Yes, waiting between updates can be frustrating... But that's only because the game is so good! This ambitious project is one to buy, to love, and to watch unfold before our eyes, in the best spirit of Early Access.I give it 5/5 dead chickens :-)			"

								I wanted this game for a long time and now i finally had the chance to get it. on the first eye i thought it was just another top-down (not scary) but that turned out way different. I didn't even dare to come out on night time because of all the creepy sounds.i really enjoy playing this game even when its a alpha so that means alot more will come in the future. This was totaly worth my time playing and im sure ill be playing it everytime when a update comes out.A few things that come up for me in this game:- There is always something new around the corner.- If you are a horror fan then this is a game for you.- The game isnt to easy so You are gonna die alot on the first time playing.- It's an alpha so alot of new stuff will come for sureI would rate this game 8.5 because it doesnt gets bored for me. its already fun to play so i can't wait for the incoming updates.

I've screamed when I turn around in the safety of my own home to suddenly find a banshee standing there, illuminated by a crimson light.

								This is one of the best indie games I've ever played. This is classic horror at it finest. The writing, music, atmosphere and monsters are perfectly designed. The atmosphere will keep you on edge the entire time. The only time you really get an ""escape"" from the atmosphere is if you're fighting a wolf outside during the day. But as soon as you kill that wolf, you immediately go back on edge. All the other combat will keep you on edge the entire time.This game doesn't have ""jumpscares"" but it is seriously one of the most terrifying games I've ever played.Then you have the Nightmare that is the nights. I don't want to spoil anything that happens, you should buy this game anyway, you can find out then.The crafting is simple but it fits the gameplay perfectly. The scavenging day to day to get by always keeps the game fresh because you have to go out further and further each day. On top of that is the randomly generated map which always makes things very interesting.All of the core gameplay is there, all that's left to develop is the story (from the half we've seen, it is amazing so far).Don't let the ""Early Access"" label fool you. This game is absolutely fantastic. If you like horror, this is for you, if you like survival, this is for you, if you like a game that oozes with atmosphere, this is for you. This game sets a standard for any game attempting anything similar in the future, from the writing and characters to the atmosphere, combat and scavenging. I would also like to mention that with all my hours on this game I haven't even seen half of everything that's in the early access version. I still have many hours of gameplay left.This game deserves to be played. It is well worth your money.			"

								I love horror games, and this amazing experience is no exception. From the dark, and captivating world you explore, to the deranged, and unnerving inhabitants whom you come across during your desperate bid to survive the nightmare that you now find yourself in. This game, although still in its early release stage, has much to offer. Day night cycles and events, weapons and their respective customization, beautiful music, and perfectly foreboding atmosphere, and a deep sense of inner thought as you are confronted with particular decisions that cause you to question if you are any better than the evil you stumble across in these forsaken woods.

								First game I bought early access... skeptical about the whole early access thing. I don't like buying a game that isn't finished.... buuuuuuuuuuuuuut, I am pleasently surprised by this game. It's a good survival horror game. You start with little knowledge of what the hell is going on but as you progress it appears everyone is stuck in the woods. Some demonic things are going on in the woods and danger is behind every..... tree. As I understand only one chapter is finished as of right now otherwise it's just a giant sandbox to play. This game has great potential. I recomend it. If you wait for full game so be it,  just give it a go sometime. You won't regret it! If you do buy it early access, you will be happy to know it runs smoothly, and I haven't seen any game breaking issues as of right now. Only thing I hope they implement is controller support. It feels as though it's meant to be played dual stick.			"

								This is Alpha, so by no means should any of this be entirely accurate after the release.With that said, I've never been more impressed with so little time spent in a game. I have over 120 games, console games, BIG gamer in general. My favorite genre is rogue-like, survival, and strategy, so low and behold this would be of interest to me.I know what survival games entail. Luck and balls. Walk out, get the stuff, get back before dark. Not much to it, but it's still entertaining. The one thing games like that, in general, lack is reality. Darkwood takes things some much further and differently.Darkwood is the freeroam, pain-stakingly hard game I've searched for for a long time. They play on fears, and best of all, make things very new and real. Everything is made to scare you. Your map is realistic, where you don't have your exact locations, but you navigate via landmark. Combat is difficult, fair, aggrivating, and rewarding. Permadeath features (the rogue-like special) keeps things fresh and more valuable. Resources are far and few between, making things even more difficult.Everything plays off each other. Everything will come for you. Everything about this game is worth it.			"

								This game scares the crap out of me. I mean this in a good way, but I feel like it is too difficult to get anything done. There is a certain point where fear becomes a hindrance, and keeps you from progressing, and I'm just not sure if this game hits that balance. Of course, I'm horrible at horror games, so don't let that be the deciding factor.All in all, it's a pretty beautiful game, and it does fear and suspense very well. The sounds in the night are not just sounds. There is actually something hunting you, and it's just found its way inside. Every night is an oxygen denied waiting game, where silence and stillness is the name of the game. You'll find yourself cursing when the character shifts on its own and you hear his coat move. If you want a true horror survival where every choice and every opened container can mean your death, or slightly delayed death, this might be the game for you. It's an unforgiving game that depends on line of sight, darkness, and horrifying sound design that will make you jittery and wishing for that white screen of daylight.  Just don't expect to be able to actually progress in the game if you're not willing to bite back your fear and dive into the horrors that dwell outside. Even a single enemy could spell your death, and there really isn't a way to be properly prepared or get the upper hand.			"

								This game is by far the most intelligently designed horror/survivor game. Unscripted and random everytime you play the only events that are scripted are the stories that play out. Dark memories attached to places and people, just like the real world. This game uses extremely in depth sound effects. When the lights go out in your safe house after the sun goes down you listen to the things that go bump in the night. The game forces you to rely on hearing to determine locations of enemies invading the abandoned building you use as a safe house. The forest is so thick you and your neighbors are trapped without escape. Sometimes you hear a monster in the night, sometimes you hear a npc going mad screaming into the night. This game is extremely dark and well detailed. A very worthy purchase this game will make you jump. I don't care how accustomed you are to horror games this one will take you for a ride. Play at your own risk.........			"

								I am terrible at playing horror games, but I still do, or try to. That being said, for a top-down game, this is one of the scariest games I've played. I would have thought the lack of first person camera seen in most modern horror games would have broken immersion, but the way darkness envelops you at night really makes this top-tier spook material. You only have the faintest hints of what's going on outside your vision at night, and the helplessness you feel when you board yourself in and barricade your position with furniture is great, albeit stressful. It's plenty spooky in the day, too.On the side, I really like the way shadows work, and the canopies of trees add a sort of 2.5d effect. Good art.For a giant man-child like myself, this is a great game to simulate how I would hide in a corner and weep all night.I give this 5 frightened whiny babies, I haven't decided what the maximum is.

And trust me, your first time in the corn maze, Will most likely be your last. The story is very interesting and vague in a good way, you never know what will happen next, and the characters you will meet, they are very interesting. Over all this game is a 9/10 and im not even nearly finnished. UPDATE. I have more time on darkwood now and i must Change my final verdict to a 10/10. With how far it is right now, It could be a finished game. The story is excellent, The art style amazing and the gameplay is engaging and the fact that they are adding more is insane. I havent even seen everything and i would still say its worth my money, hell id pay 30 for this.			"

								I absolutly adore this game and its concept. I have had it since 3.1 and have been paying attention to its development ever since. The psycological horror in this game puts you on edge and many other games out there dont have that type of horror. However the ones that do, dont do it as good as Darkwood does. In the first two zones of the game (Dry Meadow, Silent Forest) you have relatively good safety during the day and are crying in a corner at night. Just be ready for the Old Woods. This area has roaming chompers even during the day. At night you will constantly question your survival and you might even become paranoid. Just make sure you dont feel like a badass when you get a gun, cause those chompers will charge you and f*ck you up even if you have a line of sight. Whenever this game is updated i get pretty excited and cant wait to see what they added. The bad side though and i hate to critizize the people who made this, but they need to spend more time on this game's development. So many people think they abandoned it and dont give it any attention because of its largely spaced out updates. I mean for christ's sake, the description of the game says it will be released in 2015 (Last Year). I really hope in the future they will put more time into the game. I know they are trying to perfect the story, but this is just unacceptable with the amount of time it has been taking. It has been in early access for 2 years. Overall, if your looking for a game that mixes constant psychological horror with a threatning task of survival, this is the game for you. Just be prepared to wait until this game is done which will most likely take another year.			"

								Darkwood has real potential to revive its genre.I am a huge fan of older survival horror titles including the original Resident Evil and Silent Hill games and have watched the genre die with every new release. Modern day 'survival horrors' have this awful habit of spoon feeding players with abundant resources and frequent saving opportunities. This isn't the case with Darkwood; you have to scavenge for what little you can and you will struggle. The devs have done a brilliant job of balancing this game and ensuring that, all the while, you are absorbing the creepy atmosphere.The style and overall feel of the game is a real tribute to old-school survival horrors. The visual effects are dark and gloomy; the music and sound effects are eerie and build the perfect amount of tension. Hearing an enemy breaking your barricades in the silence of the night is truly terrifying. The controls are a refreshing change and combat is challenging, but engaging and actually quite fun.Although at the stage of posting my review we're only able to play the first chapter of the storyline, I can confidently say that you are immediately drawn in to the true spirit of the survival horror genre. Yes this game is challenging and yes you'll probably die a few times on your first try, but it's a welcome change.I'll be keeping a close eye on updates to Darkwood. The devs are actively improving this game and I can't wait to see what else they have in store for us. Even from playing just the first chapter I am intrigued to know more about what happened in Darkwood.			"

								I believe this game is great even if it isn't ever completed. This game will keep you wide awake at night & in the morning (from experience). I get so scared in the house/cabin at night even when I'm protected with traps, weapons & barricades because if I move I'm scared they will find me XD I just make a base with my supplies,wardrobes & light sources in a small room or corner in the house. Even in the day the sound of anything makes you paraniod. Better get to your house in time! Don't want to get stuck in the rain expecially at night you need that water from the well at night The devs put effort into this masterpiece MASTERPIECE!!!This great team of game developers should make more games like this in the future..........maybe perhaps a multiplayer or co-op game? Devs, also if you may you should add more items like animals or locations in the game like a pond ,treehouse, hill, plane, *Perhaps make even more screwed up creatures & make a feature so you can tame a dog only 1			"

								I have to say that i'm a huge fan of horror games but what really get me in Darkwood is that I underestimate the top view perspective for a horror game I thought it will be a fine game but it turns out that this is the best indie horror game I've ever played the art is awesome the dark colors are flawless the music is deep and obscure the fighting system is not predictable cause it requires skill of course and that's amazing, also I need to applaud the team who made this game cause I had so much fun playing with my friends and I think it will be great if Darkwood has multiplayer so whoever is reading this I tell you if you like challenge, a new adventure full of darkshit just buy the game and enjoy.

								I am not into horror games at all. I honestly have a really hard time with them because I'm a big baby. But for some reason I was drawn to Darkwood. I can't explain why. And I'm so happy I was brave enough to start playing. (I'm just barely brave enough...)Honestly, every time I load the game in there's a sense of dread that befalls me, because to be quite honest, the psychological toll this game takes on you is very VERY well executed. There's not much you can do to comfort yourself while playing. There's no ""I'm safe"" feeling. Just a building sense of unsafe. An almost Lovecraftian catch-22: ""the more I know the better I can protect myself - but also the worse it is for me"". That is so incredibly difficult to achieve, and this game nails it! Every step you take in the day time is unsafe, and every night is even worse. The nights... I won't go into detail... play it yourself...The developers 100% know what they are doing when they give you the ""night"" mechanic, and I hope they never change it. It makes every next day more exhausting than the last. The sound, art, and atmosphere makes this game. Its perfect for what it wants to be. Gameplay is solid, difficult sometimes, but solid. I have a feeling they will make some things smoother in the future, but I'm glad I'm playing it NOW, rather than later down the line if they ever make it easier. This game is compelling beyond explanation. I want to stop playing (because I'm a big baby) yet I can't put it down. I cannot wait for this game to be released in full. The developers should know they are working on something that will become very successful!  "

Darkwood is an Early Access title, this review is subject to change. Date and Version at time of writing editing: December 18th -- Alpha 8.1 TL;DR: One of only two Early Access games I didn't feel cheated out of my money on, and in fact highly recommend. Please fund these guys.Darkwood, from The Acid Wizards, is based on atmosphere and tension. Rather than resorting to jump-scares it relies on psychological horror and organic scares in the sandbox. It's also a game whose mechanics are kinda hard to describe or summarize without spoiling. But I'll try:This top-down title achieves 'scariness' partly due to great artistic style and sound design, but mechanically it's because of your line-of-sight - the way that light and your LOS interact to affect your ability to see in the dark is reminiscent of the foreboding feeling most people got from Silent Hill 2's fog.Speaking of darkness, Night is probably the most important mechanic other than light and sight so far. At the end of each day one must survive through the night. Hide in a corner behind a wardrobe you dragged over and barely scrape by - or take the fight to those who would hunt you, and enjoy the spoils of war.[Updated Note:]Changes to Nighttime have introduced an unkillable enemy that forces you to stay indoors during the dark hours. This mechanic is highly controversial among the early-access community.Combat is rather precise and unforgiving like the Souls games or CRAWL, but in sandbox fashion can mostly be avoided by hiding well or fleeing. Different melee weapons provide different tactics: you'll likely find your favorite bashing tool and religiously stick with it. Firearms are an expensive resource, but will give those struggling with melee far more than just an edge if they can source themselves some ammunition.By day, you explore the world for crafting items and NPCs using landmarks automatically marked on your map once close enough. Some landmarks and areas have function or loot, others are solely for navigation. The shape of the world and the location of, and loot in, each setpiece changes each new game (with few exceptions). Combined with the permadeath difficulty, a very satisfying rogue-like experience is available.When story isn't extracted in a Dark-Soulsian way (by the player inferring things from the environment), it comes from artistic cinematics, or the flavourful NPCs. While they communicate in small walls of text, they're aided by an unsettlingly animated portrait. This is shared with the greater world, where some lootable bodies, hostile flooring, items needed for XP, and even some idle enemies have strange and twitchy, but creepily organic animations.[Updated Note:] The Acid Wizards have doubled-down on their artstyle and worldbuilding with it. Players who find their way to Chapter 2 will be richly rewarded with some of the most ♥♥♥♥ed-up-cool♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever seen depicted in a videogame. H.R. Giger ain't got♥♥♥♥♥♥on these Polish fellows.At current the game's second chapter ends rather abruptly, leaving the player to free-roam the second chapter's map, but this is somewhat made up for by the number of places one can explore, and the irregular updates that either provide a shovel of new content or reworked game mechanics, requiring players to find more efficient playstyles under new rules. Summary: Darkwood might be an incomplete game with [literally:] one or two flaws, but I believe the art, atmosphere, gameplay, and effort are more than worth anyone's time. I'd put it on-par with a few of Steam's other indies like Nuclear Throne, or CRAWL, in that playing Darkwood is doing yourself a service.			"

Early Access Review
								Darkwood is an intense survival horror game set in a mysterious forest. The gameplay is viewed from a top-down perspective and blends combat, exploration, story and survival mechanics in a satisfying way. The prologue is deliciously disturbing and sets the tone of things to come: you start each day in your hideout and must venture out to collect supplies to safeguard yourself and your hideout. As you progress, you'll encounter numerous weird allies and enemies. There's some crafting elements - such as the ability to construct torches, weapons and bandages - and RPG additions - like the ability to inject odd mushrooms which give you various abilities/weaknesses.The unique gameplay mechanism comes in the form of the view cone wherein your character can only see things they are looking at directly. This creates alot of tension and many interesting gameplay scenarios: for instance, you may hear the snap of a twig or the bark of a demon dog as you explore the forest which may force you to look around, bolt away or tread more carefully. The game rewards careful planning and punishes wrecklessness. If you run mindlessly through the forest without checking to see what's around you you'll likely stumble into a beartrap or some poisoned mushrooms; if you take your time and play cautiously you will be able to progress to new regions and advance the story. The combat is nicely balanced and reminiscent of classic survival horror games: you don't feel overpowered but you can muster just enough equipment to defend yourself if you try. The game permits you to choose from 1 of 3 difficulties: the easiest difficulty gives you infinite lives and the option to collect some dropped equipment on death; the hardest difficulty - and by far the most thrilling - gives you just 1 life and forces you to play very carefully and cautiously. The game becomes even more terrifying by night as you must get back to your hideout and survive until morning. Many of the games best scares come at this point as numerous creatures try to break into your house and various strange events occur.The lighting/shadow effects are wonderful - especially considering the game is mostly in 2D - and the muted colour scheme and odd enemy/ally design combine to create an unnerving atmosphere. The sound design is incredibly atmospheric: the menu music captures the tone of the game perfectly and the dynamic soundtrack does a good job of setting the mood as the time and setting change. The 'Time Freeze' music is particularly wonderful and the sound effects are suitably strange and eerie throughout.So far I've played around 35 hours and explored 2/3 regions of the forest: I feel the game is already satisfying and worthy of its price tag based on the current content and my enjoyment thus far. My only minor complaints are some of the UI elements could be better explained - for instance it took me a little while to understand that many items in the world had their own progress/health bar - and it would be nice to be able to repair some of your damaged structures.The game is still in development however and I expect things will only get better as the Acid Wizard team push towards release. I would highly recommend this game to fans of 'weird' survival horrors like Silent Hill and Lone Survivor but if you're a fan of recent atmospheric survival games like The Long Dark you may find lots to enjoy here also.

								This game is fun but its extremely difficult. The only thing that needs refining is the fact that there is no true sense of direction and you never really know where you are going. Otherwise this game is THE BEST survival horror games i've played. Being able to barracade doors with furniture and boarding up windows is a great feature that not very many games utilize. This game is absolutely worth the money. No doubt about it.			"

								Real talk: I thought this game's arial view thing looked lame and made the game seem less scary. Really I played it for 10 hours the first day I got it. It's like silent hill except without a linear plot. Basically the protagonist's job is to do what any human being in the same situation would do: gather supplies, find information, survive and try to escape. Additionally the angles don't deter from the creepiness or the shock factor. Very fun.			"

								If you enjoy survival games like 'Don't Starve' and 'The Forest' without having the constant hunger factor or mental factor, then this is the game for you. This is one of the few games that I have bought recently that I actually enjoy purchasing. It has intresting characters, hard difficulty without being repetitive, scary monsters, and an intresting plot. I have no regrets purchasing this game and enjoy every time I play it. If there was one issue I had with this game, it would be having to turn the brightness up all the way NOT because of it being too scary (it's scary enough as it is), but rather you can't walk two feet of you without bumping into a tree or wall if you have the brightness any other way.10/10, would by again and my advice though to all potential buyers...DON'T play this game in the dark ;D			"

								To be honest this game has a damn lot of potential but i can't give it a good review because somehow i feel like this game (like a lot of others early access games) won't be released any time soon. I bought it immediatly when the EA hit steam and they said it would take around a year for the full release.Now it's 2016 and not even the first chapter is finished.Anyway, the gameplay is awesome and the ambiance really feels eerie and immersive, and the story is intriguing too.I'm really looking forward to the full release but in the meantime you get a negative review for fooling me into buying another game that will probably take 82756454 years to be released.

								Now that I've had this game for quite some time, I think I can offer a better insight into it than before.GAMEPLAY:Good, but a few glitches here and there. However, considering it's still in Alpha, that's looking pretty optimistic. Combat is tough to get the hang of, but satisfying when you finally land a powerful blow right on that annoying mutant wolf's snout. The game doesn't force you to explore off the beaten path, but it rewards you greatly for doing so (if you can handle the dangers, of course). Your character's vision is represented by a cone of light in front of you. Anything outside this cone is gray and blurry. Also, enemies and NPCs do not show up unless they are within your view. This adds danger to any encounter, as there could be something sneaking up behind you when you least expect it.GRAPHICS:Excellent 2D graphics that add even more to the game's already gripping atomsphere. I was surprised at how suspensful a top-down game like this could be.ATMOSPHERE:Superb. The eerie sounds of the forest blend with the crunching of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath your feet to form a permating feeling of spookiness. The enemies are a perfect mix of weird and downright freaky, and I found myself fighting the nearly irresistable urge to turn around and flee while exploring some areas. I jumped at nearly every out-of-place sound, especially at night.STORY:Very interesting and appropriately twisted. I won't spoil anything, but I will say that this game's narrative is on a level of its own. Sadly, a few misspellings in the text take away from this a little bit.Overall, I give the game a solid 9/10.			"

								Great addition to the horror survival series. The feeling of being alone in pitch darkness at night due to not having any fuel left is an amazing feeling. Strange things lurk in the darkness, your curiosity will get the better of you but I say be cautious otherwise you may be in for a real treat. The main thing I loved about this game is the amount of content it has. There is much more than just a few scares. Darkwood takes the scares and makes them interesting, in a psychological way. Which is why I'll nominate this game for the Woah Dude! Award. The first couple of nights should also explain why I give this award :)- Solid Gameplay- Interesting Story- Array of tools and weapons to use- Night Time is awesome!- All resources are useful in one way or another.This is my short review I'll come back to edit later hopefully.

								This is a fantastic game.  It is a near perfect combination of open world survival and progressive story telling.  This game has come a long way.  It has quadruple the amount of content that it did when it first released back in 2014.  This game is procedurally generated, but the world feels handcrafted.  The combat may be slow and hard to handle, but that just feeds the intensity.  It is amazing what the developer has done.  In my opinion, no other open world survival game has come close to the amount of depth that this game has.  I also adore the art style.  It is somewhat reminiscent of those ""Scary Stories"" books by Neal Shusterman and Alvin Schwartz.  All in all, I highly recommend buying this game.			"

								So far the game is great, it's really tough and needs plenty of balancing but that will come with time. I realized that even with perma death turned off that you lose skills/level ups after death. It makes playing without perma a huge challenge still. I would like to see a more realistic adjustment to the weapon durability. An ax would not fall apart within 6-10 hits it would last a long time, what if you heavily increased their rarity and value so that they would not break the games feel of dread? Why not make them last 4 times as long but be 3 times as hard to obtain. Amazing game though as I only have small things like that i'd like to see different.			"

								Picking up my nail covered bored I set out on my morning jaunt through the woods. Traveling due north, for fear of getting lost, I come upon a labyrinth of shrubbery. Deciding to take it upon myself to delve into the laberenth in search of loot, I enter. After losing myself for a while, I found what I've looking for, a chest. Picking the lock, I open the chest and rejoice. However my rejoice was short lived, the sun was setting. Tearing home I reach the well as the sun disappears over the horizon, I take a sip of water and enter my hideout. Pressing myself against the door, I hope that the elaborate set up of traps and barracades will keep me safe, I wait...It seemed I would be let off easy that night when I hear the ear pircing ring of snapping metal, and somthing dieing... slowly, one of my traps had triggered. Not just any of my traps the trap right next to me. There was silence, but slowly a bearly audible noise grew in my ears, The sound of somthing crawling. I look to my feet and see several skittering bugs. Suddenly I noticed my health being leeched away from me, thats when I saw the growths around my feet. I took a step to the left thinking it wouldnt alert passers by on the other side of the door. The sun rose. I praised the sun, then dread overcame me when i realised I had little health and was sitting on the only patch of dirt in the  room not overgrown by the evil fungus of doom.10/10- would get held hostage by a fungus again			"

								An absolute masterpiece; lucky are we who are so privileged to observe its creation. 100% worth the money. If you enjoy an unfaltering atmosphere of tension, uncertainty and despair, a rich but jealously guarded story-behind-the-story which demands you work for every detail, compelling and unique gameplay and mechanics and all the best aspects of an explorative, survival horror game, then Darkwood is exactly the medicine you need to restore your faith in the notion that video games can be good.From the very beginning to the very end, Darkwood devotes every moment of the time you play to making you feel like all's wrong with the world, and you constantly at the center of it. Even the local flora are actively hostile to you, and as you make your way deeper into the woods in your attempt to escape you face only greater and greater dangers. The upgrades and new items you find come as a breath of only temporary relief as you are forced to adapt to tougher enemies, harsher environments and scarcer resources as the game goes on. And even towards the end, you'll find yourself constantly struggling to decide not what to take with you, but what you can afford to leave behind. The tension is constant, and the threats to your life are omnipresent and very persistent. Even turning your back as you walk through an open field can be devastating if you take a step in the wrong direction.The mechanics of combat and of general interaction with the rest of the world come together very nicely to create a very smooth and mostly unpunctuated experience. Combat is very skill based and fast paced, especially in the end-game areas, and the game in general requires a swift mind and swift foot to keep up with the constantly looming threat of the night. Nighttime can be either a welcome reprieve from the constant dangers you face in the day or a hellish gauntlet of relentless assault, and you'll never know which until the hounds are upon you. The story is captivating, well-told and rewarding to follow. It is hidden in the people and creatures you encounter, as well as the very environment around you, requiring much exploration and personal effort to uncover the secrets of the ruined Forest and Swamp and learn the root of the evil plauging the land. There are so many different ways to approach and complete situations that multiple playthroughs aren't just possible, but rather an absolute must, and the procedural generation is enough to provide a fresh-feeling world to play through with its own unique quirks, joys, and obstacles each time.Some claim this game is too difficult. I agree that there is difficulty, indeed, but it is just enough, and if anything it could use a little more. You will learn to be patient, thoughtful, and strong in the Forest, and all you learn will be tested in the Swamp. My profile says 240 hours or something but frankly that's an underestimate as I've followed this game since it was announced in 2013 and I played every damn version I could get my hands on until I could purchase the game for myself. I've watched it grow and evolve since weird stones did something and it's been a joy because for once I have genuine hope that Early Access has facilitated something that I am proud to say I supported and believed in from the very beginning.This is the first game I've ever played that I felt passionate enough about to write a review for. But the emptiness I felt after I played Resident Evil 4 into the ♥♥♥♥ing ground as a child was filled at last when I found this game. The disappointment I've felt with every other would-be surivival game was forgotten, and I have never looked back. If you like good survival games that you will come back to time and time again, if you like games that make you shout with joy after you manage to get inside before the nightmares behind the door tear you open, if you like games that take away from time with your friends and loved ones because ""i'll only play through one more day"", Darkwood is for you. This game earned my money, and if you give it even two hours, it will earn yours too.I give this game an x/10, where x is any real number greater than 10.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is utterly fantastic, a true labor of love. Yes, it has been in development a long time, but progress is constant, and even a couple years ago this game was the type and quality you could replay over and over. It's that good. And it has only gotten better.It is, at its core, a survival and scavenging game. During the day, you leave the relative safety of your hideout to explore and scavenge the ruins of the world that is Darkwood. You collect crafting materials, and ferry them back to your hideout in an attempt to improve your situation. Do you want to use the wood you collected to board up those windows, rebuild that door, upgrade your workbench, or craft a new weapon? These choices have weight and affect your very survival.Of course, there are plenty of animals and ridiculously scary creatures to contend with as you do this, especially as you progress to increasingly difficult areas. The combat is tricky to get the hang of at first. Once you do, it's a very intense, yet rewarding system. It's not a kill, kill, kill type of game; each fight is a battle, and sometimes running your♥♥♥♥♥off is the only way to save yourself. There tends to be a desperate feel to it that can really get your heart going. For a game to draw the player in like that is quite a feat in its own right.Then nighttime comes. This is when you really have to hunker down, this is what you were preparing for during the day. This is the time when the violent creatures of Darkwood come to you looking for food, and they only have a taste for flesh.You fortify yourself in your hideout in one way or another, whether your broad strategy is to hide in a corner, patrol with weapons at the ready, or anything in between. You can craft and set traps, from something as simple as smashing a bottle on the ground to create a patch of broken glass, to working metal to create bear traps. You can stalk around in the dark (and it is DARK!) or utilize one of the many methods of creating light, such as using the generator (each hideout has one, but requires fuel to run it), crafting a torch or lamp, or dropping a (very valuable) flare. Again, each of these requiring resources. The game is filled with choices that may help you now, but leave you scraping tomorrow.I jumped right into talking about gameplay, because it's one of the many things that shines about this game. But it's really the atmosphere that gets the player into the characters shoes, makes you feel the intensity of it. They have achieved a very right combination of visuals, music, and creepy storylines to flesh out the Darkwood universe. And it is a creeeeepy place.In the end, after playing this game for countless hours (much of it offline), the only thing I really need from it is another difficulty level. Don't get me wrong, this game is difficult. It has a definite learning curve that can be punishing to new players. However, the game is so good that it's worth playing A LOT, and veteran status is bound to happen eventually. With the care and attention the devs give the game, I could see it being added down the line, closer to release. And still being in EA, anything is possible!PROS:-Atmosphere is phenomenally creepy-Intense, high stakes combat-Great scavenging and crafting system-Procedurally generated maps enhance replayability-A unique RPG-like skill system that forces a negative perk for every two positive-Day/Night system that pressures you to scavenge for supplies during the day, and make sure you're in shelter and fortified for the night-Multiple difficulties (unlimited lives, limited lives, permadeath)-Developers that are involved with the community and truly care about their gameCONS:-Perhaps not the best game for the overly-casual gamer, as there is a decent learning curve-Once the learning curve is finally overcome, the game eventually becomes too easy; as it stands in EA, veterans are clamoring for a more difficult setting than even permadeathAs Darkwood nears completion, it is better than ever. One of the best games I've ever played, let alone one of the best indy games. Darkwood is a world I will be returning to again and again.			"

								This is a fun game that reminds me of games I've played in the 90s, but has a modern twist with the crafting and controls. The story and world are unique, and the artwork is a real treat. The controls for movement and attack/item pickup are a little unusual, and the storyline is a little scattered and hard to follow, but surprisingly this does nothing to take away from the fun and experience. The game isn't easy, and can be very nerve-wracking, so if you like a nice long challenge this is worth a buy.			"

Early Access Review
								""Deep and rewarding experience""...doesnt seem very deep or rewarding to be surrounded by woodland areas, where in, you can not even pick up a stick. Speaks volumes for a ""survival"" experience.Originally posted by The Acid Wizard:Yeah, I know it makes no sense that you can't pick up sticks from the ground, but this is a game, and game design will sometimes be prioritized over logic. Anyways, we'll look into this and try to solve this issue so it's more ""believable"". You're absolutely right. And just because that aspect of the game did'nt meet my expectations doesnt mean it isnt a good game. The art style, lighting, sound and overall mood creates a very unique atmosphere. An atmos I really enjoy. With many aspects of the game in near perfect ratio...I just felt a little cheated by the forrest. During the day I love cutting my own trials through the thickest of woods, peeling the layers, discovering its secrets. The dark woods however are a very different place. A place that always makes me question my hiarchy as a homosapian. As if the playing field has been reversed like a flip of a coin. Once you have heard a roaring growl from amoungst the pitch black of the dark woods, an experience of near perfect suspense, where neither fight nor flight are viable options. In that moment, you will feel truly alive. I'm speaking as someone who spent a fair amount of time in the woods, as both a child and an adult. By daylight, the forrest is still dimly lit, it presents its own challanges, especially when traversing on unknown property. But it has provided mankind with avenues for survival. Wood for crafting very primitive tools, weapons and traps. Firewood for cooking, warmth and lighting the darkness. Things used for survival. Even things which could possibly be used to defend oneself against the paranormal.Sticks are life. Wood is good. Game is good.Just needs some tweaking imo.			"

Early Access Review
								The only way that this game can be described is impressive to the largest degree.  This is hands down the most crafted, perfected, and enjoyable early access experience that has been released in the history of steam's early access system.  I have dumped around 17 hours into the game, and I would check in and play a little after every update to see the changes that have been made.  Amazingly, the devs have kept up incredibly well with updates, and in the many months that I have owned this title, it has become a very different game, and all for the better.  The atmosphere is incredible and haunting right down to the core.  This is aided by the fact that your character has a limited cone of view.  How so, you might ask?  Though you can see things like trees and large rocks outside of the cone, you cannot see things like items, characters, or enemies, meaning that one of the many creative and challenging enemies in the game can still sneak up and attack you if you are careless.  The way this is implemented is masterful to say the least.The game demands that you be conservative with your resources, often making you choose between upgrading your weapon, upgrading your workbench to allow you to create more weapons and items, or fortifying your base to keep the mutated nightmares at bay once the sun goes down.  And the night time changes everything in the game.  Whereas in the day you can travel in relative safety and strategically kill or avoid most enemies that you come accross, the night turns you into the prey of the creatures that lurk through the forest.  Not only will monsters invade your home and attack you at night, but depending on whether or not you have any fuel in your generator, dark shadows will close in on you and kill you, and are a threat that can only be fought off with a light source.  While the early game will find you cowering in your home praying for morning light, you will later gather the resources and the courage to venture from your home at night, during which special and unique items and resources may be collected.Lastly, the sound design: HOLY HELL, the sound design in this game is PERFECT.  From the hair raising squeal that grounded objects such as stools and wardrobes make when dragging them accross the floor to the haunting moans and screaches of the night, this game will keep you scared and on your toes, especially at night.  Take it from me, when you are cowering in your room with the door baricaded with the wardrobe while not straying more than two feet from your light source, and then you hear the slow creaking of the other doors of your home opening at the will of murderous, rabid invaders, you will feel a fear for your life the likes of which very few games can produce.If I were to summarize this game in one statement, I would say that this is the most fun I've had from a horror game since Dead Space.  At $15, this game is currently an absolute steal, and even more so when the final version is released.  If you want a horror experience that is original, extremely well produced, and scary as all hell, do yourself a favor and PICK THIS GAME UP.			"

								I've been wanting to get my dirty mittens on Darkwood for a long time, and when I did, it was freaking AMAZING!This has been on of the games I've been over-hyped with, but I feel like that was kind of justified.The concept reminds me a lot of Notrium with a dark-twist, and you may argue that a top-down horror wouldn't work.But you'd be wrong.Oh, so damn wrong.The atmosphere is what really gets to me, and the sound design played a bit part in that.You'll often turn around to see what stepped on that twig you just heard breaking, or just generally s#%$t your pants at night because of what you may hear (No spoiler here. That's of the best parts).I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for us.They are nailing so far.Would absolutely recommend buying this one.			"

								Gibbering Writhing black-mouthed chaos. Wretched foul monstrousities. The guttural wails of the half-dead and the better-off-dead. Savages made from the displacement of humanity. Beastial dogs and creatures that can only be found through the utter putrification of nature. This is what Darkwood offers. It offers something, wholly unique. It offers a world of terror and fright that some people would pass off because of it being a 2D topdown survival horror game. And as a person who has been playing it as long as I have (I think the week it came out) I remember all the phases.I remember the wells at night and the mad scrambles you would make to get home. I remember scavenging through the woods and the zones trying to forage the necessary equipment to keep yourself alive. I see now, that the game has only gotten better. I remember being lucky enough to find the mirror and knowing I am nothing worse than the ghosts that surround me. When I heard it received a series of updats, I was so delighted to return to the same grim, familiar surroundings. Wolf, Chicken Lady, the poor violin kid and all the the other horrors lying in wait, with baited breath and hungry teeth, all these things made me want to come back with utter determination.I got his violin, I dragged myself a chair, I brought the Lynx back through the whole forest murdering everything in my path and contemplated murder so many times on Wolf's behalf. I met new people with nothing to say, like The Three, and fought new enemies, like the horrfiying Elk. I traversed the corn maze and I went through, carefully picking and choosing my battles until I made my way back into the same, awful woods I slithered from where I lived in the lap of squallid luxury.This is a game, where nobody is good, they are merely doing things for the sake of themselves. You can feel pity, but there is evil in everything. The cost of fresh pork? Experience a beast you can only slay by talking to a Rocket Man.That violin? You will learn what you must face to redeem the price of a sad child.. That prized sow that belongs to the chicken lady? You will see the price of fresh milk in a place where nothing grows. The efforts of the Black Box? A careful eye will reveal its secret.A Red Swing. A Black Box. A White Dress. All the secrets of an apocalyptic bastion of woodland can offer you. The game is unfinished. But it's definitely worth your time. I buy and play a lot of survival games, and with the modern few I love like Frozen State, Sheltered and a few others, I offer this game a very special place in my heart. I can't review it, but if my views on the game here are any insight, buy it. Buy it cheap if you're thrifty, but buy it all the same. To me, this was like... Playing Darkwood is like planning surgery. You prepare yourself in lackluster scrubs, you enter the operating area half dazed by all the blood, and you hope to christ you don't die in the process of accomplishing your task-at-hand. It's the effort made whether you live to the end of the day, or die in a single run.Getting a gun is nice, but it doesn't kill everything in a single blast. Getting fully upgraded melee weapons is an accomplishment in and of itself but using them and surviving is what feels good.Taking on your first fight with a Chomper and winning? That's what makes the game all the worthwhile.Sure there are bugs, but I haven't a doubt in my mind they'll get fixed. Just as more mystery is made, more problems must be solved. And with any amount of effort made, I can only stand by the game being utterly, and totally satisfied for the low, low price of 15 dollars.The many ugly and unwholesome secrets of Darkwood lay ahead, awaiting your arrival. Why don't you sit and stay a spell? Don't forget your nailboard and bandages, because it's going to be a rough ride into madness friend.			"

								I know nothing about reviewing games, so I guess I'll just give my honest opinion. I think this game is pretty well executed, and since it's still in alpha, I can't say that some bugs ruin the game for me, as they will be fixed in later updates. The ambiance scares me to bits, and when I'm not huddled in a corner with a piece of wood with nails in it, I'm running through a field getting chased by the various mutations of the wasteland. Overall I really can't give a full review, you know, since the game is still in alpha-state. I really enjoy the game, even though I'm too scared to ever enter target buildings, or go visit the friendly neighbors of Darkwood.My onion on rating8.5/10Enjoyable even in alpha-state.			"

								After playing through several survival games that plague (I am using the word plague loosely) the steam store. I have finally found this fantastic gem known as Darkwood. This game doesnt overcomplicate itself, its your basic go out during the day, loot, and genicide any wild dogs that get in your way. But when night falls you better be back inside your semi safe home with a fully fueled generator cuz this is when the game gets terrifying. Yes there is more to it than that, this game actually has a story. so far from what I have gathered about the game, to advance certain plot elements you have to gather and show certain NPC's certain key item's. Unfortunately from what I have heard the game's story is incomplete and due tolack of knowledge Im cutting this reveiw short.But what I do know is, If you like darksouls and survival games that arnt based entirely on luck, this game is for you.

								Darkwood brings horror game to a totally different level, or at least one that has not been around in quite some time. Darkwood makes me panic, and stress, all in one sitting. The felling of knowing that something is lurking just outside your door and out of your sight, or something creeping past a boarded up window, and just barely being able to see it, leaves me nervous and covered in goosebumps. I think that Acid Wizard Studios really did something special here by bringing people into the light of top down horror games, through such a dark, and scary environment. The game is just crawling with atmosphere, and other things! I totally suggest this to anyone into horror games! Great game overall! - 9/10			"

								Made plank with nails in it. Found bear trap. Set bear trap by door so monsters wouldn't come in. At night, a monster suddenly was in my room without even using the door. Hit it with plank until plank broke. Ran out the door, got caught in bear trap, died. 10/10			"

								     I want to say I saw the trailer for this game, and within a few seconds knew I wanted to buy it. To be honest when I first went to purchase this game I was unaware it was an early access game, and even as I played the tutorial and just started on the first level, so far I truthfully am loving this game.      Learning that it was early access was actually interesting to me, as I do not normally like early access games when I have tried them. I am enthusiastic about what the game will become when it is ready for release. As of right now it seems so bloody brilliant and I have nothing but praise for it so far.			"

								""Challenging and Creepy"" It's been a bit since I've played due to life, but this Darkwood has been a great experience for me. The crafting/survival genre of game has been running through a lot for awhile and believe me I know that can put a person off from wanting to give a go at another one. This has done it very well though, and with its own twists that make it worthwhile. The aspect of only seeing what is in the light when it is very likely trying to kill you is a challenging touch that I've come to love. My first few run throughs of this game it got me to jump and had me on the edge of my seat most of the time. It gives you chances to feel safe to only take them away with the terrors that come after you in the dark. I give it an 8/10 for what my experience has been so far. To explain my score:On the plus side, there is an interesting art style to the game, and the atmosphere created for it blends well to give it a creepy chill. The creatures are pretty challenging and horrifying creations, even the wild animals can be difficult if you aren't used to the combat system. Which is another thing, the combat system isn't too unfamiliar to those used to top down style games, but it requires a bit more strategy and reflex than some have to offer. Without spoiling too much, the crafting isn't all that unique when you look at it an overall objective way, but there are certain aspects to it that make it different and keeps the interest. I do like the ability to ""upgrade"" your character in the way implemented, so that's a plus in my book. On the down side however, as I just said the crafting is just that, crafting. What I mean by that is that it is not all that different in comparrison to other games with crafting implemented even in the idea of having to first find/build the crafting tables. The weapons aren't all too creative, even if the creatures are. Don't get me wrong I do love the touch of a more realistic feel for it, but a little fantasy wouldn't hurt in the weapon department either. I would say the bugs/unfinished story/glitches were an issue, but it's still in early access and I'd rather a long development that I can see the improvements on over time over a released version that could have been better. Which I bring up because it is my next point, the updates it has been recieving over time (yes I do keep up with at least checking the updates) is great I grow tired of games that just don't ever quite leave ""early access"" or ""beta"". I love the work they do and all, but if you wait to release a game till it's perfect it'll never really get released.What sold me on this game though...Darkwood, for what story I have seen it has been great for a fan of the creepy and horror genre. The personallity put into each character gives it a certain air of mystery to the story that makes me just need to know more. The trial and error I put into getting it ""right"" on a playthrough so I could finally make my way through to both survive as long as I can and progress through the story. The game has so much potential and they've done a great job with it thus far, and I think it will continue to do great regardless of my few gripes. The main gripe I wish they'd do something about is the combinations/treasures, which if you've played you probably know what I'm talking about. At any rate that is with as little spoil as I could manage why my rating is a solid 8/10. If you're a person who likes a challenge, that creepy feeling you get when you know somethings just out of sight, or if you just like a dark atmosphere in your games, I'd recommend you to give this game a go.

Early Access Review
								Darkwood was released recently for early access as an early alpha build. However, I was impressed by how not-early-access it felt. Many games these days are released as early access, people pay money, and they get a messy incomplete game. Like The Fifth Day for example. Darkwood is not like these games that just seem like a cash-grab for developers. The game thus far is very well made. I don’t recall encountering a single bug, there’s actually story, and there are things to do! I was really impressed by how well the developers, Acid Wizard, captured a creepy, eerie, dark essence to the game. It really immerses you into this freaky, weird place. The game is also very challenging, it is not a brainless walk in the park by any means. In fact, I struggled to even get much of anywhere into the questing and story in the six hours I played. I am not sure why but I could not find the violin boy’s parents house at all. The “not far” part of the message is misleading because I searched everywhere the entire time I played (two different games) and never could find it. Perhaps it is just the luck of the randomly generated world, a feature I think makes this game fun and adds a lot of replay value.Overall, the game in its current state is solid and worth the $15 price tag. If you’re a fan of darker survival games, I recommend giving Darkwood a try.			"

								Darkwood is a top-down-perspective survival thriller(?). The epilogue (which is absolutely brilliant) gives you some basic hints as to how combine items, interact with the environment, swing an axe and that is basically it. Then you wake up in a shabby old house with one wall missing, meet a mysterious wolf-man and head out to explore. And you die.Then you wake up again, make a mental note not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off any dogs, and set out again. Then you die once more – another note made – and you already know it’s going to be one hell of a ride.  Thing is, the game is rather difficult and at times can be truly challenging and unforgiving. However, If you die, you die because you made (a) mistake(s), because you were unprepared or just because you lacked experience (and I don’t mean leveling your character). It takes time to get the hang of it and actually start surviving for a change, but then again this learning process is damn rewarding  – no one is holding your hand, nobody tells you where to go and what to do. Thus, every little accomplishment feels good. Really good.  Darkwood is all about exploration, survival and atmosphere. The world is a twisted, dream-like place (partially randomized) where you’re bound to get lost. There is a map,  yes, but your current location is not marked on it. You have to pay attention to landmarks, remember where you’re going and where you came from. Otherwise you won’t be able to make it home before nighttime. And, believe me, you don’t want to be out when the night comes. You want to barricade yourself at the (not-at-all) safe-house, set some traps, hide in a corner and hope to gods the monsters leave you be. And perhaps cry a little as you hear scratching, howling, barking and what not coming from the other side of the wall. If the monsters do get in and you find yourself poorly equipped, you’re dead. You feel surrounded and helpless, and yet ready to try your hardest to make your stand until morning when all the horrors disappear like a bad dream. Sometimes the nights can be soothingly calm, but you’ll keep sitting in that corner of yours all tense, anticipating the worst. Sometimes a banshee just walks around your hideout, opens doors and move pieces of furniture around, not doing much harm (unless you attack) and still scaring the living crap out of you. You never know what to expect and it makes the whole experience even better. If you happen to survive the night, you’ll wander off again to replenish resources (which are scarce and don’t respawn), eventually venturing into darker, more dangerous parts of the forest. There are guns (some are difficult to find though) but don’t get trigger-happy as ammo is hard to obtain and expensive. You’ll be forced to go melee most of the time. And, don’t get me wrong, you’ll probably try to avoid fighting all together anyway. This is NOT a beat’em up kind of game. Dying is easy.It is also NOT a horror game as such. The mood is heavy but don’t expect cheap jump scares. There might be some, as your cone of vision (another sweet idea) allows you to see only a bit of what’s in front of you and leaves you exposed to all sorts of dangers lurking in the darkness, but it is not scripted. If you get jump-scared, it’s because you were not careful enough. Most of the times. The game in its current version (1.3) offers only the prologue and the first chapter but it is a fairly long trip and holds great replayability value. Also, it might be the most polished and bug-free alpha game I have ever played and I have played quite a few. Give it a try and see for yourself.  "

								So far this game is deadly and thought provoking, it may only be in alpha state, having just come out on early access, but the game that is there already looks to be in fairly decent working order and very challanging. Good creepy atmosphere, don't go outside at night if you want to live, daylight hours are dangerous enough, also permadeath is an option but not mandatory so it makes it kind of nice if you want to go easier or go hardcore.

								Wow what a game!I hardly every do reviews but this is specialDespite my short amount of game time (I'll be going back on as soon as I've recommended this) I have enjoyed it a huge amount so far... So here it is:Graphics: 8.5/10 - Oh boy the graphics! By far the best rogue-like graphics I have ever seen. the dark, creepy and grainy effects really put you on edge... Not to mention how void of colour it is (Not a bad thing as it helps the tension and atmosphere) and oh god the lighting is amazing...Gameplay: 8/10 - the crafting is very straightforward, but efficient, the combat is very tough. I struggled on my first enemy! (MLG) But it works. It also really reminded me of RE4 (Resident Evil 4) which is one of my fav survival horrors out there.Soundtrack 9/10 - Wow. That's the only way to describe the amazing soundtrack. Just, Just WOW.Bugs 9/10 - I've only spotted a couple bugs so far.. text out of place,etc.Optimization - 8/10 - Man it's good. I can run this full settings with my crappy little notebook. Although has it's choppy moments, will be improved!Overall rating - 8.5/10 This game so far is great, the prologue was fantastic, the gameplay is good and the story seems interesting too. A great pickup and I strongly recommend you buying it! (Review will be updated).Bye babes x "

								Darkwood is a great survival/scavenging game that has unique mechanics, creepy characters, and a mysterious storyline that will leave you wanting to know more.  This is one of the first games i've seen that make it absolutely imperitive to return to home base every night and it adds a sense of urgency and panic when night begins to set.  Nighttime, while easily one of the most difficult parts of the game, loses it's horror scariness but nothing gets you more panicked in this game than when you have no weapons and you hear something beating in your barricades.  to any survival/horror game player, i would recommend this 10 times out of 10 and i eagerly await the updates to come.

								Development for this game may be slow, but this is a case where quality comes before quantity. Darkwood is an amazing experience. It's creepy and atmospheric, full of genuine mysteries that make you wonder WTF is really going on in this twisted, decaying world. The gameplay experience isn't terrifying and stressful (like in Amnesia) but it's definitely tense and exciting. It forces you to respect the dangers of the world and plan you actions. Combat is risky. Building and fortifying a secure hideout is crucial to survival. Wandering outside at night is suicide.I played version Alpha 4.2 and enjoyed every second of it. It's not a complete game yet but it's a more satisfying game experience than some triple-A titles out there. Totally recommended to anyone seeking an immersive survival horror RPG experience.			"

								One of the most innovative horror titles I've ever played.Spooky forest simulator by day, home invasion simulator by night.This game runs with so many common human fears that it leaves its unfortunate players babbling incoherently in a corner and jumping at shadows hours after exiting.Or maybe that's just me...Don't let the simplistic top down view fool you, you can forget the world is represented in 2D with the extremely immersive atmosphere and incredible sound design. All this coupled with challenging but rewarding gameplay and an intruiging developing story makes this game a MUST-HAVE for horror gaming fans.Add this to your library and share its existance with all of your internet buddies, because this game is a rare indie developer gem.

								Such a romanticly erotic masterpiece, kidding. This game takes an underrated perspective, and makes it work well again. Most games that have been released with such an art direction as well as perspective have been highly lack luster. this game marries the concept of ambience(via lighting, audio and environment generation) with the idea of having a false sense of awareness in the space that you currently occupy to create a sense of fear that has been hard to find since the original resident evil games. notably, this game is a true Survival Horror game with a psychologically engaging story told in the most spectacular way. The story is told in a very david lynch~ish style, similar to hotline miami.... but lets not make that mistake and get the two mixed up as they are both two extremely different game.to cut everything else I would say short... because there is plenty I can say about this game...Get it... It is definatly worth its price tag in its current state... the story will build an anxiety that will make you beg the developers to some how travel into the future, steal the finished copy... and release it now... which would cause some sort of crazy♥♥♥♥♥paradox. the gameplay is soooo solid in its current state... I wonder what else they will add as I am quite satified with it as is. and last... The sense of fear and just truely feeling lost at times in the forest is truely nerve racking especially as night fall comes.Key Elements:~Intense Combat Mecanics which are also used to interact with the environments in various ways.~Object interaction... Multiple options to interact with objects via ""drop Down menu"" like most D&D games.~Lighting, Creates a horrifying tone espeially when the developers literally take all light away during the night... Insanely scary, dont change that.~Atmosphere, The sound creates a dread that will haunt you and keep you on edge for your entire play through.~sense of exploration, The map system is actually an interesting one as you have no idea where you are until you discover something aside from your hideout... giving you a ""sense of direction, It totally works for this game. Get this game... its worth yur time and money..~Mike.Mp.s.sorry for the late review, I bought the gae over the summer... looooved it... and played it recently and just... WOW!			"

Early Access Review
								I have finished the game and found 2 secrets (I think), so it is time for me to write an alpha review of this game.As many people here said this before me: THE ATMOSPHERE IS AWESOME! The style of this game fits it perfectly and some decisions you must make are really great and add a lot to the atmosphere (I would like more of these :)Also I am Slavic by myself Czech to be exact (This game is made by Poland developers, we are neighbours) so the story and settings that this game has is more familiar with me, interesting and creepier and I enjoy it much more than lets say: Amnesia (don´t eat me alive, just my opinion). The notes and old photos, old things that people left there, that you can find are very interesting and they will drive you more into the situation of the game.Locations are also very interesting (and dangerous) and I always felt good (I am the adventurous type, I explored few deserted locations in real life, I enjoy these things a lot) and also weirded/creeped out when I was exploring some new building or landmark. Just look on the web for pictures preferably (it is for your own good), but be careful this game can be easilly spoilered (or can I just say spoiled? Not a native speaker here, sorry!), so don´t look on gameplays much, if you want to buy it.The camera from the birds point of view is also very nicely done, like for example when you are stranded in the forest, you can see the branches of the trees and fallen trees and the effects like: lights and shadows in buildings are very nice. There is also physics, that adds interesting mechanics like: pushing various objects to barricade yourself from an enemy that is chasing you,or pushing against doors when something tries to walk in. Also you can barricade with planks and nails of course, when you have the time.  Or if you throw something it will slide on the ground, so you can see the physics in action.You can also run into the doors to break them open, when you are running from an enemy.It has of course a good amount of bugs or glitches, like light problem when some parts of the forest will flicker for a second so you can´t see, and also dissapearing enemies, that occured to me quite often with chompers. To explain you the glitch/bug: Sometimes when it was chasing me it would dissapear and stopped attacking until I bumb into it accidentally or look in other direction for it, then it would quickly appear and almost kill you or start chasing you)Also I would change the fighting system a bit (it is really hard to hit something with the axe and or shovel, because it just takes too long to ''charge'' the attack) and breaking of the melee weapons (they break unnecesearly/unrealistically often) and the crafting system is very small and simple, maybe add more variety and complexity, like new barricading structures and weapons. The developers are quite active and responsive also the updates are every month (more or less).So everything will get better and the game will get bigger after some time.The developers will have to do their best as the game is far from completion.Also this game is rather hard and will not hold your hand. There is a prologue, that will teach you few things, but then you are on your own and you will have to act like you would act in that situation, you must adapt to it.If you are searching for some new horror-survival game and if you are a fan of deep atmosphere and story games, that is not only about the blood/gore and jumpscares GO FOR THIS ONE, you won´t regret it!

Early Access Review
								Let's just get one thing straight.Darkwood is a brutal game. A REALLY brutal game.If you love challanges, this game is definitely for you.If you're into zombie/scavanger type survival games this is definitely a must have then.Let's start off with with this game isDarkwood is a horror game that only goes well if you plan ahead of time. After the prologue tutorial, you play as a man with very little amounts of resources to start off with. You run around in the day time looking for wood, nails, just about anything you can fit into your invetory screen as almost all of it is important. Eventually, you'll notice that you have to go back to your hide out before night fall to drink from a well and hole up in your home. This is where it get's really interesting, and where most of your strategic planning comes into play. During the night, you'll be forced to drink from a well just outside your house, which enables you to live through the night. If you don't drink from the well in-time though, you'll start losing health untill you do. So don't travel to far out without a watch (Which you must find, or buy. You don't start off with one), or a decent sense of how long it takes to reach night time. After you drink from the well, you're most likely going to run back into your home. You can close the doors, block the hole up in your house with your furniture, and barricade the doors and windows with either panks of wood, or just more furniture. Next, you can lay traps that you may have found on your journey, arm yourself with any weapons you have crafted or found, and after alllll of that, you're going to sit, and wait for morning. And wait... and wait... oh god what are those foot steps I'm hearing? What is that growling sound? Jeezes what's with all the crows? Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥something is inside the houseWith that being said, the game has a stealth mechanic to it. Monsters have to know where you are in order to attack you. Sure they spawn outside the house at night, but they don't know your exact location yet. First off, monsters listen for your foot steps. Step to close to one that's just on the other side of the wall, and he's going to know where you are.    break into your house, and start looking for you. You can hide behind furniture, or lock yourself in another room though, maybe set up a trap at the door way. Oh, I forgot to mention, during the night, assuming you've already found out how mushrooms and leveling up work, you're going to occasionally be attacked by shadows. It won't happen every night, just every now and then. Every hide out has a generator that produces electricity for your lamps. You need gasoline (fuel) to make it work though, so don't forget to turn those things on before you go into hiding. Any source of will keep the shadows from hurting you during the night, be it flares, flashlight (Though that requires some aiming) or just lighting a fire with some gasoline.After every night, during the morning of the next day, you're going to be visited by ""The three."" These guys are going to end up being your main source of resources later on down the road.  And time for the game will freeze for the morning, meaning you have time to replace those busted barricades, and rearange your furniture for the next night.Now you can travel outside during the night. In which case you'll find more mushrooms growing about then usual (These also grow in your house) , as well as a plethora of deadly enemies. (This is not recommended at all. At any point in the game. Seriously, don't leave your hide out.)Your day time scavenging is done once again, maybe you finished a quest line, and now you're prepared to wait out the next night... Oh joy, the fog is here and the shadows are approaching! ... wait, where are the shadows? And why is the house making all kinds of shaking noises? Why is all the furniture moving?! I need those!! HOLY SH-This game will scare you, endlessly. It will kill you, repeatedly untill you figure out how to really survive. You will be paranoid about every place you go and every night you have to live through.Oh, did I mention this game features a perma death mode? If you thought this game was scarey before, try playing it without dieing once. That makes it more heart pounding then ever, as one mistake could be your last, and you'll lose every bit of progress you had made. You don't have to play perma-death, you can leave it off. When you die, you'll be able to loot your corpse, and just continue on with the days. This isn't always helpful though, if you die far off from your hide out around a heavily guarded area, you're going to have a really hard time getting your stuff back and might just have to go on without it for a while.This game is one of the most interesting survival horror games out there, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good scare and action/creepy/strategically decided adventure.

Early Access Review
								The game went into early access in July 2014. I can't say I know what it was like back then but from what I've seen as of patch 3.1-4.0 I was very impressed!For a top down game it is very atmospheric and scary. Gameplay consists of searching for resources during the day and defending your hideout at night. If you somehow manage to find the time then also progressing the plot.Resources don't respawn and you need them to survive the nights so you will inevitably be forced to advance deeper into the forest to a new hideout and continously search for a way to escape the forest before you are overwhelmed or run out of resources.In patch 3.1 it was easy to survive by pulling a wardrobe into a corner with you boxed in to be safe. However as of patch 4.1 poltergeists throw around the furniture if you do this and the noise attracts more monsters. Players can survive by barricading windows and doors, setting traps, lighting the house with a gas generator, igniting enemies with strategically placed gasoline and a lit match, and fighting with a variety of melee weapons and if you are lucky maybe a gunThe game has optional permadeath and the enemies are extremely dangerous. You never feels safe and every day feels like a mad rush for resources. However for me this was a negative as the constant day to day rushing made me feel like I don't have time to soak the atmosphere or proceed with caution. Days are slightly longer in 4.1 however... I would like to see a system where time passes as the player advances from one location to another and once the player reaches a location like, say, the burned houses then time becomes normal until the player leaves, giving the player time to explore carefullyIt is in mid alpha right now, and I feel they should have progressed to beta by now but not that it is way too slow either. The devs are very communicative and take criticism into account very well. They tend to reply to post in most topics and never get mad even at people who are trollingI'd say this is one of the games worth paying to get at early access, but I don't want to encourage early access so for those who like games like dark souls, survival games and roguelikes definetly get it when it is released :D			"

								Loving this game, this has scratched that survival horror itch I was looking for that other games just didnt seem to do. It's very atmospheric, the audio is terrific, it makes for very tense gameplay without being overbearing. I knew I wanted this for a while and I'm glad I bought it. It's a shame they won't be doing a co-op for it, it doesn't need it but it would have been a nice extra.			"

								This game is by far one of my favorites. I have to force myself to stop playing it.The art design, the characters, the story... it's all great. I do, however, notice that time goes by super fast. I don't have a whole lot of time to do stuff, so I hope in the future the time progression will slow down.Other than that, I haven't really noticed any bugs or anything since the update, and everything seems to be a lot better.People who enjoy survival and a game with a good story and art style would probably like this game.

								Type of Game:Top-down horror survival PDL with crafting elementsVersion Played:Early Access PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Teleglitch, Don’t Starve, the Silent Hill series, and to a lesser degree Hotline MiamiThe Good:A truly intriguing storyline filled with mysteries around every corner. It feels like you’ve stepped into a Silent Hill storyline, but crafted by David Lynch.This makes exploration a much more enjoyable experience as uncovering parts of the story really add depth to the gameThe game is really difficult, which adds A LOT to the tension of each decision you make. The lack of resources and constant sense of dread creates an experience similar to playing Dark Souls, except just way scarier (quite a feat, I know).Randomly generated maps help with the sense of disorientation each time you play and adds to the replayability of the title.The crafting aspect to the game is very deep and intuitive. As I mentioned before, resources are limited, so finding a stockpile of items is a very rewarding experience.Crafting also lends itself to the defense building that needs to occur every game night, which if you find yourself itemless during well… just make sure you have plenty of wood and nails.The music and ambient noise is appropriately creepy and adds to the horror of playing.Combat is easy to grasp and works very similarly to Hotline Miami, which can lead to some frantic combat scenarios.The intentional lack of hand-holding in the beginning of the game can create a constant sense of discovery not unlike Don’t Starve.The Bad:As expected for an early access title, the game has bugs and glitches which can ruin the immersion at times. Though definitely not as bad as other early access titles.One example of a bug was a loading problem, which caused some difficulty picking up where I left off when trying to access a saved game. This has since been addressed.Another bug (as the dev team has referred to it as such in the forums) is the excruciatingly long initial world generation time. I had thought that the game had crashed the first time I played, though stuck around luckily due to the music still playing. This is something they are working on. Currently only Chapter One is available, which is bad only because I want more of this amazing game!Can you play it while the children are awake?No… Just no.Did I make time to complete it?I finished what was currently available, which was Chapter One.Redlight or Greenlight?This game is currently at a greenlight.The content that is currently offered is well worth the asking price of $14.99. The experience is a horror game fan’s terrifying bliss. Darkwood has mysteries around every corner, frightening sounds you feel like you imagined, fearsome creatures that don’t relent, frenzied combat that leaves you breathless, and panicked defense building which all come together to create a phenomenal gaming experience. Knowing there is more to come is just icing on the cake.A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy:www.gamersglance.com "

								Below you'll find both a written and a video impressions on the game


YouTube™ Video: Darkwood: Early Impressions 

			Views: 583		

			Darkwood: Early Impressions Darkwood video created on version: Alpha 1.0 Darkwood takes the survival horror genre to a top down perspective and throws in some optional ""rogue-like/lite"" elements.		

 As an early access Darkwood is fairly solid. I didn't find any bugs or glitches, and the game never crashed. It does suffer from some optimization issues, mainly the long load time. As for the game it self, it's pretty enjoyable, if not, at least a unique experience. Darkwood takes the survival horror genre and put it into a top down perspective, with an excellent aesthetic style. Visually the game is of a high caliber. The background and foreground elements are detailed and stylized, while still maintaining visual clarity so the player can easily decipher what items are interactable. The game's sound design is equally admirable. Your footsteps sound realistic and heavy, with the ground it treads on matching the steps you take. You'll hear random twig snaps, and kicks of pebbles. Crows in the distance, and animals in the shrubs, with a light but moody sound track to kick in the appropriate moments, and you have a game that's a real treat for the ears, as well as the eyes. The game's sinister atmosphere is further echoed by the use of light, both for visual interest as well as using light as a mechanics on it's own.The game also features an interesting chapter by chapter story structure as well, with the current build being the prologue. With out giving too much away, let's say at the game's first turning point, a fairly major and unexpected reviel will instantly grab your curiosity.  Though the game is quite enjoyable even at this early stage, it's not with out it's faults. On the technical side. long load times can drive a person's patience, and the game's lack of features and options is also worth noting. Mechanically speaking once you start playing with the more sandboxy elements of the game, you could find yourself in long stretches wandering seemingly aimlessly, wondering where your next objective is, or if you're even going the ""right"" way. To be fair, this isn't so much a problem with Darkwood it self, but rather, a common issue with survival games in general.Overall the game is a quality product already, and I can only see it getting better with time. I believe I can safely recommend Darkwood if you are interested in the idea of a top-down sandbox-ish survival horror.Pros:- Great graphics- Interesting plot- A new take on survival horror- Great sound design- Good lightingCons:- Long load times- Can get boring when searching for next objective- Limited features and options			"

								I love this game.It's something I've never played before: top down+horror=unique gameplay.Nights are scary. Not only must you hide from savages lurking around your hideout, but the shadows that want to consume you. Grab a torch and pray for the night to end!There are three sections in the map: Meadows, The Forest and The Old Woods. Each of these zones are harder than the other, and the farther you go, the more interesting locations you can find.After strolls around the woods harvesting odd mushrooms and meat, you can return to your hideout and cook it into a liquid substance and inject yourself with a dose. This lets you choose one skill from the first tier, however, each tier has its negative skills aswell, such as the shadows, mentioned before.You'll find yourself dying alot, the map may be hard to use as it doesnt show where you exactly are unless near a certain location, but worry not, it shows where you died and lost your inventory, so you can try to retrieve your precious loot.I definitely recommend this game to people who want some hardcore horror survival!

You'll die at least a dozen times before you figure out which things are dangerous and which aren't. And that's just the first hour of gameplay.The look and feel of the game fit the theme perfectly. The interface doesn't take long to get used to. It's similar to Monaco when it comes to controlling your character, field of view managing and everything.So far so good. "

								So, when I bought this I was kind of in a bind, you see I love survival games, but I have always hated top-down games.  I took a leap of faith and purchased this and I have to say I think I've found the first top-down game that I love.  This game is amazing!  It's difficult enough to make you think about whether you want to barricade that window or make a weapon, but it's easy enough that you don't get discouraged.So far I have found very few bugs, and all of the game mechanics seem to work flawlessly.  The best part about this game?  It's still in early release so there are many more features to come!			"

								This is a game. A game of twists and turns. A game of pure horror as the ambience and atmosphere of the game is enough to keep your spine chilling throughout the entire experience. The story is captivating, disgusting, and the work of pure geniuses. It is only early access and I'm already addicted especially by their progress to the development of the game. It's challenging but yet fair. It has a unique leveling system which is used by collecting certain items (mainly mushrooms) and extracting their essence into a syringe on your very own oven to inject yourself causing you to not only choose a skill but choose a downside as well. The nights are ferocious and nerve-racking as you must stay inside and hide behind your barricades that you have created with either some feeble wood and nails or some furniture you have found laying around. When you need a drink of water (you know, to live) you must wait till night when the well is not dry. But the well isn't inside your house. You must run outside, get a drink, get back in, and hope that nothing was chasing you along the way. But don't forget to put gasoline in your generator and turn it on, the dark is not a safe place to be... I strongly recomend this game to anyone who loves horror and survival games			"

								I have been waiting for this game. I don't have much time to play and horror games I always like to play in small bits. But even with the short impression: This game is amazing and it's been worth buying. They really thought this through on gameplay, atmosphere, graphic design and story telling. You can see this right from the beginning. It all comes together as a whole. Even that there are no voice overs in the game fits the artstyle and atmosphere. It is intense as hell.  I just have to get used to the controls a little bit though. I'd like to have the direction I am going applied to characters view and not to the view on the screen. But besides this it is definetly worth buying at full price. That is cheap for what you get.			"

								I truly am afraid of the dark again…Darkwood is a very immersive and disturbing title which has grabbed me by the shirt and sat me down for the most thrilling horror experience I have played in a long, long time. This game easily reminds me of the many horrors of early survival horror games played back in the day, (Silent Hill 2, Resident Evil 2, etc.), and can bring back that classic feeling of being alone while fighting the dangerous unknown. This game is beautifully done, even though it is in an Alpha state, and has a great story telling experience that keeps the player hungry for more. I highly recommend this title for anyone who enjoys surviving against mind-bending monstrosities, loves feeling vulnerable during survival experiences, and enjoys twisted visions of a gloomy forest atmosphere.

								I have owned this game sinve very early alpha and I love it.  It is always a good game to just hunker down play for an hour or two, save then just pick it up later.  So far the updates have massively improved the game.  Some of the updates made it drasticly more ballanced, some added fun little mechanics and some removed annoying beyond belief ones (the well).  I recently came back to it and I am not at all disapointed the new crafting system is much cleaner and well created.  The bench was an extremely nice touch.  Overall I would say this game has a nice plot, weird controls that take a while to get used to, but beautiful atmosphere and the characters are absolutely wonderful.  This game is worth the money.

								I was an original back of the game back in April of 2013, I wanted a true survival horror and Acid Wizard seemed to know what makes a game truly scary and tense. Note that I have only played the game for about an hour, this was so that I don't get bored of the game before it is released like I did with StarBound, so take this review with a grain of salt. The game so far is what I would call a true survival horror experience, the atmosphere is dark and oppressive with ambient sound that constantly keep you on edge and constantly checking your back, thinking something is going to constantly going to murder your horribly. I have seen one or two jump scares, mostly something behind me I didn't notice. These, however, weren’t bad jump scares, they happened during times when I was fully immersed in the game and I was already scared. One of the problems I had are that some of the controls are a little clunky. To swing a melee weapon, you hold down left click to raise the weapon, then right click to swing instead of letting go of left mouse. This feels intentional, like how Silent Hill 1-3 had awful combat to hamper the player, but it is still awkward, not too awkward and you get used to it, but it may cause a few deaths. The game is buggy at sometimes as well, I once was stuck looking in a box because a menu failed to pop up. I was stuck until a cosmic monstrosity decided that I was looking tasty, which did scare me, but it does need to be fixed along with others that may show up. From my experience, I'd recommend the game, but I'd wait until the full game is released, unless you like taking part in Early Access games or you wish to support the developers. I'd like to see how the game improves over the Early Access time to the final release.			"

								/After a few hours with the first alpha release I'm so happy I backed this game, if they can keep generating more content like what's already in the game I'll be more than satisfied. The game seems semi-structured with story elements introduced via fetch quests and interaction with the other characters present in the game world. Some random generation to the environments promotes replaying but seeing as i've only been playing a few hours I can't comment on how much it affects each playthrough. The audio and visuals work really well together to create an oppressively creepy atmosphere and playing with headphones is a must for the full effect.Darkwood is the type of game that will make celebrity youtubers♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants for their audiences entertainment, and whilst there are plenty of jump scares it's the art and sound design that really chills the bones along with a limited view of your surroundings the feeling of never being safe is always present.

								My first serious review. I did not think i would like this game. I wanted a horrer game but did not know what. So i searched and came across this. I hovered my mouse over it and the description seemed pretty cool. Went to the store page and saw it was 2d and top down view. I was looking for something first person. Since it was 2d and the view was top down i immediately thought to myself im not going to like this game. I was really wanting a new horrer game though so i gave it some thought. I read some of the reviews and they were overwelmingly positive. So i said to myself well its just 15 dollers so why not. Honestly this game is amazing. Do not do what i did. Dont second guess yourself. I do not regret buying this at all. If you are going to take advice then take this. Never judge a book by its cover. This game is really fun, scary, and very creative.

If you like survival exploration games with a touch of the weird, then this is definitely worth checking out.An important caveat: although there are are currently some random elements in the game, this is primarily limited to the location of the major....err....locations of the game. That is to say sometimes a particular house will be north of your starting area, and sometimes it'll be south, or east. But the locations themselves are always the same once you get to them. Although there's a way to save your progress, new game versions tend to wipe your saves so you end up having to start over. Enough restarts and you'll may get tired of going over the same section of the game over and over.			"

Hours of content already available, and almost unlimited replayability (Locations change and buildings change orientation for a different map each game). A game that actually shows promise from Day 1. Not only are the devs active in the community, they respond to feedback well, and make changes that the community wants. So far 9/10, the UI is a little cluncky and needs improvement, but apart from that, great job Acid Wizard!			"

That is to say sometimes a particular house will be north of your starting area, and sometimes it'll be south, or east. But the locations themselves are always the same once you get to them. Although there's a way to save your progress, new game versions tend to wipe your saves so you end up having to start over. Enough restarts and you'll may get tired of going over the same section of the game over and over.			"

								Brilliant already and it's still in Alpha. Love the atmosphere and the sense of accomplishment that you feel when you can delve a little deeper into the game. The sound effects at night when you're trying not to breath too loud are great. Can't wait to try the next build. Good work. A project and team worth supporting.			"

Early Access Review
								This is gonna be a long one so I'm gonna summarize here. If you're looking for a perfect blend of sandbox and horror then this game will definitely tickle your fancy. I highly recommend it even if it is early access. Normally I hate early access. People throwing out unfinished games to the masses. This is the one exception. Don't hesitate in getting this now if you're interested. It's damn good and feels like a finished game.Day oneFirst day of the game I was terrified. I had no idea when night was coming. My inventory was full and I quickly realized my map doesn't show my exact position. I had to figure it out on my own using landmarks I've located. This was my first major mistake. I was lost. I could see the sun was beginning to set and I was still lost deep within the woods. I was so cocky. When I first booted the game I turned on permadeath thinking I could ace this game like any other horror or sandbox game I've played. None of them set the atmosphere quite like Darkwood did. Nothing frightened me more than seeing the sun come down. I began panicking, sprinting my way through the forest hoping for any sort of shelter. Of course I didn't find any. I did find the road however and with it, eventually my home. It was pitch dark outside and I made the huge mistake of leaving the generator on. I was so stupid. I assumed the gas I put in it would last longer or it'd just stop using fuel during the day. The typical gaming conventions I was used to wasn't present in this game. Not even the sight of my own home made me feel any relief. I'd made another horrible mistake. I hadn't had time to barricade the windows during the day. I shut myself in one of the rooms and pushed all manner of furniture in front of the doors and windows, hoping it'd keep whatever was out there away. I had no idea what I was up against. But I could hear them. I had run out of furniture to push against any openings. There was one window I had to keep open and for the rest of the night I stared at it from across the room. I spent the whole night, weapon raised, staring out that window terrified for my life.ReviewI've watched this game in development for a while and I was pleasantly surprised to see a developer actually deliver an amazing game for early access. I had my doubts. I really wanted to get this game when it was finished so I could get the whole experience but I couldn't resist any longer. Boy was I impressed though. It felt like a complete game. Of course I bought it shortly after most of the bugs had been squashed so I didn't really get to see how buggy it may have been early on. They've already thrown out so many bug fixes in the short amount of time it's been released that I definitely have high hopes for its development. A lot of ""survival horror"" game developers just don't get what makes a horror game truly terrifying. I've seen countless of these horror games that rely solely on jump scares or just putting the character in a dark room with a flashlight. And what few games have that right kind of atmosphere have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game-play. Darkwood does this flawlessly. Not only is it in a terrifying setting, but it's also fun to play. The most important thing to any horror media (be it a movie, book or game) is setting the tone. You need the player to feel immersed in this atmosphere or they won't give a damn about the character's well-being. I was genuinely scared I wouldn't be able to make it home the first night. I had absolutely no idea what I was up against and I didn't want to know. All I knew is that it wanted me dead. I wasn't even sure if the dressers I pressed against the doors and windows would even protect me from them. Its that mystery that makes the game so effective at being scary. Not once did I feel like I was truly safe. Even as the sun came up. All in all this was definitely one of the scariest experiences I've had with a game. I highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for horror. Darkwood will forever be my measuring stick for judging what a true survival horror game should be. "

Early Access Review
								In terms of Early Access, I'm usually in favour of waiting for the full game to release. But there's a lot to like about Darkwood, even in the early Alpha 9.1 version that has sucked me in.The game is much more polished than when I tried it last (I think it was Alpha ~6 or thereabouts) and, at least in terms of the early chapters, seems pretty playable and largely functional as a ""game"".Okay, so enough about the development, is it fun to play?Oh god, yes. The game feels like an enmeshing of Don't Starve and Dark Souls (or perhaps classic Biohazard/Resident Evil) to me. With lots of small pixel detail thrown in. The sounds and the small details, like your character absently rubbing his arms, feels fleshed out like the little world on the screen is truly alive. And everything about it just feels kind of... off (in a good way). Sort of like when you first watched Don't Hug Me. I'm Scared videos. Well, except that the overt weirdness and horror is up front, that is. The tutorial helps you learn how to control the game, but after that, it doesn't really hold your hand. But this is largely a good thing, because it gives you a chance to learn what's going, on your own.And whatever is going on is weeeeiiird, in a very good way. Everything about it is unsettling, and leads you toward unsettling conclusions. The forest encroaches on everything, and everything has a twisted, sinister sheen to it. Like playing Nocturne, but, ahem, genuinely scary. So even though it's early access, I feel compelled to play it, and that's a very good thing in my book. If you liked the creepier parts of the tabletop RPGs Summerland, or Symbaroum, or have even gotten sucked into playing Noio's Kingdom for hours because of the base building and scavenging loop... you will be in good hands here. I think the systems and mechanics feel a lot like a tooled up version of The Last Stand flash games. You forage for materials during the day (sadly, so far I haven't encountered any other survivors willing to help me defend my hideout in the dark hours), and then hole up at night, just praying for dawn.I strongly recommend checking a wiki or a guide for some basics, otherwise it may feel frustrating. The game, at least on Normal difficulty, is forgiving just enough to not feel artificial. You'll breathe a sigh of relief when you find that lucky pile of wood to build your next barricade. But be sure not to ""level up"" via cooking too soon, or else you may find you'll be wasting precious resources on light... yes, at least in the version I played, if you skulk in the darkness of your hideout, in the beginning, you may survive okay.

Early Access Review
								While I would recommend this game for fans of atmospheric roguelikes and horror mysteries, I have to do so with a few big caveats. The top-down dark view the game uses makes it extremely difficult to tell what you're looking at to the point where half your time is spent bumping up against big gloomy objects. The day/night cycle isn't clearly defined so you never know when night is coming and you need to get back to your base, though I'm not sure it matters since there doesn't appear to be any penalty to dying so you might as well use it as a sort of quick-travel to get home. Combat is pretty clunky to the point where it feels awkward and punishing in a way that has nothing to do with difficulty.That said, the atmosphere and mood are absolutely stellar, especially in the opening prologue of the game, and the character artwork is amazing. It's clear that there's been a lot of thought towards making this a tense and difficult survival simulation with a real story to it, and it's a story that's a genuinely intriguing one too. The concept of exploring, hunting, scavenging, and barricading is solid, but at the moment my concern is that it seems like the biggest emphasis has been on style instead of polishing the gameplay mechanics. Yeah, I know, it's Early Access. I funded this last year. But playing a game, even a game that's intended to be a difficult one, shouldn't feel like an uphill battle where the game is fighting you instead of challenging you. With tweaks to its UI to provide more helpful feedback and a less obtuse combat system, Darkwood has a lot of potential, and I hope it lives up to it.			"

								EARLY REVIEW (Subject to change)Update: 4/10/2015 build 4.1 AlphaThe game is coming along nicely. With each build come new improvements to everything across the board. By now it can be hard to tell that this is not a finished product! Please help fund it. Buy it now while it's ""finished"" but under construction and help a cult classic come into being.---I waited since this was announced on Greenlight, and boy was it ever worth the wait. First off, the ATMOSPHERE. It is amazing. I didn't think a top-down experience could really capture it so well, but it does because you can see the environment around you, sometimes eerily twitching or waving if you aren't looking at it directly. You can hear the wind, an occasional shriek, eerie ambience and the occasional crunch of a branch that might make you jump. Be careful, the noises you make can attract horrifying things, and the oppressive environment makes that delightfully clear the moment you see it. Who knows what might be hiding behind those wavy branches in the background?Next comes the exploration. Getting lost is VERY easy to do, so once again the location and feeling of real fear is stressed by this risk. You must make it back by dark or you will die, so be sure to know your pathway back, and hope to high hell there aren't any -things- to block your path on the way back. Look for materials for crafting, barricading, repairing or boiling mushrooms into a drug of sorts that gives you skills (A sort of leveling system). Craft a weapon immediately when you find what you need. But even with that, you're bound to want to run and hide from most threats.The characters that I have seen so far have also been extremely interesting. Well designed, excellent art illustrates them and unsettling dialog helps highlight what remains of the populace in this story.HOWEVER, there -are- bugs, as to be expected from an alpha, and the best way to play is just to expect the unexpected and report something if it blocks your progress, quit and reload. The dev team is very on top of everything and listens well to the playerbase. With the arrival of Alpha 2.0, it's clear they love their game and are serious about making things better for the players.Ending thoughts - Worth a buy if you like to support indie development and love a good, unique horror game, because there really isn't anything else like it out there, and you'd be supporting something great.NOT worth a buy when not on sale if you can't tolerate bugs and would rather have a finished product, but this one's going to be a hit. Grab it if it happens to be cheap at the time.This is something worth supporting. There aren't many indie teams out there with such passion for their product, and I believe it's already showing with each small patch.So far: 8/10, and only because of bugs and missing features.			"

Early Access Review
								The game currently is excellent in what it tries to do. In regards to other games within its category, there is still a lot to be desired. There really isn't this sense of an active world, but, rather, set pieces that are very nicely done. Characters are interesting and I enjoy the look of em, but they never really do anything within the world. Combat feels nice. Atmosphere is excellent. I do have issues with the mandatory well mechanic in which you must drink from your specific well to not die. This prevents really any long term exploration or, what i would call, travelling and living as a nomad. It also seems rather arbitrary as no one else appears to have to undergo this same process despite also having wells <all broken>. There is also the issue of having nothing to do when waiting throughout the night. My experiences have either been immense boredom <which happens when the night noises become routine> or small moments of stress at later nights. But, for the nights, there is never this sense of productivity, just waiting. As it stands, for what it wants to be, it is excellent. Would I play it over games like Pathologic? No.			"

								This game is scary and very fun. The random nature of the chests and inside content keep you glued to exploration. You always want to keep searching in the deepest, darkest parts of the game to see what will come next. The story is nicely creepy and entertaining and doesn't seem to hinter the play in anyway; which is very important to me. Some early access glitches were extreamly annoying but thankfully the game is fun enough right now to somewhat ignore them all. The constant steady updates are also a refreashing change compared to most early access junk. All in all, not a bad game and I don't regreat buying the game. It's definitely one of those games you'll quit playing for awhile so that when you come back to it, you can enjoy it all over again.			"

								To give you an idea of what this games like it took me three tries to survive the first night. Finally I was able to scrounge up enough wood and nails to baricade a door and window and fashion a makeshift nailboard. I spent the night huddled up in the dark listening to the sounds from outside, jumping at small movements. Just when I thought I would make it there was a terrific crash as something began to batter down my baracades. I had no choice but to stand there, board raised waiting as the barricades duribility ticked down. But at about a quarter strength something happened there was a new growling from outside and what sounded like an attack. The beating on my barricade stopped and when morning came and I went outside there was just a few bloodstains outside the window. Terrifying sound design.			"

								From my experiences of playing the Early Access (Alpha) verson of Darkwood is suprising really good. Yes I've copped a few, well not really jump scares but spooks as in loud sounds and hearing of things around in the woods. I'd love the smoothness of the gameplay, and the graphics for the bird eye perspective is really good. I'm digging into the storyline of the whole game so far (not gonna tell any spoilers, sorry). What they hopefully will do in the completed game of this is you could able to build your own shelters in the woods, like Minecraft. Get wood, make the walls for the house, make a chest/wardrobe, make the windows or door barriaded (sorry for the spelling), and just other things that make the game more interesting and more intense as well.Overall, I'm really enjoying the game I think it's well made and, in my opinion it's one of the best Alpha games I've played in a long time. I'll give it 10/10! Good job guys! :)			"

YouTube™ Video: Darkwood Gameplay (CollegeBudgetGaming) 

			Views: 73		

			Here is a basic look at the game Darkwood. I really like this title because it's difficult enough to put up a challenge and be rewarding without being too unforgiving.		

First off, I was apprehensive purchasing this game in Early Access; however, I am not disappointed in the slightest. This game has a lot of content for being just recently greenlit. It's very hard, which provides the challenge that I love. It includes the ever growing genre of survival, where you have to collect and craft items in order to continue. Very little information is given and there is absolutely no hand holding, so if you like dicovering things on your own, then this is a title for you. Otherwise, I would recommend another game if you get frustrated easily.			"

								Few games have been able to invite the sheer terror that this happens to provoke. The sound design is fantastic, and it helps to convey a sense of impending doom during the night sequences, when you're hunkered down in your choice of shelter. You can hear the beasts skulking around in the rooms around you, banging on barricades, stepping on creaking floorboards, and howling into the dead of night, while you remain huddled in a corner, wishing for the light of day.It's the night sequences coupled with the pitch black segments that really make this game for me. The lack of light, and the removal of your field of view really makes every moment incredibly tense. Coupled with the hectic, brutal combat, moment to moment decisions are crucial to your survival. For an early access alpha game, Darkwood has an incredible amount of potential. I'm truly looking forward to what the devs have to offer in future iterations.			"

But at about a quarter strength something happened there was a new growling from outside and what sounded like an attack. The beating on my barricade stopped and when morning came and I went outside there was just a few bloodstains outside the window. Terrifying sound design.			"

								Want a game that will make you jump from your chair, this is it! Can you take it ? Dark, Tense, Horrorific, Mystery and at the same time very challenging game. This game isn't easy at all, and if you are scared, is even worst. The game still in Alpha but there is value in it, and a promissing future. I didn't jump from my chair in a long long time, I love the game as much as I hate it, but as much as I hate it, I keep coming back, because I want to solve it, I want to finish it, I want to unravel the mystery. This, is the meaning of a good game, it trap you, it kills you, and it give you a reason to come back for more. A true horror game !			"

								An amazing dark game about survival. Darkwood succeeds in creating a unique atmosphere by combining great gameplay and sound. Despite being a 2d game it can still scare you in more than enough situations. Inside the game there are plenty of hidden clues waiting for you to discover them in order to unravel the lore of this great game. All of these create an amazing experience you should not miss. I definitely recommend this game, you should buy it if you have not already, but beware, it's a hard, hard game that will haunt your dreams :).If you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, then please consider following my curator page.

								Let me first say that if you are not fond of hard games, this may not be the game for you. The game has a rather steep learning curve for first timers... But for those who brave it and learn from it, I assure you that you will thuroughly enjoy this game. Suffice it to say, your character may die in this game... perhaps a lot in your first play through. Though, like dark souls, every 'death' is a learning experience, and this game rewards persistance. Matched with an environment as creepy as its well-told story, the Devs have truly outdone themselves with the creation of compelling (and very disturbing) characters shown in a world full of danger. You will quickly need to learn how to survive and, for the sake of maintaining the resorces you find, find tricks to keeping your character alive. The fact that this game is still in Alpha is, for me, among the most exciting factors of the experience. In and of itself, the game has run without flaw from me, save a few minor easy-to-avoid/get past glitches that I have seen in many slelf-proclaimed 'finished' games. Just so, the thought of MORE being added to this game in every aspect pleases me greatly. This is a game well worth both attention and support... And heck, why not have a GREAT time playing what they have thus far while doing both of these things?			"

								Those impatient people writing bad reviews ""game is cashgrab and devs dont work on it. 2 years and no chapter 2, no progress is being made"" are dumb. DONT LISTEN TO THEM!here is brief history of the Alpha changes to this date:first wave- map is only one region, chompers everywhere, maddening death systemsecond wave- crafting system was fleshed out, night gameplay was reworked (several times), map grew in size and regions were added. morning event was added. another reworks to nightthird wave-whole chapter 1 was reworked, all characters were re-written. ton of new (and some of them extremely huge and intricate) locations were added.upcoming fourth wave-rest of the game is being added which is reason for the long hiatus. game is basicaly doubling its amount of content in the next update.and now lets remember those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who are writing bad reviews and saying that devs do nothing. those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who bought game and ignored this bolded part of the EA description:""It is strongly recommended you ONLY buy the game if you want to influence the development. Otherwise, please wait for the final release.

								This may update as time goes on.1st impressions (way before this came to steam); it looked brilliant. First time into the game before literally moving about in the tutorial; incredible. I had honestly never been so terrified in a 2D horror game like this in a long time. It is old school horror, something I praise so much to see and you absolutely feel frozen fromthe sounds, atmosphere and the unknown this game offers (I literally was pulling my hair during my first night, screaming ""what the hell are those sounds, is it coming, please don't let it get me!"") Playing into the game; the tutorial helps you a lot with the rope and it's straightforward. It even allows some freedom on experimenting before continuing (had fun testing out some items before the tutorial ended). First time playing, you have the freedom to follow the story (which I have to say is very interesting and I am curious just to go through it completely) and/or survive as long as possible in the Darkwood. The more you play, the more you learn how to adapt to survive. That hasn't frustrated me at all and with each death I endure by whatever is roaming the forest, I come back wanting to do better in survival. And mind you, this is still an early access game and there is a lot more I believe I'll be learning from this game. Darkwood, hands down, is by far for me, the best survival horror game I've ever played. If that alone isn't enough, here is a list of what happened to me and what's cool to me:* The characters you meet, are brilliantly designed and creepily cool! Every one I've met so far, I really like them! Especially the guy who you can give parts to (exhaust plug, wheel, etc)! :D* I tossed a flare onto some posionous, flammable vines, caught on fire by it, bandaged myself quickly to dull the burn effect, went in to jump in my seat to see a rabid dog inside the very room the vines were protecting. BEAT IT TO DEATH in a panicked state.* One night, I thought I heard someone was WALKING INSIDE MY SAFEHOUSE. Next morning, I look around to find my windows still barricaded and nobody around. I KID YOU NOT!* Another night, some BIRD SHADOW CREATURE appeared right in front of me. I screamed so hard in my seat and whacked it with my nailed plank to see it reduced to ashes. Since then I have been ramming my brain how it got inside.* Longest time: 5 days. Had some ravenous antlion thing coming through my barricaded window and just waiting in front of me, taunting me first before the kill. I just begged it to get it over with it!10/10. Death galore. :D			"

Early Access Review
								This review is an early access one and will be subject to change as time goes by.So, Darkwood, its somethin alright.I've first bought this game on a lovely sale I think sometime back in 2014? Close to the release date? I'm not sure. Maybe I watched a youtuber play it and I bought it at some point. I dunno. But at any case, I've realized after all this time, I've spent about a full day total onto this very game. So, its appropriate enough for me to begin reviewing it.(Note, this may contain spoilers so if you dont want to risk it, dont read.)Darkwood is a top down perspective survival horror game. Though it gives limited vision, meaning you have to look all around you and be on your toes because this gives a sense of anxiousness. You dont know what might be across the field next to you, and you wont know that you're about to back into some poisonous mushrooms. This gives off an interesting feeling when you play the game, having to be purposely alert like in FNAF. The first one anyways, but I digress.Its focus on horror is mainly on my favorite, sound. You might hear footsteps in the distance, or at night you might hear some thumping noise or shreik just outside your door or barricaded window. You'll never know and thats what I love about it. The sound mixed in with limited vision gives such a dreadful feeling that something is there and you dont know if you should look or not.  Like at one point at night in this reviews more recent playthrough, I was minding my own business, just trying to wait the night out before I saw a light and noise just outside my house that was out of my characters vision. It was new and weird, so I went to investigate, and it was some kind of creature with red all around him, before it unfolds its arms and then releases birds/crows from under him before disappearing. This immediately got me nervous and I love that there is something that might be dangerous yet you dont know what it is. I love this fearful feeling. The combat.....its okay. Its a little finicky to handle because you have to wind up the attack all the way before swinging. And you dont get guns or things like that till mid game, but its a long way from where you would be depending if you're new to the game. I did find it annoying to having to wind up the attack all the way, making it difficult to judge when to swing. But thats just me. Maybe thats how it should be.The story wont be spoiled here, but I can try to describe it as best I can without spoiling. To me, its incomplete. But thats because its in early access and all.Speaking of, for an early access game, this is a long♥♥♥♥♥early access. I feel that the developers could put more time and energy into speeding the process up because this ambitious project is very, VERY ambitious. Tough to tackle too what with all that goes on in developing games. Though its none of my business, I would say that something like a kickstarter or funding program would greatly help get this game noticed more, and then get the support it needs to hurry its way out of early access. Because at this point, it might be in early access for a long long time, what with what they need to do to get all the story and game together.All and all, this game is one of my favorite horror games to this day. Though at first I hated it because trading was such a mess, but now with all that it is now, its at least fun, while at the same time challenging. And every time the developers FINALLY update it, its always a fun update to make me come back and play some more. Even though it makes my save game invalid due to the update, causing me to restart, it still feels worth it to see all the things they add into it. I give these guys my full support because what they got here is one of the most fun, exciting, heart pounding horror games I've ever played. The dreadful feeling of hearing a monster growl or make some sort of noise quickly makes me alert and at the same time, scared. All and all, if you crave a horror game and have a lot of time to spend (Seriously, you might spend quite a bit of time into this per session) while at the same time needing a new and fresh idea for a horror game, go buy this one. There wont be any regrets.Bonus: MAJOR SPOILS By the by, that one section where I had to go into the chapel and move around a literal horde of sleeping monsters was the most terrifying and unfavorite section of a horror game I've ever played. Please make more scary things. <3  "

Early Access Review
								I bought this game almost as soon as it came out, and it's great to see how far it has come since the very early days.This game is exactly the kind of psychological horror that is missing from a lot of horror games these days. I have heard a lot of people complaining (before they even got the game or have seen what it's about) that the top-down view makes it not scary, that it would take away from the experience.That is absolutely not the case.The way the horror is portrayed is not so much through what you see, but rather what you imagine. This may sound silly on paper, but it is absolutely true. This also goes with games like the earlier Silent Hill games, Amnesia 1, etc. The top-down view I think works perfectly, and I would even argue that any other perspective would lessen the experience.The biggest way the horror is brought across is through the sound design. Honestly, whoever you are, whoever made those sounds that make me me want to twist the screen of my laptop off like a bottlecap and move somewhere else, you aren't human. The nights are the absolute worst part of the game, and I mean that in the best possible way.Alright, I know I'm rambling, but I just really wanted to gush about this game somewhere. So yeah, it's OK.(And yeah, I know I haven't been playing for that long, I can only play for a little while before I get overwhelmed and have to drink some bleach.)			"

								When i first started the game up, i did not care for the intro gameplay and went straight in to the actuall game. On day two i encountered a red chomper and thought it was a random newbie creature and died the same night or so by banshee babies. I thought the game was to freaking hard and gave it a negative thumbs down and some rambling review comments. But i was wrong, the game is doable. It is still a very hard game, that casual players will find problematic to rush through. But that is a good thing, that some people dare to make games that does not target every possible gamer out there, in order to make money.A problem that consists with many ""similar"" games, is that random will kill you. In this game, there is such a good enough mixture of random and none random, that you can not blame the game entirely when you screw up. This is a solid game though still in alpha. There are a few bug issues but i have not seen anything close to major. My only beef with the game so far is some lag after a particular encounter. But i hope that is something that is due to it still being alpha. Anyone who likes survival horror games should have this one. It might not be a game for the average gamer or gamers that are mostly in to action.			"

								Darkwood is a deeply atmospheric, punishing adventure survival game, with a surreal and dark Eastern European theme. For being a top-down game, it has gorgeous graphics that make the most light and shadow to give the game world texture, and the visuals are backed up by excellent and skillfully used sound effects that give you a reason to turn up your speakers. Gameplay is harsh, and random, and a healthy dose of caution is required doing most anything. It's a good game to play around in the sandbox or pursue the story elements, but which ever you do, it will be a shadowy and blood-soaked nightmare of an experience. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes horror, adventure, survival or RPG games, or any mix of them. The difficulty IS an acqired taste though, be forewarned.So far in Early Access, I've experienced no crashes and only a few minor to moderate bugs. Darkwood is up there in the ranks of Early Access games who had their♥♥♥♥♥♥together before they came on Steam.			"

								My previous view on this game changed for the better :). Alpha 7 really done great for this game and its good that the game is still in developement. pros:- hard but rewarding- added tutorial- more content like crafting, better storyline npc's and monsters- many concerns were adressed: now firearms work well and controls are more responsive- sense of being lostcons:- many useless items that have no purpose usually from previous installments of the game that can confuse players- the night mechanic was better in the past, you could choose to wander in the dark, hide near creek or in abandoned house in forest and now you NEED to stay in hideout just not to die. Now when everything in night survival is well figured out, a night is just plain boring.Generally, if you find this game in indie bundle of some sort for 5 bucks then buy, if not then probably wait for more content.

YouTube™ Video: Darkwood Gameplay: Spooky Dark | Darkwood Walkthrough [Part 1] 

			Views: 2,825		

			Darkwood Gameplay: Spooky Dark | Darkwood Walkthrough. Darkwood (early access) is a roguelike procedurally generated open world survival horror pc game.		

It's unbelievable how a top down perspective game can provide more tension and anxiety than a lot of first person view games. Darkwood does an incredibly job on the atmosphere, remarkable work on the sound which takes a huge part in that regard. The survival genre has grown making it more difficult to find games that stand out, Darkwood does it by delivering deep surreal experience and very, very shady. I won't say more for now to avoid spoilers.Pros- amazing work on the sound, even bumping at a chair provokes noises that make you cringe- tense and scary atmosphere from the start- there's crafting but...Cons- ...I would like the crafting system be more ""discover able"", as long as you have the ingredients on you, the crafting result will show up for you to click and craft			"

								=|Heads Up|=The Time spent in game has a reason. No, I have not played it anywhere but steam. I am just a big damn coward.=|Review|=So, I have seen this game played by Markiplier. And I found it quite interesting but not all that scary. I mean sure it had its scarefactors but not that much on video. So what happened? Why did I only play this game for not even an hour? Well, I did not get far. And by that mean, I got into the tutorial,♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants and uninstalled and refunded the game. Because, god damn, it was that good at scaring me. See, I am usually not the type of person that gets scared by simple imagery. I have quite wild dreams in terms of horror. I enjoy it a lot. Being scared, helpless. Thats the feeling I tend to enjoy in these games and stories. Having to play this game however made me not only realise that I just cant play it but also made me remember one specific dream where I, and that for the first time ever and never again, woke up because the dream was that scary.And this game is on the same level. I got into the tutorial at first and all was good. And weirdly enough it followed the same specifics of my dream. So then I went towards the next and suddenly woke up in that dark shack. And holy balls, the athmosphere! I tried to give it my best shot. I tried to take it but I couldnt. I played just for a few minutes and, even though nothing happened at all, the athmosphere scared the s*** out of me. I didnt see a monster, I didnt hear a monster nor did I even see anything remotely scary. I only heard things. And that was quite enough for me to leave.So. Is this game good? Its quite effective for all I care so, yes. I mean, I refunded it but not because I disliked it. But because I will NEVER play it. No matter what the circumstances may be. But hey. If you want a game with an amazing horror athmosphere, go for this game right away. Because it scared me without even trying.			"

Single dogs that strayed from the pack. And the occasional savage guy who runs at me with a stick.[5:55:50 PM] connor conneely: Can you tame a dog[5:56:13 PM] Brett Gier: but sometimes, you see a savage. and you walk up to fight him for his stick. And then his head splits open sideways and he gets down on all fours.[5:56:20 PM] Brett Gier: those are the things i run from.[5:56:28 PM] Brett Gier: no, they've got like a plague[5:56:43 PM] Brett Gier: that like changes everything.

								i have been eagerly awaiting this game for some time now, all the trailers made it look like an amazing horror game(this is the first trailer i saw around a year ago)i am only a few hours in and i already restarted once because i was on day 4 and i had gotten myself killed in stupid ways every day and thus i had not even experienced the night time yet.....on my second play i have been a LOT more careful, i looked outside with torch on the first night and was almost killed by some kind of sword wielding monster i survived by running around my house like a chicken with its head cut off(after failing to even get close enough to hit it with a torch) and even around my house until day came. then the second night after i drank water i sat in a corner next to the door to the outside in the dark and waited, listening to the creatures wander around outside no weapons except 1 Molotov and some matches and an almost out torch. then the door slowly creaked open, i quickly slammed the door closed and ran further inside and hid next to the second door, my heart literally pounding, i did not hear any footsteps, although i could hear some kind of ethereal moan.... suddenly this door too flies open, i slam it closed and see a life bar appear on the bottom of my screen i run through the third door(that i had just repaired before night fall) and i pull out my torch to get a look at whatever is hunting me, it looks like some kind of slow moving shadow creature, as i start to figure out which way i am going to escape day breaks and the creature vanishes. i don't know if i have ever been more revealed while playing a video game in my life. i had to pause and go get a glass of water to calm me down. i am going camping tonight.... maybe i should have waited to start this game till i got back			"

								This game is very unforgiving and difficult. Every mistake can lead to your death again and again. There are times where I just want to throw my laptop across the room. But this is what I like about it, how I struggle to stay alive every day and night. But once I gather enough supplies, I go through each day with ease. I almost feel like I'm invincible and that feels good after all the fails. But this game always finds a way to bring you down.Overall: If you like a challenge, the fear of something killing you in the middle of the night, and mystery then this game is for you.			"

However, I always wanted to try it out since it first came to the Steam market, and with a deal going on the Humble Bundle, that possibility has become a reality.

								When I first started to play this game, I was completely absorbed in it, but then kept hitting wall after wall after wall.  I decided to wait until more of the game was listed as completed, and considering I've had it for almost a full year and they still have not finished the first chapter of the game, I cannot recommend this title.  Not sure what the hold up is, seeing as this game is about to hit its 2 year mark, but it's obvious that this is another flop when it comes to Early Access.  For $15 Early Access I expect a team of people to really keep plugging away at making this game something amazing as it seems to have the premise for becoming.  But as it is, I would steer clear of paying anything for this title and follow it instead to see how much progress is made in the next full calendar year.  My guess?  Not much.  It's a shame, really...			"

As time has passed the game has gotten bigger, better and more intense. I've put in about 8 hours into the game and even though that may not sound as much, it's been one of those games that you don't need a lot of time in it to enjoy it.Check out a series I did below.

								You know, taking into consideration all the crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥(pardon my language) going on in the Darkwood, I'm pretty sure that everybody is just tripping balls on Mushrooms and raw meat.I mean, just look at the facts:About the mushrooms: ""They look so juicy, so... delicious.""Mushrooms and the items that Essence can be extracted from are called hallucinogens.To gain Essence, the Protagonist must cook the Hallucinogens.Why the eff would you cook a god damn Embryo and Fetus or Baby of some random creature, for god's sake?Dosage one causes Shadows to appear in the darkness of night - a hallucination, perhaps.More advanced dosages seem to cause the Protagonist to pass out and enter a dream (The Grave and The Church).The only creatures that seem to be absolutely confirmed to attack and kill the Protagonist are Dogs and Huge Dogs, evidenced by the item Partly Digested Finger, which is dropped by Dogs and Huge Dogs which have killed the Protagonist before. This could evidence that all or most of the other creatures (perhaps aside from Savages) are hallucinations. Come on, where could you possibly think up a corpse that splits from skull to waist, or a red mass coming at you while you're outside of some kind of gas redius, without being on some kind of drug?Who could possibly tear out part of their body and leave it as a 'marker' or bait?Every subsequent dosage gives a positive and/or negative skill. He's boardin' up them windows. He's blockin' up these doors. He's attackin' these things.The Wolfman. How?Piotrek must be tripping balls - why the hell does he want to go to the moon, and what makes him think a rocket made of random scrap around a desolate inescapable forest would get him there?Speaking of an inescapable forest, it might only be impossible to escape because the dudes tripping on liquid mushroom and god knows what else are hallucinating the edges and subconsciously don't want to leave, knowing that they'll abandon all the drugs.Symptoms of the drugs: ""My body is changing. I can barely lift this pencil. I no longer feel hunger or thirst."" ""I'm too scared to sleep."" 'A mirror is talking to me.' 'I'm seeing♥♥♥♥♥♥' Shivers, fear, Weak Lungs, Healing, and Weakness in general?This mfin tree made out of corpses it talking to me. I'm gonna burn it.Later: WHERE DID ALL THESE BURNING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S COME FROM?!To conclude:Whatever the hell the guys in Darkwood are taking... I want some.			"

 My review to Darkwood So what makes Darkwood different from other games that strive to unsettle you? Well, for starters, Darkwood doesn’t hinge on jump-inducing surprise-scares for its sense of tension (though it promises its fair share of these moments, anyways). Instead, Darkwood places you in a procedurally generated forest in a deeply twisted perversion of Soviet Russia. From there, the game’s dismal lighting, grotesque ambiance, and overall eerie atmosphere create the horror themselves.darkwood horror survival game gameplayIn other words, Darkwood doesn’t rely on cheap scare tactics and bursts of adrenaline to generate its terror. Darkwood’s brand of fear is the type that starts as a knot of unease in your stomach, a knot that grows tighter with each door you push slowly open, with every backwards glance and each spectral groan that floats out of the fog. Darkwood doesn’t try to scare you in the traditional Western sense – it tricks you into scaring yourself.Of course, we can’t talk about innovation in the genre without looking into the very thing that made the game stand out to me in the first place – its choice of perspective. Where most horror games seek to attach you to the protagonist by making you look through their eyes, Darkwood is the embodiment of detachment. You look down on your character from above, your line of sight limited to the swath of your flashlight beam.This means that behind you, inside buildings, anywhere that your light can’t reach, is blanketed in darkness. Nightmarish things lurk outside the light, things that you will be forced to encounter as you drift through the corrupted forest. Whether or not you survive these brushes with the frightful unknown is entirely up to you. What Else? In addition to the top-down view, Darkwood introduces some more interesting ideas. Its design has been inspired by rogue-like, adventure, and role-playing games alike, giving it a unique and nuanced feel that it seems only indie games can achieve these days.Its diverse inspirations give Darkwood a well-rounded approach to the genre, providing something enticing for every flavor of gamer. Its RPG roots have inspired the developers to include a skill-tree to the game, allowing character diversification and specialization. The looting and crafting systems are reminiscent of many survival games, from Minecraft to Fortnite, but are presented in their own uniquely gritty ways. My Rating 8/10			"

								WHATthis is a surreal psychological horror game where you survive the wierd world that is darkwoodSTORYthe story is interesting and and quite dark ,but is just the first chapterCOMBATthe combat is tricky at first you aren't supposed to run in and buttonmash that will get you killed faster than you can say ""f*ck off!!!!!"". It is ment to be strategic and slow paced you attack when you have the opportunity: get one hit in, gtfo and wait for another chanceDAY/NIGHTnow the biggest thing about this game that makes it interesting is the day/night cycle. In the day you scavange for supplies and fuel to keep your hideout in shape and your generator running so you can progress to the next area and hideout. At night however it varies from nothing happening at all to your furniture flying all over the place to savages breaking down your baracedes DIFFICULTYat first it has a steep learning curve and i would suggest watching a lets play if you are held back by this, however if you are awesome you will just learn it through either trial and error or the wiki page in another tab while you are playingDEVSconstent updates keeps the game alive with gameplay changes bugfixes and overhauls the dev team has done a great job with keeping it fresh and i can't wait to see the full versionTHIS GAME IS AWESOME BUY IT NOW!!!!

Early Access Review
								Day 1...I have awoken in a room with a wolf, but he is a friendly wolf. He has given me some insight on the situation and told me about a crazy chicken lady who I shall seek out later but first I decided to look around my hideout to hopefully find a weapon.10 Minutes have passed and no weapon or anything useful. I hopped out my window to look for the well. I found it moments later but something else appears to have found me, something terrifying began staring at me with it's cold bloodshot eyes. We stared for what felt like hours until it scurried in my direction. I did the only thing I could...Turn and jump through the window. I thought I would be ok but I was wrong, it followed me so I jumped out the window to the outside and hurried into the generator room. I turned it on hoping it would deter the beast...It did, or atleast my hiding skills had made it loose track of me.A while past and I noticed it was getting dark so I headed back inside where I waited till the well was ready to be drunk.Finally the well was drinkable so I drunk as much as I could when suddenly I heard a loud noise so I hopped back inside, ran to the generator and switched it hoping to deter whatever it was.It's pitch black outside but my lamps are doing ok at keeping it lit inside. For safety measure I have placed a stool next to the window to make sure no one could possibly get in. I waited...And waited...I walked around the house aimlessly when suddenly I noticed the worst thing imaginable...The lights went out...I heard some inhuman laugh or noise, whatever it was I knew it was now coming for me, in hopes my hiding skills would once work again I hid in a corner... *Creeeeeeeeek* The door went as someone entered my house. *Cshhhhhh* went the stool as someone or something walked past it. The footsteps got louder AND louder AND LOUDER until they were inches away from me. *Shinkkkk* went the blade that cut, piercing my skin. I screamed and ran for the window where I hopped out and closed the door hiding myself once again inside the generator room. 'I'm screwed' I thought as I listned for any movemnt...I waited and waited until I noticed light beaming lightly through the hole in the wall. I went to the door and opened it...It was day...I survived...'But wait!' I thought. 'What if it was still out here?' And as thoughts raced through my mind I did the only thing I thought I could do. I ran for the chicken ladies house. I remembered it was east so I ran as fast as my shaking legs could carry me. But without focusing properly I heard the worst noise imaginable...'Cshhhh' went the sound of a few mushrooms crushing beneath my feet. 'No......' I thought. I almost began to cry but I thought that if I got to her house maybe, just maybe she will have something to help me. So I ran once again as fast as I could. I saw a structure. 'Yes YES!' I shouted. As I closed nearer my heart stopped...It was the pig place...I looked left and right furiously as I felt my legs about to give way. I turned and ran north as fast as I could but it was to no use. Within seconds my legs gave way and I fell flat on my face where I layed...To die....			"

								Ok, I am editing my review due to some negative reviews I have seen (Not many, but for people reading those some extra information is important.). Darwood is one of my favorite games. It is atmospheric, downright terrifying at times (My original review is at the bottom of this one talks a bit about this, it contains a couple spoilers but nothing too specific and it was meant to be more on the humorous side.) and the sound design is absolutely stunning. The FOV system really adds to the tension of the game. Now this game is already amazing! I have played through the game 3 times and loved it every time! If you like the concept support the developers! There are only 3 wizards on the project right now and they can't do everything quickly. Great games take time, some of the most popular game have multimillion dollar budgets with teams consisting of 100s of people. The darkwood team is only 3 people, don't yell and scream at them for not releasing your game early, this is THEIR passion project and early access is not a ""Get the game early"" it is a ""Play the game early, and give feedback for the final release."" I think the progress they have made is amazing considering the number of people working on the game.My original review is here if you want to read it:Warning: Contains minor spoilersWell I just barely finished the lynx quest, went through the doctors house and...Holy crap the roots. The roots fill me with raw fear. I don't understand it, in darkwood there is monsters whose entire BODY is split apart to reveal sharp teeth. And the roots scare me more. Why? Because I don't understand them, I don't know where they come from. I don't know how to beat them. The entire underground is filled with roots. Thats what it means, and that fills me with fear. Going into the church basement is also scary. But not as scary as the roots, the fear of the unknown. And this is why Darkwood is my favorite horror game:It has made me scared of trees.			"

								That game is awesome! It is a combination of Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, Amnesia and Hotline Miami. It is so atmospheric and immersive. Not only that, it is damn scary at times. I screamed more than once and not because of carefully crafted jump-scares either; these were emergent and organic scares with plenty of build-up in a distinctly non-linear world. Brilliant. The story is intriguing too. The difficulty however is the great part for me. No handholding (a decent tutorial in the form of a prologue but that’s it) and lethal enemies. It is extremely hard, which makes every victory, no matter how small, seem immense. Seriously, buy this game. There are $90 AAA titles without even a tenth of this game’s great design.			"

								I'd been following Darkwood for about six months before it was released. It looked very fun, very scary, and really hard, but not hard enough to prevent you from having fun. Man, was I wrong.This game is obscenely difficult. Resources are scarce to the point that, if you run out of a particular item, you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. Gasoline, arguably the most important resource in the game, is so low in number that its nearly impossible to divy it up between each gas-hungry tool that needs it.The ""scary"" part of the game, i.e. surviving the night, isn't scary. It's irritating. You are forced to sit in a dark room for four minutes, and if you move at all, you get wrecked by monsters with toothed-♥♥♥♥♥♥s for heads. If you don't move, nothing happens. It's either really boring or really stressful. Where's the fun in that?TL;DR: I REALLY wanted to like this game. I played it after every update to see what new additions had come with it. But it's just not fun. It never has been, and likely never will be. Spend your money on something worthwhile, like Undertale or Dungeon of the Endless.			"

								darkwood is a top-down horror game that idolizes usual survival elements, but this game is anything but usual whan it comes to the enviroments, chalenges and ovel-all experience. let me tell you, this game is brutal, I, being a more of an adaptive(casual <-> hardcore) gamer found that the game only stays within the player's comefort zone for a short while. during the day i was free to roam and explore (untill i found a pack of dogs) i found a very small amount of resources, and headed inside for the night. What accualy killed me was not a monser, but the fact that you need to drink form the well befor you buckle down for the night, or you will slowly die. This bothered me some as i didn't know i was supposed to fix the well, or i just didn't bother to pay attention to the warnings. I later awoke to find that i was the second say, I was disapointed to find that the buff i had worked for thorught gathering mushrooms was gone, but whatever i had found yesterday was still on me.my accual review? this game blew me away, I was expecting allot, but not this much. the gameplay was smooth, the lighting and enviroments are perfect, and i'm considering boarding up my bedroom window out of fear of a shadow monster crawling in. I was a little unhappy at first by the pixely graphics, but it didn't bother me at all later in the game. I'm having a great time playing this game and so should you. 4.75 / 5			"

								Explore. Run into dogs/creatures. Die to dogs/creatures. Lose all your mushrooms so that you can't get perks, and lose durability on weapons which makes it so that you can't explore anymore. Keep using supplies to make new weapons. Keep dying because ""exploring is fun"". Run out of supplies. Can't find any new supplies because you die 12 seconds in when looking for new locations. Get stuck with no way to explore/fight enemies when exploring. Can't progress through the game.Fun.			"

								You may think a top-down world couldn't envoke some sense of fear and terror. Darkwood does just that and is one of the best horror games I've played in recent memory. It's not your typical horror game, but it's certainly got a gothic/macabre feel to it and is by far one of the better games I've played this year.If you're itching to scratch that horror itch then you need to deep into Darkwood. It's wonderful.			"

								It haves naked hobos with giant sticks, naked hobos that trow rocks as Roger Clemens, giant sentient jaws with tentacles, screamers, dogs that always want to kill you, a furry, a lady covered in chicken poop, a kiddo that plays the violin so bad that is good, a more crazy version of Pee Wee Herman, and magic mushrooms that give you power ups (does this sound familiar to you?). This game is awsome. Even in the alpha state, its a good game. 8/10, but when its finished, it will be a 10/10 (i hope so).			"

								not my kind of game thats for certain, hardcore stuff, I am too old to have patience now.The game is good I'd recommend it to anyone who d dare a horror game with nice UI and gameplayAltough the game lacks some visual improvements, and leads, Im pretty sure the producers are already on it to bring solution for such issues with relative ease.The atmosphere pulls you in, excpects your full concentration, wants you to be cunning as much as possible, ever vigilant for anything that might become handy or any''thing'' that thirsts for your blood in your strives to live out another night. I wish I had the time and interest to play this a bit more, horror flows through it!Very well done game.			"

								An unfortgiving game that does not hold your hand.  Lots of mystery involved in a setting with strange creatures.  The artstyle is great and fits the atmosphere.  Even for Early Access the game in its current state offers a lot of content and stable gameplay.  Highly recommend if you like difficult survival horrors with a dark mysterious tale.			"

								I love the theme; it inspirably leads me into the creepy atmosphere, which is really my favourite. Although I have some prob to play this below, I have to recommend this.Here is my problem. I'm not sure that this is only my mac prob though, my macbook pro retina is unstably rolling its cooler, and in 50% of chances, the game is shuted down (just it stop the screen, and never come back normal) even before my death; I CAN'T play the game for fun with my mac. (Simply, start the game -> wait for map building for few 'minutes' -> get out the shelter -> find another house or encounter some enemy -> died or shut down -> press my bloody booting button to force-shut down my mac.)I HOPE this is only cuz of my old retina macbook pro, and the next version of this game is much stable on mac as well.

								Ok, Misture a atmosfera de trevas e medo do desconhecido do Silent Hill, com a jogabilidade e um mundo (que quer te matar) de Don't Starve.Resultado:Um jogo de graficos simples, jogabilidade estabanada (pra piorar o seu medo de luta), uma história complexa e cheia de segredos, um mundo em estado apocalíptico, um sistema de habilidade ultilizando da flora de uma floresta sinistra com efeitos colaterais (que dificultam ainda mais a sua sobrevivencia).Darkwood trás aos seus jogadores a realidade de quão frágil e instintiva uma pessoa fica em uma situação de extremo numa floresta macabra, tentando sobreviver dentre os turnos diários dentre pilhagem/Dia e sobrevivência/Noite, é notavel a dificuldade de luta nesse jogo trazendo ainda mais à realidade situacional de alguem tentando sobrreviver em  condições de fraqueza, multilação, e mutação (Se você quer um entreterimento de click/kill, não lhe recomendo esse jogo).Recomendo pessoalmente este jogo a pessoas que procuram uma sobrevivência complexa ao terror da noite, e uma historia repleta de surpresas e atrativos macabros.

								Great atmosphere, probably the creepiest 2D I've ever played, And just the right amount of pixel resolution to give both a detailed but 16-bit feel. The game is hard and doesn't hold your hand, you will get lost and die. But the controls work well for top-down view its just a matter of finding weapons before night hits you. Its currently in alpha but still plenty of game-play to be had at this point. Give it a go if your a fan of DAYZ, amnesia or generally hard indie games like binding of			"

								Ok, the game is brillant; why I don't recommend it: Because it's still in alpha; I was waiting for this game to be finished for ages now. The devs are always working on it, alpha after alpha, that's OK; but some day this game should be released properly or shouldn't it?I somehow get the feeling, when it's finally finished, I don't want to play it anymore, because it doesn't interest me then.This game is rather hard/difficult; I don't want to invest time in a game that's not polished.So, if you want to be part of the neverending process of developing a fantastic game, buy it. If you are waiting for a finished game, keep waiting and buy it then.(And: I already played this game before I had a Steam account; so I have spent much more time than you might think looking at my hours here. I just visit the game regularly to find out, if something significant has changed.)And: just my opinion, but I don't think an early access game should be an incomplete game, my understanding until now always was, that an early access game is a game that has still some flaws and some details are missing. But, only half the content or etc.? That's just crap.			"

								I bought this on a lark because I like games like Metro and the STALKER series and I wanted more survival horror in my life. I play with permadeath on because anything else is for babies and children with thyroid disorders. I went to bed frustrated last night because I couldn't manage to get into the next zone, past this cottage, and restarting was feeling tedious.Last night I dreamt of a drowned woman chasing me, asking me if I knew how bad it must be down there that she'd claw all the way back up here? Then I awoke to an invisible presence gripping my hands and weighting me down. Then I actually woke up.10/10			"

YouTube™ Video: ➜ A Quick Look @ 'Darkwood' 

			Views: 109		

			PD recommends Cheap Games here: https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/paradisedecay Many thanks to the Dev's for the Review Copy! I take a quick look @ 'Darkwood' A superb isometric horror survival game.		

This has all the elements you would expect from such a title. I'm not normally a massive fan of this genre, but I loved the atmosphere generated and the art style involved. I don't think a tutorial is required as you learn via references which you simply highlight, click, drag and examine. Most of it is common sense logic and the crafting system is superb, it will only highlight craft-able objects if you have the required materials and objects. Overall I'm really impressed with this title. - Highly Recommended!			"

								Gave this game a new try but still boring and after waiting for months feels like there is not much hope for this coming for a full game.. I recently have  been really negative to games who are still EARLY ACCESS after 2 YEARS.. it feels like no one cares if this game come out as a full release but there is many games as The Forest, and other survival games. I have owned this game for 2 years now and I have to say that lets wait a next 2 to 6 years and lets see does this game then have something that actually keep the new and old players active. I know I get lots of negative comment down but this is just my opinion and to all of you developer has been nice to me so I dont judge him or his team, but the main point is this game is not ment for me so might work for you.
