Once Upon a Time, when the gaming community was young, and coptures - old, game developers had the guts to try and put some new and truly unique stuff into their games, rather then just copy - paste a single successful formula for every given genre. Giving this game a try, you will learn why, and come to appreciate the fact these good old times have past. This game used to amaze back in the day, it was the first time gamers were given a try to play an RPG that doesn't blindly follow the ""knight in shiny armour killing the archdemon"" cliche. The graphics rocked (in 2002), the feeling of flight on your own set of wings, and the ability to dive down and catch your rival to have a bloody snack up in the air were amusing. BUT back in the day we were used to having to relearn and remaster the controls for every new game that we played, we were used to having to deal with clunky controls and some minor inconveniences in the overall gameplay. The tradition of implementing high quality, touching stories with complex characters had not yet been settled in the industry. We loved games mainly for their gameplay and the fresh experiences they brought us.Today most games deliver several genres in one pack, like shooters where you can fly a plane or ride a car e.t.c. The things that made this game look cool more than a decade ago are fairly trivial for the modern gamer, while the flaws look outrageous. The game has an unappealing story, the quests are boring and repetitive (go to an area kill all the monster, then go to another locations and do ""the exact same thing over and over again""), the controls are oldschool (clunky + underworked = inconvenient). This game is bad by all modern game standards, but this game was developed in the times when those standards were only a work in progress. Summary:  If you are a player from back in the day, taking the low price of the game to notice, you might want to take a glance to the past with this one, it might be a useful experience. Or if you are new to gaming and want to feel how it realy was to play them ""good old games"" you might want to get it while on sale. In other cases take a second thought before you press the ""buy"" button.			"

												The game was initially released with files missing, which has since been fixed. What you have now is a wonderful RPG where you get to play as a mighty dragon. I played this game quite a bit over the years and was very surprised to see it pop up on steam.The I of the dragon is quite relentless in its default difficulty (5) but can be adjusted to either 1 or 10. I do not recommend putting it higher as the game was clearly not properly designed for it. The game is rather slow paced by default and turning all enemies into tanks that just take way too long to kill is not fun, only tedious.There's 3 different Dragon classes; Necromancer, Mage and Warrior, the latter focussing on its fire breath over magic use. Each class has unique skills and specializes in different stats (which are cheaper to level up). The necromancer ends up being the middle ground class with some summoning options.As you level up you can spend points on stats and purchase spells (for said points). Its up to the player to balance it out.Spells in this game are quite awesome and deserve to be mentioned seperatly. There is a wide range of spells and with the ability to litterally summon mountains and giant craters you can terraform the land around you quite dramatically impacting enemy movement as well. Yes after some time the land will turn back to its original state but it takes quite a while and it looks impressive. Really makes the player feel powerful.However, as for downsides; There are a couple of segments in the game where you are forced to play as other characters and these segments are just plain terrible. There's no way around it, they should never have made it in the game. However they happen relatively late and can be finished somewhat quick with some practice.Overall,  if you like the idea of controlling a mighty dragon that grows incredibly strong over time, get this game. Yes it's a bit dated but the game is unique enough that there really isn't a better modern alternative. This IS the best dragon RPG out there.			"

												Full Disclosure: Re-released game, bought original and bought Steam version during $2 sale. Big fan of GOG.com.I bought this game back in 2004 and played it then. It was alright, especially since games that let you play as a dragon are few and far between. Yeah, it got fairly repetitive since the majority of the game is hunting down monster spawners and killing then, usually via fly-by attacks. (Would've been better if they used mouse-based flight a-la Freelancer since you use said mouse for some controls. And yes, Freelancer came out before this.)However, this is no longer that game, and even at $2, I can't recommend it. The controls are still awkward, but now they're worse since you can't remap the keys unless you use a fan-made patch. Also, the game has a CTD problem trying to play the opening movie unless you delete it, and trying to rotate the camera is especially painful as sometimes it starts moving right away, and sometimes it takes up to a full second before it even starts moving. If this was turn-based, it'd only be annoying, but this game is very much action-based. (This is also fixed with a fan-made patch.)The devs have already gone on record saying that there won't be any patches or improvements to the game as they have lost the source code. Look guys, if you don't have the source code and/or can't fix any problems that arise with the game, DON'T RELEASE THE GAME. The gameplay has gone from ""not bad"" to ""broken mess"" simply because these issues can't be fixed due to being unable to update the game for modern systems. The saddest thing is, GOG.com has set a standard for updating old games, and this falls well below it.Fix the controls so somebody doesn't need three hands to play the game/restore the ability to remap keys, fix the CTD issues, and the lag when trying to rotate the camera, and this game might be worth the asking price. As it is, this game is a broken mess and despite the graphics not aging well, it might be worth playing again.EDIT: BTW, those review scores up there at the top of the page from Actiontrip and Gameshark? Those are from the '04 edition. The Gameshark site isn't even around anymore.			"

												First Question: Is this game worth buying? Well yes, for us old people it is fun to play games with sub par graphics that are from 2004 (correct me if i am mistaken). Really don't expect this to be anything like super fancy and spyro like, don't expect graphics to which you can actually see teeth on the model. But, this is not for people who want things that have more options to being a dragon such as landing or interacting. This is more of I am going to burn and destroy every living thing I see. Second Question: What is Gameplay like?-You fly around.-You make human towns because apparently women aren't pooping babies fast enough or the babies are getting eatten by Diablo...-You never land because you are magically suspended into the air.-You get hit by the most annoying enemies and have to use your manuverbility to actually fly around and avoid being hit. Hint: just fly up and down :)-Somehow I get shot out of the air by a blast of fire that I have no clue where it came from O.o-It is still challenging dispite you fly around and burn stuff. P.S: You have spells because you a bloody magical dragon. -You have 3 classes of dragons only.-The graphics are that of N64 and PS1.-Also I get to eat food on the go!Third Question: Why write this review? I am a friggin dragon.Also I think it deserves a review that just because it's not like modern day games doesn't mean it isn't good. For it's time it was pretty cool, but just remember that older games had a weirdness of being simpler yet fun and straightforward such as Fate, Bejeweled, Diablo 1, Warcraft 1... and so on. Once again....As I said I wouldnt recommend this to people who want to interact with other things or do more complex actions than casting spells, burning monsters/spawners, and flying around. This is not a complex nor intense game. It's pretty straight forward but the balance of the game is slightly off and requires you to actually think and react to overpowered mobs shooting at you. Not a perfect game but like I said it's a cheap timewaster.			"

												A great game that is poorly released on steam.  The steam store is flat out lying, this game does not contain any english audio, in fact it does not even contain any scripts to trigger cut scenes for the game to even properly start.  If you directly buy this off the steam store and fire it up into a new game you will be met with a weird end game start, (You have access to end game areas right from the get go, which should not be the case).   If you want to play it you will have to download a few missing files that are available on the steam fourms other wise it is in an absolute unplayable state.			"

												While being very buggy and hard to control, it is still the game I always wanted to play. I wished there would be a sequel with fixed bugs, better controls, customizeable dragons and other features (like landing?) but there like like no demand and therefore I doubt that there will ever be a sequel.

												You get to RP as a dragon. That alone was enough for me to buy it. The game is a bit buggy, and already had to fix some of the bugs myself such as tutorial+dialogs not triggering, but I have definitly got enjoyment out of the game. It also has one of my favorite killing methods:

												This game is so great since I played on around year 2005-2006 and I love it!When I have been growing up, have own Steam, and saw this game on Steam...I'm feels nostalgic a bit. Too bad that I play this on Windows 7, everything is fine except for music problems, I don't care though. (I'm plays the musics on outside the game) The control is able to fix, I have been trying out by myself, but you need to have some search... Yeah, it is like normally when I'm played on 10 years ago.Well, you play as the Dragons. Fly around over the landscapes. Fight the Monsters. The humans are respect you!Also, I love the Dragons! :DThis game is totally worth for me!			"

Goods and contras: (+) Helpful Dragon. (if you like or think it’s interesting)  (+) Interesting control. (Flying)  (+) Colourful and nice landscapes. (View)  (-) Repetitive missions. (It wasn’t boring me)  (-) Low graphics quality. (For those who care)  (-) A few of voice actors just read their text. :( Crash, bug, glitch:I had three game crashes in seventeen hours. It was when I had played much hours with it. About 3-4 hours. Most of the negative review say it’s a crashing game. I had played with it Windows 7 64bit. The game doesn’t play the in-game musics. But, you can fix it with this: Workaround/patch for background music issue  My personally opinion:It’s a game where you as a Dragon have got a mission to save the world from the evil ‘Skarborr’ who wants to destroy the world. So, you would be a Dragon hero, opposite than the ordinary Dragon means. (Good Dragon) The game is nice. Neither awesome nor bad. = Nice. I enjoyed to play with it. The control was uncomfortable for me at first because I hadn’t flown before. I managed to used to it.  Recommendation:I think that those who like (or don’t care) play as a Dragon, and flying, and help to save the world could enjoy this game.  To the Achievement-Hunters:There are no achievements. You can play with it without Achievement-Rate drop-down.			"

												This game is just great. 8.5 of 10, even in 2017.You are a real DRAGON. You have dragon magic, you are strong, you fight as a protector of humanity. Game has a huge potential to be something more. But still - dragons in this game are MUCH MUCH better, than in Skyrim. Story is simple, acting if 50/50, gameplay has a lot of grinding.Game is not that easy, yet not hard too. It's well-balanced.You can play as a firebreating Annoth, icebreating dragon-mage Barroth or dragon necromante Morrogth. Every dragon has his own pros and coins, diffrent stats better suit one but not the other. For example - Annoth is a warrior like, Barroth is more like tactical-assassin gameplay, while Morrogth is a necromacer - a little RTS (without ability to command, only spawn units at your side).If you love dragons, want to play one where you can really feel like a dragon - this IS the game for you. It's the best game atm of every other games, where you can be a dragon - to play in.About ""steam crashes"" I had 0. My friend too. You can find some if you use cheats or mess with game, but without this - you're safe to play. Game will work correctly.Any devs reading this - please create a game like this, but with 2017 abilities!			"

												First of to say, this game is incredible, it's like one of those games where at first glance at the graphics you think is absolutely terrible but i am here to tell you otherwise.This game is the opposite of terrible, it's an absolutely amazing game, why it is, is because everything but the graphics is awesome the graphics themselves aren't too bad though considering the age of this game, but the gameplay is really good, the story is great, the audio pretty good and some of the sounds are funny and strange, there is a large range of enemies, animation is really well done and not to mention the camera settings as there is three one of them (which most players would like) is a eyes camera, where you are actually seeing through the eyes of the dragon which is awesomeSome would debate me and say ""pssh there graphics are terrible and so what if there is an eyes camera it's still bad"" but they are wrong, if you actually give the game a chance, I promise you, you will like it.So to finish of this review basically play this game it is amazingly good for it's time of creation and cheap for it's quality unlike other games where you do one thing throughout the whole game and just because it's graphics are really High Quality the game has to be $40. So I really recommend this game to all but especially to people that love dragons.			"

												I played and enjoyed the CD-ROM version of this game back in the day, but the Steam version is a mess. The default controls don't work well, and using a program such as Joy To Key won't help because the controls are already partially mapped (unsuccessfully) to a game controller. The game allows you to remap the keys... except that it doesn't actually work. The game doesn't save your changes.  But, worst of all, the game crashes almost constantly. I finally gave up on remapping the keys and tried to make do with the sub-optimal default key assignment, only to find myself booted out of the game and staring at an error message window roughly once every 1-2 minutes of gameplay. I really wanted to like this one because it brought back fond memories of the CD-ROM version. But, in the end, I decided that it just wasn't worth the effort and frustration.			"

												This is quite possibly one of my favorite games I've played in a LONG time. I never even knew this game existed till I stumbled upon it on the store for 90% off ($0.93 CAN.) Frankly any game out there that lets me play as a mother f***ing Dragon is usually always an instant purchase, as games like that are far and few between, and sadly most of them are not that good either. This one happens to be a mixed bag. This game does suffer from problems, and I will explain.This game is old, 2004. There hasn't been any work on updating this by the Devs, as according to the forums, the Devs don't have the source files. Thankfully though some loyal fans have made some patches to fix problems, like the music not playing, the intro movie not playing, not being able to change controls, slightly improving the graphics, etc. I've played both the normal and patched versions. I never experienced any crashes as stated by other people.My main gripe with it was the controls. This was the main reason why I never actually finished the game. I got tired trying to fight with the controls. The fan patch does help improve them, but I still found myself fighting with them when fighting harder enemies in the later stages of the game.In terms of the gameplay, you are a dragon. You fly around, using your attacks and spells to kill monsters and spawners, gain XP to level up to upgrade your stats and learn new attacks/spells, collect gems to gain more power to learn more spells, grab enemies and devour them, and f*** s*** up! There really isn't much for variety in anything though. You go to an area, kill everything, move onto the next, repeat. Some people may not like that at all.You have a selection of 3 types of dragons. Fire, Ice, and Acid. Each one has different starting stats, and a variety of different kinds of attacks/spells. Everything from Fireball, Ice storm, to summoning zombie minions, and even opening a giant fissure in the ground to kill your enemies! Each Dragon class also plays slightly differently as well. The Fire Dragon being the big Tank/Damage dealer, getting up close and smashing enemies with Fire based attacks. The Ice Dragon being more like a Sniper/Mage class with Ice/slowing attacks to freeze or take them out from a distance. The Acid Dragon being a Necromancer with Acid based attacks causing DOTS and summoning zombies to take the focus off of you.Now in terms of actually flying and battling, is very awkward. You move around by clicking where you want to fly, and your dragon to fly to the beacon you placed. Then attacking enemies you have to select a spell, and either click or click and hold to power up the spell. Most spells though will cause you to stop before actually attacking, causing you to attack then trying to move to avoid being hit. This tend to make the game feel very awkward for me, and kind of why I never completely finished the game.I played the game for about 8 hours before I added in the Fan-made patches. I highly recommend adding the patches.Pros:- You are a god damn mother f***ing Dragon!- Lots of good attacks/spells to use, that feel powerful to use.- Leveling system is simple to use.- Audio/Music sound great.- Has a much needed Tutorial.- Steam Trading Cards.Cons:- Very outdated graphics.- Controls are bad.- Audio/Video problems.- Extremely repetitive.- **Requires Fan-made Patches to make the game better.**- No achievements.If you can look past the problems, it can be a good game. Not perfect, but GOOD. When in doubt, get it on sale!6/10I will say though, because of this game it made me realize something. We NEED a new Dragon game!			"

Graphics Enhancement Patch (GFXe) and Guide

By: Hiten

			I've created this patch and guide in order for players to enjoy the full graphics capabilities of The I of the Dragon. There are many settings which are inaccessible in-game that provide a much welcomed graphics boost.		


 - better graphicshttp://steamcommunity.com/app/279720/discussions/0/517142253856588188/ - background music fixUpdate: There are 3 versions of soundtrack - one from worldwide release (my favorite), one from russian release and steam version. http://steamcommunity.com/app/279720/discussions/0/405692224244169702/ - if you want different version http://steamcommunity.com/app/279720/discussions/0/610574394230072551/  - discussion about access violation errorhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/279720/discussions/0/451850213947582937/ - discussion about crashes, besides, there should be no crashing if you pause before going to world mapStill, its worth it. Why? Dragon here is not a mount, its a main character, and really - powerful main character. Just killing machine, rather slow, so no fancy maneuvering, but it's big, killing machine. What about summoning great vulcano (one of endgame spells) right into enemy forces? What about building entire cities (thanks for artifacts) in 10 seconds (and that is actual game, not cutscene)? Gameplay may be repetitive after certain point, but i think this game should not be considered only as action rpg, but also as hack and slash, and thats another plus - h'n's with dragon instead of guy with his sword? Yup. Also, world is quite interesting, many different biomes, creatures (design of some monsters reminds me of Sacrifice - great titile btw, by reminds me i mean not direct similarities, rather general style, that there is something unique), characters, quite big maps even for modern standards (because they are open, no endless lanes or canyons like in drakan series, for example). Another + for progression system, for example: expanding mana is cheaper for ""mage"" dragon and more expensive for warrior; many, many spells/abilities to learn (different trees, depends on your character class), also dragon will change his own looks (from time to time) - how? that depends on which stats you focus. Ofc, all these things won't help if you just don't like old games, but for me it is great title. Not AAA, rather... lets say... ""mediocre""(well, maybe too harsh word), but mediocre with a soul.

												The I of the Dragon has decent graphics for it's time, is a neat game concept, and you get to be one of 3 different dragons. Each dragon has their own unique abilities and it's attribute points can be distributed any way you want. You can also build and maintain towns in an open-world, non-linear enviroment. All this sounds like an awesome game, but then you get to the ugly. There's no way to rebind the keys and the key layout is terribly weird and awkward. The game is filled with bugs, is unstable and crashes often. Crashes when you press the escape button, crashes when you level up, crashes when you open the game options, and crashes just flying around being a dragon. It's too bad that because of it's age, none of these issues probably will never be fixed.			"

This game is definitely added to my list of favorite dragon games and though I have not yet finished it, I'm looking forward to the end. Though it has a few bugs and the music doesn't play, there are no game breaking glitches and overall it's something fun to pick up and play. It's quite charming for an older game.10/10 Would play and eat a friendy villager again			"

 FOR EVERYONE WHO CRASHES WITH ESC, O, M - problem solved! Hey, i just got that game as gift from my lovely bf and it was my favorite game when i was a child, just read you have problems with ecs,o,map etc... When i was a child i couldn't find a way to play itwith these crashes but i kept to play at first map even without mobs but i've discovered when you just press P ( for pause ) then you can press M, O, ESC and everything what is doing crash. Guys i hope it helps and have fun its awesome game with awesome spells! CONTROLS AREN'T INTUITIVE? I know controls aren't intuitive, but hey, 9yo kid (me) could play like that and you can't? :DIf you have problems with reaching F12 itp... just put favorite spells at active ""spellbar"" hold alt and then click your at favorite spell. You can make queue of most powerful spells using alt+click on spell, then game will activate these spells when you want to attack and its able to being casted. I recommed it badly when you are playing as Barroth, because he is pure mage and doesn't need to use his fire.			"

												This game is terrible. Some of the worst controls I've ever seen in the game. The camera is oversensitive, goes flying around all over the place. Trying to change sensitivity doesn't help much. When putting the video settings to natural resolution, the UI is super tiny and unable to read. Controls are awful. It is a bunch of random keyboard buttons that make no sense. You have to use buttons on numbad and ""a"" and ""q"" for normal button controls. There's not much direction or story. The first level just has you farming kills of tiny little things which give tiny little xp boosts until you reach level 4. There are these crystals that you are supposed to be able to collect, but flying next to them doesn't collect them, and sometimes they are randomly absorbed, and other times not. It isn't explained what they do or their purpose. That's pretty sums up this game. If you  want to struggle with horrendous controls, awful camera, lack of story or direction, grindy gameplay and no fun, then this is the game for you.3/10.			"

												While 'The I of the Dragon' is a super old game I once got from a magazine I had subscribed I must say I would not buy this for the price it is on Steam for unless you have played it before. Nothing changed, the move-aim system still sucks Dragonballs and you must save repeatedly otherwise you get thrown back a lot- like, an hour or so. Other than that it's still fun to snack those little pests, eat humans that annoy me (who I should be protecting but w/e). On another note- I've read loads of bad reviews and comments on Forums about the nonexistend (or rather glitchy as heck) English translation. Please note that I play the original German game which is mostly neat if you ignore one or two spelling mistakes.If you like Nostalgia, wrecking♥♥♥♥♥♥as a Dragon in super bad graphics and strongass enemies- go for it. If you want this game for the gameplay or story without prior knowledge of this game- don't.			"

												It's clunky, it has bugs, but between the community and the current development team's efforts I think most people can get this game to work. I played it back in 06, and personally I think, with a little work on your end to configure it to your operating system, it's worth every cent.			"

												Really bad controls. Bugged - I have sort of this bug that pressing A/S or some other key is making screenshots... each minute I got couple of them. So annoying bug, as well as not triggering scripts to make progress in game :(Poor gameplay - why flying with mouse, instead of WSAD, that's so silly :(When you release the game, why you don't apply bug fixes that are PRESENT in other versions, released for example on GOG, Why devs, why?!?!

												To be honest, I never knew this game existed until I level up recently and got a coupon for 90% of a game called ""The I Of The Dragon"". At first I was either going to trade or sell the voucher, since it was indeed tradable, but my interest was peaked and I took a look at it. Not caring much for Action-RPGs, I was still inclined to sell it, but I decided adding a new game to my collection would be nice and it was a steal at only 70 cents with the coupon. Little did I know I'd find an obscure gem.This game has become one of my favourite old-school story-based games within the first hours of playing. It was a little repetative, yes; and the controls did irritate at times, always going backwards because a tree or hill was in the way and such, but it was really fun. There were a few sections in which I had the down the difficulty because it got quite extreme; being killed in one hit as the Warlord and Cultist, but overall the difficulty curb was nice and smooth.The voice acting was complete garbage, no sugar coating that. This was 2004, however, and I can give it a pass for that, especially since the low quality voice acting in this game actually is far better than a few select games I've seen from 2014-15.I played the Fire Dragon, as I always play a tank character in RPG games. It was a fun experiance, burning things and getting close combat in with the many monsters. The gorillas with homing shots did irritate me, but after level grinding a bit through invasions I could take them. By far my favourite part was the final battle against Skarborr because with the column spell I managed to launch him all the way across the map, which I found highly amusing as he'd fall back down floating and changing direction incredibly quickly, obviously annoyed.Can't really think of much else to say. I didn't find the low quality graphics annoying, since I'm used to early 2000's games like Age Of Empires. I just found it fun and I'll probably do a run as the other two dragon classes once I get some more free time. If you have a few extra dollars, I'd suggest this game.			"

												This was a lovely game back in the day, thats spoilt by bugs that force close the game when you either; start a new game, level up, you know... Play it. When I did get it working, it was withut the BGM, though I usually turn it off anyway, it was disappointing I had no option for or against it. ¬_¬If its possible to get the game working as well as it did back in the day, you'll find it an enjoyable gameplay, and at times I often forgot I was meant to complete objectives and just went around you know, being a dragon. I'd swoop in and pick off monsters one by one.  The game was challenging but fun and you could get lost in what you were doing in other words. The background story was fun I guess, and the only disappointment was that blasted mission where you play as the King or something and lost the ability to play as the dragon for a brief. But the bugs spoil any hance of recreating that fun I had the first time around for me.			"

												It's even nice, old game. Firstly, it's game where you are a dragon. No a rider, no a guy which can transform, but a dragon and this is rare and great. Graphics... it's old and not really pretty, but spells and projectiles effects are not bad. Music is ok, but when you install fan patch, because steam version has problems. In gameplay The I of the Dragon is mix of rpg and action. You can develop statistics of your dragon and buy new spells. Is better to play small session. You fight monsters, eat them, destroy they nest, built and defend human cities and thats it. There are 12 regions and you always do this. Flying and destroying can be fun, but after time it's get some boring. Game has a plot and quests, but they are not very complicated. Sometimes you control other character than your dragon.In sum, if you want to play a dragon it's worth to give it a chance :)			"

												I first played it at friend's house several years ago, and I loved it (even though I had almost no idea what was going on back then. Ehhh... Seeing it got me into nostalgia mode,Anyways graphics are quite good in my opinion (well it shows its age but I think it looks neat), I'm not really qualified to talk about diversity of environment, as I just left the first area. I remember that there were quite a few different ones (I still remember the crater from a meteorite in the desert area... I think it was in desert...) There enemies are quite diverse too.As for the gameplay: You play as a dragon. At the beginning you can chhose form 3 types (Mage/Warrior/Necromancer) each one has its unique traits (and appearances): Mage, as name implies relies mostly on magic to fight, has less lung capacity as well as lower fire power and has only one type of non-magic attack at start (Ice Breath - low range, can't move while attacking, freezes enemies) and getting more would be more expensive, but the spells are cheaper on the other hand, while Warrior(fire dragon) is the opposite and has fireball in addition to breath, later on receiving homing ""missile""(types of attacks are same for all,, but with different elements), while Necromancer(Poison dragon) is somewhat in the middle.the controls will most likely need a while to get used to (and even then are somewhat cumbersome), on top of that game is ridiculously difficult at times (getting surrounded by over ten enemies with homing attacks that take quite a chunk of HP away...). and clearing a location is rather tedious if there is no city, as the monster camps will be rebuilt if there are monsters left... and thet they will spawn more...But let's move on to more fun things: Spells! They are really nice, for example creating a mountain that damages everything (excluding the caster) when it is created, or ""geysers""- (relatively) smal fireballs flying randomly above ground that look quite nice(not that it is really useful. And another fun thing: Eating, yep, eating: You can just swoop down and grab a monster (or human) and eat it. I just cant get bored of listening of their shrieks whet they are being eaten alive...All in all it's quite fun game for short bursts of playing (as long as you don't reach one of very few moments when you are forced to control something else( for example a human archer) It's just a hassle. Fortunately these moments are few and far between.			"

You are practically greeted by ""look at your keyboard and see those buttons? - You will need all of them, in the most unintuitive and painful way imagineable, have fun.""I could live with the graphics, if at least the controls would allow playing the game, but they don't, which makes this neither worth money nor produces it any fun.A clear thumbs down.Oh wait! There are of course trading cards, grab those if you got the game for free, else don't bother.			"

												Let me tell you a little story: When I was about 14, my brother got this game on one of those cds that come free with gaming magazines. I really liked the look of it and borrowed it from him, most probably without asking first, I don't remember anymore. What I do remember however, is the fact that I absolutely loved this game.And yeah, maybe I was stupid and not able to recognize faults in games (which this game has plenty of in gameplay, vioce-acting and many other aspects), but I would have recommended it for the sake of nostalgia alone except...it doesn't work. I sometimes get lucky and actually get to play the tutorial level before it crashes.			"

												It's a decent game. It doesn't blaze trails into new domains, but it does stick with what it has, which is more than some games can say. I used to play it a lot when I was younger, and I'm glad Steam got their hands on it so hopefully it'll be fixed of it's problems. The dragon mechanics are some of the better ones I've seen in gaming, not the greatest, but it has good things going for it. The options aren't the greatest, and there are some glaring problems, but thankfully the main game can still be played pretty well now that it's been updated to the recent OS's. The game play itself is pretty simple, mass monster genocide and kill the evil baddie at the end while making sure humans don't blow themselves up or stab you in the back. The story isn't revolutionary, and has some... glaring issues, like a lack of a real moral choice. *Spoilers* Even after the king turns and tries to kill you, and you find a level 4 city that is turned evil, in which the gypsy even says 'no wonder dragons hate humans', you still fight along side them. Why? Because GAME LOGIC! The game itself is still good, and one of it's greatest points is it's spells. It brings an interesting choice for skill points, spend some to get a new spell, or level up stats. And unlike some games, the cost remains the same for all spells, with only a level limit for the spells. Meaning you don't have to get a bunch of level 1 spells just to get that huge level 15 spells. Most of the time I ignore the spells until around level 20 because that's when things start getting good.If you want to play as a dragon, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and feel like a true bad♥♥♥♥♥of the sky by tearing up a bunch of monsters, then I recommend you play this. It has problems, but I think the game itself is very good once you get things situated. It's a shame that the makers of this game didn't put in more work, but then again, budget and time are harsh and merciless towards game creators.			"

												I of the Dragon is half RPG and half dragon combat simulator.Despite the appearance, I of the Dragon isn't a flight simulator, if you were expecting something like Descent: Freespace, Wing Commander, or Tachyon: The Fringe (with dragons instead of spaceships), you will be badly disappointed.The awesome:-An original concept - role-playing game with a flying character in an open-world, respawning, nonlinear environment-Amazing graphics (for its time)-Build and maintain towns and cities.The good:-Dozens of abilities to use and 3 different dragons.-Build your dragon any way you with attribute pointsThe bad:-Various balance and game design problems. Some abilities are overpowered, others are bad, and the in-game descriptions of abilities and attributes aren't descriptive enough. There's no way to roll back or refund attribute points.-There's no way to rebind the keys, and it looks like there's never going to be an official patch to fix this.The unacceptable:-The UI is bad enough to sink the entire game. The camera swings around wildly and there's no way to bind it to mouse movement. UI buttons aren't scaled with resolution, giving you a choice between bad resolution or small buttons. But wait, it gets even worse. The left/right steering randomly stops working (and this happens often). Obviously in any game that requires dodging projectiles, being able to steer or strafe is required, and this problem ruins the game so badly I can't recommend it.The verdict:An otherwise great game completely ruined with severe UI/control issues bordering on unplayable. If you're going to buy this, wait for at least an 80% discount - and only if you like role-playing games, flight games, and/or dragons.			"

												Like many others this game was a keystone to my childhood.  I remember when I first played the demo, instantly falling in love with the story (I mean you're a dragon?  What's more to ask).  Some of my fondest memories are playing this game, fun to play, though the controls are very unothrodox but with two forms of movements (You can solely play via keyboard, or with just a mouse) and camera settings you can definitely find a compromise.  If you've been looking for a videogame that you can play as a Dragon, but dismayed that most of them make you either a Dragon rider or a morphing human-dragon-thing, look no further.			"

												People are giving this game a bad review, forgetting that this game has been out for over 12 years, for it's time it's great, I remember playing it a very long time ago, and I had a blast. Good rpg elements, it's overall fun and it has trading cards! I do admit it didn't age meeting today's requirments, but I wouldn't give it a negative review.			"

												What is wrong with this game with these Access Violation errors? game loads and plays fine.. just don't hit escapewhy don't developers fix these old games to work on modern computers instead of just throwing them on steam and just get what they can?  6.99? seriously?? it is bad enough i paid 83 cents for this and still feel ripped off.

												I thoroughly regret playing this piece of trash. This game is true garbage, which in turn begs the question how the hell did they get a very famous voice actor (J. Meduna) for the Czech voiceover. Please, do not pay for this and if you get it from someone, don't even bother installing. I did so with a foolish promise to finish it ""for the lulz"" and I would honestly just prefer to spend the time writing a boring 20-page-long paper for uni. 0/10 Stay the f away if you have anything to live for.-7/10 if you don't, because this will only hasten your fall into the void, but in a bad way.Final verdict: game so bad even masochists or nihilists would prefer doing /anything/ elseIf it's on a sale, give it to your worst enemy and gorge yourself on their tears.

												A one of a kind action RPG. Have you ever played Divinity 2? Ever wondered, what would happen if it's dragon levels were not a dumb third-person shooter, but a complete RPG with three-dimensional flight controls? This is it. Take control over a mighty dragon, help puny little humans retake their land from the forces of evil. Soar the skies, rain fire and magic spells down on your enemies.The reason for the mixed user rating are the compatibility issues, such as inability to change the key mapping. Apparently, nobody can get the intro cinematic or any in-game music to play properly, too. You can find and play the in-game music over at ""The I of the Dragon\Data\Sounds\Ambience"" folder. Strangely enough, the music is different in (european?) steam version of the game. It's not bad; however, I find the original music much more fitting the game.Here, give these a listen. https://www.dropbox.com/s/usmi5ngfov27czn/Ambience.rarMake sure to check out the user guides on how to remap your controls and make the graphics a little bit better.Don't miss it.

												I wanted to like this game.  Who doesn't want to fly around as a dragon spitting out fire or ice to tear through their enemies like so much tissue paper?  Why wouldn't you wish to swoop down on some unsuspecting herbivore, snatch it in your claws and climb again into the skies for a quick snack?  Among other things you think a dragon may do.What do you do?  Plod along at tortise-like speeds, attempt to use your spells/abilities and wondering why they aren't doing anything, and wonder why they put a dragon skin on the flying brick you are using.Not worth your time, folks.  This is not the dragon you're looking for. You can go about your business.  Move along, move along.			"

												Someone donated me a steam code and voila, the game boy graphics dragon game became my property. I don't care about the graphics since I'm a 90's kid and loved to play such games. I played Riven, Myst, Turok, Indiana Jones on floppy disk, the first Tomb Raider etc.. I loved those games. They also were clunky. They sometimes would stress my nerves to an unhealthy level. I remember doing the same passage in Tomb Raider for 12(!) hours until I found the way. I'm a patient guy and a very patient player. But not with this game. This game is not meant to be mastered. It is meant to be deinstalled. It has various bugs that let the game crash. It has controls that are simply unable to master because you need 4 hands. Camera is broken. The story is ultra boring. The quests is actually one quest that you can repeat until the end of days. Besides this is a re-release of a company that lost the source code (their own explanation) and they can't patch anything but made it worse. The first release didn't have a lot of these problems. Save your money. Buy Myst instead (the first one, not the online chunk). One of the best games ever made.			"

												Many years ago I saw this and I was like aw cool!  I didn't get it because things were not as readily acquired then as they are today.  I saw this today for 3.49 and I was like whoa, I'll risk 3.49 for that.  My short review:  don't waste your time.I understand that this game is 10 years old, and it may have been fine then, but if so, it hasn't aged well.  I can overlook the aged graphics.  It's hard to control.  There's no in game help that I can tell.  I have the options checked for the hints and tips, but I didn't see any hints or tips,  it just throws you into a world and lets you sink or swim.   So I thought ok, maybe I should have done the tutorial.  I tried the tutorial, and it was the same thing!  It just popped me into a world and that's it.  No help whatsoever.  I didn't know what to do, what are the goals?  I managed to fly around, shoot some fire, and eat an ox.  The controls themselves are very poor and non-intuitive.  The game play is boring.  There is little to no in game help.  Even the main menu took me a bit to figure out.  The way it's laid out, it doesn't even look like a menu, it just looks like an opening title screen.  For 3.49 it's not much of a loss, but I wouldn't recommend this.			"

												While this game does not have the best graphics and models and gets really repetitive, it is still a wonderful game. It's soundtrack is very good, and the story and actually really interesting (when you actually know the whole story)Granted this version is not the original. Those who had the disc copy would know that. I had, and surprisingly still do, have my original disk copy (I had thought I lost it which is why I bought it on here). The gameplay is still the same, but the original intro that plays at the start up of the game is changed and cut dramaticly. You can find the original, in full english, on youtube still which tells much more story than this one does. And also, the land is called Nimoan. There's a second N in there. Shows how much it has been changed...But I digress, the game is still marvelous and while some features have changed (minor but I still would prefer them the old way) it is still a great game for anyone who would like to pick it up and give it a whirl. For the crashing issues, it hasn't crashed on me once. I tried getting the graphic patch and I had to find something to fix it because the game wouldn't start then. But other than that and the intro not actually playing, I've had no issues with the game as of yet on my potato of a computer (lol).For Dragon lovers, give this game a shot. It'll be worth your time.			"

												I of the Dragon is an interesting game. As other dragon lovers know, its nearly impossible to find good 3D dragon games where you actually are the dragon. It is an old game(2004) so please have patience with the graphics. I've played this game nearly non-stop till I completely finished it(28 hours), so I'll tell you the pros and cons straight up.Cons. 1) Its old. So it has a hard time working with newer computers. 2) Every time you open the game, it plays an annoying clip of the backstory. Just click to surpass it. 3) Every time you level up, the game halts for a second and may want to close the program. I have a very good computer meant for digital art and gaming so it tried to overload it but couldn't. Your computer may not be able to handle it. Its ok, just open the game again and continue like normal. 4) The game controls are annoying being forced to use the arrow keys and not WASD. I'm right handed so it hurt my wrist after awhile to play at that angle. Other than that, using the mouse etc is pretty easy to learn and get used to.5) For some variety, they give you a quest in the position of another character (only 2 or 3 times). If you die, which you most likely will, it will take you back to your last save point. So you have to complete the quest AGAIN as the dragon that lead to the subquest, then do the subquest again. Till you complete it. My advice, wait to complete the quest till AFTER you level up so it goes to that save point instead of way back.6) Dont try to change controls in option tab. Does no good whatsoever. It never saves your new settings no matter what.7) You never get help. You the dragon ""The Savior"" do everything by yourself. Which is okay. It doesn't get old.8) The targeting system can be a bit irritating sometimes but youll get used to it and know how to work around/with it.9) Once you finish the final boss battle, its sad that the game doesn't allow you to keep playing and flying and fighting enemies just cause. Once the battle ends, that's end game. No more. At all. Unless you start a new game.Pros.1) Its fudging awesome. The dragon is awesome. The gameplay is awesome (though the graphics are obviousy 2004). Being a dragon buff, structure, ability, flight physics, etc is all so important to me and its the best I've seen. 2) Flying is great. Its so smooth and controlled. I spent time just flying around because I could.3) Even though you have to do some grinding to level up, its still fun and doesn't get old. There's new places and new monsters to destroy all the time. 4) The leveling up system is nice. You get plenty of points to pass around nicely and the leveling up doesnt seem too far apart. Its not like once you reach such a high levl thats its impossile to keep leveling up. (I reached level 58).5) You can choose from three different dragons. Fire Dragon, Mage Dragon, and Necromancer I think. I always love the original straight power of the fire dragon. I can't tell you about the other two. The choice is nice.6) The power matches the dragon. Neither one(dragon or enemy) gets overpowered throughout the game and runs together nicely. 7) Endless monsters really and the great feeling of accomplishment when you finally demolish them all(In that area).8) Variety of monsters is great. Especially because each one has a secret on how to defeat it easiest. 9) The different areas you can go to have similarities but are all differnt. Each one is a completely different map with a difference in mountains, desert, forest, plains, tundra, and a mix of each.10) There is a constant story. You're never left without a direction to go(unless you just feel like wandering around instead of finishing the quest). There is no time limit on quests. Dowhat you want, when you want.Overall, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. I would support a remake or makeover (better graphics etc) 100%. Every dragon lover would love this. I would LOVE a new version or a sequel or any thing else really. So worth the money spent. I cannot express that enough. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. The pros SO heavily outweigh the cons. So worth it.Tips for Playing:1) When I first started playing, the controls wouldn't let me turn at the same time I flew forward. On the front screen where you play, in the bottom right there are a couple buttons. Scroll over them to display the name of what they do. Right above the pause button is the gamespeed level. Put the game speed to maximum and you'll be able to fly with perfect control.2) Don't destroy ALL lairs. Leave one, two max. So you can grind or make sure to complete a quest.3) Wait to do the last step of a quest till AFTER you level up. So if you die, which you will, you will go back to your last save point instead of way back so youd have to do everything all over again.4) Each creature has a way to kill it. The dragonfly things, you have to get right on their flight level and chase them. Never stop moving. Their attack is so fast that if you stop, you'll get hit ten times in .5 seconds. Etc. Just an example.5) Fly around the edge of the map of a new area and level up after so if you die, you have the whole map still discovered. Fly as high as you can if you don't want to be bothered by monsters. They may still try to attack, but they won't hit you or gang up on you to attack.6) When starting a new town, clear all the lairs nearby so they don't immediately destroy the town. Another tip. If you think the town can handle itself and you go to destroy lairs, remember to only destroy a couple lairs at a time, because the monsters without a lair to defend will immediately go to attack the town and will overload the town. So destroy a couple, go back to town and defend it, etc. 7) Even if you're a fire dragon based in straight power, DO NOT ignore your magic. The monsters get strong enough that if  you stop for a bit to destroy a lair, you'll get hit so many times you die. Use your magic abilities to fly over, destroy a lair, and run. Return and pick off the monsters one by one. Don't bother with mana inflow. Just life, regen, power, etc.8) There are pretty much NO walkthroughs. I only found one. You'll probably find the same one. Ignore the youtube ones. Go to the one on a website and is in just basic text. It doesn't go to the end of the game, but it goes far enough to help you where you need it.9) GRIND. GRIND. GRIND. Destroy all but one lair in each area. After towns are built, lairs won't form, but when you destroy everything but one, you'll never be low on power.10) Dn't kill the little guys on carpets. They help you.11) In settings, set the game difficulty to level3, not 5. Level 5 is impossily hard and irritating,That's all I can think of right now. Awesome game. If you have any other questions etc, feel free to message me on my steam account. I'll help you as best I can.			"
