												I first played Rogue Legacy at a friend's place, trading off the controller at each death. It wasn't much, but it got me instantly hooked on how fun it was. So hooked, that I downloaded Steam, bought the game for the full $15, and bought a $30 wired Xbox 360 controller... and I don't even have any Xboxes. All this for this one game... and it was worth it.Rogue Legacy plays like Castlevania and Super Ghouls N Ghosts. You move, jump, attack, and use a secondary weapon. The uniqueness comes into play when you die, which you will... a lot. Once you die, you will be brought to a selection of three hiers to play as next. Each one has a random character class, secondary weapon, and set of traits. Classes determine certain stats and abilities. Secondary weapons, or spells as they are called, use up MP. That's all pretty basic stuff. But the traits are very interesting. Some traits are helpful, like a speed increase. Others are harmful, like giving your attacks no enemy knockback. And some are just... well... neutral things... like making everything black and white. Your heirs have a chance of having two, one, or none of the traits at random. With all the random factors, you have to really get lucky... or pick the lesser of three evils. Is getting your prefered class worth the traits? Are the spells to your liking? It also makes you think about the next area... skills.After selecting your heir, you are then brought to a skill tree. You inhereit the gold of your dead relatives I guess, and you can spend it on upgrading all kinds of things, from stats, to passives, to new character classes. Do you want to build up a magic or melee character? Maybe focus on a specific class? Or do you want to play it safe and try to build up well rounded skills to work with the random factos? It's a lot to consider when purchasing points in the skill tree. And be careful. Every time you buy an upgrade in the skill tree, all of the others become more expensive. So plan accordingly. And try not to spend it all in one place because...... there's another screen. Yes, another screen where you can do even more character customization. IF you buy them in the skill tree, you can open up three different shops outside the caslte: The blacksmith, the enchantress, and the architect. The blacksmith sells you armor and swords with different stats and perks, but you'll need to find the blueprints first so he knows how to make them first... some blacksmith, eh? The enchantress does roughly the same thing. She sells you enchantment of your armor and sword after you've found the appropriate runes. The big difference is that the blacksmith's wares have weight, meaning you can only carry certain pieces until your carrying capacity improves, while the runes are weightless. It give you lots of customization options between the two and the skill tree. The architect has only one purpose. He locks down the castle. The levels are randomly generated every time enter, but if you agree to give the architect a percentage of your gold on the current life, he will lock down the previous map so that you are not lost in a random new place. This can be helpful for retrying bosses, but be warned. Enemies will be back, chests will cannot be reopened, and as mentioned your gold gain is reduced for this entire life. So consider it for saving time and getting around. Lastly, at the gates of the castle, you are faced with Charon, the gatekeeper. He will allow you to enter at the cost of all of your gold. This is where a lot of the motivation is built for the game. You'll want to spend as much gold as possible between the skill tree and the shops since you'll be losing it all anyway. You can't simply keep amassing gold over a number of lives. If you want a nice, expensive upgrade, you'd better not die and keep getting that gold. It's a nice way to give death some gravity, as getting upgrades and new characters already seems like REWARDING you for dying, and that needed to be checked and balanced somehow.The basic goal is to become strong enough to survive the four areas, beat their bosses, and then defeat the final boss. There are lots of cool extra things to find along the way, like super bosses, passive items, challenge rooms, and even some cool secrets here and there. The game CAN become grindy, and if you don't enjoy grinding, then you might get a little upset at the difficulty. However, you always have the option to not buy anything and just try to beat the challenges old school style. Nothing bars you from doing so. So it's a nice duality. The game also goes from being a platformer in the earlier stages to being more akin to a bullet hell in the later ones. Master your movements, improve your aim, and pick your battles.No game is perfect, so I had a few complaints. My main gripe with the game, though it's not a HUGE one, is that it doesn't really give you much incentive to stay alive. There's the thrill of getting more gold to get more upgrades, but eventually you'll want to keep dying so you can actually purchase and USE the upgrades. The only reason you'll want to NOT die, aside from adding to your gold count, is to beat a boss or, in the case of the final boss, beat the game. There are a good number of different room layouts and enemy combinations within, plus the challenge rooms the pop up now and then. However, after playing for so many hours, especially if you're like me and get really grindy with it, you'll start to recognize all the room types repeating. Even though the four areas are supposed to be different, they are all pretty similar. They have the same room types with different skins, more or less. And the enemies aren't really all that different between areas. They're mostly just more powerful versions of previous enemies in the harder areas, with maybe one or two new ones added. More variety would've helped, but there's already a lot of different things to deal with that it may be too complex to have more of everything, so I understand. Also, there weren't a lot of instances of this, but a handful of times I found weird floor glitches where gold fell through and I couldn't get it. That, and every once in a while my character would fall through and start randomly appearing in all the adjacent rooms for a few seconds. Nothing game breaking nor frequent, but a little spooky when they happened. Also... the music will wear away your sanity, but then again, so will anything when you play the game as much as I have.There are lots of customization options, lots of random elements, lots of strategy involved, lots of skill required... and lots of hours of playtime and replayability in this game. I got 96 hours in my first playthrough. I love Rogue Legacy. The gameplay, the music, the sound, the graphics... everything comes together to make a game that feels like it was made for ME. It's the first time since Banjo-Kazooie that a game has felt like it was made just for me. It's an amazing feeling, and I can't recommend this game enough. Easily my favorite game on Steam and has instantly worked its way into being one of my favorite games of all time. I'd really say to just buy it now. Sure, you can wait for a sale if you're skeptical... or cheap. But it's definitely worth the $15 price tag. I mean, I ended up esentially putting down $45 to play this game, and it was well worth it. 10/10 Would complete entire skill tree again(And yes, I seriously did that. How else do you think I got 96 hours in one playthrough?)

But I found blueprints for an awesome looking sword.One more run, just to get enough gold to unlock that sword.------11:31 PMDead, but I'm kinda glad because I can't wait to buy this sword. (I could probably sleep an extra 30 minutes and take the 7:50 train to work. I'll bike fast.)One more run, just to see if I can one-shot enemies now.------11:50 PMThat was awesome. It only takes me one hit to kill those guys now, which means I'm getting gold twice as fast. Also, I found the boss room! One more run, just to see if upgraded defense gives me the edge I need over the boss.------11:54 PMThank god that character is dead. She was wack. There's no way anyone could play with everything upside down like that. One more run, with a proper character.------12:12 AM%#*@!! SO CLOSE. One more hit and that boss was TOAST.

THIS is the one.------12:40 AMBOOOOM! That was glorious. Slaughtered the boss and got soo much money.Enough to try out some of these runes I unlocked.Not sure what ""vampirism"" does, but surely I'm a total beast now. One more run.------1:05 AMHoly crap. HP regain on kill means longer runs, and more gold.Stack a few more of these vampirism runes and I WILL LIVE FOREVER!!!Muah hah hah hahhhh!------1:09 AMOk, still gotta be careful.One more run. Relax a bit this time.------1:40 AMOMG so much gold and I found vampire gear! There's vampire gear.Let's try it o-- Ah crap, I need a little more gold to upgrade my max weight capacity first. One more run. Just gotta grab 4325 gold and die so I can check this out.------2:22 AMMan, what an awesome run! I was unstoppable. If I hadn't been so greedy I probably could have taken down the forest boss.One more run, just to test out this vampire armor.------2:45 AMThe forest is mine and after I spend this huge pile of gold I am gonna be an absolute monster. Holy crap it's 2:45 AM. Alright. One more-- it's not a ""run""-- just gotta see how strong my attack is now.------3:12 AMIf this new sword will let me one-shot some of the enemies in The Maya, I can do this real quick for sure.

												Rogue Legacy is a brilliant roguelike game. You'll die a lot. But you'll never have to start over. While doing a run through the castle you'll earn money. This money can be used if you die to upgrade your skills, unlock classes and buy gear. You'll then start as a new character with these specific upgrades. Every time you upgrade a skill you'll also level up; killing enemies won't earn you experience, only money and items. It keeps the game fresh and gives you incentive to collect as much money as you can before dying. However, every time you start a new game the layout of the castle resets (ie, the castle is randomized). Later on, you'll be able to keep the current layout, thanks to the Architect. You'll have to unlock him first though.You have to beat 4 bosses before you can defeat the final boss. Depending on your skills these bosses range from fairly easy to incredibly hard. Selecting and upgrading specific skills is really important here.The layout of the castle isn't big. If you're properly equipped you'll be able to speedrun through it within 30 minutes. But you'll hardly ever make it out alive. In fact, it's so tough and challenging that it should take most of us gamers 15-20 hours to complete. Yup, for a small game like that that's looooong.Like a few other games out there Rogue Legacy will never frustrate and will always be fun to play. I sincerely hope that they'll make a sequel.There's definitely room for improvement and more features, and as negative as that may sound, it's meant in the most positive way possible.Awesome, awesome game ![Rating: 87/100]			"

You start of at the entrance to the castle and you are the first descendant and you walk in thinking ""COME ON I CAN TAKE ON ANYTHING"" 10 descendant's later your like ""OMG THIS GAME ISNT THAT EASY"".But as you wade through and lose more character's you eventually come to realise that this is the aim of the game and that death is'nt a stumbling block but a means of progression as every time you die you leave the castle and then spend the coins you have ammased,therefore your character gets better on every new life and the game gets that little bit easier.Eventually you will beat the game and go ""I BEAT YOU"",but then here it comes NG+ and then the game really start's.The enemies are tougher the boss'es are harder (sometime's to the point of frustration) and its basically like you have started the game from the beginning again.The sound's and music in game are great and do a fantastic job of making this feel like an old 8-bit game which in fact it is'nt (OF COURSE DUH),but the score for the game is so well put together that you would be forgiven for thinking that it is.Rogue Legacy OST - Complete Soundtrack - YouTube

The 8-bit style they have gone for with the graphic's really does suit the game and compliment's it in fact and overall the gameplay is fair and balanced to the point that you realise that every mistake you make is your's and not the game cheating you at all (might feel that way but trust me all death's are your fault and the game is not laughing at how its tricked you yet again-SO JUST DEAL WITH IT).Anyway in closing if you dont own this game ""WHY NOT"" its been cheap enough in the sale's to make it a definate purchase and even at full price is still one of the best GEM'S on STEAM full stop.(I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE CLIPS OF VIDEOS PUT UP IN THIS REVIEW AND THEY BELONG TO THEIR RESPECTIVE OWNERS AND ARE THEIRS BY COPYRIGHT)			"

You like Random-Procedure levels like Binding of Isaac.4. You like challenging games like Dark Souls.This game have a ending, but apprently is infinite, each time you beat the game it get harder but there is a plenty of items or perks to improve your character for a long time.A gamepad is advisable for better enjoyment of this game.

												Just an overall excellent roguelike. If you loved The Binding of Isaac, you will love Rogue Legacy. It's the same kind of procedural try-and-die, where every death you feel like ""Damn no I can do better"" and you try again, and again and again.The persistant upgrades make it really worth your while, and the various funny traits give a refreshing turn to each play.Also the OST rocks.

												I hated Rogue Legacy for the first hour. I repeatedly threw around swear words at my computer every time I instantly died to anything and everything I touched. I kept wondering how a game could be this hard. Then I started figuring out the enemy patterns which led to not dying as much, allowing me to accumulate a little extra gold here and there to buy upgrades which are passed down to my children. Soon I wasn't instantly dying anymore and I was able to explore further into the castle. Rinse and repeat this cycle for many hours and I eventually became a bad ♥♥♥ rouge and slayed all the bosses and grabbed all their loot and achieved epic awesomeness. Two thumbs up.			"

Summary:So you go to the castle... and die. Then your lesbian daughter goes to the castle. She dies. Then her dyslectic son goes to the castle. He dies. Then his colorblind son goes to the castle. He dies too! After few tens of generations your great-great-...-great-grandson who is scared of chicken beats the first boss. And you feel awesome. And time goes on... It's a roguelike game but you will get better equip and stats by time, so it's beatable even by casual players (roguelite). Hell of a fun for every platformer fan!Pros:- Roguelite. Great for fun casual players and newbies, every challenge is slowly being easier when you spend your time to boost your character.- Addictive gameplay. If you fancy platformers, you'll dive into it for many hours.- Characters variety. Many trait and class combinations.- Big skill tree.- New game plus. And plus plus.- Nice graphic style.- Full gamepad support.- Achievements.Cons:- After about ten hours, it might start being dull and repetitive because of repeating locations and same enemies that are just stronger.

												A roguelike with a good sense of progression, courtesy of an upgrade system that moves with you as you die.  Unlike a lot of other games, you'll always restart with a little more power or abilities and a better chance of surviving longer each time.The trait system is really interesting, and balances between good and bad enough that sometimes you just have to chose something like being farsighted in order to get the class you want.

												Rogue Legacy is probably one of the best indie games to release in 2013. It invokes a certain level of nostalgia while still being able to feel modern. In the game, dying is permanent. But your current character passes down his fortune and stats to an heir when he dies. That heir then picks up where their mother/father left off. And just like in life, your characters have traits; some whacky like Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Vertigo, while others require serious skill like Giantism and Anorexia. The controls are a bit tricky with mouse and keyboard. Personally I recommend to use a PNP 360 controller. The soundtrack is very fitting and if you don't enjoy a track, hunt out the jukebox in a randomized room and change the selection. If you enjoy Castlevania-esque games, this game is definitely for you.Overlord's Greatest Stamp of Approval 10/10			"

												Well, what can I say? This game is a must-have for every rogue-like-2D-action-tons-of-fun-amazing-replayability lover - ""Rogue Legacy"" provides it all. Randomly generated levels, challenging enemies, simple but interesting story - it's all here.What I should mention explicitly - this game has almost perfect balance. I can't remember many of such balanced games. Each game run provides you with a new level of toughness, which is totally beatable by your skills (they grow really fast while you are playing this). You must prepare for a slow and lazy start because you don't collect much gold in the beginning but when you'll beat the game once, you'll fall in love with it, I guarantee. My recipe of success was Lich King/Queen and then Traitor. What's yours?			"

												This game is like cocaine. I always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. But you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. Things I like:+The RPG elements are well done. -- As you gain gold you can purchase upgrades, which also build a castle. As you build it further, you unlock more upgrades. It is a very satisfying spin on upgrades. Additionally there is a good variety of gear and runes which allow for some really interesting build options+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. On top of that there are many elements of the game that just give it a certain charm.+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.What I didn't like:- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.Then at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.Maybe just one more playthrough...			"

												In a sea of permadeath progression games, Rogue Legacy hits a really cool and versatile niche that both hardcore enthusiasts and newcomers can enjoy. Whichever protagonist you choose out of three randomised options, know this: you will die eventually, be it to traps, minibosses, the area-bosses or the varying fauna in any of the four zones you must explore. Fear not, however, because your family's lineage will be furthered by each respawn, and the gold you hoard on every adventure can be spent on stats and equipment improval. Every run is different, and both the personal traits of your heroes (varying from drawbacks such as myopia to perks like regaining mana from breaking miscellaneous items) and the ever-shifting dungeon architecture get randomised into interesting scenarios that demand different approaches, clever tactics and quick reflexes. Alternate boss fights, New Game+ content and hidden classes will add quite a few hours to an incredibly addictive experience coated in a toon fantasy setting that looks pretty much like a cross between Prehistorik and Castlevania. Buy it if you:Enjoy indie Metroidvania titles with RPG elements sewn inLike riding the line between dying and progressionPrefer light humor and nostalgic sidescrolling misadventures to the cinematic polish of modern AAA titlesDO NOT buy it if you:Get easily frustrated and think dodging should be done via quick-time eventsExpect an elaborate narrativeWant 3D in your games			"

												This is a well known game, is not in need of additional reviews, so I will just correct some of the misunderstandings about this.1) This is NOT a roguelike. Yes there are some similarities, ""Rogue"" in the name, you have only one life at each play, and a bit of randomization.There are also many features of this game which makes it not a roguelike. a) It lacks proper RPG gameplay, since each class has only two upgrades and these upgrades are for between playthroughs not included in them. so you get stronger each time you die, but your strength is constant for only one gameplay time.b) Bosses are predefined. Some memorization or... grinding is required for a usual player. Reflexes do matter, also your grinding time. Mostly, your strategy does not.c)Yes, there is grinding. SInce there is persistance between lives. The game also gets harder by your newly bought upgrades, but it scales a bit slower, so yeah you are expected to grind as hell.d)since I already said that ur strength wont increase between two deaths, after getting enough ""level""s rushing through bosses is a viable strategy. Think about average roguelike and you will see that calling this game a roguelike just because it is hard, semirandomized is stupid.e)Apart from looping with ever getting harder enemies, this game has a goal. So you can finish it. By finishing I am also meaning, being done with it, in like 20 hours or so. Yeah there is replayability, but you will be grinding the same stats all over again.2) Saying this is not a roguelike is not a negative criticism like many thinks, just a categorization. It is a nice game, I enjoyed playing it, and finishing it. Mechanics are weird, most are solid. I had my fun. For me Barbarian and Shinobi seemed much more stronger than the others but I guess they are actually balanced. Music were quite nice, atmosphere is also nice. Not many are on with me with this I guess, but writing in Prince's Journal was quite high quality material, and one of the strongest aspects for me. I kept playing until I see the end of the journal, and slowed down afterwards. There are some unique mechanisms like Architect, and insanity in the fiber of the Castle is really well thought. So a well designed cross genre platformer, I am satisfied with what I got.TLDR: This is NOT a good roguelike. This IS a good game.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a 2D platforming action game by Cellar Door Games, an independent Canadian studio.  It’s categorized as a roguelike, which for the uninitiated, is a sub-genre that typically includes procedurally generated levels and permanent death (meaning once you die, you start over from the beginning).  Rogue Legacy has both of those, but it adds in some RPG mechanics which make the imposing threat of death easier to swallow, while not altogether curbing the difficulty that fans of the genre have come to expect.  At the beginning of Rogue Legacy, you are a generic sword-wielding hero who is tasked to fight through a dungeon.  There’s some reason for doing so, and there are diaries strewn about the world to help piece together exactly what’s going on, but for the most part the narrative is in the back seat throughout Rogue Legacy and that’s totally fine.It’s hard to overstate just how much fun the minute to minute gameplay is in Rogue Legacy. Controls feel tight and the mechanics are all-around solid and enjoyable.  Any fan of 2D platformers such as Spelunky will find themselves at home here.  The dungeon is split into four separate areas, and while they are distinct in aesthetic and difficulty, they do tend to blend together after ten or twenty hours in the game.  The main distinguishing factor of Rogue Legacy is the way in which death, and subsequent life after death, occurs.   Upon dying (which will happen -- a lot), you get to choose a new “heir” among three choices to attempt another run through the game.  Each heir can have all sorts of randomly assigned genetic traits which affect how the game plays.  Discovering the novelty of some of these traits is fun in and of itself, so I won’t ruin them here, but I will say the traits are pretty well balanced, creative, and occasionally good for a laugh.The other unique aspect of death is that your character continually gets stronger in whatever way you choose.  As you traipse throughout the dungeon, your character collects gold from chests and enemies.  You can invest gold after dying in a huge amount of ways; you can boost stats such as strength and armor, unlock new classes, or buy new equipment.  It’s almost impossible to beat the game during the early hours because of the upgrade system, and how weak your initial character is.  Having to rely on more than sheer skill may be a problem for some, but the feeling of progression through boosting your inherent power is pretty satisfying (as in most RPGs) and makes the whole experience very addicting.Toward the end of Legacy, when your character is strong enough to make it most of the way through the dungeon before dying, each run can take about 30 minutes or more, and I found it becomes a bit of a grind.  Luckily the grind doesn’t last too long (at least it didn’t for me) before you become powerful enough to beat the final boss and finish the dungeon.  There is a nicely done New Game+ option, and it’s a telling sign that I immediately dove back in upon completion my first time around.Overall, I really enjoyed my time with Rogue Legacy.  The RPG mechanics do an excellent (or evil, depending on how you look at it) job of cranking up the “Just one more run” factor that roguelikes are infamous for.  Blending rewarding and difficult gameplay with a really smart way to make death a little less punishing goes a long way to make Rogue Legacy one of the best games in the genre.			"

												At $2.99 right now, buying this is borderline criminal, considering how much fun it is, and how much replay value there is. If you like Rogue-likes, buy it. If you like indie games with fun mechanics, buy it. If you like Metrovania-type games, buy it. If you enjoy games at all, buy it!!			"

												If nothing else, Rogue Legacy gets points for having probably the best setup for a roguelike possible. You hail from a long line of adventurers, delving into the ever-shifting halls of a forgotten castle, and when you die, you take on the role of one of your children, random class and quirks and all. The story fully utilizes this setup as well, which is really cool when (if) you reach the end and see how it all ties together. It would be a shame if that hook was wasted, but luckily the game is a pretty solid platformer and roguelike to boot.Before each run, you get the option to upgrade your manor, buy new gear and enchantments, and lock down the castle. The first two should be obvious, allowing you to customize and upgrade your heroes through the unfortunate generations. The third lets you enter the same castle layout as your last hero did, at the cost of most of their gold. It's an interesting feature that's not common among roguelikes, adding a layer of strategy that gives you a better shot at finding specific upgrades or reaching bosses at the cost of your other treasures.The actual platforming inside the procedurally-generated castle is probably the weakest part of the game, but by no means bad. The tradeoff for randomization seems to be very simple room layouts, mostly spruced up by liberal application of breakables and traps. There are special challenge rooms, miniboss rooms, and stranger secret rooms to find as well which help keep exploration fresh. However, the game can be pretty aggressive about murdering you with its elaborate traps and vicious enemies. Each of the four wings of the castle has a general difficulty level, but it can be hard to tell where exactly you fit at the moment, especially if the place has not been kind with upgrades. My first dozen generations passed without finding a new sword, for example.There's a certain attitude to the game, as well. NPCs enjoy berating you for failing at nigh-impossible tasks, and challenge rooms will happily trick you into failing them with cheekily-placed monsters and spikes. It feels like a very mean game at times, especially if you're not doing well. But if you stick with it, learn to synergize your gear with your class, and grab all the treasure you can, it'll end up being one of the more rewarding games to complete.			"

												I wouldn't call this a bad game, but in the end, it feels too grindy to me, and often feels more like an RPG hybrid than a roguelike hybrid. I'll try to break down this impression across a few different points, and use The Binding of Isaac (BoI) as a foil to help elaborate.First off, something you should understand is that pretty much all character progression happens in between sessions, not during them. Every item you find has to be purchased after you die, so apart from health and mana, pretty much nothing you come across in a given session is going to be immediately useful. Contrast this with BoI, in which every item you pick up either activates instantly or goes into a slot for manual use. In its first few hours, Rogue Legacy (RL) has constantly given me the impression that I simply won't have any success until I build up enough gold to purchase useful gear- and that's assuming I even find the gear in the castle to begin with. (99% of gear can't be purchased until you find it in the castle first).Moreover, re-entering the castle costs you all of your gold. You can reduce this to 50% by upgrading a particular stat, but doing so will cost lots of gold that you probably won't be able to accumulate for at least the first several hours. In addition, upgrading one stat increases the prices for every stat across the board. So, you'll be in situations where you have a bad run, but you still want to spend the small sum of gold you collected on something before starting the next session. The problem is, doing that will make it harder to get the upgrades you really want in the long run, so overall, having a bad run really makes you feel like you wasted your time, even if it was only a few minutes' worth.In BoI, you didn't have to worry about shops all that much; they could give you a helpful boost, but you could do fine without them for the most part. RL, on the other hand, wholly revolves around the concept of a shop; you can't really accomplish anything significant without going through it first. As I mentioned before, every upgrade has to be purchased- everything. Some of the stats can be upgraded 25 or 50 times, though you probably wouldn't want to target those first because of the constant price increases. I think I would have enjoyed RL a lot more if the creators removed some of the minutiae from the early game. As it stands, I don't think it respects my time.Finally, something to keep in mind is that the enemies' levels are scaled up according to which of the four major areas you're in. Not only do they take more hits to kill with the same equipment, but their attack patterns (often projectile-based) become more complex as well. Until you accumulate better gear and really learn the enemies through death after death, you're probably going to be spending most of your early game in the same two first areas over and over again, unless you're okay with repeatedly ramming against a difficulty wall. In BoI you did have to learn enemy patterns, but if you were able to learn them quickly, then the game wouldn't hold you back from claiming victory. It nearly always provided you with something useful along the way, thanks to its diverse item pool- most of which you didn't have to buy in shops, mind.If none of the above points concern you, feel free to ignore this review. I just want to caution people against impulsively buying roguelike hybrids just because one particular title was a lot of fun for them (which is what I have done, regrettably). In my experience, these kinds of games vary significantly, and often you really have to take a closer look before committing to them.			"

												This is an amazing roguelike game!Gameplay:You start off with a very basic character and challenge a castle filled with many monsters. Your goal will be to plunder as much gold and equipment as possible before you die. Dying is inevitable and a recurring feature of this game. The catch is that the gold you collect will be passed down to one of three children to choose from. They can have different classes and different traits. Traits can either be good, bad, funny or obnoxious. I won't be spoiling them. So, your bounty gets passed down and now you get to spend your money on a skill tree. From there you can unlock new features such as the smithy, from which you can buy equipment from. Equipment is important as it is a quick and cheap way to raise stats such as armor, health, mana and strength. However, these stats can be upgraded on your skill tree as well. As you play through the game, you will proggressively get more and more gold, getting better and better characters with which you can delve deeper into the castle and, perhaps, complete the game. If you aren't into difficult games with permadeath, this might not be the game for you, even though this game has very forgiving and enjoyable deaths. You won't mind dying as much as with other games. Definitely a fun and unique experience. Visuals:A lot of people would say that graphics are very important and, as such, this game isn't very appealing. I am not one of those people. Although the visuals are an important element to games, the deciding facor for me has been gameplay. Nonetheless, I would say that, despite its graphic limitations, this game looks incredible. The artstyle is fun and simple, yet beautiful and charming. It kind of gives off a retro aura that I really enjoy. It doesn't matter that it isn't realistic, that's not what the game is going for. I would say it's very well made.Music:Finally, the music! I must confess, when I loaded up the game, I heard a very beautiful song playing. It kind of mixed electronic sounds with orchestral instruments in a way I had never heard before. As silly as it may seem, I didn't realize it was the game. I thought it was from a video I had been watching or something. But I was wrong. So amazingly wrong. As stupid of an assumption as it is, I never expected an indie game to have such beautiful music in it. A lot of work and effort were obviously put into it. So yeah, I really enjoyed the entire soundtrack. It's very unique and amazing.Story:At first, the story isn't very apparent but it gets very interesting as you discover more. Note that there are a bunch of references to the history surrounding the fountain of youth. It's pretty cool.Controls:I have not had the opportunity to play this game with a controller yet, but yes, it does have full controller support. Regardless, the keyboard controls work pretty much perfect for me. They're responsive too. Overall, I just think there's no problem with them, there's not much else I can say.Verdict:This is, in my opinion, one of the best Steam games out there. I bought it less than 2 weeks ago and I've played over 50 hours! I'm completely hooked. It is astounding. For the amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it, 14 euros is a complete steal. If you're interested, go buy this game. It's worth it.			"

												Great mix of metroidvania, rpg leveling mechanics and roguelike elements. The game is as hard as you want it to be depending on how many times you can clear it. Once you know what you are doing and get some levels and upgrades on your rogue's descendants you might feel overpowered and for a while that's quite true but as you advance the game matches you and if you keep at it eventually supercedes you and you are basically left to hit and run tactics while skulking through the castle trying to get to the boss room doors.Rogue's Legacy found a winning combination with the various elements it incorporated in the gameplay and if you are any kind of fan of 2D combat platformers... this demands to be played.

												Absolutely fantastic game. It is so good, that I, a random person on the internet, took 15 minutes out of his schedule to tell people to play it. The premise is simple and engaging, progressing through a randomly generated castle. Enemies are varied and can get challenging. The story is hilarious, and while not groundbreaking, tends to fix a smile firmly on my face. Gameplay is simple in theory, but with the Equipment and Runes system, can get some nice depth going. It is one of those games you sit down to when you have 30 mins to spare before a big meeting, and end up just deciding to miss it. Got this during the Steam sales at a discounted price, but would willingly pay full price again.9.5/10			"

Rogue Legacy is a delightful medieval-themed action platformer with adorable art and a few unique twists.Its masterstroke is how the permadeath and rogue-like mechanics are wrapped in a tale of heirloom and magic castle with ever-shifting walls. Each death does indeed end your run, but then you get to continue as one of your descendants, able to spend all the gold earned by your unfortunate ancestor on equipment, runes and the expansion of the family's manor, which is basically a gigantic tree of permanent upgrades that will help subsequent playthroughs.Any boost will be very welcome, as you start off very weak. Working your way through the randomly generated castle and its three surrounding areas will be a painful journey at first, but it will get more and more rewarding and satisfying as you crawl further and further with each run. You might even be so fortunate as to end up slaying one of the four bosses, whose spirits seal off a mysterious room!The second stroke of genius is the way your descendant's abilities are defined not only by their class (barbarian, mage, paladin, etc.) but also a gazillion of unique traits, which might provide benefits or be hugely detrimental. Your chosen hero might have A.D.H.D. and gain a speed boost, while also being near-sighted making everything far away blurry. His/her hypochondriasis may well result in hilariously exaggerated reactions to any damage taken, not to mention a number of purely cosmetic or anecdotical traits such as baldness or same-sex attraction. You only get a choice between three random heirs on every playthrough, meaning you'll likely end up having to work and compromise with most of these characteristics at one point or another.With all these twists that keep every playthrough refreshing as well as the sense of progress and accomplishing things in the bigger perspective of your heirloom as a whole, Rogue Legacy is as charming as it is oddly addictive. Although the final few achievements may require a bit of grinding, it also has a bit in store for the hardcore gamers with five vicious secret bosses and the option to advance into ever-harder ""New Game +"" modes everytime you complete the game. I'd say it's worth at least a good 40 hours if you want to accomplish everything, and you'll more than likely keep playing the occasional run after that just for the hell of it.You are a fan of the man/10			"

												This is a really fantastic game. I have a copy of the PC version and decided to revisit the game on Steam. This has got to be one of the funniest gaming experiences I've ever had. There's not much about this game that's ""politically correct,"" but there's a whole lot of funny, and I'm having a blast. The character traits are very much like hexes and hardcore disadvantages used in other games to increase challenge and promote replayability. I found myself trying every new character, class, and trait I came across just to see how badly my character would be impaired. The O.C.D. trait is perfect for me, because I never met a destructible I could pass up. Well, I'm on about Lady Charlotte the three-hundred-and-sixty-first now (see exaggeration trait-though it sure does feel that way sometimes!) and have never experienced the same butt-kicking twice. The graphics are sharp and vivid, unless they're not meant to be due to said impairments, and the controls are very responsive. There is a lot of opportunity for character upgrades and additional features, items, weapons, and armor. That coupled with the randomized map means that even hardcore gamers are not likely to get bored, or experience every scenario this game has to offer, anytime soon. The Steam achievements are fantastic, and the looting aspect of the game definitely appeals to those who love rogue games and dungeon crawlers. Any connoisseur of platformers should also give this a try.			"

												Great platform game, it has a very good and creative gameplay.The game itself is simple to play but it takes time to master and earn the money necessary to buy new abilities and items to go further in the dungeons.Every time you enter in the castle the rooms are randomly created and each hero has some pros (more critical hit, more life or mana expert, ...) and cons (colorblind, dyslexia, glaucoma, ...), some are pretty fun, others don't make a difference, but all is worth test at least once. This make the gameplay unique each time you start.I just don't liked the music very much. It was nice in the beggining, but after die so much the same music became annoying, so I played listening anything else.It is a cool game and has a nice end. I liked it.			"

												This is one of those games that took me a long time to actually enjoy.  You have to grind for a while to upgrade your stats enough to last in the castle.  Somewhere after 100 lives it started getting easier and I started living longer than 5 minutes.  It took me 22 hours of total playtime to be able defeat the four bosses, while somewhere around level 160.  Another 3 hours of grinding and I was able to beat the final boss.  That's what I mean by grinding, although I readily admit that I suck at this game, which is part of the reason I didn't like it much at first.If you can be patient, and you enjoy platformers and rogue-likes, you might like this game.  It takes time to get over the wall but when you do, you will find it becomes easier and more enjoyable.			"

A Solid and enjoyable roguelike action platformerYour goal is to enter a castle where you have to defeat 4 bosses plus a final boss. You start out weak and will die quickly after entering the castle. Collecting gold from enemies and objects will let you buy items, perks and abilities like upgrading your health or draining health from enemies when you damage them. Most upgrades are permanent and will be used by all future characters.When your next character enters the castle he will be a bit stronger than its predecessor and will probably survive longer. Each new character has different traits than your previous one like faster movement or doing more damage, together with the randomized castle layout each playthrough keeps the game fresh. Once a boss has been defeated it is gone for good (meaning you won't encounter it in your next playthrough).The castle layout is reminiscent to the castlevania series or any other metroidvania. It also plays like the castlevania games as far as attacking is concerned but without inventory management and complex magical abilities. You also don't need to have certain perks or items to unlock parts of the map, everything is unlocked from the get-go. You can't go wrong with this title if you like old school action platformers.

												I don't typically write reviews, but Rogue Legacy for me is going to be an exception. Ill start off with the pros and cons and then give some of my final thoughts. But first, I just logged into the game to play one run through and HOLY CRAP I BEAT THE GAME! Finally!!Pros:+Fast paced, hack and slash, dungeon crawl+Simple mob combat+Very fun spells+Strategic and challenging boss fights+After you defeat a boss, the door unlocks so you can do a unique challenge fight+RPG elements (item upgrades, rune upgrades, castle upgrades)+Very wide character variety+Deaths bring you a selection from three random characters+Randomized character traits+Randomized levels after each death+Quirky and a fun story line+Weight - Yes, weight. It brings a special element and challenge. You can't just unlock the best gear and wear it. You have to make sure your character upgrades accordingly.+Difficulty starts at a standard. You can control it by adding runes, which I've found also gives you new and unseen levels to the dungeon+168 hours played and I just beat the final boss. I still have so many upgrades and blue prints to find.+In that, extremely high replay valueCons:-Finding later tier (tier 4 and 5) gear is very difficult-Once you unlock enough upgrades to your castle, the grind can feel tedious. This doesn't happen for a very long time, though.-There are very annoying occurances at times due to bridge placement. I.E. when trying to escape a level by jumping up to a bridge and activating it, only to have the hit cause your character to fly into the upper room and then back to the lower room. Causing it to reset. I'm not sure if this is meant to be a challenge to the player or just poor placement.This game will always be a favorite of mine. The control you have to either farm for gold or challenge yourself to get blueprints for gear, is amazing. I find it really fun to have a choice of random characters and I love all of the unique traits they can come with. Whether you are looking for a dungeon crawl to play casually, or challenge yourself with hardcore settings, this game can fit anyone's arsenal of games.5/5			"

												Rogue legacy is a great ""roguelite"" game that doesn't desperately try to be something that it isn't.It doesn't necessarily have as much content and longevity as something like the binding of isaac would have, but what it does have is well made and polished mechanics.   The armor system is well made, supporting fairly many styles of play. The rune system is an interesting and well fleshed out system of secondary perks and abilities which can impact the core gameplay loop quite vastly depending on how you decide to utilise them.  And the gold and level up system is also nicely done, striking a balance between feeling worthwhile and being absolutely necessary. The descendant system is a nice touch which helps to keep the characters feel fresh, and the traits system adds yet another layer to the gameplay. Some of the traits being helpful, some neutral and some outright bad. Charon being in the game helps to add some of the ""rogue"" in to rogue legacy, him not being there would make leveling up and managing your gold very different. And not in a good way in my opinion.I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, except perhaps the architect. I think removing the ability to lock down the castle would overall profit the game. Although i can see that being somewhat frustrating to a new player. But overall it's probably not a big gripe.I've beaten rogue legacy tens of times, and grinded to max level and found all armors and runes twice. I guess that tells something about my enjoyment with it.I guess my summary would be something in the lines of, everything just feels so enjoyable in this game. It never feels like a chore.And i would definitely recommend it at it's pricepoint. Especially when it's on sale, about 4 dollars or your regional equivalent is a steal for a game like this in my opinion. :RogueChicken:			"

												Rogue Legacy, as the title suggests is a Rogue-like. It's got randomly generated elements here and there with psuedo perma-death (You keep everything but your character when you die) which brings in it's 'Legacy' system. This Legacy system allows you to pick another hero, a child of your previous one and they inherit any stat boosts, items or runes (abilities). The overall concept of the game is that you must spawn various heroes to grind your way up to defeat various bosses in order to complete the game. This is one of the weaker points of the game in a way however. If you do not like repetivity then stay away as for the first 20-ish lives (depending on how good you are and how much gold you get) especially, you will constantly loop through the first area just learning the mechanics and enemy types and also trying to defeat the first boss. I have to admit it was a little frustrating and I could only manage like 5 runs before needing a break. It's not all bad though, as when you die you keep any gold you rustled up and that is then used to upgrade your castle (It's an upgrade system that unlocks more as it grows, like a skill tree) You can increase stats such as health, mana, damage and even unlock new class's for your future heroes as well as giving them extra abilities. There's a fair amount of upgrades to choose from so you can tailor it to your personal preference for the most part. Okay, so let's talk mechanics and gameplay (a bit more in depth) So, as already prefaced, Rogue Legacy has you enter a randomly generated dungeon to face off against various enemies and bosses. The combat is quite simplistic and yet a bit difficult to master, especially downward attacks in my own experience. (This is with a keyboard by the way) Much like the controls themselves it's somewhat tight and has a nice feel to it. You are also given a spell and a class ability to play with which vary in strength and usefulness. The spells are selected at random at the start so this can be a factor which makes you pick Lady Chun Lii III (this game also has references) The Barbarian Queen over Sir Charles the Assassin. The spells are more-so a personal preference of what each person likes and also what you intend on doing with that character as some enemies and bosses are easier to fight with certain classes and spells. Another Mechanic which I have yet to talk about with the Legacy feature is that the characters each have traits, some of these effect the game visually, others gameplay-wise and some just comical. You can have a Giant, a Dwarf, a skinny person, someone who is colour-blind, someone who is permanently roided and the list goes on. Some of these have little effects such as IBS which just makes the character do fart sounds when jumping or dashing. Other traits such as Dwarfism allow for you to get into secret areas for free loot and other little shortcuts. This brings me to another element of the game which is Blueprints and Runes. As you explore the Dungeon you will encounter many a chest, these contain, gold or blueprints with special chests containing stat boosts and Runes. Any blueprint you pick up allows you to craft some new armor and any rune you pick up grants you the ability to add an ability to your character. The Rune Chests come with a price however as you must find them hidden in certain locations or you must complete challenges. Some of these are easier than others. There a many varying abilities which can be stacked to become more powerful, this further adds to that personal customization to play in a way that suits you. Time for Graphics, Sound and Aesthetics. As you can see from the screenshots and trailer up above, the game does not boast any amazing graphical fidelity, it is quite basic. The Aesthetic however is rather quite pleasing to the eye and has a rather Paper Mario feel to it. When the sprites turn around they flip sides.  It's a nice little nod and it looks quite neat. The designs on the enemies and locations are all pleasant to look at and you can usually tell an enemy from the background (There are enemies that are paintings which can catch you off guard if you don't notice them shaking). The sound design for most of these areas is awesome and is definitely one of the top points of this game. Each piece fits it's location and is enjoyable to listen to. The sound effects of taking damage, dashing etc are well suited and feel right.I know I have yet to mention it but there is also a story behind Rogue Legacy. I'm not going to spoil it but basically there's an adventurer much like yourself, who's traversing the dungeon. As he goes about, he leaves journal entries behind which allows you to read his story and gives you hints on where to go and such. It's a nice way to add a story to the game which isn't entirely necessary. Also, this guy who's leaving these journals must be pretty good at the game as he goes through the entire thing without dying which is literally impossible for the player. Throughout the game there are also paintings that the devs have left of their previous games with some insight into them. It's a quiant touch that is interesting to read if you are interested, So that's Rogue Legacy, I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy Rogue-Likes, Dungeon Crawlers or MetroidVanias as this game is a mash of the three. It's a fun 10 hour + raunch through a trap filled, enemy infested loot dungeon that will have you dying for more.			"

												I do not regret getting it, but I have a hard time recommending to anyone.  It is not that it is just a difficult game, but it feels like it is just being difficult for difficult's sake.  Losing is not fun in this game.  The family tree system is only cute at the beginning.  It is a fun enough platformer but the progression of the game is too much of a grind to be able to get better stats to be able to do anything.			"

												A beautiful addition to the roguelike genre. Random generation of levels AND characters ensures that challenges remain fresh, and the incremental progression keeps it addictive. A must-buy for people who enjoy this type of game.			"

												Let me begin by saying that this game was truly a welcome surprise, I expected not to like it and boy did it prove me wrong...So, what is it ? Is it really a rogue like ??? oh sure, in a sense... I mean there is no real save and you restart your adventures in a procedurally created dungeon every time... on the other hand not really because you actually do improve each time over and thats a fundamental no-no for rogue likes....At the end of the day its a hybrid, that will appeal more to non rogue-like fanatics, rather than the true fans of that genre.The thing is that if you look past all that, its a truly fast paced, fun-filled plat-former that will make you swear, cry and smile every-time you give it a go and believe me you will give it a go and another and another and so on... its so compelling to just try to do a bit better each time.The main concept of the game is that each time you die you can start over with one of your descendants all of whom carry over the abilities of their ancestors (and their flaws). So you gather money with each run and but abilities and equipment and each generation is a bit stronger - mind you you cant keep your gold (or at least most of it) between runs, since you need pay death each time you enter the dungeon (except in cases where you have found a special item that you turn on instead of gold).A similarity to rogue like games is that it starts out very hard and that will frustrate most players (but you will come back for more). However as you progress and improve it becomes easier and I must say (this is one of my grievances with it) after a point it becomes, perhaps too easy.The bosses are somewhat easy (with the exception of the four special bosses that are insanely hard - but those are not necessary to finish the game) and each new play-through increases the difficult (ala Dark Souls New Game +1 ect).One thing that ticked me off, which becomes apparent when you master it, is that it is actually short and it really makes you yearn for more.... perhaps with some expansion or dlc but you would like to do more much more (and this is another point where it differs dramatically with true rogue-likes).The graphics are pix-elated but beautiful and the retro style suits it so well, the music can get a tad annoying at times but then again its very reminiscent of 8-bit era game music.Overall I have to say I loved the game and I truly wish it had more to offer, but it doesn't. Is it worth playing in spite of that ? Hell yes - its so much fun....But after 5 play-throughs and all achievements equipment the only thing left was the special bosses. I did spent the time to kill one of them but its for the true hardcores... perhaps I may go back and try them again for the achievements alone, but at this stage there isn't a lot of re-playability.Again, regardless of any shortcoming I described, its so much fun and totally worth it (which is why its a bit disappointing at the end).

												At first, this game is very entertainting. The combat is fast-paced, you can upgrade your character however you want, and the character descendants are often humorous.But after a few hours, it gets *extremely* repetetive. The game's hook is that you will die, and you WILL indeed die A LOT. I thought games had evolved past the 3-decade old idiocy of being ""touched"" by anything hurts you, but apparently this game didn't get the memo. Often you are surrounded by half a dozen monsters, which means dozens of projectiles flying at you and even more chances to get ""touched"" by monsters. Ranged attacks would help greatly but mana is so limited for even the most basic of ranged attacks that you can't rely on it. So you're forced to melee most of the time against projectiles flying all over the screen. It makes for a very frustrating experience. So you die. And then die some more.Dying often could be forgiveable if you're progressing. However, in this game, you are literally playing the same level over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It gets old fast. The only way to progress is to grind the same level repeatedly for gold, while memorizing enemies. But with limited HP and each hit taking so much HP away, not to mention the annoyance of accidental ""touches"" as described previously, you'll die often no matter what you do.The upgrade system seemed really great at first, but every time you upgrade your character the price of all other upgrades increases. Essentially the carrot in front of your nose is being moved farther and farther every time.Not only that, but every time you die, you have to give up all your gold before restarting the level. So you have 1000 gold and spend 500 on an upgrade, with the next cheapest upgrade at 510? Too bad, you have to completely waste the rest. Idiotic beyond belief. After a while, all the upgrades become so expensive that if you don't farm thousands of gold before an accidental death, you have to give it all up and you just made 0 progress. After a few hours, the game expects you to play perfectly, or you won't progress at all.I was indeed getting really good at the end of my play time and really memorizing all the enemies and how they moved. But then I took a step back and realized that I wasn't having fun any more. Because of the extreme repetition in this game and the frustrating nature of combat, I would certainly give this game a DO NOT BUY. I bought this on sale for $2.99 and wish I could get my money back.			"

												Rogue Legacy is solid conceptually, but ultimately relies too heavily on the player's addiction to the genre to keep them hooked. While the randomized progeny do add some variety to the game, generally it is in the form of either amusement or frustration, rarely strategy. The metroidvania platforming style calls for skilled manuvering, but bizarre hitboxes and sluggish controls will interfere with your mastery more than the difficulty of the enemies themselves. Each area of the game feels the same as the last, sometimes even generating identical rooms with a different coat of paint. Even the enemy challenges presented in more advanced areas are merely faster, more projectile-y versions of their smaller-sprited counterparts. Rogue Legacy will certainly entertain for a short time, but eventually the monotony of raiding the castle and dumping your gold into various stat-sinks will start to feel like more of a chore than a diversion. Rogue Legacy is perfect if your gaming appetite is sated by spending twenty minutes saving up enough gold to raise a single stat, then dying and playing the same areas over again with a slightly different character. In other words, this game is built for players who have the patience to endure the least pleasant aspects of the procedurally-generated platforming roguelike. For everyone else, I recommend you divert your attention elsewhere.			"

												A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.All in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought ""that looks interesting"" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.

												Fails at its central conceit; is neither a good Roguelike nor a good Metroidvania. Little care or thought was put into developing the mechanics and balance of this game in a way that works well. Most of the game will be spent grinding the castle for gold over and over to boost stats until you randomly get a class that is strong enough to beat a boss.			"

												Rogue Legacy is the sort of modern retro classic that dreams are made of.Entering the looming castle, unaware what awakes you inside, it quickly becomes apparent that this is not the simple 16-bit platformer it first appears. It cleverly blends genres, from roguelikes to RPGs to traditional platformers and bullet hell shooters, into a consistent and dangerously addictive blend of beautiful originality that feels fresh yet instantly familiar. It's also constantly and abundantly rewarding, making sure your many, many deaths feel worthwhile instead of frustrating as you continually rush back into the castle hoping this run will bring greater victories.The concept is deceptively simple. You are the descendant of a dying king, embarking on a quest to find what lays inside this castle that will allegedly cure the king. But within moments you are struck down long before you can make it anywhere near the deepest layers of the castle. Thankfully you were rather, ahem, ""friendly"" in your life and know it's up to your incredibly large number of offspring to take up the sword in your place.This then leads into RL's broad progression system, which incorporates a level of randomness while also allowing you to level your hero to better confront the monsters within the castle. No two children are ever the same, with each being a random combination of a huge amount of classes, traits, and special items they can use. For instance you could be a giant colorblind mage, or an ectomorphic shinobi that gets sent flying with every hit. It's a tad disappointing that some of the traits are merely for laughs (for instance one that causes you to pass gas with every jump), but there are enough that drastically alter the gameplay for it to be considered a success that plays largely into how you intend to approach a given run.These runs are what I love most about RL, because they take the most compelling elements of roguelikes (such as randomized level designs), and combines them with a more approachable leveling system and patterns that can be learned and mastered. Although you lose all your gold each time you enter the castle (at least at first), what you manage to attain can then be used to buy better gear, equip skill runes, or level your skills and unlock more classes. This leverages the difficulty away from impossibly hardcore, into something far less daunting. I constantly like like I was making progress even when I died, and it's this constant drive that makes finally overcoming a particularly challenging boss or section so satisfying. Overcoming RL's obstacles was easily some of the most rewarding moments I've ever had while playing a game, and finally beating it felt like the epic accomplishment it ought to have.Don't take this to mean RL is an easy game, because rest assure you will get pounded into the dirt more times than you can count. But it's not an insurmountable challenge, and it's in this that I feel it most succeeds at turning hardcore design philosophies into something everyone can enjoy. It makes the difficulty something you can realistically see yourself beating if you just try one more time; upgrade one more stat; find one more blueprint. It's the best sort of ""hard"" game that knows when to reward you and when to hold you up, only long enough to keep the hunger for victory ever present and relief just out of reach.Even though I've conquered the castle, beaten the bosses, and discovered what lays within I don't see myself putting Rogue Legacy down anytime soon, and that more than anything is what sets it apart as a brilliant experience that I want to play over and over again. Every element of its design is polished to a glorious sheen, glued together by it's fantastic artwork and mind blowing soundtrack, and it's relentless attempts to empower you while always leaving you something more to accomplish. Everything about it is just freaking rad, and hopefully you realized that already and are now  metaphorically running to pick it up.			"

												Was really excited for this game, and as you can see from my play time I believed in it for a while. The platforming actually is rather good (with a tendency to use too many spikes for my taste) as is the funny genealogical system. But the major sticking point is the permanent STATS progression. At first it sounded great, you get the blood rush of permadeath with something to carry over! Unfortunately it means that initially you can't get very far without being completely destroyed, and that later on the early parts of the dungeons will likely be no-challenge pieces of cake (can't tell if they put mechanics in place to prevent this, didn't get that far with the unlocks).Also, unless you're the absolute god of platformers you'll sooner or later hit a progression slowdown where you just can't get a run that's profitable enough to unlock anything.I think the lesson from this, and I'm gonna repeat it in every rogue-lite review I do, is that permanently unlocking new alternate classes and new stuff that gets fed to the random generator for a run is great, but permanent stat progression just doesn't work in a roguelike, it makes it GRINDY.

												A fun platformer Rogue-Lite where each new life will be a person with different traits and/or classes, in a dungeon that keeps being randomized (which isn't that big, but it'll do).The traits itself are a little gimmicky, but it still brings variety and it's fun to see some have the fear of food itself. Music is good enough, whereas combat is perhaps a bit too simple (you can cast only a few spells and usually only one per life, melee attacks are even more simple consisting of a standard slash or a down thrust).However since you die very fast, it's quite challenging and how long you survive usually depends on how well you can dodge. It's quite a grindfest to get further, but an enjoyable one nevertheless and definitely worth checking up on.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a sidescrolling, action-heavy rogue”lite”.  Other than the fact combat is real-time, most of the elements of a roguelike are present.The most notable feature of the game is that, although death is final, you never truly start from scratch when you die. Currency is carried over to your heir and you can use it to permanently unlock classes, perks and stat increases before each trip into the dungeon.  Additionally, you will find equipment blueprints and enchantment runes on your adventures and may pay to equip these at the blacksmith and enchanter, respectively.  An architect offers you the option of locking the dungeon design down for future generations, rather than having it randomly generated with each visit.Each time you die you must select from three heirs to use as your next character.  Their classes are randomly drawn from the pool of classes you’ve unlocked, and each will also have one or two genetic traits which positively or negatively affect your playthrough.  These can be anything from color blindness to obsessive compulsive disorder to irritable bowel syndrome.  The devs attempted to make these conditions and disorders humorous with awkward results, but it’s a very small part of the game that’s easily overlooked. Rogue Legacy is appropriately difficult for the genre and gets harder with each new game+, where enemies and their projectiles increase in size and density.  Players can expect some grinding regardless of their skill level.  Gamepad is fully supported and it will take most people several completions and 20-30 hours to 100% the game and achievements.  One of the best games I’ve played this year and highly recommended.			"

Rogue Legacy is probably one of the best roguelike games on SteamThat might be an overstatement since I haven't played every game on steam. Regardless, Rogue Legacy is a fantastic game. It has all the right elements to make a great roguelike and includes personal touches that make it a truly unique game. Positive:- It's different every time you play. Seriously, you pick a new character every time with a class, a spell, and several traits (irritable bowel syndrome hehehe). Additionally, the map is scrambled every time, forcing you to explore the castle over and over again.- They also include an option to lock down the castle, giving you the option to continue exploring the same map you had before you died. BUT you are slightly punished by doing so (only receive 60% of gold loot). This is a fantastic option because it gives you an advantage at a price. Let's not make things too easy. - Teleporters (thank you).- Simple responsive controls.- Enemies and traps follow specific patterns - learn them!- The combination of the previous two points makes this game very fair. It is purely skill based. Did you take damage? It was probably your own fault. - Enjoyable music.- Different segments of the castle have different themes and enemies.- Lots of collectables scattered around the castle.- Option to level up stats and diversify the genepool.- Different armour, weapon and rune options that you can customize before entering the castle.- First play through is a challenge (especially the two last bosses, those took me a long time).- Great replay value.- You can have up to 3 different profiles at one time (start a new game without overwriting your previous save).- Being gay (as a character trait) does absolutely nothing. I love this feature.Negative:- Many enemies are just reskins of older enemies (but they have new abilities and patterns).- Blob boss is very difficult.- Attacking downwards to open platforms can be difficult.- You will die a lot in the beginning - try not to get discouraged.- Over time you will figure out which kind of character you prefer playing, leaving the other ones almost untouched. Personally I almost never played the mage. Conclusion:I am fairly certain that you will know whether or not you will like Rogue Legacy based on the trailer. It is exactly as it seems: fun, fast-paced, rewarding and punishing. If the trailer tickles your fancy, I would definitely urge you to get it.Side-noteSometimes I played this game with my brother, switching after every death. We basically made a competition to see who could go the furthest or collect the most gold before dying. Naturally this game is fun alone, but it is even better when you play it with someone else.

												(Due for an edit)I have about 20 more hours of offline play time in addition to the listed amount shown. Now about the game.Rogue Legacy is a very challenging game, you will die...a lot, it's pretty much the premise of the game. Fight, die, upgrade. Rinse lather and repeat essentailly but it's a bit more varied than that.Gold is king in this game as your wealth carried over upon your ancestors death determines the upgrades you can afford thus improving upon the spawn of your hero.Careful being greedy though in Rogue Legacy, it may just cost you your Heroes life.The castle in which you will be entering in (and mostly dying in) will be where your Rogues Legacy begins, in addition to that it will also be your grave.Every new generation that enters the castle will find it has shifted and moved around with semi-randomization.  I believe this is so it is never the same experience twice.Enemies seemed to be strategically placed in set rooms as if to add a more difficult element rather then just being in random locations.Your only solace of preventing the castle from shifting each generation is via the Architect, but beware for he wants 40% of your gold earnings so weighing in the extra financial loss is something to consider.While upgrades are done via your manor estate which can improve stats to gold gain there is also a Blacksmith and a Lady who can sell you runes. These two npcs can help you greatly in giving you an edge wether it be a weapon that returns 50% damage back to the enemies or a rune that can make you double or triple jump. You'll need to loot chests to aquire these first however which mini bosses or special condition chests usually contain.Another thing is upon choosing your child to follow in your foot steps Traits & Perks are most likely given to each of the 3 you have to choose from (Occasionally will a child with no traits appear). These can range from I.B.S (Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Your hero tends to fart while jumping) to Dementia (You see and hear enemies that are not real and they attack you which doesn't hurt you.)You start off with some pretty basic classes at first. Knight, Barbarian, Mage, but upon upgrading your manor which is only done after death you can unlock a few more such as Shinobi and lich, in addition classes can be upgraded i.e Knight to Paladin and given a new ability such as ""block"".Platforming is a thing in this and a bad jump or fall can hurl you into some spikes or enemies so eager to end you.The story while subtle is not shy of being rich. The comedy is also subtle but still there. Probably nothing to make you rolleth on the floor in a histerical fashion.It took me a plethora of generations and frustration to master the patterns and eventually defeat all of the bosses. Patience is important is so is studying the patterns and attacks of everything.Rogue Legacy is truly a Gem and a tough one to boot.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a very hard game with a superb soundtrack, I fell in love with it a while ago! This is my favorite game of 2013.Everytime you die, you can choose between 3 randomized children and you get to keep your unlocked weapons, armors and skills. You can find rare chests which contain permanent boosts to your character and the monster difficulty scales based on your level. There are 10+ big bosses to beat and a vast amount of enemies.I cannot explain how good this game is! It is cheap, addictive and great in all aspects! 41 hours in, I have completed the game and new game+ once. It was well worth playing and I had alot of fun! Lasted longer than most games I've played. Keep in mind that with the infinite new game+ and ranodmly generated levels, it wouldn't surprise me that you would play the game for longer than I did! If you haven't played it yet and are not sure if you should, you can check my personal score below.  Category Rating /10 Details   Gameplay 9.2 A pure hardcore roguelike action platformer (for those who are not familiar with the term roguelike, it means that the levels are randomized and death is permanent, even though you keep your upgrades and gear in Rogue Legacy). Very hard to master, stiff controls (which fits the genre of Nintendo-era games, execpt for ""Down-attack"" which is just weird in my opinion), lots of weapon, armors and runes to unlock. You have a full skill-tree you can eventually max-out if you gather enough gold! The game is not frustrating because whenever you die, as long as you gathered enough gold or found +Stats bonus from chests, your character gets stronger. Keep in mind that monsters scales too! Multiple save-files and new game+ (infinite amount of ng+ and new gear for those who can succeed in ng+)! The game could have more monster variety, but for an indie game it's just fine!   Graphics 8.8 Retro graphics that you will just fall in love with! In Rogue Legacy you will find funny, yet beautiful, 2d art with well-done animations that goes perfectly with the style of the game. The UI and menus are simplistic but gives you just enough information, fits with the rest of the art and looks fine overall. Plus, there's plenty of different visual effects you will discover based on your character traits.   Atmosphere 9.5 The soundtrack of Rogue Legacy is EPIC! It is definately one of the best soundtrack I have listened to in my entire gaming career. The sound effects are very satisfying to listen to and they're unique to the game. Your character attacks have a wide bank of sound, so they are not repetitive and they don't get boring to listen to. Rogue Legacy doesn't feature any voiced dialogues, so there is no voice acting for this game.   Performance 9.5 I have noticed barely any bugs while playing through the game. Nothing annoying, just very few glitches, like being able to move during some boss cutscenes (which might be fixed). Also, another thing I need to point out is that in my 41 hours playing this game, I have not crashed a single time, which is great. The game runs totally smooth, I have never experienced any fps drops.   Story 7.5 While the story is not bad, it's really short and litterally only a few pages of text left by Johannes and some boss dialogues. I'm surprised such a wonderful game has got such a simple story. As I said previously, it's not a bad story, just very confusing. As far as the NPCs goes, they don't really have dialogues and there's not many of them, but those dialogues are fine. Honestly, it's an amazing game and the story doesn't really matter in this case, because the gameplay, graphics and sounds are all fantastic!   Singleplayer 9.0 Since Rogue Legacy only offers singleplayer, this will be a resume of my review. Rogue Legacy has a fantastic singleplayer experience, it is totally addicting, it has tons of replayability and it is challenging. Definately a game to try if you are a fan of hard games and like 2d action platformers! There's items to farm, a huge skill-tree to unlock and level-up your stats and skills and unlimited randomly generated levels. Rogue Legacy also features unique boss mechanics, challenge rooms and secrets to uncover   Multiplayer -- This game features no co-op or multiplayer.   Playtime 9.0 Rogue Legacy takes a good 20 to 40 hours to complete depending on if you want to simply kill the last boss or complete ng+, collect all items, collect all runes, etc... Overall, you will probably spend around 40 hours playing Rogue Legacy, which is huge for a singleplayer indie game. As for the replayability, don't even worry! Multiple save-files, random traits, randomly generated levels, infinite new game+... You will have to play for a while before getting bored of the game!   Prices 9.0 Rogue Legacy is totally worth the asking price of US$14.99 (As of late 2014), as it doesn't have any DLCs or microtransactions, it's developped by indie developpers and it's just a great game overall.   Steam Features 8.0 While Rogue Legacy doesn't have Steam Workshop and is lacking a few Steam features, it does have the most important ones. The achievements are pretty good (and some are quite difficult, because most bosses are difficult anyways) and the game has Trading Cards. The game also features full controller support, which is always a great thing to have in a retro game!   Game Score 9.0   Information Time Details   Time required to complete the game. ~16 hours. Reaching and killing the main boss.   Time required to fully complete the game. ~100 hours. All bosses, around 10 ng+, all items, all runes, maxed castle... Etc.   Time required to get 100% achievements in the game. ~41 hours. 28/28 achievements working, the last bosses achievements are challenging and ""Katagelasticism"" is moderately challenging.  "

												This is a good rogue like game that has an interesting progression system. This progression system is really one of the key reason why I put so many hours into this game. Most rogue like games have perma death. Where if you lose thats it, its done you start from the beginning. Personally I did not like the idea of perma death in my games. I like to feel like I am working towards something and not losing everything just to try to do it again. With this said, many people who like rogue like games will disagree whole heartily with my decision and I understand that. Well with this game people get a little bit of both worlds. This game has perma death and progression. Each character that goes into that death trap of a castle will eventually die but his or her's gold will be sent to their child where he or she can spend it on upgrades to their castle (that supplies skills, armory, stats etc) and to buy armor, accessories and even lock the previous dungeon so you can attempt it again. Then that child will die and send it's money to the next child and so on. So people get their perma death and progression all in one. The gameplay is fun with platformer elements to it as well as rpg. Its a 2d side scroller where you go around in a randomly generated dungeon looting for gold, trying to survive and fighting bosses. Thanks to the option to lock the previous dungeon you can keep retrying the bosses again and again, without searching for the boss door. Which is nice because the bosses can be extremely hard if your not prepared. Also the dungeon itself is hard as well and you will find that it will take many attempts before finding the boss doors. So overall, the progression system as well as the gameplay makes for an addicting game. With this said, their are a few issues I have with the game. When your character dies you get a selection of three (maybe four) randomly generated characters to choose from. All of these characters have different classes, special attacks and/or different qualities. Although the qualities like vertigo can really mess with you, most of the other qualities are forgettable after a while but it does add another element to the game at times. The random generated abilities on the other hand, were for the most part useless because most of the classes (except maybe mage and spell sword) had very little Mp to work with. I found that the normal attacks were sufficient in getting me through the dungeons.  It could have really helped if the characters had a bigger Mp pool to work with and maybe some different spells and abilities.  Overall, good game with a few issues with the characters abilities, still very fun to play and has a game plus mode so good replayability as well.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a very dark game. It forces you to minimise the importance of life and death in your mind. The whole game is about the end justifing the means. The main concepts in the game are, the core game mechanics, the characters, and the gameplay.The core game mechanics of Rogue Legacy include you dying. To progress in the game, you need to die, so your heirs can get better defense and offense and have a better chance of defeating the dungen. Everytime you die, the dungen resets, so it is half impossible to master the dungen, just based on memory. This adds a harder elelment to it (THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE!). This game mechanic is put in place to make you apathetic towards the aspect of life and death, especially of the protagonists. Some characters you might play you might only get past a few rooms with them, and then their life is over. Each character that you play will have traits, which is an attempt to humanise them, so they aren't lifeless chells for your on progression. Instead of humanising them it makes it easier to objectify them. The traits become not character traits, but tools you can use to progerss further. Being short will make it easier to get into hard to reach places, being huge makes their sword strike more, being gay.... Well that just makes them fabulous! You start to care less and less for the life of them, but care more and more for what their next heir will achieve. They become less of protagonists and more of vessels for the protagonist, you the player. The gameplay of this game is pretty fun, and addictive. Each time you die you can now buy more armour and more weapons and progress even further! One thing you couldn't do the first time, you will try again the next time, and again. New powers that you get will help you to get more powers. You will find journal entires which will entice you to explore even more. Overall the gameplay is pretty good and very addictive.Rogue Legacy is a really good game for people who want to play something a bit darker that makes them think, but is also a good game for people who just want to play a fun game.

												I entered the castle and promptly died on some spikes. Then my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heir ran into the castle, drooling the whole way, and managed to kill some enemies by swinging his sword wildly as he died. Then his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ daughter drooled her way to death at the [sans] hands of a huge eyeball. Each time you die, your predecessor has to spend whatever remaining gold you didn't spend on equipment or upgrades to re-enter the castle. Charon stands before the doorway like some malevolent Gandalf, not allowing you to pass until you give him all your money like some ♥♥♥♥♥ paying her pimp not to beat her tonight because she's special. All in all, a subtly addicting hack'n'slash platformer that has surprising depth. Hours disappear while playing this game.			"

												I love this game & I hope one day we get a sequel.If you enjoy rogue likes or platforming titles, then this game is for you. The difficulty may be a bt jarring when you first start playing, but that's the genius of this title, everytime you enter the castle, you're more experienced & knowledgable than the last time you entered.You'll soon be bouncing off enemy heads as you fly through the castle looking for more loot, or the boss room to advance yourself.Fantastic game with sublime controls. 8/10My review isn;t that in depth, but there isn't much to say that hasn't been said already, If you're remotely interested, just buy it, the game is great.

												This game is a bit overrated. First let me just talk about the good things. The gameplay in this is very solid. The combat mechanics are fluid, and for me are what makes this game worth playing at all. Great gameplay with tight controls.  That being said I wouldn't reccoemdend this game for the price they ask for. This game is a weird case, it doesn't do anything particularly wrong, but it just isn't intresting enough to be worth playing. It's fun enough to endlessly go through the dungeon and getting further and further each time. But it's a long long road, and it feels like a grind.  And there will be times where you wont gain enough gold to do anything with, which feels horrible because I wasted all that time. It's not fun to have to search every room for gold over and over. The enemies can really screw you over fast and the level generator can get a bit too extreme in giving you good stuff, or really bad stuff on a run. My big problem was it just all felt pointless after awhile. I'd work up life after life to beat a boss. And its not an easy boss fight. And in this game the bosses are much more stressful than they are fun. You have to go through a lot of fighting to become good enough to handle a boss. So you go from room to room fighting harder and harder enemies until you finally want to devote the next 10 runs to just beating the boss. ANd you do it! and you feel great! but then its like... now what? I get to do that entire process all over again now, but its going to be the same thing just a lot harder.. and that cycle will never end. The upgrades you can buy are pretty standard, there's nothing particularly intresting with the leveling mechanics, or the class  changes. On a personal note I also think they underplayed their theme a bit. I was really attracted to this title because of the whole legacy thing. Each life is the ancestor of your previous life. But they never use that for anything outside of context and what they call things. The legacy stuff is just there to slap names on things really. There's no actual gameplay to go along with it, and personally that bums me out. They could've made it so if you choose to play as a certain class, you get that class or some of that class' traits in your next life. To be a sort of genetics passing between lives. They could've made it so that if you killed the monster that killed you last time, you get a boost of some sort. They could've made it so that if you died by a certain type of enemy, like a skeleton, then your next life deals extra damage to skeletons(to sort of simulate anger that they killed your dad or something so now you hate skeletons and they must all die). They could've made it so each time you die you say a last word, which could've been an in-game tip system. Like if you die by a skeleton his last words are like ""skeletons attack this way, maybe if I had tried to do this I would've lived. They could've given an ancestoral fund thing you could sink extra gold into, and you can see which ancestor donated the most, it would also help make it so that no run is completly worthless. I dunno, there's a LOT of ideas and they did none of them and it makes me sad. They have a really intresting hook with their context, and it was part of the reason I bought this game to begin with, but I was let down by the way they used it. But the gameplay is balls out solid, so you will definititly have fun with this game, but I don't recommend it unless you can get it for $5 or less.			"

												Imagine you're playing a board game. You're given infinite lives. However, every time you die you have to reroll all of your character traits.That is essentially the gimmick behind Rogue Legacy. The only difference is that instead of infintie lives, you have infinite heirs. Each heir is given any of a whole slew of different modifiers that can be useful, harmful, or simply funny. Each heir gets to retain anything their predecessors unlocked and make another go at the pseudo-randomized castle (certain regions of the castle are always in the same general location, but the rooms and layout are randomized).It is admittedly an exercise in grinding as most runs through the castle early on you can expect to die. And die. And die. But you do get this certain feeling of progress and learning how to cope with the variety of traits you can get. But there's nothing quite like that feeling of seeing a boss for the nth time and finally kicking its ♥♥♥.The story is fairly basic but is entirely fitting for the game. It is, however, somewhat predictable if you can catch on to certain things as you make your way through the game. If you enjoy the gameplay a lot, the replay value is high as each iteration of the game gets progressively more difficult. Plus a patch some time back added special versions of the bosses for added challenge beyond the original game as well.Overall, I found it a very enjoyable game.			"

												I didn't think restarting a game a multitude of times would be fun. Then again, the oldest games out there are fun just because you keep trying to beat your old high score.This game begins as one of your fore fathers goes into a castle and tries to battle his way through. I'll be honest, I didn't pay attention to the story line I just wanted to start playing. The game works as so : every generation (or every time you die) there is a new line of blood that comes to challenge the castle. This new blood line comes in many forms, some have ADD, some are colorblind (to the point where your screen is colorblind), some generations are smaller or larger than usual with different classes (mage, paladin etc...), some are dyslexic (to where your screen is as well) and some are far sighted. Mixing up classes (or choosing to stay the same) is a nice feature. As you progress and collect coins you are able to unlock different sort of classes and even upgradable classes (or upgrade your HP, mana etc...). You can save your coins instead and spend money on new armor or weapons. These require the player to unlock ""blue prints"" before such purchases can be made. There is also the ability to ""lock down"" the previous castle your player died in... meaning you are allowed to go back into a castle you already explored previously however the treasure chests that were already opened remain opened. The game play itself is relatively simple, with a few buttons to use for attack and mana capabilities (each vary with different class of player). It's a plat former with simple up, down, left and right game play. I wish there was an ability to roll as some levels get crammed with sprites shooting all sorts of weapons every which way. Yes of course the game does suggest to go back or to another dungeon room but sometimes you get caught. I like the idea of the game more than I like the game play.I like this game, I really do but I can't go as far as to recommending it to buy for it's full price... heck maybe even on sale. I don't have on indie games but I do find they cost more than they should... especially when it's a platform game.I will give it an indie rating of 7.1/10 but it's real rating as a game : RATING : 7/10  Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-Could be funner perhaps with local co-op? Also, there is double jump in this game... eventually. You just have to unlock it. UPDATE : After playing the game for over 5 hours, I'd like to say having better dodges or attacks against certain enemies would be nice. Seems like some levels/rooms are simply impossible without the right movement. Old NES fans may enjoy it?			"

												5 reasons I love this game: 1. It is simple, yet addicting. You could just play a quick run for 10 minutes or you can play for hours on end to earn upgrades and try and make more progress in the castle. 2. You will always have more milestones to reach. When you're starting out, struggling to defeat enemies, and have no mastery of the controls you will be motivated just to have runs that contribute anything to your game. Whatever money you make is lost if you don't spend it, and everytime you buy an upgrade, the cost of all the upgrades available slightly increases. You're motivation is just to improve, however you can. Strive for runs where you get just far enough to afford something that can make your situation a bit easier. As you start to acquire upgrades and get used to the controls, you find you can make more money, but you also need to earn more to keep upgrading your characters. Then you may get far enough to fight the area boss, but you will probably get decimated by them. So you're goal is to fight them more, to learn their patterns and try to defeat them.Then you finally defeat the boss, but you have 3 other areas to explore, which means going deeper in the castle to fight tougher enemies and surviving enough to challenge 3 more bosses, who will also demand a similar learning curve and challenge you to reach them while earning upgrades to increase your chances. This excellent pacing makes it so the game is constantly rewarding.3. The game has a lot of variety thanks to the randomized layouts, traits, character classes, and rune/weapon unlocks. It's really fun to experiment with different classes and test out new gear and runes. There are also a large variety of enemies with various patterns to keep you on your toes. 4. This game has a nice metrovanian art style and a good soundtrack as well. I especially like Ponce de Leon's theme. 5. Unlimited New Game +'s. Nuff said.			"

												Rogue Legacy is my favorite Indy game of all time. If you like 2D action platformers with randomized dungeons, generational upgrades, extremely tight and responsive controls, and a little humor thrown in, then this is your game.Just to be clear, though, this game is HARD. While it is possible to beat the game in only a few lives (see speedruns), most players will never get that good and it will take you many generations of heroes before you are able to reach the end. If you are like me and you enjoy the gameplay, then you won't mind that, and you will have fun experimenting with different playstyles along the way. Most of the negative reviewers don't seem to be onboard with the whole concept of a roguelike...			"

Rogue Legacy is a standout title in the roguelike crowd that deserves attention due to its satisfying platforming elements and unique randomization premise, though its system does inhibit replayability due to difficulty issues.This game's trademark is its dual-randomization aspect, in which both the character the player uses and the layout of the castle that the game takes place in are randomized each playthrough. The backstory under which these factors are justified is equally intriguing: for every character that dies during their journey, one of three of their descendants will be the next to journey into the castle, which is apparently renovated in between each excursion. The usage of the lineage system to limit character choices keeps the game fresh by not allowing the player to avoid bad traits or unpreferred classes when they appear. However, this method does have issues due to the limited quantity of bad traits and the fact that they often are either ""not impactful to gameplay"" or ""downright game-destroying""; some more meaningful downgrades that players would not necessarily spell defeat for players would have benefitted the game.Further deviation from the normal roguelike setup comes from the fact that Rogue Legacy contains an RPG-like permanent upgrade system. Money earned in the game during a run carries over beyond death to an skill tree which grows to include unlockable classes and buffs, alongside general stat increases, over time. The game also features a basic armor system, with blueprints to be found in-game that unlock different pieces for purchase. Due to a lack of customization options for the attributes attached to the armors, however, by the end of the game there will only be around two different sets of armor that are feasible to use, since all the others would generally leave you too weak. Unlockable improvements to the armor to make the lesser sets more valuable would have made the armor system much more deep. To make up for this lack of customization, though, comes the final perk system, which allows the player to attach up to five perks before a run. These perks can acclimate to various playstyles and balances out the luck effect of the roguelike factors with the skill of the player in their preferred method of playing.Other aspects of this game are on-point. The gameplay as a platformer is responsive and adjusts accordingly to traits and perks, helping players concisely feel the effects that they're playing under. Combat is sometimes too floaty, as many flying enemies recoil too far from attacks for the player to prepare for/respond to naturally. Largely, though, the game feels fair in how enemies and rooms are designed in order to give players a fighting chance. Bosses vary widely and require strategizing from players, especially underleveled ones, in order to be defeated. The game's aesthetics are aided in part by its catchy chiptune soundtrack and the creators' humor, which is incorporated throughout the game in unexpected places. The game's lore is even decent, as diaries laid out by a previous denizen of the castle detail prior occurrences and tease some endgame events. The castle format smartly balances randomization and predetermination by allocating certain extremities of the castle to be certain areas (and thus certain degrees of difficulty), meaning that players that wish to face challenges above or below their own level can travel in certain directions - a useful mechanism that both rewards learning the attributes of different areas and surprises new players with unexpected challenges.There are some downfalls that occur due to Rogue Legacy's mixing of genre elements. One significant issue involves the game's difficulty in later playthroughs. The game's balancing system levels out permanent upgrades in the skill tree with huge improvements to the enemies after the player beats the game. This system works for a number of victories through the game. However, at a certain point during games, the skill tree will eventually max out. At that point, further progress becomes largely impossible past whichever current playthrough that player is on. This issue can be exploited much earlier in a playthrough with abuse of the aforementioned perk system. With overuse of the ""enemy weakening"" perk, players could potentially inadvertently ruin their saves by beating the game so many times with reduced rewards (a downside of the perk) that the game may be unable to beat even with the perks, impossible to get past the first room without any of the perks and the player won't have enough resources to improve themselves. Such an exploit should have been either worked around or patched out altogether in order to protect the integrity of players' runs.The RPG implementations cause unforeseen issues with the levelling system and prevent this roguelike from possessing the endless replayability that the genre is known for. However, as a venture into uncharted territory, this game provides an admirable experience that is driven by strong fundamentals and a memorable randomization system that fittingly gives this title a ""legacy"" of its own. Rogue Legacy gets a B-.			"

												As the Steam description for the game says, Rogue Legacy is a Rogue-”Lite” platformer-type thing where you travel through 2D rooms slaying the castle’s inhabitants either by sword or by spell. There is a large variety of traits you can get to either benefit or harm your Rogue Legacy run as the heir to a hero trying to save the king with a cure that can be found in the castle. There’s even a pretty interesting amount of different spells you can get, ranging from throwing a dagger, to a circle of fireballs around you, to a couple crows that will home in on enemies and kill them.You might have heard that this game is extremely difficult, and in a way, it is. It’s hard to start out against the new monsters and the weird mechanics of the game, but once you get the hang of it, there really isn’t much else you can do to get better other than upgrade your castle. So rather than it being particularly challenging, it’s more just time consuming. I’m not saying this in a bad way though, I rather like it. It’s still never extremely easy, and as you complete the game more it still gets more difficult. It’s really fun to slowly upgrade your character, barely managing to pay for that upgrade and having to do another run to get some more.The world generation in this game gives you a lot of different rooms that you will experience a lot and eventually get the hang of. There are spike traps, wall turrets and platforms that only come out when you hit them, all used to add to the challenge of moving around, which is a very important mechanic to get the hang of. Some rooms will be extremely challenging with valuable prizes when completed, and some rooms will be a simple stroll through a hall. Spending your money properly is vital to performing well. You need to buy the things that will benefit you most and improve your runs. If you find yourself running out of mana quickly, maybe you should increase your mana capacity, or if you find yourself not doing enough damage, you should increase your health. If you find yourself playing as certain classes a lot, you should upgrade them to improve their abilities. And then there’s always the blacksmith and enchantress, who will get you very important items that may even benefit you more than a manor upgrade. You can buy swords and armour and capes from the blacksmith, along with runes from the enchantress to allow your character to do all sorts of different abilities like draining the health of your enemies and being able to fly, or making the difficulty a bit harder for better rewards. What do you think is more important? That will determine the success of a Rogue Legacy run.Though the storyline isn’t one of the bigger aspects of the game, I find it kind of intriguing to learn things from the Prince’s Journal that you’ve experienced yourself. After completing the journal, I haven’t gone back to read them all in order but it was fun to find the journals scattered around the castles randomly and read a bit of the backstory of the game. Although this game does last a lot of hours, and you will be able to play it for a while, it doesn’t have infinite replayability. Once you get through all the bosses enough times, all that makes the game harder is increased damage/health, and not new enemies to fight. It does get boring eventually, and once it gets to a certain point there’s just no reason to continue. Still, this game will last enough hours to be worth buying.This game may not be worth $15, but any sale that happens for this game makes it probably worth looking into if you like Rogue-lite platformer type games. It’s extremely fun, a challenge worth looking into and plenty of gameplay to go through. I recommend Rogue Legacy to anyone who likes this sort of game.			"

												In this game you will die. You will die a lot.But it is not just because the game is insanely hard (although it is a little bit), but death plays a very fundamental role here.When you die with a character, you won't be able to play with it again. Instead, you will have to choose among three of his or her heirs. Every character is randomly generated, with classes and traits that directly affect gameplay in very interesting and clever manners. The map also changes for every generation, so you'll have new challenges, treasures and secrets after every death.The point is that every generation will be more powerful than its predecessor, once you'll have the opportunity to buy status, equipment and abilities with what was found in the castle by the previous character. So there is going to be a very clear feel of progress even if you die a lot in the beggining of the game, being able to survive a little bit more with each character generated.So don't get frustrated when you die. Don't give up, because this game is totally worthy! Every single element was pretty well planned and applied, like the controls, graphics, sound, music etc. A really enjoyable, fun, addictive and remarkable game. Without a shred of doubt this is a must-have to all fans of the metroidvania genre.			"

												Just a quick review for those who are wondering if the game's worth purchasing.Short answer: yes, unless you can't stand platformers and/or grinding.The game is obviously one big grinding campaign, but it's enjoyable and does not feel like a chore for multiple reasons. The platforming controls are finely tuned, the random dungeons are designed well, with pretty much no choking points that affect progress (and you have the option to revisit a dungeon after dying if you want to), the challenge does not feel unfair, and the customization options like the runes and upgrades (not to mention the character classes) let you taper the game pretty much exactly to your liking.I have to say I enjoyed this game more than Borderlands 1 & 2, for example, where difficulty feels too level handicap biased and you run into tough choke spots all the time.Looking forward to playing New Game+ and recommend everyone to pick this up, even at full price.PS. If you're a Mac user like me, rest assured the port is great and the controller support is flawless (I'm using a old Logitech Rumblepad 2).			"

												Easily one of the best action platformers of the past decade, if not the very best. Thoroughly addicting, constantly nagging you to play ""one more round"" until you realize the sun is rising. Gamepad highly recommended. Rogue-lite elements and generation system are unique and brilliantly executed. Desperately awaiting a sequel, Cellar Door!			"

												Rogue Legacy is an expertly crafted game with a confusing title.The rogue-like is an obtusely defined genre of games focused around permanent death, random environments and unforgiving mechanics. There have been suggestions for better descriptors, including the Procedural Death Labyrinth (or PDL[www.proceduraldeathlabyrinth.com]) which I personally prefer, but with Rogue prominently featured in the title I guess there's no denying that this is a Rogue-like, Rogue-like-like or Rogue-like-lite.The player character is tasked with conquering a magical castle filled with devious traps and dangerous monsters and he/she will fail and die horribly.Luckily your character had the foresight to leave behind a legacy and you'll cheerfully head back into the castle as one of your character's children.The castle changes each time you enter it though, so even though you will get the benefit of knowing the types of things it can throw at you you won't be able to memorize the castle's layout and breeze through it.Why would this next generation have a better shot than the ones that came before it? Because you get to buy upgrades before heading in using the gold your ancestor found in the castle.These are permanent improvements that will usually influence your character and always influence your offspring. Things like increased strength or armour, but also unlocking new classes for your children to be. Each time you choose a new character you have a choice of 3 randomized character classes, and upgrading in such a way that you unlock more of them keeps the game varied and helps to make the castle easier to overcome.Your basic warriors will soon diversify into wizards, barbarians, rogues and a handful of other classes that I don't feel like spoiling. They all have their place in the game and I never felt that a class didn't have any use (though I definitely had my favourites). Each classes can also be upgraded to get a unique ability, warriors become paladins that can expend MP to block any attack with their holy shield and along the same lines you'll get Barbarian Kings/Queens, Assassins and all sorts of colourful characters.As if that wasn't variety enough, each character has up to two randomly assigned traits (on top of their gender, class and spell) to differentiate them. These range from the comical (being bald, occasionally passing gas when jumping or being stereo-blind which will flip each sprite Paper Mario style when it turns) to the useful (remembering where enemies are, not triggering spike traps, getting MP by destroying furniture) to the hindering (colour blindness, dyslexia, being short sighted).These are all charming and often funny traits that will help set each character apart, and you'll go through a lot of them. Over my course of playing the game (and its extra challenging New Game+ mode) I went through 138 generations of characters, and even though I wouldn't be able to recall any of them specifically I never felt that two consecutive runs were similar.The castle you explore is divided in four different regions, which all have their own look, set of enemies and imposing boss at the end. The Castle area (you start here), the Maya high among the castle's towers, the Forest to the east and the Dark, deep below in its cellars. Beat all four bosses (in any number of runs, this is one of the things that does carry over between runs) and the large door in the foyer that you've run past dozens of times will slowly swing open allowing you access to the game's final boss.This is not a perfect game though, even though almost all parts of it are excellent, my main gripe with it is that it can get quite grindy. The main aspect to blame here is the gatekeeper, Charon. To enter the castle you have to give him all the gold you have left over after buying upgrades / equipment. This means that, as you get the cheaper upgrades and gear, you'll soon get to a game state where you'll need a minimum amount of gold from a run to be able to afford any upgrades and it can sometimes feel like you've 'wasted' a run.(There is a late-game upgrade that somewhat mitigates this problem by convincing Charon to only take 50%-90% (depending on upgrade level) of your gold).Overall though, this is an amazing game and definitely one where you're vulnerable to ""one more try"" situations turning into gaming sessions lasting deep into the night.As long as you can stomach that not every run will contribute to your progress through the castle and you feel like playing an excellent 2D platformer, this is definitely a game to pick up.

												The concept of this game is excellent, but once you get up to (and past) the first boss, it all feels kind of pointless:1. Everytime you purchase an upgrade the other upgrades become 10 gold more expensive. So if you have a bad run, you spend your gold so its not wasted (the game takes your money when you re-enter the castle)-- and then the expensive upgrades that you DO want are just that much further out of your reach.2. The randomly generated castle is an artificial thing meant to extend the game's lifespan. You can learn about the (small) handfull of enemies in each area, but you'll spend 90% of your time in the first two zones, over and over, just trying to progress. Progression is stunted even further by the game's general concept. You get just a LITTLE bit further each time, or the castle generates a room full of spikes and you take 75% of your health in damage before getting anywhere. Better get used to that first room, mate, because those four candlestick holders and that chair are always gonna be there for you to hit every. Single. Time.3. Bosses are bullet-hell creatures. Given this game's ""tough but fair"" philosophy and how easy it is to die, this was completely out of left field. The sudden difficulty ramp when it comes to killing any of the bosses will be like crashing into a brick wall, and made even worse if you're using a keyboard. The game only has five bosses, and rightly so considering how it all works, but the sudden spike in difficulty is not only unwelcome but punishing to the unwary gamer. I like difficulty so it's not a cakewalk, but I don't apprieciate having almost no chance at all. This is a cartoonish platformer, not Dark Souls.4. No difficulty adjustment. 5. You can't use a mouse on any of the menus, which just FEELS wierd.=-=-=-=-=Don't get me wrong, I liked this game a lot when I first got it, but I'll never be able to finish it. The constant grind-grind-grind for gold with almost nothing to show for it 80% of the time, coupled with the VERY difficult boss fights make this game a little too hard for a casual gamer like myself. Games are about fun to me, and if my game becomes an endless loop with no progress it stops being fun. :(			"

												Great blend of action platforming, roguelike, and Castlevania-style gameplay. Unfortunately, it does tend to fall apart at the very high levels and the repetitiveness might wear you down, as well as the absurd number of enemies that rely on projectile attacks.Overall, extremely fun and worth it.

												Player death is an important part of most videogames and has been for a long time. Every monster wants to kill you, and then you have to start again from scratch. A lot of games hold your hand, dust you down and sit you right back where you left off, as if nothing ever happened. Not so in Rogue Legacy, death is the most important thing. Death may start your game from scratch, but it also allows you to move on, to grow your dynasty and make them stronger. It’s also about killing things and trashing furniture for spare change, but that sounds far less impressive.Rogue Legacy is a ‘Metroidvania’ game, a platformer where your character navigates a location, backtracking where necessary and trying to solve puzzles while on your way to a final boss. As you find out pretty quickly, Rogue Legacy is not as forgiving as those games were. Your first character runs, jumps, hacks monsters, loots gold and dies. You get to see images of everything you killed and are told to press A to move on.And move on, you must. Instead of starting from scratch, you pick one of three children, but now there are different classes, traits and spells. The opening classes are all fairly limited and the spells are pretty basic. What really stands out are their traits, and I’ll get on to those shortly.Once you’ve picked your character, you spend your dead parent’s gold on improving your home, then pay the rest to a grim gatekeeper to enter the monsters’ castle and start again. The interior of the castle will change each time, presenting procedurally-generated rooms filled with monsters and traps. You traverse the castle trying not to die and lasting as long as possible, delving deeper into the castle.It sounds simple, and it pretty much is. The progression and the randomly-made characters make all the difference in each playthrough. Your home helps improve your chances with each successive generation. You can upgrade classes, add new ones, get stat bumps and even buy new equipment which will inevitably be passed on to your next of kin, and oh what glorious children you’ve had.I said before that you have three children to choose from, but sometimes it’s less a choice of how you want to play your next life, more like having to pick which dysfunctional mess of a child won’t hinder you the most. Your first kid looks to be the most powerful, gigantism doubling his sprite size and his class is barbarian king, but he has vertigo and while you play as him the screen’s flipped upside down. Your next choice is skinny and easily knocked back, but he’s a mage with OCD and will gain mana for each piece of furniture he cleans away (destroys). The third is the weak knave, but his dyslexia jumbles any words you read as him around, and his nostalgia simply puts a sepia tone on the game until he’s dead. Do you play it safe with the knave or pick the mage and hope to hang back from any monsters? It’s a difficult choice.Each trait could potentially add something minor, although bald or gay characters have no difference to play style. You might be blessed with no feeling in your feet and not set off pressure traps. You might be totally immune to pain though, and that means you can’t see your health bar. Gigantism makes your sprite tougher and taller while characters with dwarfism are able to slip through secret passages. Each combination of traits puts the game in a new light, along with the different layout and the incremental improvements.The improvements is one of the ways they hook you. After dying, you ‘move on’ and you can only spend your rewards after starting a new life. Then you earn more money, die and want to upgrade again, so you press A and pick a new character.The game adopts a fairly standard ‘retro’ look, with a simple enough style to the castle, better than the original Castlevania but worse than most outings. It’s cute, but the main feature is the way each character looks slightly different depending on their traits and gear. Even though this is a PC game, it feels best on a controller, just like the Metroidvania games of old.Roguelike games have become increasingly popular of late and it’s great to see one which rewards you for all the time spent by allowing a form of character progression. It’s mitigated to a point by having you lose all your money before entering a castle and each purchased bonus makes all the others more expensive. As much as I have enjoyed the Binding of Isaac and FTL, Rogue Legacy is a game which cares about constant progression even in a roguelike game and lets you invest in dozens of generations of knights all on their doomed quest to conquer the castle.

												The first hour of Rogue Legacy is frustrating. You don't have the power needed to overcome the huge amount of enemies. But when you start to learn the monsters patterns, collect gold and equip your characters, the game becomes much more enjoyable. Yes, there's permadeath here, but the gear you buy stays with you forever.Levels are randomized, but you can lock them if you want. It's good for practice, but bad for looting, because when you ""lock the castle"" you need to pay a high fee, so you'll earn a lot less gold. I recommend to do this only if you found a boss area and feel confident to fight him (you can teletransport to the boss area since the beginning). So, you might be thinking: ""how I'm gonna beat all the bosses and finish the game with the same locked castle, earning almost no gold?"". The answer is: thankfully, when you beat a boss, you don't need to lock the castle. The game register that you've already won that fight, even playing with different castles over and over again. With this feature, you can play with no pressure to beat all the bosses in one sitting.All in all, if you're seeking for a great challenge and enjoy games like Castlevania and Ghouls'n Ghosts, you should play Rogue Legacy. There's a long and tough way to go, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride as much as I do.			"

												This game is a load of fun. I think this is my favorite type of Roguelike game. Doing well enough in a run will get you more money, thus allowing you to buy more classes or upgrades for your characters. Everyone run is different. Before you start a run, you get to choose an adventurer. The adventurers you get to choose from are all random, so you could have a really bad pool to pick from sometimes. Other times, it'll be great.The concept is really well done, and definitely has it's humor to it. One of the quirks your hero can have is IBS, which just makes them fart occasionally. It does nothing else. People can have really silly names, and it's just generally a lighthearted game. It's also addictive as hell. It's really easy to set goals in the game, It's really easy to just keep playing. Just one more. Just one more. 3 hours later, you bought that health upgrade, but you probably should have gone to sleep 4 hours ago. I say 4 hours, because it's 4 in the morning, and you meant to go to sleep at 12.The bosses are also well designed, and enjoyable to fight. Even the super hard versions of the bosses, although they are really damn hard. This game does have NG+, but I really didn't play it too much, so I can't comment on it.For $15, I'd thoroughly recommend this game to someone who wants an rpg-ish roguelike game.			"

												This is a game that takes its cues from roguelikes and celebrates a long trail of dead grandpappys and gam-gams as one of its main selling points. The developers, Cellar Door Games, have dubbed the genealogical mis-adventures of the Rogue family a ""rogue-lite."" Similar to other recent roguelike games such as Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, Rogue Legacy features an ever changing dungeon filled to the brim with ridiculously lethal monsters and flagrantly unfair traps, all presented with a perversely masochistic glee. Where it differs from it sadistic peers is its sense of continuance. While each hero may only have one life to live (and impale upon a spike), the treasures and items he or she accumulates is passed to their next of kin. Bizarre elements foreign to the roguelike mindset, such as stat upgrades and ability expanding items, enter the mix.Unlike Isaac where the entire game is a mission to see the end (or at least how far you'll get), Rogue Legacy has more of a gradual slope. You know it's unlikely you'll take your first few heroes all the way to the end, or maybe even to the first boss. But that's okay, because success in Rogue Legacy isn't just determined by how far one gets, but what they amass and pass on. It's a lovely blending of genres that, like many blindingly brilliant ideas, is so amazing that it somehow becomes obvious in retrospect. Of course someone had to make a game like this. It's the perfect entry point for a new audience just dipping their feet into roguelikes.Despite the fluffy exterior of being a new audience friendly ""rogue-lite"", it's still damn tough. For such a cute looking game, there is a lot to learn and a lot to screw up. I played the absolute hell out of Rogue Legacy and made my fair share of boneheaded errors and dumbfounding revelations figuring things out. If you like good games, you should play Rogue Legacy. "

												I came into this game expecting a easy and classic platformer. Boy, was I wrong! Instead, Rogue Legacy gave me the funnest and hardest experience I ever had. This genre of rogue-like games is a blessing to other game genres out there. Instead of a linear story and a one way approach, Rogue Legacy pitted me against the unknown. This unknown was the part of the charm of the game. I never knew what to expect in the next room because every version of the castle differed from the rest. However, there is a way for the heroes to keep the same version of the castle and it is by reducing the amount of gold earned. Speaking of this feature, the other features that Rogue Legacy presented broaden the aspects of the game.Rogue Legacy offered the ability to upgrade the castle so that the heroes would have better skills and more job advancements. In addition, every hero is unique due to the randomization that the game does. Some heroes may be of a certain class or possess a certain trait that would be vital to complete certain areas of the game. To recap, I ventured into this game with a completely different mindset. After completing the game, I realized the potential Rogue Legacy has and how satisfying the gameplay was. Even though the game provided me a few hours of enjoyment, it's a good game to purchase when it goes on sale.Rating:  7.8/10 (78%)Achievements: 26/28 (93%)Game Done.			"

												This procedurally generated game has a big emphasis on death and each time you die, you lose your character forever and start with one of three characters with a random class and trait. It’s clearly inspired by Dark Souls in many ways so if you like that game, chances are you’ll like this one. This game makes death a reward in a way because that’s when you finally get to level up, this makes this game extremely addictive. It should be noted that the game lacks variety, especially in the boss design which seems like the idea between all of them is a giant version of a normal enemy. The first four bosses are just a floating ball that shoots stuff at you. The game feels like it could use some more types of combat or weapon upgrades, since the only weapon is the sword and the shield is never very affective. Every new area doesn’t introduce anything interesting besides a few enemies and a there is a huge overuse of flying enemies that gets worse with each area. Since the games aren’t completely randomly generated and just chosen randomly from a selection of pre-made rooms, you start to notice repetition a few hours into the game. Even though I have a few complaints with this game it is really fun and addictive. There’s not the same kind of issues I see with other indie games which are unpolished. I think the main failings of the game aren’t really the developers fault as much as the game needing more time and funding. But taking the game as it is, I think it’s an extremely fun, satisfying, challenging, and rewarding game.			"

												Fantastic little indie game. It's basically a Castlevania style RPG but with more of a twist on it. Using characters with abilities (and disabilities!) that effect things like having the entire game play upside down, being able to avoid all floor traps, being massive, small, or just neutral random traits such as balding, being gay and flatulence. The progression is somewhat grindy with randomized loot chests and expensive upgrades for your keep. Especially in NG+ it just kind of got jokingly awful with having tiny minimal health upgrades that would take me 10-20 minutes just to get. Still, the classes are interesting and mostly allow for unique playstyles and can help with puzzles, specific bosses or just navigating the castle.There's a somewhat interesting story to follow if you don't mind a bit of reading and exploring, I personally loved it and was disappointed when I ended up missing a few journals before completing the game. Though it definetly starts out slow.The game is painfully hard as well, which is unfortunate at times. I wasn't a fan of the idea that early levels are basically what dictate how far you can get. It's disappointing that I would sometimes barely kill a boss in an area but end up stuck because all the other enemies in the next zone can one hit me. At least leveling through your first playthrough is fairly quick though.Believe it took me around 8 hours to complete my first run. The game is a little short but if you can get it on sale it's definetly worth the money, and if you're a completionist there's plenty of skills, armor parts, and weapons to collect.			"

**This game was given by the developer for review purposes.**       This is my first real attempt to try a rogue-like. I had a cup of tea with The Binding of Isaac a couple of years ago but thoroughly disliked it. See, my problem with rogue-likes is that I feel that they inherently waste my time, if I die then I lose all of my progress and have to start from scratch. As an adult with a full time job and limited free time to play games, this experience is not enjoyable to me. I do not like the feeling that my time is being wasted, and when I played BoI this is exactly how I felt. Yes, I know that part of the rogue-like experience is learning new things about the game each time but this is essentially just trial and error. Again, if I had all the free time in the world this wouldn’t bother me nearly as much. Thankfully, Rogue Legacy mitigates this concern a great deal.	Rogue Legacy is a rogue-like with progression. What a novel idea! It takes your standard 2D sidecrolling platformer and ingeniously adds a family legacy mechanic: each time you die, you pick a family member as a successor giving you a sense of history and context for your playthrough. Each successor you pick will have specific traits as well that affect the game: this might be colorblindness (the game is black and white), glaucoma (blurry screen), ADHD (you move faster) among countless others. This smart addition makes each run through the castle seem fresh and interesting.	Another aspect that carries over from run to run is the gold that you accumulate. Any gold collected during a run can then be used to permanently upgrade your family tree (HP, mana, damage) or buy new gear for your heirs. This added progression, for me, fixes my biggest problem with rogue-likes, I always feel like I’m chipping away at a goal. So even if I died quickly during that last run I can grab a new helmet that will help me from there on out. In addition to this carry over, you can also lock down the dungeon so the layout is no longer procedurally generated. Just had a long run and loved the layout? Lock it down! This, of course, comes with a reduction in the amount of gold you earn though.	So while I may not be very good at Rogue Legacy and will almost assuredly never beat it, I appreciate what it has done for rogue-likes. It has taken a genre that I have never cared about and given me pause to explore it a bit more and see what variations are out there. "

												If you've ever played the Castlevania games such as Symphony of the Night and similar titles, imagine that turned into a rogue-lite and with some silliness thrown in the mix. The castle changes everytime you die and there are areas in the game I haven't even explored yet besides the castle itself. You will die alot but as you accumulate money you'll be able to buy better equipment and stats and get better stronger and farther. All in all this is a very fun and solid game with alot of content and while it can be very frustrating at times its also addictive as hell.			"

												2D Castlevania and Roguelike, like chocolate and peanut butter. If that's enough, don't read on. Just buy it. It's like someone saw the whip in spelunky and were like, wouldn't it be amazing if Symphony of the Night were made this way?This game features permadeath, but the progress made in one playthrough carries over into the next by way of descendants that brave the prettily-pixelated castle. Every time you die, one of your children picks up the mantle, and trots off to their chiptune-scored fate.And these kids can be seriously messed up.Colorblindness, coprolalia, irritable bowl syndrome, your descendants have traits both positive and negative. These traits can affect gameplay, or not. Being a dwarf, for instance, will quickly become your first choice, as there are paths inaccessible to any other size and they can more readily dodge projectiles. But the gender, lack of hair or sexual orientation of your character has exactly zero effect on gameplay. I like that.This game gets to have its rogue-like cake and eat its RPG-like stat progression, too. If you like addictive, difficult, beautifully designed and procedurally composed sidescrolling video games, buy Rogue Legacy.			"

												This is a rogue game done right What i played  :  I am level 470  i have all blueprints and runes and i am on new game +4. I have beat one of the secret bosses and maxed out the castle Everytime you beat the game it gets harder and harder. Your gold gain also increases so it is wise to be the game more then once. This game willl certainly have you pulling out your hair alot and dying a lot. The game play is rock solid good platforming killing enemies ect. The ost of the game is very well done it fits the retro theme nicly.  is it worth a buy.... only if you are into these types of games. If you get frusted and give up easily then i would not really reccomend it to you. However for those of us that like a fair challange give these fine developers your money.   I should mention that each time that you enter the castle it changes you never know what will be waiting for you on the other side of the door. You can get lucky and get rich quick. Or you could end up being ambushed by 12 different enemies at once. so once again give these dev's your money !			"

												I was kind of let down by this one. It just wasn’t all that much fun after a while.Having permanent upgrades made it feel like the game was more about grinding for gold than actual skill, like most rogue-likes. But maybe I just sucked at it.Giving your heroes random disabilities was a fun gimmick, but it got quite annoying once you actually started to play the game seriously.It also felt kind of cheaply made: Most of the enemies had tons of color variations, big enemies were just stretched little enemies, equips didn’t visually change your character besides the color, the backgrounds were quite bland and repetitive… It was also a bit boring that the bosses were just huge versions of normal enemies.Anyway, I beat 3 bosses, and then gave up. Maybe I’ll try again later. I mostly ended up feeling that I’d rather be playing Spelunky.It's a fun game, but not worth the full price tag.			"

												Rogue Legacy, much like the title suggests, is a metroidvania style game inspired by the Rouge format of permadeath. Like many new Rouge inspired titles, Rogue Legacy is more of a rogue-lite. After each death you do have to start over, but there are RPG like elements you can level up with each life to improve your character.Each “life” is actually the child of the last hero you played as, it’s a really neat idea but it has no mechanical purpose. The child is always random, there are no traits passed down from parent to child.It’s a ton of fun and offers plenty of accessibility for relaxed play as well as lots of content for hardcore challenge runs.

												Modern 2D Castlevania and rogue-likes combine to form an enjoyable if somewhat frustrating game, one that while randomized, is occasionally so random as to not make sense.At times the game becomes quite easy, other times it can be quite hard, the randomization needs to be improved so as to take into account where they are putting what kinds of enemies.It has a sense of humour, and the function of generations is interesting and keeps the game from stagnating.It's biggest flaw in my book is the transition between the first playthrough, and New Game+ - where the difficulty makes a jump forward that is startlingly big.  I had played through and beaten the four major bosses, leading to the final one, and I had gotten to the point where I was unstoppable at that level, but barely able to dent the final boss.  Through amazing luck, I managed to take him out, and thus began a New Game+, where I was regularly getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by enemies that hit far harder and took far more hits than the hardest enemies presented in the previous game.""Mind the gap,"" as some would say.The multiple different unlocks in the game help increase the variety to how you play, though it is quite random, you cannot selectively breed your lineage to consistently be Barbarians, you end up with many flaws that randomly occur, without the ability to strengthen your bloodline by not allowing weaklings to move forward in the family.  Between the runes and the armour and the various unlocks, you have a lot to work with as long as you can make the money, and oh what money you must make.  Dozens of playthroughs that must end in death in order to apply your money to the next generation, never to your current character.It would have been nice to be able to spend your money where and when you wanted, instead of depending on the mechanic of death.

												Finished the first playthrough in about 3 hours with my godlike platformer skill.More likely with the experience from excessive playing of the castlevania series!Pro:- Nice graphics; retro looking, but fluent and pleasing to watch- good music; relaxed to energizing 8bit soundtrack- progression is logical; you loose your gold upon entering the ""dungeon"", everything you earn until dying can be spent on upgrades for your next run, thus, your ""children"" will gain more and more power and will be able to explore the castle further, gain more gold for upgrades and equip and so forth- controls are responsive and not too complicated. I recommend a controller, but a keyboard can do just fine- humor is ""special"" as are your heroescons:- progression depends on your platforming skill. HARD. Before getting used to the controls and the feeling of jumps and attacks, you will die against everything. And if you die before collecting enough gold for an upgrade, the life of the sad lad and the run was complete time wasting. Better git gut or struggle the feel of a grindfest.- Thats the only con i can give you for a 1.50€ game, if you like platformers and are able to learn quick, just give it a go. If you manage to quit before 2 hours, get your refund. I could not quit...			"

												Too repetitive for me. Being new to the genre, I kept playing with the expectation that the gameplay would evolve/deepen over time. Sadly, it is just a miserable grind. The game's description suggests that you leave all your loot from each run to your next of kin, but this is not true. If you don't have enough gold to purchase another upgrade, you end up losing it every time you re-enter the castle. This made me feel like the game was wasting a lot of my time. Also, the quirky genetic charateristics of each successive line (vertigo, dyslexia, IBS, etc) are generally gimmicky and not meaningful. Not sure why this was highlighted as a selling point, since the game would have been the same/better without them.  I usually finish games I play, even when they're not 100% enjoyable. However, 10 hours of this game was about 8 hours too many, and I won't be playing any more. Which is a bummer because I had been looking forward to this game for a while. Glad I got it on sale.			"

												It's a great concept, but the whole ""randomly killing you"" thing gets tiresome pretty fast.  Traditionally, Roguelikes were hard, but they were rarely ever about cheap deaths.  Being cautious is what led you to success in those older Rogue style titles, not constantly being killed.  I wonder if a lot of devs these days ever played the old titles they claim to be tributing, because even though a lot of older RPGs had higher difficulty curves and things like perma-death, it was always sort of an element to the game rather than being its defining factor.  Games with harsh difficult like Dark Souls are offset by the fact that deaths are a learning experience and tactics matter, but none of those things really apply to Rogue Legacy because it's all so thoroughly random.   This, in and of itself, really wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact you are constantly punished by having your money taken away when you restart which effectively makes the challenge far more unreasonable.  I could also put up with the inclusion of ridiculous insta-death crap more if the controls were better but as it stands they are awful.  There's is a detectable lag between button presses and on-screen action (just the tiniest lag, but just enough to make it feel murky), and the movement controls are terrible with a controller or keyboard.  Barely moving the 360 controller stick results in your character moving some random distance from where they were.  performing platforming parts are excruciating because of this.  There is no tight accuracy, like what you would need to play it properly.  I have no problem with hardcore difficulty or random elements, but it all just seems like it wasn't really thought out very well and the game effectively relies on you dying hundreds of deaths just to make progress.  I can see why a lot of people like it, but it didn't sit well with me and might not really work for others.  I got it in a bundle, so I can't say I don't feel like I've been ripped off, though.			"

It's super challenging and fun.The perma-death aspect reminds me of RotMG, which I used to play, except you get to keep equips and upgrades which is more or less your progress.The maps are randomized, and sometimes you can find fun or rewarding bonus rooms, which is always a nice surprise and cool/funny..I like how you are always switching characters so you have to adjust your playstyle differently for each run.So many tiny features like these that make the game fun and rewarding.

I also recommend using some kind of controller. God help anyone who tries to use keyboard and mouse.Gameplay: Run and jump around a 2D world killing things, dodging things, and collecting money to spend on upgrades.Presentation: Fun and colorful. The crunchy sound effects are satisfying. The flavor is funny, right down to the ever-hysterical run animation; a sword outstretched, head held high, sprinting high-step that all but screams ""CHEARGE!""Gimmick: When you die, and you will die a lot, your character dies permanently. The game ends and you return to the main menu. To continue your adventure, you select one of the 3 generated heirs of your recently deceased playable character. They each have a randomly assigned class and various genetic traits. Some traits are useful, like dwarfism, which lets you access areas a full sized person can't. Some of them are harmful, like near sightedness, which makes things farther away from your character blurry. Some of them are amusing and useless, such as hypochondria, which falsely exaggerates the damage you take... for example, being hit for 10 damage might cause a big red ""2,308"" to pop up over your head.Your selected heir will inherit their predecessor's collected money, unlocked passive skill tree bonuses, and purchased equipment. So while the character himself/herself is essentially rerolled upon death, everything aside from their name, class and traits are retained. A quick sample of what the skill tree looks like can be found here:

Dying also regenerates the dungeon, so your offspring don't have to retrace any identical steps. I wasn't too sure about this game at first. I was terrible at it, and often died before obtaining enough money for my heirs to purchase anything of use. But Rogue Legacy's amusing presentation helped me to stick with it through the initial difficulties. After a couple of hours I was competent enough to make some decent runs and became hooked for good. I'm now 18 hours and 160 dead ancestors in. Still going strong.

Recommendation Bonus if want to try Rogue-like games in a platform setting.Background: This is my second rogue-like game. This game has been hard on me with the random traits and classes only furthering that difficulty and killing my enthusiasm for it. Still, I saw this game had a lot of heart from its developers embedded into the game and that kept me going.Some points, may be pluses for some, negatives for others, or neutrals.* Enjoyed the 2D graphical style* Enjoyed the music overall that sometimes harkened back to that early 90's video game musicGameplay:* Side-scrolling platform adventure with RPG elements and permanent death* Played with a gamepad, did not try to play with keyboard/mouse yet* Controls may sometimes feel unresponsive when performing two actions simultaneously such as jumping and swinging a sword or moving and swing a sword ~ if you adjust to it, you may sometimes use this lag to your advantage to swing while stepping backwards, but can initially lead to missed swings and/or death by not stopping the enemy's attack* Fight monsters, avoid traps, explore a single large castle with four major areas, find coin and treasure, gambit with statues or encounters of luck or misfortune, fight bosses to progress the main story, read through the logs of those that ventured the castle before you to piece a greater mystery, die and leave your wealth to your descendants to improve their odds of success before paying the gatekeeper all of your wealth to ensure that to buy upgrades, you will need to have a good money run* You have access to a standard sword swing, a jumping down stab, a magic attack that is often randomly assigned to your hero at the start and if applicable a class-special ability* You choose one of three heroes each attempt from a random selection of traits and unlocked classes* Classes consist of such things as knights who are balanced with the ability to block, barbarians with a large health pool and the ability to shout enemies away, wizards with a large mana pool to use more magic, ninja who can move quick with strong sword attacks, miners who have low combat attributes - but find more gold and can locate chests on the map and more* Traits can drastically alter gameplay and are randomly selected, such as dwarfism which allows your hero to fit in narrow passages that may avoid some enemies or find treasure, as well as make it easier to dodge, but shorten their sword arm - or hypochondriac where you hero exaggerates how much damage they take, making it difficult to tell how dangerous an enemy really is - or vertigo, that makes the screen upside down and reverse while making half of your controls backwards ~ you may end up with one or more of these traits to make for an interesting, frustrating or nauseating experience* You can spend the gold of your predecessor to increase health, mana, strength, intelligence, encumbrance limit, unlock new classes, increase the gold found on subsequent playthroughs and more - however, increasing any aspect will raise the price of the others, so you may want to consider the direction you would like to take as you unlock more upgrades* You can discover equipment recipes and attachable runes in chests or completing challenges, equipment such as a sword that reduces the damage received, armor that allows you to drain health from enemies at the expense of less max health, runes that let you make an extra jump or runes that give you mana when attacking an enemy* Dungeons are mostly randomized with four major areas that remain in the same general directions - this may result in dungeons that are too brutal for a new player to places too easy for a veteran ~ when exploring, you can hire an engineer-like character to lock the current dungeon design at the expense of much of your earnings, giving you a chance to continue exploring the same setup if you like the layout or if you want another shot at a boss* Optional Challenge Rooms that do not count toward destroying your game progress ~ using a preset hero against advanced versions of a boss* New Game Plus with enemies of greater stats ~ have not tried to explore more to see if there may be new enemy types or enemy attack patterns (edit: just finished New Game +1 and +2, the spike of difficulty with new enemy attack patterns created so much screen chaos and bullet hell that I ran to the bosses for safety, I don't have it in me to try New Game +3 or go achievement hunting)* Easter eggs and references to various sources throughout the game's content, gave it a light-hearted or personal touchDifficulty:* The game's difficulty varies greatly based on what hero you have available, your personal play style, what dungeon you're presented with and if fighting a boss, if you're adapted to the overall boss tactics and taking advantage of your class/trait (if applicable) tactics ~ overall, the game is on the harder side and can be rewarding as you clear out areas or go through past locations with greater confidence* Does not appear to be a guaranteed way to recover health or mana in the castle, leading you to eventually run out of recovery items and die as you make mistakes* The game auto-saves, so if you're having a bad run and losing health, it's going to remember that, sometimes it can be more convenient to you as the player to accept the sweet embrace of death* Most deaths were attempting to adapt to boss mechanics, died approximately 118 times over 9.2 hours or approximately one death every 5 minutes ~ the hero that cleared the main story is one hit away from death (edit: 135 times over 14.5 hours and three playthroughs, just going to put this game down now before the amount of screen activity on New Game +3 causes an epileptic seizure)ESRBish/Content Advisory:* Some characters are depicted farting with visual trails of their mishaps and may decrease the enjoyment of the curry you're eating* Some characters see the screen upside down and backwards, which may disorient some players* There is an image of an 8-bit man sitting on a toilet, could not recall if his genitalia was drawn with three pixels or if it that is part of his first two legs* There may be some occasional language when reading murals such as ""sh*t""* Some dark themes			"

If you try to restart the whole game, because you think you have died to many times, you will lose and get even more frostrated. Keep trying again and again, and after a few hours you will get into it.

												Finally finished Rogue Legacy today (NG+ awaits), and I think I can confidently say this is on my shortlist for 2013 Game of the Year whenever GAF runs the thread. It has so much I look for in a game- Gameplay- Humor- Soundtrack- Infuriating Difficulty- A tickling of Childhood MemoriesRogue Legacy draws upon a lot of what made the NES and SNES such a popular console, at least in the Lucha-Household. It takes a basic concept (platforming) and twists into a complex hazard filled world that slowly builds up in infuriating difficulty as you die and reborn.Abilities are gained and unlocked with each generation, depending on the bounty you collected in a previous life - double/triple jump, dash, flying, etc. Those skills might first appear trivial, but they become almost essential as the game progresses. If not only to kill and avoid mobs, but to unlock some of the hidden chests, and the challenge chests.You see, Cellar Door have been clever with this game, and are aware of what abilities it has given the player and makes sure that the player WILL have to use them at some point. They're not just window dressing.The simple nature of the game carries over to the 'fighting system' too. 1 Button for Sword, 1 for Magic, 1 for special ability and another for jump. However, it's how you link these simple buttons together that can cause chaos, panic and eventually joy.Why?Well, it's the mobs. The assortment of mobs again are simple and have simple attacks, but it's the pairings and timings of the mobs when grouped together that become a headache, a frustrating headache that is rewarding to dodge and kill without being hit.However, it's not a game that takes itself seriously, as there are ton of humor in this game too, as can be seen from the game's trailer. It promotes flatulent heroes, dwarves, colourblind heroes and so many other insane combinations of flaws and gift-like-traits.This traits can make or break a generation run through the castle.What's more is the game has a progression system, linked to a castle which you build up with Gold you gain with every run. As you unlock new classes, or boost your attack/health, the castle grows, and new traits and classes start to appear in your gene pool.Words can't really do the game justice, as reading this back I'm making it sound like a really basic game, but it's so much more. If this had been released in the 90s on the SNES it would be regarded today as one of the SNES' greatest games.I found it to be a hugely enjoyable and fun game, and despite the nature of the beast (it's a game that WANTS to kill you and WILL kill you), I never really felt the enjoyment dissipate.(as a side this is the first game I've actively sought to buy the OST for).

												Everyone has a game to which he/she comes back again and again to have some fun. This is that game for me, a bit surprising as I'm a casual player so rogue-lite's are not usually my cup of tea.What the game is all aboutRogue legacy is an action-platformer dungeon crawler.The levels and enemies are randomized (from a pool) but there are always 4 main sections (in order or increasing challenge): main castle (centre), forest (right), tower (top) and dungeon (bottom).Every time the hero dies, a new heir needs to be selected from 3 randomly generated characters (again, from a pool of classes, but with random characteristics from dwarfinism/gigantism to IBS).All the money is passed to the next generation, but you'll need to forfeit it before starting a new game. This basically means that you're encouraged to spend all the money possible in the castle (opening new or upgraded classes, upgrading energy, mana, power, armour, etc), in the blacksmith (upgrades to the armour and sword) or the enchantress (upgrades like double jump, speed, easier or harder enemies).Basically, the objective is to go to the castle and get as much money as possible to upgrade our hero.Once the hero is strong enough, you can battle 4 bosses (1 in each section) to open up the last battle. And then, a +1 harder version of the game opens. And then a +2. And as many +N as you want to keep the challenge going.The good parts* The game is just plain fun
* It is never too hard for non-hardcore players
* The +N versions of the game can keep more experienced players interested 
* The upgrading system makes you come back to ""jsut another game""
The bad parts* There are a few annoying bugs (mostly projectiles going through walls)
* There is a mid-point in the game that is mainly grinding for gold
Final recomendationI had way more fun with this than with more expensive AAA games. Given that it is frequently on sale, there is no excuse not to buy it!			"

												A fun little roguelike platformer. The grind can be a little annoying after he 10 hour mark, but you'll be able to beat it soon after that point. Cute graphics and soundtrack, tight controls, but it won't keep you hooked like Binding of Isaac will. Once you finish it, the enemies and level layouts are insanely difficult and you likely won't feel motivated to continue to grind your ability upgrades. Thats when I put the game to rest. A good 17 hours played. No regrets. I'd suggest it for $5 easily, maybe $7.50.			"

												While the game is fun, the boss battles and general elements can be extremely overwhelming. In Ponce de Leon's boss, there are flying spike balls as well as fireballs that disappear every 10 seconds or so. He also trails you the entire time. While the game is fun and its challenge is mostly based on skill, it's moments like these that kind of sour the experience. "

												Let me just start by saying, this game a masterpiece. it takes concepts from older games and flips them on their heads. It takes old platforming and RPG elements and combines them with rogue-like gameplay and makes a whole new kind of game. The difficulty is gradual and you can take it at your own pace. Personally I liked to go in, get as much money as possible so I can upgrade, and repeat until I thought I was ready for that boss. Definately an improvement over the game that they made about the guy trying not to ♥♥♥♥ his pants. I get into more detail about this game in my review on teh yootoob, so check it out if you get the chance.

												Listen here and listen well.This game is a true gem. Metroid-vania 2D game with charming graphics. Not good enough? How about Metroid-vania roguelike? Still not good enough? How about fricking Metroid-vania roguelike with plenty of customization to mix and try to find the combination of runes and equipment just for you. Still not satifsied?What if I were to tell you that each of your new characters wont be the same? How about a dwarf with ADHD that will run so fast he will stab enemies before he will even get to their shins? Or how about a giant with colorblindness and vertigo, which won't get you too far in the game. And now add to this random character generator possiblity of classes, and I guarantee you that one typical tactic won't work everytime.And as it goes with roguelikes, this is no walk in the park. But believe me when I say you will get your money worth. This comes from someone who played the game for over 40 hours, unlocked every single achievement, bought everything that could be bought in game and reached New Game +6.Buy it, and hopefully love it as much as I did.

												This game caught me off guard for a game mechanic I am not used too....Death.So firstly this is a old school platformer that is extremly diffcult and expands upon this with death....death what a neat concept.Anyways when you die...that it game over your dead...BUT thankfully you had kids before you attacked the castle. Now you kid is going to pick up your sword and try again for you....but unfortunetly your child has giantism and is huge and easy to be hit....or maybe it is near sighted and can't see more the 2 inches around them clearly. How about vertigo and the world is upside down? How about dyslexic and the controls are backwards?Shockingly fun game mechanic that both challenges you to survive more then 3 minutes but rewards you if you don't. The closest game I could suggest it plays like is may old school Ghost and Goblins with the suggested death mechanic. There are also some light RPG elements as you save a portion of your gold and can improve your skills, equipment and other things.If you like platformers and are in the mood for a challenge and unexpected surprises. This game is GREAT!			"

												Rogue Legacy feels a lot like a kid's castlevania. This game tries hard to combine minimal rogue elements with 2d dungeon crawling. I'd suggest adding way more variability in enemies and bosses, more complicated hereditary diseases/buffs, more areas, and more randomization of rooms, and I'd play it forever. It might be within the developers interests to release a devkit for people to submit bosses/enemies or even written concepts for the game to make it better. Has a lot of room to grow, but I don't see it growing yet sadly.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a rogue-lite game that combines the randomized levels with the metroidvania style. Every run you have a different character with different traits that either hinder you, help you, or are just there for cosmetic reasons. With your long line of family members you embark on a journey to battle different bosses, encounter loot that you can use to upgrade your castle which gives you new character classes and many other bonuses. There is some grinding in the game so prepare for that but overall if you like rogue-lite or roguelike-like games you'll love this one.			"

												Another of my favorite games on Steam. This game has everything I like all wrapped up into 1 game. It is a roguelike game, so expect to die a lot. I usually don't like roguelikes, but this game added the most important part of enjoyment for me; being able to upgrade your character after every run. You have a castle that you upgrade with all the gold you earned from your last run. These upgrades consist of making your character's statistics better and all sorts of different things related to the game. This makes every run feel worthwhile to me, instead of having to start at basically nothing everytime I start a new run.Theres a lot of equipment and abilities to find in treasure chests. Your character's visual appearence will change with each new piece of equipment you put on (I love games that do that). The storyline is also simple, but I really like how the game told it. There are a lot of interesting journal entries that I recommend reading to add to your gameplay experience. It really puts what your character is doing into perspective. The boss fights are all excellent. None of them are cheap and all of them are expertly designed. If you can't beat them at first, then just focus on trying to find more chests with equipment and upgrades, or finding more gold to upgrade your castle.After beating a boss, you will be able to challenge the remix version of that boss. These are the same bosses that you fought while going through the castle, but they have all been changed to make the fights more difficult. They are A LOT more difficult. You will use a specifically made character for each fight, instead of the one you have been using throughout the game. Levels and equipment effect nothing. Its all about your skill for these fights. Look at how low the Steam percentages are for the remix boss achievements. They are still a ton of fun trying to beat though. The music is also great in this game. I have a couple new favorite songs now after playing this (I'm looking at you title screen and ending theme). The game will last you around 25 hours and you can go through New Game + as many times as you like. Everything keeps getting harder the more playthroughs of the game you complete.			"

This game is great! I highly recommend it to anyone interested in difficult platforming. Even with 100+ hours, I have yet to beat it, yet I still have fun everytime I play. I did have to restart once as it is not supported by Steam's save game sync. And yet, every night when I sit down and think about what I want to play, Rogue Legacy is always thought about.About the game:Start off as a naive, so weak you probably won't make it past the first few screens. Kill enough monsters and get that money so you can upgrade your skills. Hopefuly you get enough to upgrade SOMETHING, or else you must surrender a portion of it to the gatekeeper in order to play again. Just make sure not to buy an upgrade you don't need as every purchase will raise the cost of any future purchases. Run through the castle and discover chests with recipes for armor, weapons, and runes; all of which add to your base stats or include special abilites such as vampirism, flight, double-jumping, dashing, extra gold pick-ups, and so many more. I've never ran through the same castle twice but I have seen the same room on occasion, usually just a simple hallway or great-room or something. Each run through the castle features it's own surprises. Pick your hero wisely, and don't forget to equip the right equipment for the right hero for the right type of run. Eventually, get strong enough to tackle those bosses. One of the great things about this game is that, even if you are bad at reflex-based platforming, if you play it enough you will eventually be powerful enough to tackle the bosses without even flinching. Also full of fun mini-bosses that drop their own 'super-chests' .I can't reccommend this game enough, I have had so much fun with it. I hate buying things when they are not on sale, but if you are looking for something to get lost in and make you feel like a total castle-romping badass, Rogue Legacy is the game for you and you shouldn't wait to play it!

												One of the best games I have ever purchased on steam, a lot of people will say negative things about the fact you die too much or that everything gets really expensive quite fast. The dying is a main, if not essential part of the Rougelike Genre of games. This game utilises dying to improve your ""legacy"" whether it be a new class to choose from, an upgrade to a class you already have or a stat boost, the game makes every upgrade a little more expensive each time you buy one but thats the equivalent to the lowest value coin found in the castle. It is a bit slow to start off with as you lose every last piece of gold you earned to re-enter the castle.Story wise this game doesn't really have much. You have the tutorial and the log entries, which provide some background to the start of the game. Its not brilliant, but it does provide you with the reason behind the actions done in the tutorial.This game also has your heroes with ""traits"". These are actual known medical conditions (to some extent) and affect your hero in different ways like I.B.S which makes your hero fart to things like vertigo which flips the games screen upside down. Each hero can have up to 2 different traits and may very rarely have none.The castle is randomly generated each time, unless you decide to get an upgeade that allows you to ""lock it down"". Which allows you to practice bosses or try to reach that chest you couldn't reach last time. These chests can provide runes, which can give you different benefits and come in 5 varieties (for each main piece of equipment you have), you can only have 1 rune in each piece of equipment and you can also get equipment blueprints, which allow you to spend your gold after you die to unlock and maybe even equip (providing you have the weight allowance that is).The enemies have 3 different tiers basic, advanced and expert, but you won't come across any expert tier enemies till you have beaten the game twice, but they still can spawn and you will be facing expert enemies a lot after you beat it for your first time, the bosses and mini-bosses are a nice challenge aswell as they need you to think ahead. After you beat a boss you can find its ""obol"" (except the 5th one, you just need to beat all the remix bosses to be able to find its obol) which allows you to face its remixed version where you use a specific preset character, these are a true test of skill and will take many attempts and beating them all gives you a real sense of accomplishment, once you beat the final boss you are sent into New Game + mode, where you do it all again with harder enemies and the enemies are all now at the advanced tier (expert if its NB++ onwards)I know I have recommended this, but if you don't like games where you die a lot, or games that get repetitive quite fast then this game isn't for you.

												This game is awesome, addictive as hell and very challenging! Rogue Legacy is a roguelike game where if your character dies, he dies permanently, but don´t worry! Your child will inherit your gold and castle as well as your burdens and responsabilities. Even when you die all the money you get can be spent on upgrading your castle (meaning you will upgrade your stats, gain new classes and abilities), buying armor or runes so the future generations will be stronger. It´s a creative and well balanced system that challenges the veteran players while at the same time gives an opportunity to the newest ones to the genre to beat and enjoy the game. The story is simple: You must find the traitor, who killed the king, inside a cursed castle. This castle will have different rooms every time you enter with another character (unless you want to give up 60% of the gold you find inside if I´m not mistaken) which is also a good mechanic as it makes the game more dynamic. You will also have many different classes to choose from as well as hilarious characters traits. The soundtrack is also nice. Now for the most challenging yet rewardind thing in the game: The Bosses, in particular the Remixed Bosses. I don´t remember the last time I had this level of difficulty in beating a boss! Thank you Cellar Door Games, it was rewarding as it was difficult! I even recorded beating two of them, which I never did before in a game. It is indeed a challenging game but given enough time, you will learn to improve and master the mechanics of the game. There are other features in this game like new game plus or new game plus plus or ... Well in fact there´s countless. What I mean is everytime you beat the game the enemies get stronger (they level up but not only that as they will be upgraded versions with more deadlier attacks). I saw on youtube a person who was playing a game 40+! Well I beat the game twice doing everything and beating every boss and I have 41 hours of gameplay so I think it´s a pretty good game in terms of longevity. Overall of course I recommend this game, if you like the genre and want to be challanged than this game is for you! Recommended 100%!			"

												Great rogue-like game. You go into a castle to kill 4 bosses so that you eventually can kill the main-villain-boss. In the castle you get money by killing enemis and destroying things. This money can be spent on upgrades and equipment.Whenever you die you play as your offspring, basicly you get a new character with new abilities and powers but keep your upgrades. It's a really fun game and actually  has enjoyable ""grinding"". If you're good you can complete things faster, otherwise you can always keep upgrading your stuff. This is one of the few games I've actually went back to and actually got all the equipment/upgrades in, it's that enjoyable :)			"

												Well, I have hit level sixty and have almost 10 hours in-game, guess it's time for a review.I had ALOT of people recommend this game to me.  I saw it on sale on The Humble Store for $2.99 and figured ""what the heck"".  I am a big platfomer fan and this does NOT dissapoint.  Each ""Castle"" level is randomly generated.  Alot of people compare this game to spelunky because of this.  To me there really isn't even a comparison.  Spelunky is more simple where RL uses leveling and RPG elements.  I really, really, REALLY like this game.  It is brutally hard in the beginning, but as you level and progress the difficulty curve lets up a bit and leaves room for experimentation.

												I would give this a neutral or mixed rating rather than a positive one If I could, but I don't feel like this game deserves a negative rating, so I'll just rate it up instead. So anyway, If I had to describe Rogue Legacy in three words I'd call it ""Roguelike The Game."" Because the only really original thing in Rogue Legacy is the descendant system. Instead of respawning as the same character or choosing from a list of pre set character every time you die, you instead choose one of three randomly generated descendants. These descendants all have different classes, traits, and even some character model differences that do play into the gameplay. It doesn't do enough though. Sure the characters all have different strengths and weakness, but besides height and some weight traits most of the traits just make the game harder or have such small bonuses that they really change gameplay. No matter what, you'll always be running around whacking things and collecting as much gold as you can. The only thing that changes is how easy or difficult it becomes. Honestly, I feel like this system would be more impactful if you couldn't choose a descendent because it would mean that you couldn't just negate the system by picking the character with none or the least negative traits. Even if it might've come off as unfair I feel like it would've made death more meaningful because if you had a really good character then you might play more defensively because you could never be sure if the descendent the game would next time would be any good, and that would really help build tension and make you more hesitant to taking risks for loot. Besides that mechanic though, It's pretty much everything you've come to expect from a Roguelike side scrolling action platformer. On each run you'll play through a new set of levels with varying sizes and layouts, enemies and traps are randomly placed within these levels and use projectiles and attack patterns that are difficult to memorize and avoid, and the game's difficulty curve starts off hard and only gets harder the farther into the castle you get. Even with tons of upgrades, loot, and experience you can die very quickly if you get too cocky (or simply bored with replaying the same types of levels every time you die) and stop paying attention. Even though the game has a similar appearance to, and references Castlevania, notice that I didn't call this a metroidvania game. That’s because when you get down to it Rogue Legacy really isn’t one. You have access to pretty much every area and boss in the game right from the start. The only things blocking you from accessing them is the ever increasing difficulty of the enemies and traps in each new area, how many upgrades and items you’ve acquired, and how good you get at avoiding projectiles. Sometimes it even just comes down to whether you get a good castle layout or not. If you're really good at the game though you can get through the entire thing with just a starting character and the default equipment. Now you might be expecting me to tell you about the faults of the game, and while there's obvious things like the jumping feeling somewhat floaty and the hit detection being off at times, everything else is entirely subjective. I feel like while the random generation of the game keeps it from getting stale too early, it lacks the refined and well designed structure that something with set levels and characters has. As a result the experience of Rogue Legacy simply has none of the longevity of a well designed Metroidvania, even though it references them. I also feel like the game subscribes to the notion that a hard game equals a good game. At many times Rogue Legacy well simply fill a room with tons of enemies that use tricky attack patterns and shoot fast and hard to avoid projectiles, traps that make you constantly have to move and put yourself in danger, and makes the rooms chaotic messes that have no flow or gradual build up to anything and calls that finished. You pretty much just get bombarded with cluttered rooms from the start and this never changes. Simply making a game hard or random does not mean it's well designed. Take a game like Dark Souls for example. Dark Souls is a hard game, sure, but if that's all it had going for it then it wouldn't have become the smash hit it eventually ended up being. It had great level design, an interesting combat system, was surprisingly forgiving and easy on the player at times when it could’ve been much harder, and had a mysterious world and setting filled with strange and eccentric characters who went through their own arcs without the player’s input. Rogue Legacy simply doesn't have any of that, and unfortunately it just isn't a very memorable experience as a result. Even the potential story elements which could’ve been fleshed out more, like the diary entries of the ancestor you find or the fact that you the player are throwing members of your own family into what is essentially a meat grinder for personal gain go nowhere. In the end, your enjoyment of Rogue Legacy will simply depend on how much you enjoy Roguelikes as a genre. Because if you're going into it thinking that it will change your opinion of Roguelikes, or because you think it will have really innovative and original elements or design not seen before, then unfortunately you'll just end up being disappointed.

												Rogue Legacy is an indie platformer developed by Cellar Door Games. Personally, I am not into platformers but after playing this game, it has changed my mind. The game features randomly generated levels where the player has to go through in order to get to the bosses. After all of the four bosses have been defeated, the final boss door will unlock. However, there is a catch to this… You will not be able to kill all of the four bosses and the final boss in one run. You would have to die over and over again but with each death, you’ll get stronger and stronger and eventually, you’ll be able to slay all of the bosses.Pros+Fluid gameplay+Great soundtrack+Great variety of heirs+Great variety of enemies+Good sense of humour (character traits like I.B.S which stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome)+Unique bosses+Full controller support+Steam trading cards+Able to run on low-end PCsCons-No Steam Cloud-Gold farming may get a bit repetitive over time-Controls are not as good on the keyboard and mouse than it is on the controllerMost of the charm that comes from this game would be its difficulty. It is a pretty challenging game and there has been comparisons of this game with Dark Souls. Some people have dubbed this game to be the platformer version of Dark Souls. So if you’re into hard games, then I highly recommend that you buy this title and try it for yourself. This game also has many other good points going for it such as the ones I’ve listed above. It has one of the coolest soundtracks I’ve ever heard from a video game. My favourite soundtrack from this game would be the one during the third boss fight. Rogue Legacy is 15 dollars and I would say it is pretty much worth every penny but if you’re still doubting whether you would like this game or not, then wait for the sales to come and grab it when the right opportunity arises.FINAL RATING: 8/10.

												Oh man, Rogue Legacy had its hooks in me for a good month or two, during which time I played the game practically daily. There was no cloud save feature at the time (not sure if this has been added in a patch) so I was emailing my save file between home and work every evening. Anyway, the game gets a ton of stuff right, specifically its charming presentation and that sticky ""just one more go"" roguelike design. There's a very nice mixture of skill-based platforming, stat-based character building, and a dash of pure luck that comes hand-in-hand with procedurally-generated content. Despite its finer qualities, Rogue Legacy does suffer from a pretty unbalanced character progression curve, especially as it relates to the cost of upgrades in the early game. Difficulty spikes throughout, which is also very frustrating. And once you have experienced all the palette swaps, the enemy variety is somewhat lacking. However, like many of my favorite games ever, it is this ""rough around the edges"" quality that makes Rogue Legacy that much more enjoyable. Highly recommended!			"

												Okay, what is happening to me, i'm digging into rogue like platformers. To make it clear, at first i was pretty much skeptical about this game, but then again thanks to Northernlion's LPs i wanted to play Rogue Legacy myself. Never thought i will ever enjoy it. Grind and yes gameplay is based on grinding gold as much as possible in one life, with it you can unlock and upgrade various things in your manor. Search for loot within entire castle either its random rune or piece of equipment. Luckily after beating last boss you can continue to play as NEW GAME+. It's only matter of time when everything will be upgraded and then you can enjoy real challenge of game as it is based on player's skill rather than luck. There is much to tell, but i will end here.Ah and just as soon you have some experience with entire castle you always will have that feeling - ""Just one more run"". ;DOverall Rogue Legacy is one of best platformers which i have played so far.Score: 9/10.

												Go ahead and buy it!This was the most enjoyable, addicting, and challenging 30hrs I've spent platform gaming in some time. I'll throw my recommendation on the massive pile of recommendations this game already has. I got hooked quick and didn't stop until I hit the top. I don't normally 100% games or pay attention to ""achievements"" but I went all out on this one! I couldn't help myself, it is that good.I got it on a steep sale of 2.99USD but 14.99USD is not unreasonable for what you get out of it. (But of course still wait for a sale of some sort.)Now if I had to FORCE out a complaint or two at gunpoint they would be; 1. Be very aware that every time you beat the game the difficulty will increase substantially. I think I was ahead of the designed curve on my first and second finishes which made my third playthrough feel more like punishment for beating the game rather than any reward. Some thirty or so ruthless deaths later I had stockpiled enough gold to unlock some perks that helped with this issue and I got back to enjoying the game. Other than that issue this game actually avoids ever turning into too much of a ""grind"". Really scales super smooth. 2. Certain enemy's detection of the player kind of eliminates the perceived appeal of a few specials and dashes. You would think you could use a dash to the opposite side of a turret to land a quick strike but it will instantly be facing and firing on schedule at you the exact pixel you cross over. Neither are real issues, just trying to find a negative for argument's sake. But honestly, this game is darn near perfect for what it is. Buy without apprehension and enjoy!			"

												Not a bad game when weighed on its own merits, but there's no reason not to play Spelunky instead.The RPG elements and the ""child with unique attributes"" system might pique your interest initially, but I have found they detract from the gameplay. Buying upgrades is neat at first, since even when you lose you get the consolation prize of being able to improve your stats, but soon enough it turns into a grind. As for the latter, many traits are only good for a one-off joke.Most of the (procedurally-generated) screens offer little challenge, so it also feels fairly repetitive and drawn-out after a while. Just... just play Spelunky instead, it's a much tighter variation on the same formula.			"

												Listen up bud, this game's an odd taste adventure and may be an aquired taste.But if you continue at it, you're in for a splendid meal. With elements of platforming, spices of castlevania and a unique ingredient that puts a spin on Permadeath.You see, when your character's finished up, you get a choice of three random meals to put on the grill. Not all of them will be to your liking, granted, but it can be used as an excuse to try something new.When you're done choosing your meal, you can improve your stats at the manor to improve your chances of finishing a meal.The story here is told through notes, about an adventurer who has went through the same castle as you are.Don't skip them unless you are going for a record.A small warning here, this chef is not really used to making platforming meals. Don't let it turn you off though.			"

												'Frustration is fun' must have been the motto of the designers.  I will destroy them.  Not because this is a bad game.  It's a great game - the graphics are perfectly thought out as a silly retro platformer, the controls are super tight and worked out of the box with my ancient POS logitech gamepad, the designs are consistently challenging.  Everything you wanted from a roguelike plus everything you expected from the best of the NES/SNES platforming generation of games.  No, the reason I will destroy the developers is because this is a great game made by people who hate you and especially hate progression.  Let me explain.  Complaint the first: Charon.  There is no bleeding reason for Charon to be in this game.  Every time I have to pay the toll without buying an upgrade, I hit alt-f4, because I hate him and what he does to the gameplay that much.  Complaint the second: Upgrade costs.  The game calculates your upgrade costs by adding an amount, N, to the base cost of every upgrade.  N is figured from the number of upgrades you have bought already.  (Same deal at the smithy and the enchantress, but harsher.)  The cumulative effect of this is to create an atmosphere of wildly upspiraling inflation.  I would cheerfully endure either of these challenges by themselves, but both together is unforgivable.  This game makes me too angry to play for more than a few minutes at a time, because about half of my sessions end too soon for me to make any progression.			"

												Like any Rogue-based kind of game, dying isn't so much a matter of if, but moreso a matter of when.  Thankfully, dying is not nearly as agonizing or painful as it could be.  You keep whatever treasure you had gained up 'til your death, which can be used to purchase either stat upgrades, equipment, or runes.  Progression is pretty slow at first, but over time you do start seeing advancement in all of these areas.  Since you do have to work for and earn progress in the game, it feels rewarding as you become more capable of exploring larger areas of the castle.  This is especially poignant later on as you overcome the hardest parts of the game, because earlier you were dying repeatedly in only the first couple of rooms.  One element that helps this sense of advancement is seeing the myriad of enemies and the different varieties of each one.  Each enemy has 3 levels of difficulty, with visible differences and changes in how they attack.  Each one also has either a mini-boss or boss equivalent as well, and developing in the game to the point where you can defeat all of them is a milestone you end up striving for.The game is balanced really well as far as a sense of making progress because there are four distinct areas on the map to explore, with each one being clearly different from the other in respect to the color configuration on the map, background setting, music cues, difficulty/damage taken, and which enemies spawn.  Early on you will immediately recognize when you've inadvertantly found one of these new areas, and if you want to live, you will flee from the area as soon as possible.  It's programmed quite well as far as generating random set-ups that feel unique each time, even though there are only so many pre-programmed styles and arrangements of rooms available.  You don't feel like you just played the same map earlier, even if you recognize similar room layouts here and there.A nice aspect of the game design is the variety of classes and traits available.  The game designers allowed their sense of humor to shine in some traits, while others are very creative and have significant impact on the gameplay/design.  There were times where I liked all of the choices available and also times where I didn't like any of them, but that's just the roll of the dice.  You'll wind up finding which ones you can't stand or love yourself.Finally, I like the additional boss remix challenges available in the game.  They are quite gruelling, but allow for rapid, unlimited retries.  However, if someone doesn't want to bother, they can still beat the main part of the game, as it takes far less then maxed out stats to vanquish all of the bosses.  I've beaten it twice myself, and I still haven't purchased all of the upgrades yet.  I suppose that would be one complaint I have, since the gold requirements to buy everything is so excessive, though it's thankfully not a necessary aspect to win.  Overall I highly recommend this game, as though it can be disheartening to die, it only winds up giving the player a chance to upgrade and try again stronger than last time.			"

I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who misses the good old days of punishing 2D platformers, and anyone who just plain needs a break from attention demanding games. You can pick this up and get it whithin 20 minutes or so, and put it down anytime you die (and you will die.

												Welcome to Rogue LegacyYOU JUST DIEDWelcome to Rogue LegacyYOU JUST DIEDThats the gist of this game. Welcome to the Dark Souls of Side Scrollers. Except each time you die, you rejoin the fight as a descendant of your previous character - and each character has conditions such as colorblind - where everything is in black and white. OR THE ONE - Where the map looks like something out of tron as a joke about the Matrix. This game will keep you busy for a rather long time as you struggle to make it through the constant changes in the map and defeat the bosses hidden in each zone. Though each attempt earns you gold you can spend to make the next character stronger, gear you find is kept for each new character, making each attempt a better attempt than the last.FEAR NOT - For when one of the bosses is defeated it remains defeated.At the posting of this review I have only defeated the boss within the castle and am struggling with the forest.If you aren't playing this game yet, you really should be.

												Undoubtedly the best rogue-like game I have ever played.  A word of warning:You will die a lot.  And I mean constantly.  But only for the first couple hours.Slowly you will level, and simultaneously with each of those hard earned improvements you will learn the behavior of the critters you are faced to deal with.  Between the two the game slowly becomes managable.Very very few of the deaths feel cheap.  Even when you enter a room and suddenly are beset on all sides and death comes within moments, even then the death rarely feels more than momentarily frustrating.I couldn't recommend more.  As good an indie game as there ever was.  The devs did a magnificient job both on depth of content and fun.  I'm nearly thirty hours into it and feel like I'm probably only half way.  Crazy for a game that cost me nearly nothing on a sale, and particularly for one that I have enjoyed so much.  One of the best games I have played in years.FYI: I played the first five hours with just the keyboard then decided to try with a controller.  It is worlds better with a controller.			"

												An unconventional Metroidvania/Rogue-Like, Rogue Legacy hits all the right notes.  The way characters are generated is a wonderful change of pace from the usual conventions used in perma-death games.  Increasing your stats and abilities are done through an also unconventional system, where you buy stat increases between deaths.  The weapons, items and armor have several great effects and interactions.  Anybody who  says Rogue Legacy is lacking in 'RPG conventions' is dead wrong.  They're looking for a single skill tree packed with nonsense, and tons of randomly generated equipment, most of which you sell to a vendor for coppers any way.  Instead you have to be creative in selecting enhancements and gear, making decisions that fit your needs or compensate for the... inadequacies that some Heroes will be born with.Combat is fluid and fun, enemies are varied and dangerous.  Feature-rich, very re-playable (to a point), and well made; Rogue Legacy is a different take on the Rogue-Like genre that succeeds at almost everything it takes on.  One of my top five Rogue-Likes available on any platform.  And, unlike many independent forays in to these genres, the game does not feel incomplete or lacking in content.			"

In the beggining it can be frustrating, but once you get a feel for the game and manage to survive long enough each round to get a nice amount of money for upgrades, the rounds will get slightly easier.Classes and Runes: Some challenges will be made easier (or ""not impossible) if you use the right adventurer class, equipment and pick the right runes (that can give you abilities like double jump and dashing - crucial for some challenges).Syndromes: Since you can choose which adventurer to use, in most cases you can pick an adventurer that have positive benefits from syndromes (one of them makes you undetectable to mechanical spike traps; another shows the position of enemies on your map), which makes the syndromes not much of a main feature at all.Platformer: It may not appeal to you (I personally am not a fan of platformers), but those who like the platformer genre will have it's classical feel - and platforming skills is required to survive longer or beat some challenges. Those who are not very good at it can find a way around it (with upgrades, mostly).May feel repetitive: Even though the castle's chambers are random in each round, there's around 4 different types of castle ""areas"" and their monsters are always the same. Each area has upgraded versions of previous monsters (and some introduces new ones), showing little diversity.Getting upgrades and the sense of achievement of surviving previously impossible areas helps, but eventually you'll wonder if all that you're doing is part in a grindfest.Conclusion:All in all, a nice little game worth $5~$10 if you're into it, but research a little about it so you won't get frustrated and leave it unplayed in your library.Remember that Losing is Fun and make that colorblind, OCD Knight bring in some money!

												Oh baby, quite the little game here. First off, ITS HARD. Hard platforming, hard bullet hell dodging and hard timing of attacks. But man, its fun!The gist here is your decendents take up your sword when you die and ""inherit"" all the gold you managed to gather and all your upgrades/gear. So, even though you'll die possibly hundreds of times, your heirs will continually grow stronger and stronger as all the upgrades and equipment you manage to get will keep being passed down to the new heir.Its addicting!Now, your heirs come in all shapes and sizes such as midgets that can fit through secret tunnels, giants that are harder to dodge with but have a giant sword swing arc, colorblinds, heroes that fart when you jump... haha, theres a lot of ""genetic"" traits that your heirs can have - some good, some bad!There are classes such as the high damage, speedy but frail Hokage, the tank Barbarian that can use a Fus Ro Dah shout to knock away enemies and projectiles, a mage with massive mana pool who gets mana back when you kill foe and a bunch others. Each class has its own special power that sets it apart as well as different stat modifiers.Good game, but don't expect to face-roll your way through it! It took me over 80 lives to beat the game and now I'm in New Game + and getting my ♥♥♥ kicked! XD "

												This is a pretty fun game. Its gameplay is very much in the style of metroidvania for the most part, but it adds some other cool things too like skills and character progression. The levels are randomly generated and your character gets randomized attributes when you start to keep things interesting. Difficulty wise its pretty tough, expect to die a lot until you unlock some stuff. You also have to start the levels (which will change) completely over and pick a new character when you die, however you can unlock a guy later that lets you keep your previous level layout so progression isn't impossible. Highly recommended if metroidvainia and/or roguelikes are your thing.			"

												As the name suggests, Rogue Legacy plays around with the conventions of 'Rogue-like' genre that's become popular recently, the game includes ways to circumvent the random level generation that is normally associated with the genre & there is a money based upgrade system in the game.  When you die you keep the money you collected during your run and that can be spent on upgrades to make your descendants stronger (which where the 'Legacy' part of the name comes in).I really enjoyed this game, the controls feel just right for the kind of precise 2D platforming the game requires.  The game has basically an infinite New Game+ mode which makes the game harder everytime you enter a new New Game+ but I feel you'll eventually get bored of the game after 2 or 3 New Game+ runs due to the limited environments & enemy types.

												One of the best Rogue-like games on the market. I picked this game up during the steam sales in the summer for about $4.00 but would have definetly payed the full price after learning how amazing this game is. With tons of different skills and weapons / armor that do completely different things, you really can choose to play however you wish. It also has the perfect amount of difficulty, the game starts out rather hard, but when you finally find some patterns and some skills you can finally take down the first boss! The game remains challenging with different modes that are hard no matter your level to add some replayability, as well as the monster+ levelsIn conclusion... pick up this game, you wont regret it.

												Welcome to Rogue LegacyYOU JUST DIEDWelcome to Rogue LegacyYOU JUST DIEDThats the gist of this game. Welcome to the Dark Souls of Side Scrollers. Except each time you die, you rejoin the fight as a descendant of your previous character - and each character has conditions such as colorblind - where everything is in black and white. OR THE ONE - Where the map looks like something out of tron as a joke about the Matrix. This game will keep you busy for a rather long time as you struggle to make it through the constant changes in the map and defeat the bosses hidden in each zone. Though each attempt earns you gold you can spend to make the next character stronger, gear you find is kept for each new character, making each attempt a better attempt than the last.FEAR NOT - For when one of the bosses is defeated it remains defeated.At the posting of this review I have only defeated the boss within the castle and am struggling with the forest.If you aren't playing this game yet, you really should be.

												Undoubtedly the best rogue-like game I have ever played.  A word of warning:You will die a lot.  And I mean constantly.  But only for the first couple hours.Slowly you will level, and simultaneously with each of those hard earned improvements you will learn the behavior of the critters you are faced to deal with.  Between the two the game slowly becomes managable.Very very few of the deaths feel cheap.  Even when you enter a room and suddenly are beset on all sides and death comes within moments, even then the death rarely feels more than momentarily frustrating.I couldn't recommend more.  As good an indie game as there ever was.  The devs did a magnificient job both on depth of content and fun.  I'm nearly thirty hours into it and feel like I'm probably only half way.  Crazy for a game that cost me nearly nothing on a sale, and particularly for one that I have enjoyed so much.  One of the best games I have played in years.FYI: I played the first five hours with just the keyboard then decided to try with a controller.  It is worlds better with a controller.			"

												Solid ""rogue-like"" or whatever you wish to call it. Combines elements of platformers, RPG and the ""rogue like"" type games. The one thing that really stands out, besides the cool idea of ""Traits"" that can enhance/hinder your player a bit, is what they have done to mask/replace generic ""grinding"" from traditional RPG's. ANy fan of RPG's knows that grinding is, unfortunately, a necesarry evil. However this game has done well with taking the ""grind"" and maskng it up pretty well with it's style. See, instead of roaming the same forest, with the same character killing the same monotonous beasts over and over, you get a ew ""forest"" and character with each playthrough. Adding in the ability to mix-and-match some of the equipment/runes makes for a lot more relayability than one would expect. There are some pretty neat combinations of items/traits that you can put together for soe solid runs through the castle. I highly recommend this game. If ""grinding"" is something that annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, this game and it's approach really do help. Do you still realize you're essentially grinding? Yeah, you kinda do for the most part....but it is A LOT more tolearble (and can even be fun!) with the way this game has handled it in it's approach.			"

July 12, 2015This is the first time I've really considered keeping an original review entirely for reference. My opinions on Rogue Legacy have shifted substantially since my first review. I still recommend the game, but with some caveats.After some time away from the game, I found the combat to be clunkier and shallow. Armed with short range and a delayed swing, combat can feel sloppy. Once the enemies gain speed and more attacks, your sole weapon feels underwhelming. Enemies are primarily ranged, and you'll eventually wish for more mobility and a smaller hitbox. By my third playthrough,some rooms became true bullet-hells, except randomly constructed instead of the tightly crafted affairs in other games. Later rooms can be more hectic than any of the bossfights, and some rooms will have unavoidable damage with the number of enemies filling the screen with projectiles.I do feel like the game is very fair in the first two completions, even into the third with Difficulty decreasing runes. Beyond that, the game starts to suffer from an abundance of enemy projectiles without the means to avoid them. The health system is a bandaid fix, with each room slowly wittling your health down unless you get random food drops, or abuse life drain on slimes. By 30 hours, I'd seen (almost) everything, and I don't enjoy the game nearly as much. Unfortunately, even with all my complete runs and dozens of partials, I have yet to see the plant miniboss. Until the RNG decides to bless me, I have to do partial runs just to search for this miniboss. It's the only thing keeping me from 100%, and it's ridiculous. I've killed other minibosses over 5 times, and never seen just one.I loved Rogue Legacy. It is a great value. But the way it is designed, it ends up running into a wall. This is a rougelite that can (and should) wrap up nicely in 30 hours of play. Rogue purists may dislike that the replayability runs dry. It's a great game to start in the genre, and can be as easy or hard as you want by New Game +1. Just be careful running that +1 much higher, or you may grow weary.Original review:I'm incredibly hooked on Rogue Legacy since I picked it up. Spelunky was pushing me to improve my skills after I bought that recently, but little issues bothered me. Rogue Legacy hits some of the same points (looting, combat, random areas) but improves on what I want. Runs never feel like a waste, as gold can aid your progression. Combat feels crisp for being mostly melee, and the enemies are appealing. The style is humorous and compelling. It feels great to improve as a player along with stronger character stats. The design pushes random luck down in the equation, since loot is progressive. There is no single game-breaking item that makes winning a run easy.I don't yet have the words to express why I love the game so much. It's hooked me hard.  A rogue-like with strong combat and a ""Just 1 more time"" appeal, it's hard to find major issues. The game could get too easy or pointless once you unlock and complete everything, but most games do the same. This game has caused me butt pain from sitting and playing so much. I wish I had gotten it sooner. Easily worth full price.			"

With all the different runes, armors, and general upgrades it really can cater to a wide area of play styles. After completing the game you can go into New Game+ and after that NG++ etc. Sadly after getting all the upgrades the money in the game is useless and your only goal is to get to the next NG+ which to some is fine but I feel that I've achieved all I can at NG+5.100% Recommend			"

												You will die . . . a lot, but I love this game.  It's a great mix of platforming, rpg leveling, and rogue-like.  A classic example of ""just one more run.""  There is a carrot constantly being dangled in front of your face that you just know you can reach on your next run.  I've only beaten the first boss, but I know I'm slowly getting better and my characters are getting stronger.  And it's pretty funny, never taking itself too seriously.			"

Level up system is superb and will pump you up for another run through the castle, even if you promised yourself you would quit 2 hours ago. If this isn't going to be the Indie game of the year, I'm not sure what is.			"

July 12, 2015This is the first time I've really considered keeping an original review entirely for reference. My opinions on Rogue Legacy have shifted substantially since my first review. I still recommend the game, but with some caveats.After some time away from the game, I found the combat to be clunkier and shallow. Armed with short range and a delayed swing, combat can feel sloppy. Once the enemies gain speed and more attacks, your sole weapon feels underwhelming. Enemies are primarily ranged, and you'll eventually wish for more mobility and a smaller hitbox. By my third playthrough,some rooms became true bullet-hells, except randomly constructed instead of the tightly crafted affairs in other games. Later rooms can be more hectic than any of the bossfights, and some rooms will have unavoidable damage with the number of enemies filling the screen with projectiles.I do feel like the game is very fair in the first two completions, even into the third with Difficulty decreasing runes. Beyond that, the game starts to suffer from an abundance of enemy projectiles without the means to avoid them. The health system is a bandaid fix, with each room slowly wittling your health down unless you get random food drops, or abuse life drain on slimes. By 30 hours, I'd seen (almost) everything, and I don't enjoy the game nearly as much. Unfortunately, even with all my complete runs and dozens of partials, I have yet to see the plant miniboss. Until the RNG decides to bless me, I have to do partial runs just to search for this miniboss. It's the only thing keeping me from 100%, and it's ridiculous. I've killed other minibosses over 5 times, and never seen just one.I loved Rogue Legacy. It is a great value. But the way it is designed, it ends up running into a wall. This is a rougelite that can (and should) wrap up nicely in 30 hours of play. Rogue purists may dislike that the replayability runs dry. It's a great game to start in the genre, and can be as easy or hard as you want by New Game +1. Just be careful running that +1 much higher, or you may grow weary.Original review:I'm incredibly hooked on Rogue Legacy since I picked it up. Spelunky was pushing me to improve my skills after I bought that recently, but little issues bothered me. Rogue Legacy hits some of the same points (looting, combat, random areas) but improves on what I want. Runs never feel like a waste, as gold can aid your progression. Combat feels crisp for being mostly melee, and the enemies are appealing. The style is humorous and compelling. It feels great to improve as a player along with stronger character stats. The design pushes random luck down in the equation, since loot is progressive. There is no single game-breaking item that makes winning a run easy.I don't yet have the words to express why I love the game so much. It's hooked me hard.  A rogue-like with strong combat and a ""Just 1 more time"" appeal, it's hard to find major issues. The game could get too easy or pointless once you unlock and complete everything, but most games do the same. This game has caused me butt pain from sitting and playing so much. I wish I had gotten it sooner. Easily worth full price.			"

												Solid ""rogue-like"" or whatever you wish to call it. Combines elements of platformers, RPG and the ""rogue like"" type games. The one thing that really stands out, besides the cool idea of ""Traits"" that can enhance/hinder your player a bit, is what they have done to mask/replace generic ""grinding"" from traditional RPG's. ANy fan of RPG's knows that grinding is, unfortunately, a necesarry evil. However this game has done well with taking the ""grind"" and maskng it up pretty well with it's style. See, instead of roaming the same forest, with the same character killing the same monotonous beasts over and over, you get a ew ""forest"" and character with each playthrough. Adding in the ability to mix-and-match some of the equipment/runes makes for a lot more relayability than one would expect. There are some pretty neat combinations of items/traits that you can put together for soe solid runs through the castle. I highly recommend this game. If ""grinding"" is something that annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, this game and it's approach really do help. Do you still realize you're essentially grinding? Yeah, you kinda do for the most part....but it is A LOT more tolearble (and can even be fun!) with the way this game has handled it in it's approach.			"

												A casual game for the gamer who loves a good side scroller, actiony game with a splash of hilarious challenge.One run you're using a female wizard complete with full beard who has a fear of fried chicken and uncontrollable flatulence to the next run you are playing as a beefy barbarian who was born a colorblind dwarf with two left hands.The game's graphics provide a charming atmosphere and the gameplay is relatively simple and easy to get the hang of yet holds the potential through runes to become a complicated system of flight, dashing, and bouncing off of the heads of every enemy in the room.The amount of content in the game is tremendous for the price tag as well. If the game hits a sale, buy it without hessitation, you WILL get a good laugh. If the game is full price- give it some consideration, it IS a single player game that can wait for a sale, it isn't going anywhere.But keep in mind... every moment you miss out on this game is a moment where you miss out on an armor-clad Litch with gigantism releasing pure childish, comedic gold from his colon upon dashing, jumping, or landing.

												Some games need long reviews, thorough analysis of pros and cons, balance discussions, thought provoking and well written observations of design brilliance and developer short-sightedness. Not Rogue Legacy. It's simple enough to pickup and play and challenging enough to stay interesting and reward progress.I don't want to put the game down, don't want to stop playing. It's addictive and fun even when obviously evil, which is often! 8/10 +1 for featuring absurd traits including uncontrolable flatulence. Another +1 for sending wave after wave of your children to their doom on a fool's errand. How can you not like Rogue Legacy?

												2D platformer, appeals strongly to my inner sense of desire for programmatic chaos and ""ooh I haven't seen that before"". Both the world and the player character change each time - within set patterns - and alongside that, there is also an external progression and levelling up structure of unlockables to add to each time (as long as you played well enough). So you get the immediate changes from character traits and level layout each time, combined with an overall feeling of progression to keep you coming back.I'm surprised my total time playing this game is so short. I think it's because I'm generally playing it in short bursts.It feels tough, but doable - if not immediately, then with further playthroughs. It's extremely rewarding when you finally manage to accomplish something difficult.Also, most stupidly inclusive game ever. Love it.			"

												Good:This game has the ultimate rogue set-up: character leveling tree that applies to all further characters so you can advance even as you lose the couple perks you can get during a character's life, it gives your a feeling of reaching a little bit closer to your goal even as you get mauled by wild dogs or shot with any number of things.  Numerous abilities and armors (as well as different starting classes with powerful abilities) that can be purchased (that also can be used for all future characters) and give an immediate and often obvious boost in power to let you survive longer through the castle.Bad:This is kind of expected for a rogue game, but for those that are new to the genre: you are going to die, a lot.  A.  Lot.  Also the item screen is scaled in such a way that it's generally more beneficial to hold out several 'generations' of items before purchasing since it becomes relatively easy to hold out a bit longer which makes the majority of the items not worth buying.  Also most of the magic runes aren't actually useful for getting further in the castle.  Also, once you get pretty far in the game, about half of the available classes (I think there are 8) become fairly useless due to having low health compared to other characters (it becomes significant because later on in the game it can be a difference of several hundred lifepoints and also makes them heal for much much less when using a health potion).Overall I personally like this game a lot.  There's just something awesome about being late in the game and being able to spam magic at everything that moves while maneuvering through bigger and bigger enemies, dodging and striking in quick succession.

												I'm, possibly... the worst Rogue Legacy player EVER. But that fact doesn't stop me from enjoying it! I'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series and that's exactly what hooked me into this amazing game.To get you an idea this game is ""Spelunky meets Castlevania"", it's as difficult as Spelunky (ok ok! maybe a bit less...) and as good as a Castlevania.Basically you have your hero, the one who increases it's stats every time you level up or add new equipment, and the bad guys, from zombies to deadly plants to cursed knights.But the different thing is that every time you die, ""your son"" (or daughter) takes your place on this mighty quest.So, every time you die, you'll be given the chance to choose between 3 new heroes, which will be randomly generated with different class, bouns and... imperfections, some of them are stupid (and fun), some of them are more bonus than they look like! and others are just downsides to the character.Also the Castle, which is the scenario for this adventure, is procedurally generated, much like Spelunky but with a twist... there are four zones: Castle, Forest, Tower and Catacombs, they will always remain in the same ""zone"" for example, Catacombs are always at the bottom of the map, but how you get there is what it changes. In each of these zones you have a Boss fight waiting between all the gold, enemies and hidden treasures and that's the goal of the main game. In order to get to the final boss you have to defeat it's four guardians first, but not necesarily in a single play... if your character dies after defeat a boss, it stays dead forever, the tricky thing is on getting to know the castle which you already know, it changes... but! you can stop it from changing thanks to an upgrade bought in you home (oh yes you have a home full of upgrades and improvements, also a smith to forge you new weapons and a gipsy to give you new enhancements and...) which is an architecht who'll stop the castle from changing... for a price of course!And, whats more to say? Rogue Legacy totally deserves your attention (and a lots of your free time)			"

												Really fun sidescrolling action/platforming game.  Basically the game starts by picking a hero, then you proceed into a castle and kill stuff until you die.  When you die, your gold items found etc. go to your next hero (your kid/descendent) which allows you to keep building your heroes until they get stronger and stronger.  As you get more and more money you can also purchase upgrades and new heroes.  This makes it so you can kind of focus on upgraded the heroes you really like, but there is never any guarantee that your choices among descendents will ever be one of your preferred classes.  This adds a lot of randomization which is really fun to mess around with.  Also your descendents can have a wide variety of afflictions like being obsessive compulsive, having tourette syndrome, and even irritable bowel syndrome.   Some of these are just simple funny things, but some of them can change how your character works completely (for example if you are nearsighted, everything farther away is blurry).  Overall it is a great game that seems to have a lot of replayability (the castle you enter changes with each descendent unless you activate a certain upgrade) and for as cheap as the game is i'd say you are going to get your money's worth.

												This game is great for rogue-like veterans, but it's a must buy for those who aren't sure about rogue-likes but want to get their feet wet.This game isn't your typical rogue-like (rogue-like = when you die, you lose everything and start completely over.) When you die, you get to keep your gold, and an 'heir' inherits it. With that gold, you can buy upgrades and armor that you get to keep forever. Your progress in the dungeon is completely lost, however, and the format of the dungeon changes each time you enter it.The combat is fun, the sprites are charming, some of the genetic quirks heirs inherit are funny/cute/useful and as is typical with rogue-likes, you feel yourself improving and getting better at the game as time goes on. You really can't go wrong buying this game, it is well-made and a great contrubition to the genre. "

												Rogue Legacy borrows from multiple genres and makes something amazing out of them. You will die, often, and it's integral to progressing just so you can inch past some tough-as-nails bosses. The game centers around a knight from a long time ago and his descendants. Each of his descendants is different inherently and depending on your family's upgradable manor. These children endlessly charge a shape shifting castle gathering loot, only to be felled and have their spoils enjoyed by the next generation of the bloodline.Absolutely a great rogue-like platformer. Fun, humorous, and very challenging.			"

												Wow this game is a grindfest and the first few hours in the game are so frustrating as your characters are so weak. You're learning enemy attack patterns and trying your best just to get that extra coin to unlock your next upgrade instead of losing all your coin to charon because you are 10G short After a few hours and your character starts beefing up it becomes very enjoyable. I am still yet to beat a boss as my characters aren't strong enough yet but this is a very charming and fun rogue game. 8/10			"

												Note: I posted an update at the end. I wrote my original review after a few hours of gameplay. The update is after 18 hours and changes my opinion on the game somewhat. This is a really fun game. I've been hooked on it the last two or three days. You start with one hero and you venture off into the castle. The layout is randomized each time you play. You fight enemies, leap over spikes, the usual platform game challenges. I don't really like platform games, but this has become an exception. I'm not very skilled with these types of games and my character dies A LOT. But every time you run through the game, you collect money, runes, and equipment to build yourself up. You also gain levels which appears to boost hp/mp. When you lose, you start again, purchasing your upgrades, then venturing into a new castle totally unlike the one you last explored. There's an option to lock them down (for a 40% cut in gold intake), but it means that when you go back in any treasure chests you opened are already used, so you have to explore deeper to find new treasure. Each time you start again, you choose a new hero, which can range from spell casters to strong melee to heavy armor/high hp, to low hp spelunkers that reveal chests on the map. It's a nice variety. Also, some of the characters have status effects like ""colorblind"" where the levels are black and white, which can add challenge by making it more difficult to separate some enemies from the backgrounds. There is also near-sightedness which creates a blur on the screen outside a certain range of vision. There's even one that makes you play the game upside-down. I tried that one once and avoid it at all costs now. I think the main draw of this game is that you can load this up with the intention of killing 20-30 minutes and it's still fun 2 hours later. It can be frustrating though. With randomized layouts, some rounds are going to be significantly more difficult than others. Fairy Chest rooms are the worst, sometimes having rules that just don't make sense like ""no jumping"" when the entire room is a series of platforms over spikes. Even if you run through the spikes, you still need to jump out of them at the end. Maybe there are runes to overcome this that I will find later. As you upgrade your character, the gold cost of upgrades naturally increases. I'd imagine at some point this cost will become excessive, as I am already struggling to bring in enough gold for some upgrades as it is. The worst part is that you have to use your gold or lose it before reentering the castle. You have to give up any remaining gold you have to enter, so if the cheapest upgrade you have access to is 650 gold and you have 640, goodbye all 640 gold. You can reduce this toll but it costs a lot to upgrade and it appears the max is probably going to be a 30% reduction. I've only done 1/5 reductions. They don't really seem worth it, so I've been investing in more useful upgrades. The music is good, the layouts are interesting, the game is challenging. There isn't much in terms of story. You uncover short journals as you progress. It's fine that the game is lacking in story, however. It's not the point of the game. It keeps you going with the action non-stop (except for selecting your upgrades). Lastly, boss battles seem disproportionately difficult for the rest of the game. I'm level 60 or so now and it's getting pretty easy to clear the castle (even for someone who is terrible at these types of games), but the bosses are much much stronger than anything else you encounter.Update: After playing for 18 hours, I've pretty much burned out on this game. All I do at this point is run dungeons over and over and over collecting money to spend on upgrades, so that hopefully I'll one day beat bosses outside the first area (the castle). The costs on everything keep going up, so it's an incredibly slow grind to unlock the incredibly large amount of upgrades. On top of that, after 18 hours I'm only level 150. I've read that the level cap is just over 500. Assuming that exp to level up increases per level, it would take 60+ hours to reach level 500. That is way too much of a time investment into grinding. I never minded putting large amounts of hours into games like Final Fantasy 7, for example, because at least you're progressing through a story at the same time. Rogue Legacy has no story. Do I still recommend this game? Sure. I did enjoy it for 18 hours. That's a nice turnaround on a $5 game (on sale). If you're looking for a game you'll finish, however, this one probably isn't it.

												Somedays it just sucks to be alive.Your entire life, defined by a Castle. A Castle filled with hatred for all who explore it.Whether it's by monsters or traps, you're going to die, just like your ancestors.When your children come of age, they will lose their lives to this castle as well.Upon starting Rogue Legacy, you're bound to ask yourself ""What does everyone see in this game?"" You'll walk into a room, and there will be wizards filling the screen with projectiles. This isn't a 2D shooter, and your hit-box is your entire body. Along with the wizards, there might be spiked floors, a couple knights, some evil paintings, and bone-tossing skeletons. Your options consist of finding another way around, attempting to fight your way through, or you could just die. Better luck next time right?With Rogue Legacy, maybe next time will result in better luck. The keyword is in the title: Rogue. Unless decided otherwise, the layout of the castle is always random. The goal is to find each of the four boss-monster lairs to open the way to the finale. There are multiple areas to explore, and each room contains a multitude of possibilities. Your next attempt may result in more treasure, less frustrating enemy combinations, or it could be even worse and you'll die before you manage to explore three rooms.Unlike its inspiration, Rogue Legacy isn't entirely sadistic. Your stats & equipment are carried over no matter how many times you die. Before the beginning of each adventure you can use the gold acquired in the last ill-fated adventure to purchase upgrades. These run the gamut of stat-gains, new classes, better equipment as well as ability-bestowing runes, and a few other niceties. Basically, you're expected to die. Unless you're completely miserable at the game, eventually somebody in your lineage will complete it.However, don't confuse this method of game-design with ""I have to grind until the game lets me win.""Rogue Legacy is primarily an action-platformer, meaning your reflexes and quick-thinking are just as if not more likely to keep you alive as a dozen health & armor upgrades. The controls are quite reasonable and extremely versatile with the right combination of runes. Also, if money isn't your immediate concern, weaving in-between the monsters and their attacks can be really enjoyable. As we've come to expect, merely beating the game isn't enough. There's a new game +, then a ++, and it just keeps going. Each subsequent play-through has stronger enemies, more dangerous traps, and so on. To add to this mounting absurdity, there are a handful of optional bosses to contend with. These ultra-difficult clones force you to use specific class/stat combinations. Since grinding is out of the question, you really have to use every tool to have a chance. Honestly though, it's more frustrating just to trigger these fights. Since the layout is random, there's a high possibility that you won't find the necessary keys. Access to these battles involves finding statues and offering up a prayer (why you would pray for a headache is anyone's guess). Sometimes these statues simply don't spawn, or you don't survive long enough to find them.More than anything else, if you're going to play Rogue Legacy, see it through to the end. It's an addictive game and well-designed, but trust me on this. Play this game as much as you're willing to stand, then uninstall it, hide it, bury it deep. The one day you revisit this game, load your NG+++++ character, and get dropped in seconds by more bullets than Dodonpachi, all you'll think is ""What did I ever see in this game?""			"

												Like the name implies, Rogue Legacy is basically a rogue-like platformer. Let me state now that if you get frustrated easily or are an impatient individual, then this is NOT the game for you. However, if you enjoy a challenging, difficult/semi-casual game, then you should definitely check out this game. The best feature of this game to me is that most of your time is spent earning gold to upgrade your characters. So basically never-ending character progression. It is scaled though in that every time you buy an upgrade or piece of equipment, the other upgrades you didn't initially choose very slightly increase in price. It is in this way that Rogue Legacy promotes a setting that allows you to continuously work harder to get better, one little upgrade at a time that does not seem impossible or overwhelming.The game does have a nice balance feature to it. Before you go into the next randomized Dungeon, you must pay up the gold you have left in your possession after upgrading to ""Charon"" (he really looks a lot like a cloaked grim reaper...). This is necessary unless you buy a few upgrades to where you only have to pay a significant portion but still keep some of your gold upon entering. Also, you can stabilize the dungeon by acquiring an architect in the game, but this will cost you 40% of the gold you would normally earn within the dungeon to do so. Therefore, the game presents a nice challenging cost/benefit scenario to the player. Lastly, I'd like to address the characters you will be playing as and their unique abilities/features. Every time you die, he next child in line will be who you ultimately play as in the next dungeon run-through. However, you can select from 1 of 3 various and randomized characters. Now when I say random, I mean it. Gender, abilities, spells, physical features, mental aspects, etc.--ALL randomized. You could have a gay female paladin who has irritable bowel syndrome with a blade summoning spell to a male assassin with dwarfism and hypergonadism (look it up), with a spell that throws giant spike balls at enemies (the irony is thick). What I'm trying to emphasize here is that every single playthrough is inherently different, and the player must adapt and change their gameplay style to match what they judged to be the best character they selected for the next dungeon runthrough. With so many choices available to the player, you can expect Rogue Legacy to accrue several hours of play time in your daily lives. If you like Indie games with intentional imbalance aspects (such as the Binding of Isaac), then I believe you will quite enjoy Rogue Legacy as well. I found myself feeling a mixture of humor, frustration, anxiousness, excitement, and joy as i played. So essentially this is highly addictive, adaptive, challenging, and a ton of fun. So what are ya waiting for? It's time to start poppin' out the most random heroes the fantasy world has ever seen nonstop for generations to come.			"

												After beating so many New Game +'s, getting all the achievements and defeating all the Obol bosses, I think I am in a position to finally review Rogue Legacy to it's fullest.First of all, Rogue Legacy is possibly one of the hardest games I've ever played, mentally and physically. Continuously grinding to get better equipment and money was always a psychological thing, and if you didn't have the willpower to do that, you would slowly fall to the game's relentless ability it crush and punish any mistake you make. And that's the brilliant thing.Rogue Legacy is a game that I would only recommend to the people who are willing to put in hard time and be crippled by the game's difficulty over and over again. Pros Lots of time to be spentVery fun hack and slashRPG elements to add that slow but steady progessionEnemies that fit the area and level, and can show players the path they should takeLots of upgrades to be unlocked and purchasedTons of different classes to choose fromBosses are interesting and uniqueRandom layout every time you enter the castleStory is interesting Cons Enemies can be redundant, as reskins will be found as progession continuesNot forgiving and very punishing to beginners and players not very good at platformers or hack/slashersMay find grinding to be very boring and not a lot of time fighting bossesProgession is slow and tediousInsanely difficult Obol bosses (I'm looking at you, Alexander the 4th.)Overall, Rogue Legacy is a difficult hack and slash RPG game that will punish you for every mistake that you make. It is a brutal ride and is very discouraging at times, but when you finally beat the final boss, the bittersweet taste of satisfaction will stay with you (at least for a while).Purchase this game only if you are willing to grind and die and grind and die over and over again. 8.8/10  "

												Metroidvania style Action RPG game with a Roguelike (death is permanent) element added to it.  Once you die, you get to pick one of your 3 randomly assigned childeren to carry on your Legacy.  That's not all though, each child will have a certain set of traits, or lack there of, that they come with.  Such as, Stereoblind(doesn't see in 3d), Far-sighted(everything up close is blurry), Dwarfism(TINY), etc.  Thus in doing so, the randomness of each kid isn't just based on their class, but small elements that will affect your game play, and style.  On top of death being a part of the game, the Castle you are trying to conquer will change each death, later this can be stopped for a price, and again in doing so, keeps you on your toes and always learning.  The game play is intense, and you are bound to get upset once or twice due to sheer bad luck or inability to get your crap together (me) for that playthrough.  The game has a ton to offer in the sense of leveling up, each death you keep your gold, you come back with it, spend it on upgrades, which unlock more upgrades, and in doing so, you improve your chances of moving further along in the Castle to defeat all the bosses.  The game can be simple at times, and hair pulling at others, and once you think you have it all down pat, you'll unlock some remixed bosses that will surely have you cussing at how the level of hard they are shoving in your face.All in All this was by far my favorite game purchase this christmas(2013), and I spent many a nights trying to bring this puppy to its knees. Fun graphics, great humor at times, lots of deaths, and tons and tons of fun to finish.  If you enjoy somethign that'll keep you on your toes, and let you feel that old school level of fun again, Rogue Legacy is certainly for you.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a 2D action-platformer done in a ""roguelike"" style, with a few twists. Each time you venture forth, the map layout and enemies you encounter are randomized. It is sort of like Spelunky, except progress isn't through a series of levels (1-1, 1-2, etc). Instead, there is only a single map, comprised of 4 areas: a central castle, a forest to the right, a tower above, and a land of darkness below. The goal is to explore as much of these areas as possible and defeat the bosses of each. Of course, it's not so simple to do this - there are tons of things that can kill you, and when you first start the game, you are very weak, so you will die. Frequently. In most roguelikes, that would be the part where the game says ""tough luck, get better""... but not so with Rogue Legacy. Instead, when your character dies, you get to purchase upgrades (stat boosts, weapons, different character types, etc) with the money you collected during your last life. These upgrades are permanently passed along to your next character (a choice from 3 randomized children). However, there is a catch. As you buy new upgrades, the next set of upgrades gets more expensive, which means you have to collect more and more cash on each life to be able to afford new stuff. Frankly, this is probably the weakest aspect of the game. It can get to be a real grind having to play through the same thing over and over again... but that pretty much comes with the territory in this genre, so it's not so unexpected. On the bright side, heading back into the fray so many times allows you to get better at the game and learn the ins and outs of the various traps and enemies, making future playthroughs easier. So it all sort of balances out. That said, the challenges you'll face aren't really all that tough anyways, so this is a pretty good game for those who want to get their feet wet in the genre. The other aspect of this game that is pretty unique are the different types of randomization you can get with the aforementioned children. Characters come in several different types (knights, barbarians, spellcasters, miners, etc), each of which has a unique a special ability. Additionally, each character can also have one of several different ""traits"" - for example, ""color blind"" makes everything appear black-and-white, ""gigantism"" makes you huge, ""ADHD"" makes you move faster, etc. It's pretty fun experimenting with all the different types of characters you can get, and it definitely keeps the game from getting too stale. The only main downsides to the game are the aforementioned grinding aspect, but also that there just isn't all that much left to do once you finish. After beating the game, the bosses reset and you can continue with progressively harder playthroughs, which is nice. But nothing else really changes aside from the difficulty, so there's nothing really new to see or do. Maybe that's enough for some people, but it would have been nice if there were some additional areas or secrets. That said, what the game does offer is good enough for the price tag, I think, and is well worth your time if you are into these types of platformers and/or roguelikes. Pick it up on sale for sure, if not at full price.

												Personally I absolutely love this game.Game has a very addictive factor.And continues until the last boss challenging.You fight through four parts of the castle.Each location is yet more difficult.Simple way because the creatures are stronger.Only weapon against this is to always upgrade your character and become stronger.And by playing a lot get yourself getting better at the game.Overall I think it's a great game if you love 2d platform.Many challenges and short, very addictive.For me long ago that I played a 2d game for more than 10 hours.positive:- Upgrade System- Big Challenge- Many Characters- Great music- Lots of varietydisadvantage:- No Steam Cloud- No co-op multiplayer- No free choice of characters (this is random)			"

												Besides having a fantasic idea and meaning behind the creation of this game.  It also just has that ablity to suck you in and replay it over and over and over again.  Yes, it is mainly a time waster, however i find myself pouring endless hours into it without intention because it gives you a drive to push forward and see whats next to come or even if you can do better than your laast effort!  A great game if you enjoy short dungeon run game that you can keep playing for a long time.			"

												I really like this game, liked it so much I beat it twice. What I didn't know aside from having game plus, this game also has the few, the rare game plus plus! That's right. Beat this game twice and you go into an even harder mode. I played this game with a gamepad and the controls are very solid and respond at the right moment without any delay. Love anything about it. THe graphics are ncie and remind me a lot of a PS1 game. The gameplay it like playing through a castlevania metroid style game. What is unqiue about it is that every time you die, yu come back as a different character with a new set of trait skills, you keep the same armor, weapons and abilities as the previous character though. So every time you die, nothing of your progress if lost. I rate this game 9/10.			"

This analysis examines the remix bosses in Cellar Door Games' Rogue Legacy as a great challenge and an example of nonlinear difficulty scaling.[. . .] There are games designed with the knowledge that most players will test the waters and then move on; Rogue Legacy is one of these. But there are also games designed with the knowledge that some players will be left wanting by a game that compromises with 'most players;' Rogue Legacy is also one of these.

												To preface, while I'm not recommending this game in general, it's definitely worth it if you get it significantly on sale. It has many flaws but between them you can definitely find some good enjoyment. The flaws are, however, ever present and egregious enough for me to give this game an unfavorable review. I did beat the game, so don't think I quit early and am merely ranting. None of this is going to complaints of it being too hard for me, anything resembling that will hopefully be a critique of a game mechanic. To start off, though, here's a list of what it did well.Pros:-It looks pretty good, even as far as pixel art games go. No complaints there. Animations are smooth enough, backgrounds and landscapes colorful and interesting enough to not be a sore sight. -It sounds pretty good. I liked the music and general sound design. Nothing to write home about, but it did the game justice. -It definitely can be very fun at times. Out of the 8-9 hours I played it, 2-3 of them were me having genuine fun. Lots of it, even. Another 2-3 were me being mildly amused, just kinda going at it without thinking too hard. And another 2-3 hours of playing was me either being incredibly bored or frustrated with it. The reason for this inconsistency will be explained below. Cons:-The stat upgrade system could be a lot better. Many other roguelikes have certain things that carry over from run to run. Mostly these are unlockable pools, starting equipment, or something of the sort. Rogue Legacy takes this a step further by maintaining all of your base stats from run to run, where you use the money gained on a run to upgrade stats. This could have been interesting and kept the gameplay progressing dynamically, if not fora vital problem. Very quickly, stats become so expensive that upgrading after each run becomes less and less likely. If you play well, you can almost always get at least one upgrade, but it won't be very significant, requiring many consquetive runs (and therefore deaths) to be able to make any real progress. But the biggest issue is that upgrading any stat raises the price of other stats. Not only is this annoying and discourages changing up playstyles by speccing into other stats, it has a terrible combined effect with how classes work. -The ""choose one of three randomized classes"" thing gets old extremely fast. Talk all you want about it forcing people to change their playstyles and it being good, but in the end it just makes some runs ""throwaway runs"" that you'd rather not be doing but are forced to thanks to a poor choice pool. Combine this with my complaints about the stat system and some classes are downright useless because you haven't specced into them. This is especially infuriating when you're rushing towards bosses, because sometimes you'll get a selection that are all completely useless and you have to waste time throwing yourself to your death.-And as far as ""changing up playstyles"" goes, that hardly exists. Every single class uses the same weapon, a big sword, that does the same attack, a swing. The only differences between classes are stats and a single extra ability that is often not useful. I don't prefer a class over another because it moves or attacks differently, I play it because it does more damage or has more health. It's not explicitly bad but it's pretty boring, and my playstyle hardly changes between them. Any other differences are completely random, like spells or incredibly annoying attributes like black and white vision or flipping the entire game upside down. Again, those things are cute but get old fast.-Enemy design is bland and repeats itself constantly. Once you've gone through a dungeon area once, you've seen all you're gonna see, more or less. Since there's only a single basic attack you can do in the entire game, the strategy for each of them always remains the same strategy too. It just changes how quickly you take things.  Even between areas enemy types are reused, merely increasing their number of projectiles and other numerical properties. -Similar complaint, boss design is kind of terrible. Of the bosses I fought, only a single one was genuinely fun, and that's the very last one. The first four consist of bosses that know up to two different attacks, in arenas often littered with enemy adds or hazards. The boss immediately preceding the final boss is interesting but ends up being more annoying than fun, as it will repeat the same attack 4 times in a 5 second window. I quite enjoyed the final boss though, so props for that. -smaller gripe is that sometimes enemy movement can be a little deceitful. They sometimes change directions instantly and at random, ramming right into you. And enemies who jump to just a little below a platform will be teleported to onto the platform instantly, which is pretty infuriating for a particular boss. Also some projectiles can go through walls if the caster is close enough, which seems like a pretty silly flaw if it's unintentional. Overall, it's a great concept with pretty poor execution. It's worth it on sale but definitely not full price. I realize how damn popular this game is, and I don't understand how people could rate it so highly when it's in the same genre as far superior games like ""The Binding of Isaac (either one)"", ""Enter the Gungeon"" or ""FTL"". It just seems to fall flat in all gameplay aspects, like the developers had a fantastic game in the works but had to quickly wrap it up at about 60% development.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a game about risk, chance, and a little bit of luck. It harkens back to the days when Simon Belmont could only take four hits before succumbing to sweet oblivion, or when Arthur's armor burst off his body upon simply touching a defiled zombie. Modern conventions and some wacky characteristics keep Rogue Legacy feeling fresh despite its old-school charm, though these sources of intrigue can prove a bit frustrating at times. Following a short prologue and introduction to death, Rogue Legacy tasks you with exploring a castle with four distinct areas, dispatching bosses as you proceed towards the ultimate goal of defeating the final evil locked behind a gold door. There's a little bit of story told in journal entries scattered about the environment, but mostly this is a tale about killing monsters and gathering loot, and the game is better for it. We didn't need much explanation back in the NES days other than, ""Dracula has risen, now go kill him good!"" With the recent glut of cutscenes and dialogue in today's big-budget AAA world, Rogue Legacy comes across as a breath of fresh air with its focused and directed nature. ""Explore the castle, get stuff, and power up"" are reasons enough to scour the corridors of this huge deathtrap. Rogue Legacy takes advantage of a distinct 16-bit graphical palette that adds to its old-school charm. Your on-screen avatars are pixelated and slightly deformed, holding his/her sword awkwardly as they run through the castle on short, stubby legs. Giant skeletons, headless horses, robed mages, and various other nefarious creatures attempt to halt your progress with colorful attacks and old-timey patterns requiring a great deal of memorization. Rogue Legacy isn't going to blow anyone away with amazingly intricate environments. You have a castle area, a forest area, and dungeon-y areas. Familiar almost to a fault, you'd be forgiven in thinking that this game is quant and simple... until you actually play it and get your ♥♥♥ handed to you. I died on the second room on my first castle run. This was my first real death, and there were many (...many) more before I finally started to get my bearings and understand the mechanics at play. Enemies hit hard and fast, barely giving you any time to figure them out before they fill the screen with large area-based attacks ranging from fireballs to ice blasts and everything in-between. Controlling your character feels almost too precise and tight for this type of game. You can easily change direction mid-jump, and you'll probably overcorrect and hurt yourself if you grew up with the Belmonts. Within an hour, though, the controls feel great and really open you up to pulling off some intense maneuvers and stunts, though the downward strike necessary for some traversal mechanics never feels quite right. I didn't really understand Rogue Legacy when I first started playing and grew frustrated quickly as a result. Dying so early without any real progress felt odd, and I was rolling my eyes with some of the ""gotcha"" moments with spike traps and large enemies hitting me immediately after a screen transition. Death, however, reveals the wonderfully modern conventions of RL that make it stand out amongst a sea of ""old-school"" games released during this massive indie boom in the industry. Every time you die, you select a new character from a list of three, and then you get the opportunity to spend your ancestor's hard-earned loot on upgrades for your family. These range from the ability to lock the randomly designed castle into its previous incarnation to new character classes and stat boosts. Better still, Rogue Legacy incentivizes you to spend all of that money because you go back down to zero upon reentering the castle. Leveling your family yields huge results that fundamentally changes the way you play the game and perceive death. Dying results in initial disappointment, followed by the joy of selecting skills and stats, and then finally a return to the castle to find more loot. It's truly wicked game design, provoking you to play just one more character before turning the game off. You're almost always unlocking new pieces of gear or abilities, and you even get to tailor your play style with runes and special skills. Maybe you like to focus on double jumping, or perhaps you want to lower the level of your enemies but receive reduced rewards as a result. Rogue Legacy feels deeply personal and meticulously constructed, never coming across as a tedious affair. Character selection quickly becomes the driving force when you venture into the castle. The classes all perform differently and most are best suited for certain situations. The speedy, hard-hitting ninja makes regular enemies feel like a joke, but he is probably too squishy for some of the more terrifying bosses. The miner gets a huge boost to gold pickups, making him an essential part of your family's economy. Still, some classes feel a bit useless if you haven't invested enough of your family's fortune into their chosen stat. My mages felt horribly underpowered, making some runs more frustrating than others. This becomes truly detrimental when trying to tackle one of the game's bosses. I waited nearly six generations before finally getting a paladin capable of taking out the last boss, which proved more aggravating than exhilarating. Sure, I was able to power level a bit, but I wanted to get something done, and it's hard to break from that line of thought when you die waiting to accomplish a goal. This was the one time Rogue Legacy frustrated me, but that comes with the randomization of both the castle and your family tree. Nearly every selected character brings along some kind of trait to liven up the gameplay a bit. One guy might be colorblind, leading to a black and white screen, while another character may have irritable bowel syndrome, resulting in a great deal of fart noises coming from your speakers. Usually, these traits provide little more than entertainment and a bit of individual flavor for each excursion, but they can sometimes prove beneficial or outright disastrous to your forward momentum. I was never a fan of getting characters who are giant, for example, as this made them an easy target for some of the nasty projectile attacks enemies like to spam. Rogue Legacy makes a lot of really smart decisions to keep it feeling fresh while maintaining some pretty old-school game design. ""Hard but fair"" usually comes to mind whenever you finally fall victim to the onslaught, but randomness brings both variety and some frustration to the proceedings. You have to go with the flow and understand that maybe you won't get the right class for a given situation, that some people just aren't meant to vanquish evil. Some of your offspring may be simple cannon fodder, while others are little more than accountants looking to build up your future heroes. Death is almost a reward in a way, and perhaps more designers should look to keep things fresh and interesting even when the dreaded ""Game Over"" finally appears on screen.Highly Recommended "

			Rogue Legacy features a lineage of often ill suited knights hurling themselves in to near certain doom to assault the castle. Very Metroid-vania feel to it. Where else can you find me?		

Roguelike Metroidvania platformer, with a sense of humor.  There isn't much more to say about this game.  You're going to die a lot.  You're going to have characters that have serious disadvantages.  You're going to get lost.  The control on the game is smooth, and while I haven't had a chance to actually grind out some levels, it looks like it'll be a ton of fun to do even that.			"

												This game is pretty amazing, defining of the rogue-like genre and packed with hours of fun. Raiding the castle is its strong suite, and you'll go through the randomly generated castle rooms time and time again and have a blast doing so. The main bosses are fun, excluding the final battle, and the optional end-game bosses. The issue with the final bosses final form and the end-game optional bosses is that they mainly utilize pseudo difficulty. They're meant to feel super hard, but in reality are not. By the time you defeat them, rather than feeling like you're overcome an obstacle, you're thinking ""thank goodness I did not get too many undodgeable knife cycles"", or that you didn't take a hit you couldn't have possibly avoided. The RNG makes the fight, it can be very easy with good RNG, or a nightmare with stacks of attacks you cannot dodge(Unless you're the right class).All in all, still a great game, but the last 5 bosses(excluding the final brothers fight) all leave much to be desired. If anything, you can learn how RNG can turn a fight that's supposed to be difficult, into a grind for the right RNG. Another con is that in the late game (NG++ and on) which class you are determines whether or not you'll be able to achomplish anything. And the gold collecting class becomes completely useless. You can also unlock a dragon class, but in NG+, it's completely useless and just wastes your roster slots and increases the odds you get a useless class.I know I mostly sang the flaws of this game, but I still highly suggest it. It's because I enjoy the game so much that I harp so heavily on the flaws that it does have. If these issues were resolved, it'd go from a good game to a great game. But I still reccomend this game to those who are a fan of the genre.			"

In my eyes Rogue Legacy is a good game. However, despite it being touted as the ancestor (haha) of all roguelites, it takes a very special audience to enjoy it and should not be recommended to everybody regardless.I found the concept of creating legacies and chosing each run with one of three random characters very novel. However, after the first few runs I grew tired of the game, because the gameplay is extremely unforgiving and very much alike Metroidvania. But not necessarily in a way I like. This game is mostly dodging projectiles and requires a very high amount of dexterity and is also very dependant on having a gamepad.I felt the combat itself was just too simplified with one sword attack and using one magic spell at a time.I would have liked to see a decent combat system and less of a bullet hell style.That said, if none of those things bother you and you actually have enjoyed these elements in the past, go for it!

This game was the only game I played for a few weeks, I eventually bought all the armor, achieved most of the achievments, and upgraded all my skills to the maximum level. This game consumed my life for a month. 10/10. There is not much replay value once you buy everything though. I got this game for $3 in a sale awhile back, and I'd say I got my money's worth.			"

												Well, that was a lot more time than I would have hoped to spend on this game. Now you might see my hours and go ""why is this not recommended?"" And that's because honestly this game isn't ""bad"", it's just not a game I can recommend. I picked this game up from a Steam sale because, hey, 2$ for a game is great, right? Well, this game is riddled with issues. Its main gimmick of giving you a new character to go with wears off after you start unlocking more classes (because you need to unlock stuff in order to be able to unlock some of the really good skills) and you find out just how weak many of the classes are. Mages aren't very useful when magic is such a tight resource and get vastly outclassed by spellswords, Liches aren't very useful, and assassins are outclassed pretty much completely by ninjas. Even the best class, the Dragon, is pretty much useful for one thing, killing the 4th boss, which the right spellsword just does better. Basically any time I didn't have a Barbarian, Paladin or Ninja I just felt like I could be doing so much better. And some of the quirks are just awful, such as Vertigo or MP/HP swap. The game restricts your ability to play it with its various character classes and quirks, which you only have a very small amount of control over. While this leaves a lot of variety, it leaves the entire experience inconsistent and pads the game length. And then the bosses just weren't very fun, outside of the final boss. A giant floating eyeball, a floating fire head, a giant slime, is that really the best they could come up with?All around the game is fun when you actually have what you want, but that is so sporadic that the entire game just feels out of your control and much of the game you spend playing inferior characters in the vain hopes of getting enough cash to buy something better.

												One of the best games I have ever played. Depth is incredible, amount to do is incredible, the dificulty is incredible.  Don't buy if you don't like rogue likes/lites because you will die a lot learning some things.  Also don't buy if you don't have a controler to use.  Other than that if you love fast pased sidescrolling action with a rogue lite twist, this is a MUST have. inb4 I played this on PS4 origionally, just bought it again on steam. I have 50+ hours on PS4.  The game lasts, don't let my hours fool you.			"

												Rogue Legacy is an amazing Rogue-like experience and I highly recommend it, assuming you like rogue-like games.You are going to die.  A lot.  Period.  Infact, even if you play perfectly, to progress, you MUST die.  If that bothers you, you do NOT like rogue-likes and should probably not play this as a result.This game has a great learning curve but you need to be good at 'platforming' games like Mario, Sonic and Megaman (to name a few) to be good at this game.  Your main goal is to collect as much gold on each castle clear as you can (assuming you live through the entire castle) so when you die, you can purchase much needed character progression upgrades which will also be represented as 1 level per upgrade invested.This leads to character progression as long as your not dying before you collect a decent sum of gold.  The controls are tight and precise (I use the xbox 360 wired controller on my PC) and when you die, its often because you messed up.  The enemies start out very easy and get progressively harder in each wing of the castle not to mention that there is a New Game Plus mode as well.  In fact, you can progress the castle in NG+ modes as far as you want to.  Its up to you.If your a fan of Rogue-likes, this game is a must have and I highly recommend it!			"

												Hm, I'm sure many people will disagree with my opinion here, but I found Rogue Legacy to be somewhat underwhelming.  Or maybe I just don't enjoy rogue likes too much as I really hate the feeling that I wasted hours of my life by dying and starting from scratch.  Then again, I enjoyed FTL more and it was even more ""rogue-like"" than RL, since its only form of progression was acquiring new ships, while in RL you could build up your RPG stats and unlock classes.  I think the first 30 minutes of RL is quite enjoyable, but the problem is you eventually realize the gameplay is a bit stark and the control is never as responsive as you'd hope.  Many of the skills seem pretty imbalanced or only useful for very particular situations.  I did end up playing RL enough to beat the game once, so I must have enjoyed it to some extent... but overall I guess I was expecting too much for a game to combine the genres of Roguelike, Platforming and RPG seemlessly.

												A fun game that doesnt take itself to seriously. Game can fell slow or unfair at times but ultimately feels good to control and advance in. Pretty gosh darn hard, I would tell you to prepare to die, but Manus, the father of the abyss makes no apearence. The soundtrack by Tettix and A shell in the pit is also pure gold, good at pumping you up to get your but handed to you on a silver platter. Lastly the art is awesome, its really colorfull and fits together really well while giving the player easy visuals with which they can interpret the action, although some character traits can mess with it and cause problems. I just wish there were more to it than there is, I would totaly buy an expansion pack for it if one ever came out. Its a simple joyfull little expirience that pulls you in and take great pleasure in beating you to a pulp, but as though posessed by stockholm syndrome I cant help but keep coming back.

												Rogue Legacy is a Roguelike, hack 'n slash platformer which showcases the best of what the genre has to offer.You play as the descendant of a hero, who must enter the castle, collect treasure, and kill bosses. When you die, it's game over for your hero. Done. Gone. No coming back from the dead.But that's where this game bends the rules of the Roguelike genre. You hero dies, but his descendants live on, and the next in line inherits their ancestor's fortune. A fortune which can be used to train skills, purchase ruins and equipment aforementioned ancestor was kind enough to unlock, and finally enter the castle again. Don't even think about hoarding coins, though, as the toll to enter the castle is whatever you didn't spend before entering it.I like to think of it as a generational Roguelike. A Roguelike which was never intended to be won without dying. It can be done, but if you don't die, you won't be able to train your skills or use the new equipment you've unlocked - unless you somehow manage to beat the base game with no upgrades or equipment. But most players could never do that. So you'll probably be in the boat with the rest of us who isn't too sad about dying because you've had a nice run, and you can't wait to spend your treasure.Forget about making that new character, though. Characters are randomly generated with a few different attributes: class (Barbarian, Ninja, Paladin, Wizard, etc - all with VERY different playstyles), spell (fireballs, axes, throwing knives, etc.), gender (doesn't really affect much), and a random trait. Traits run the gamut from baldness, dysylxia, near-blindness, and irritable bowel syndrome. Some of these traits are benign. If your character is gay or bald, nothing really changes* (minus a small story element, but I won't spoil anything, no matter how insignificant). Others are slightly annoying such as irritable bowel syndrome which makes your character have flatulence when they jump. Still, others are a death sentence. Being nearly blind makes it incredibly difficult to see enemies.The enemies and locations follow the standard forumula more closely. There are four areas in the castle. Each means new enemies, and often upgraded versions of older enemies. For example: The first version of the eyeball spits one projectile at you every few seconds. The second spits two or three. The third spits nearly a dozen. The fourth unleashes a volley of projectiles in a fairly complex (but predictable) pattern.Thankfully, this is the kind of game that's actually quite fair to the players. Each death is an opportunity to learn about the enemies. After you die enough, you will learn to predict their movements. Even the bosses will become easier as you beat them enough times. You'll also have weapons, armor, and runes to augment your skills.And then the difficulty will ramp up, and you need to adapt once more.			"

												Despite the fact that Scouts and Skeletons (among other enemies) are absolute attention ♥♥♥♥♥s that I often have to keep my eye on (HAHAH Scouts) that I often have a bone to pick with (HAHAH Skeletons), this game is absolute perfection. Beneath its complicated appearance what with the whole lineage thing, this deceptively simple game has me playing for hours on end and I  NEVER GET BORED. As a Roguelike, death is permanent, which sucks if you finally find the perfect child. This aspect keeps you on your toes, making you constantly adapt to the downfalls of each child. Also, the amount of defferent enemies in this game is... well...... MASSIVE. Every time you play, you get forced to immediately remember the strategy to fight each enemy, keeping your mind as active as your fingers as you spam the attack button constantly. If I could rate this game as a part of this review, it would be 11/10. I don't just roguelike it, I rogueLOVE it.			"

												10/10I can’t overstate how great this game is. This might be one of my favorite games of all time. It’s incredibly challenging yet deeply rewarding. You will find yourself dying over and over again yet you are happy to come back for more punishment. The idea of having to pick a character – each with their own strengths and weaknesses – from a randomized gene pool is a great concept. Sometimes you will simply have to concede defeat and sometimes you will luck out and prepare yourself for a long run into unknown worlds. The randomized castles are a great mechanic that provides a fresh experience every time you restart. The ability to unlock power ups and game-changing mechanics is unique and fresh and allows for much more gradual difficulty curve. Eventually you should be able to beat the game; the question is how many hours will it take? It took me just under 20 hours to beat the final boss. The game is hard but not Spelunky hard. "

												Rogue Legacy is one of those games that perfectly balances the simple with the hectic. The game could be called simple, like many side-scrollers can, but there's a lot worth thinking about and strategic decisions to be made in regard to the upgrade tree for your character. While the various rooms of the castle explored by your hero can be quite chaotic, it's never completely overwhelming. The difficulty level in this game is perfectly balanced for it's play-style (dying a lot but not too much or in a bad way.) The game has great replay-ability as when you ""beat"" the game, the difficulty is notched up and you simply continue on, with the same character even.The game does a fantastic job with it's subtleties and humor without losing sight of the actual gameplay. The two are spliced together almost perfectly. It's supported by solid achievements and trading cards. Rogue Legacy is completely enjoyable. It'd be hard to regret purchasing it. I know I never will.Strongly suggest giving it a try! It really is a great experience.			"

												I love games that punish me for not playing perfectly. Things like Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, Super Hexagon, and Limbo are some of my favorites. And when I started Rogue Legacy, it felt like heading back down into the mines of Spelunky. But as I kept playing, that changed a bit. This game is hard on you, but it's not unforgiving because, even when you fail, you make progress.I hesitate to call this a rogue-like because it moves almost all progression from the game to the meta-game; you don't power up at all (except for one or two rare exceptions) while you're playing, and when you do, it's permanent. Contrast that with Spelunky, FTL, Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeon, etc., where failure means a complete restart, and you get a much different experience - a nicer, kinder experience.This rogueish-like (rogue-likeish? rogue-like-like?) gameplay is perfectly complimented by smooth platforming mechanics, very solid controls (though I would recommend a gamepad), a good variety of enemies, and a great soundtrack. Toss in the descendent and trait gimmicks and this you've got yourself a well-designed, highly replayable, very polished experience.			"

												Rogue-like gaming meets Castlevania and a persistant upgrade system.  If your curiouse about Rogue and Rogue-like 'hardcore' gaming then this is an excellent place to start.  While it has the harsh and randomness of a Rogue-like. it also has an underlying persistant progression that all of your characters share and benefit from as you unlock it and a rather unique sense of humor.   There are a wealth of classes and features to play around with as you progress through the game and not much is missing in the way of challenge you'd expect from a game in this genre while still managing to be more approachable by newcomers.  Though it does bare mentioning that if you sit there and grind those manor upgrades you'll soon find the challenge stripped from the game, if only for the time being till your progress catches up with your power.  I recommend not grinding, sure grab all the money and pickups you can per run but -do not- grind.  you may find  that stripping the challenge from the game (even temporarilly) may also diminish your enjoyment of it.

I do *not* particularly like Roguelikes so if that's holding you back, forgetaboutit; this is ♥♥♥♥ing fun.  I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ at it and it's still a ♥♥♥♥ton of fun.  Excellent job to the devs, looking forward to playing this a lot more and maybe one day having the courahe to leave the castle zone for the other zones.			"

												Excellent game, like a modern Ghost and Goblins! Good retro art, very good soundtrack, and excellent gameplay designed to fit various playing styles. Definitely worth the price. It has a decent replayability potential, even though for hardcore gamers maybe it lacks a time run or something of the sort. For me, until now, best game of 2014 (I know that it came out last year).In a few words: a must!!!			"

												Have you ever tried out a roguelike and wanted to like it, but just couldn't get into its punishing nature?I have, and no matter how many times I tried to get into the genre, for the most part I couldn't find one that was for me.And then Rogue Legacy came around, with its Castlevania-inspired gameplay, randomized character-trait system that always added a unique flair to the gameplay, and the constant sense of accomplishment with the numerous upgrades available at your keep, and I couldn't stop playing the game.Every time I'd get to the point of ""just one more run,"" I'd find myself getting even more gold than I did the previous run, and then I'd want to go spend it on something in the keep, and then I'd try again, and before I knew it I had played another hour.Addictive doesn't even begin to describe it.Buy this game, hook up your favorite gamepad (or buy one because this game plays SOOO good with one), and then watch as time flies as you try to uncover more and more of the castle and/or find tons of gold.

												A very well crafted rogue-like platformer game.Gameplay is fast-paced (bullet evading included) and feels really greatSounds and music are quite good.Mechanics are decent for a rogue-like game.However, as soon as you reach the ""end game"", the game will become repetitive and boring. Hop in, kill the bosses, kill the last boss, go to the next difficulty, repeat.I would suggest this for anyone who loves platformers. Even if you're not very familiar with rogue-like genre.			"

												While the rogue-like (permadeath) system coupled with the randomizing castle can make you feel like you aren't making any progress initially, the game surprises with the gradual gains of building out your manor to unlock new classes and bonuses.The inclusion of traits adds more depth to the experience, even when the traits do nothing from a gameplay standpoint (e.g. baldness or being gay). It's kind of fulfilling in its own right to power through the castle with a lesbian dwarf ninja.The game has a good sense of humor, and there are nodding references here and there to other media (e.g. Skyrim, Naruto), and there is enough of a rhythm once you've upgraded things a bit to offset the frustration of starting from scratch every time you die (and you will die many, many times). Note that you do have the option to ""freeze"" the castle layout at a -40% gold intake penalty once you unlock the Architect.The concept is great, and the execution is clever and full of charm. I hope to see more games from this team.Notes:-Spellsword+Vampirism is a mighty combination.-The game can frustrate you by offering puzzles that are only possible if you re-equip and lock the castle layout.-Some traits that sound negative can be surprisingly useful (e.g. P.A.D., Dwarfism, O.C.D.).-It's nice to play as a gay hero (without any stereotypical humor), especially after reading the developer's comments on why they included it.

												Rogue Legacy is a rougelike game made by Celler Door Games, who also made Don't **** your pants and Tribal Tallies. So you're thinking this won't be a great game based of their previous games. It isn't. Rogue Legacy brings in some very unique gameplay that makes it fun and enjoyable. You play as a hero with a class as they enter the castle looting and killing baddies until they die. They will be remembered by how well you played in the castle and each time you die, your descendants will continue where you left off, or at least do better than you did. And sometimes they can have good or bad traits depending on what the RNG gives you. But each time you enter the castle. You have to pay a fee with Cheron before you can enter and each time you enter, the castle will randomize itself, so you always expect different results each time (unless you use the architect to keep the castle the way it is).There are RPG elements added in the game to beef off your heroes. Such as increasing stats and gaining new classes and abilities in the manor. You can also gain runes and blueprints for equipment in the castle for your son/daughter to wield the next time they enter, some giving them unique abilities when equip. There's also a training dummy to see how strong your attacks are. Sometimes there will be fairy chest challenges that will be needed to be done before you can obtain the runes and later stats upgrade once you obtained all the runes. Some are nearly impossible to do and others are really simple if you have the right tools or you know what you are doing. There are minibosses you can fight too for bluepritns and stats upgrade too that appear rarely. So it's worth it to fight them if you have enough health to withstand their attacks.The story is simple. The tutorials give you a hint on what happened before you entered the castle with your heroes and later near the end explains what happens. It may not be heavily story based, but the story seems to work well with the game.There are also minigames you can play too, such as carnival games and pick the right chest to gain profits or lose it all. They are hard, but with the right tools and strageties, you can earn some neat stuff.There are negative stuff to be had too. One, this game is really frustrating. Expect to die alot from careless mistakes or not being lucky enough. It even sucks when the characters you choose will have really bad traits and can't trade them in (until you get a upgrade that allows you to reroll your children). And second, it's a grindfest. If you want to beat bosses and enemies and last longer in the castle, get alot of money for upgrades. Usually Cheron takes all your money, but upgrading the haggle skill allows you to keep some money for later purchases, which is good. All in all, this is a wonderful game. It has neat graphics, cool soundtracks, and it's addicting to play. But the frustrating levels and the hardcore grinding makes it hard to really love this game when it's not being evil to you.Rating 8/10			"

												While the game starts slow (you're going to die very often and very quickly), the nature of the gameplay works to its own advantage--you can play for so long, get frustrated at dying so quickly, stop for a bit, and then come back to it later. The game itself is incredibly fun and charming, with so many little extras that make every new character feel unique and worth playing (even if sometimes your heir options suck). It definitely keeps you coming back for more, and well worth the price. Good for gamers who can't focus for very long periods of time!			"

												Rogue Legacy is as you could imagine a game about getting money, remember Binding of Isaac and how that seemed challenging? Well when you play this game you will change your mind, this game is filled with challanges, powerful mobs, heroes with annoting, hard and sometimes useful traits but most of all a lot of fun.This game has been designed for people that know how to play hack and slash games and get get through the hard territories even with Vertigo, Stereo blindess and Colour Blindness.Through out the game you gotta earn money to expand your mannor, that's the only way you will survive further through the endless corridors of the castle in order to defeat the 1st out of 4 beasts, expanding your mannor will grant you things like more health, armour, attack and armour capacity, but also you'll be able to unlock new classes, upgrades to those classes, and other utilities, but importantly, unlock the Blacksmith, that will sell armour, Enchantress who will sell runes (NOTE: all those things you first gotta find in the castle) and an arichtect who for a a 30% of your money will lock the castle, why would it be useful? Say if you found a good spot to get money or found the boss room or even just you like the castle, well then that's useful (Looted chests will stay looted when you lock the castle).About a story, well the story isn't told to your directly, but me telling you it would ruin the fun, basically the story is contained in the Prince's Journals that you will find through out the castle and it definately is worth a read.So is the game worth buying, I say yes, I myself haven't seen many people deny that, this game is a lot of fun and a challenge, I like challenges myself and although the game is sometimes frustrating of how hard it can get, however after a few seconds break I get back to the game and I've already killed two of the four bosses.Sory wise once you start reading the story you might actually not want to stop, the story gets quite intense plus it kinda ruins the ending once you do get to the ending of the journals, but its still a good read, unless you have dyslexia... then its just confusing.Anyway I rate this game 9 evil paintings out of 10, my highest rating yet but I can see the game deserves it. So go ahead, buy it since its on sale! You won't regret it!			"

Interesting game mechanics combined with plenty of humour and nerdy references make this game quite fun to play. It's nice that the game doesn't force you to constantly backtrack unless you want to (it's optional~), so every playthrough feels fresh. Dying a lot is one of the main features of the game, but it doesn't feel tedious at all; instead, it'll have you saying ""Just one more heir, and then I'm done"" over and over again until you realize that you've been playing for 4 hours longer than you meant to. It's also nice that there are so many different character options every time you die, so you can change your play style to whatever suits your current mood. 10/10			"

When you die (WHEN you die), you upgrade various slots on your Mansion with the gold you earned going through Castle Hamson to better various skills and attain new abilities. Then (the most interesting, unexpected, and well-blended feature I've ever seen in a Roguelike video game) you choose one of three heirs to go through the castle again, with the new skills/abilities/equipment/runes you got with the previous character[s].This game is a STEAL at $15.

												An excellent Castlevania-style platformer with roguelike elements. Because gold and upgrades carry over between characters, permadeath doesn't make you feel like your run was wasted when you eventually miss a jump and fall onto a bed of spikes. Combat is fairly simple, but pleasantly fast-paced, and the assorted challenge rooms, random positive and negative perks, and various other nuances make repeated trips into the castle very entertaining. I do wish there was a bit more enemy variety (there's a fair number of palette swaps), and some of the rooms show up more often than I'd like, but overall Rogue Legacy is definitely worth a look for platformer fans and roguelike fans alike.

If you do get this game, partition your time wisely. If you are skilled, you will probably get through this with more ease than I had.The game offers many many many upgrades that you can get through finding gold inside the castle (which changes all the rooms everytime your [new] heir enters). You have a manor that allows you to upgrade health, magic, armor, you know, the regular stuff, but also allows you to upgrade rooms to get new styles of play.It is much more deep than that.Trust me, you want in.Good luck, it it a fun treck.

The random dungeon system makes you feel like you're not being tedious with every run, which is well done for a rouge game. Although fairly short, you can spend a lot of time beating the game over and over again, with the increasing difficulty during NG+ to NG^n+. Although a steep curve to start off, it does get easier over time after you have mastered the different classes and their playstyles.			"

Well when you play this game you will change your mind, this game is filled with challanges, powerful mobs, heroes with annoting, hard and sometimes useful traits but most of all a lot of fun.This game has been designed for people that know how to play hack and slash games and get get through the hard territories even with Vertigo, Stereo blindess and Colour Blindness.Through out the game you gotta earn money to expand your mannor, that's the only way you will survive further through the endless corridors of the castle in order to defeat the 1st out of 4 beasts, expanding your mannor will grant you things like more health, armour, attack and armour capacity, but also you'll be able to unlock new classes, upgrades to those classes, and other utilities, but importantly, unlock the Blacksmith, that will sell armour, Enchantress who will sell runes (NOTE: all those things you first gotta find in the castle) and an arichtect who for a a 30% of your money will lock the castle, why would it be useful? Say if you found a good spot to get money or found the boss room or even just you like the castle, well then that's useful (Looted chests will stay looted when you lock the castle).About a story, well the story isn't told to your directly, but me telling you it would ruin the fun, basically the story is contained in the Prince's Journals that you will find through out the castle and it definately is worth a read.So is the game worth buying, I say yes, I myself haven't seen many people deny that, this game is a lot of fun and a challenge, I like challenges myself and although the game is sometimes frustrating of how hard it can get, however after a few seconds break I get back to the game and I've already killed two of the four bosses.Sory wise once you start reading the story you might actually not want to stop, the story gets quite intense plus it kinda ruins the ending once you do get to the ending of the journals, but its still a good read, unless you have dyslexia... then its just confusing.Anyway I rate this game 9 evil paintings out of 10, my highest rating yet but I can see the game deserves it. So go ahead, buy it since its on sale! You won't regret it!			"

												I just keep coming back to this game.  Rogue Legacy is a game that can be enjoyed in small pieces but it takes a long time to master.  I love getting a little bit better every time I play.  The basic mechanic is that every time you die you start over as a new character, but any upgrades you've purchased persist.  I still have only beaten the first two bosses after 26 hours, but the randomly generated dungeons have stayed fresh and interesting.  I definitely recommend this game.			"

												   Wow, what a game.  I'm not generally a platform gamer, but this has more than a few additional aspects to it.  Challenging as all get-up, but a bit of time investment, gets better by the level.   A bit of humor thrown in makes this a lighthearted but intensely deep game that will suck up more than a few hours at a time.  In addition to the fact that you can step away at a moments notice, being that each run may only from a few minutes to sometimes more, being able to jump right back in, this is a winner and a highly suggested purchase.

												An enjoyable and utterly addicitive Metroidvania/rogue-""lite"". The sprite work in regards to both the enemies and the castle's various backgrounds is sharp, colorful, and all-around fantastic. Between the procedurally-generated castle layouts and the unique geneological trait system, the game is able to stay fresh from one run to the next and maintain a nice sense of randomness. The progression/skill tree is surprisingly deep and will require a lot of playtime to fill out. Intimidating bosses and rooms packed to the brim with enemies help create a healthy, satisfying challenge. I also like how the game gives you the freedom to explore the entire castle right off the bat, yet punishes you if you travel to specific areas out of the intended order (a la Dark Souls). Perhaps most impressive, though, is what could best be described as a ""masterful"" soundtrack. Every time I hear the theme for the Maya/Tower, I smile with joy. The music in this game is just so well done.On the downside, while the platforming and combat controls work well for the most part and are simple to get a hang of, the analog controls tend to be a bit over-sensitive. There have been quite a few instances where I've screwed up and felt it was more a matter of the game's controls being imprecise than it was my own fault. Also, while still fun more than 20+ hours into playing, the experience does tend to feel a little grind-y once you get far into New Game+ territory.Problems aside, Rogue Legacy manages to do so many things well and so few things wrong. It does a terrific job of scratching that old-school Metroid/Castlevania itch and provides a sense of accomplishment with each run. A game that's easy to pick up and play in short 30 minute bursts, or spend hours on end with. Highly recommended.			"

												At first, I only bought this game because i liked the art style, but now, after beating the main story, I absolutely love this game.To start, the whole concept of ""no two castles are the same"" is done very well, with defferent rooms challenging different classes, plus there being secrets for characters with specific traits. The enimies are varied and intersting, esepcially the mini-bosses, even though at the beginning, you won't last very long. If you continue playing though, your skills will increase, as well as your armour, runes and stats. The 4 main bosses of each area are fun and are diffuclt, being extremley hard to beat them on your first time ( except the 4th boss, he is too weak to be the 4th area boss.) The controls are very good, with all the key assingments feeling natural. The finally thing is that the music in Rogue Legacy is some of the finest indie music I've heard. Overall, If you are a fan of Metroid, or the Metroid-Vanias, or are looking for a great indie game, this is the game for you. Also, on a side note, my longest living character was a midget, bald, assaisan.			"

												First of all, If you hate dying, dying, dying... dying, again, again and again then you'll hate this game cause you do die a lot, It should be called Rogue Legacy DIE Edition.Let's be serious, It's not that hard but like most of the roguelike games you'll have to play to get better, your character will gets better but so the enemies, It's a nice platformer game, It can be kind of repetetive after a time but It's still a really great game that I would suggest to any roguelike fans.What would make this game even more epic is if you could be able to create your own castle/level and also more characters, more weapons, more genre of levels (outside, snowy, etc etc...).But I'm not complaining, It's still a really good game.8.5/10			"

Players comming from games such as Castlevania (the series) or Zelda II The Adventures of Link will find a familar but fresh and  most likely unique and enjoyable expirence. I appriciate how this game offers options to cool down the difficulty (although personally I haven't had to use them yet, I anticipate it later on in the game, as it is found by many players to be a useful, natural option) for players who find themselves overwhelmed in any way, shape or form.

Difficulty is good, maybe a little on the hard side if you're rusty on action platformers (like me). The game is genuninely funny, too.

												I really, really enjoyed this game, and if the following words mean anything to you, I think you will as well:Arcade platformer metroidvania roguelike.Still with me?It took me 102 deaths and 16.5 hours to beat this thing. Unlike other roguelikes, it's very probable that you will beat this game after investing enough time into it, thanks to a life-to-life upgrade progression system that other roguelikes don't possess. As Rogue Legacy is super fun to play, that won't be hard to consider doing.Like most roguelikes the game's dungeon is different every time you play, but you can sacrifice a bug chunk of your money of your money (used for upgrades between lives) to keep the dungeon the same, keeping access to all the warp points you've uncovered, etc. This feature is theoretically good for fighting the game's bosses until you win, as they are very difficult and will take multiple tries to beat. But as bosses always drop a ton of cash, I never bothered with that. In fact, I effectively never used the feature -- not because I'm super hardcore, but it's just in my best interests. The more money I get, the faster I upgrade, the faster I will eventually beat the boss in its due time.Even if you have played other roguelikes and didn't enjoy them, I recommend you download the demo to Rogue Legacy and give it a shot. As death is your chance to spend your money and upgrade your lineage; like it's the only way to Level Up and if you're an RPG fan, you know Leveling Up is fun.  This is a rare example of a game that actually makes it fun to fail.  If you like action platforming, the game is an incredible value with fun mechanics and charming aesthetics.			"

												Rogue Legacy is an interesting game/rogue lite.  A variety of classes (which you don't choose but from possibly up to 3 each death), a huge amount of upgrades on your castle, and a touch of nostaglia in terms of graphics AND controls leads to a ... pleasant? experience.  When it isn't causing nail biting discomfort, that is.  Game can be tough.Pros:Nigh infinite replayability, with no two zones the same, no two characters the same, tons of upgrades.Interesting story wrapped in a few neat little bundles, and hidden throughout the game.Cons:Can be hard as all heck to get anything as certain classes.Some of the negative qualities can make the game unplayable.Dragons were underpowered when I played.

												Rogue Legacy is apply named it's very 'Rogue' like. You're not expected to win on your first playthrough, you're just supposed to do a little bit better, each time spending your hard earned gold on upgrades, runes & abilities. The game mechanics are in a way close to Binding of Isaac & Dark Souls, the death isn't the end but instead a teaching tool. After each time you die, you get a little farther because it let's you get a feel of the enemies, the traps, the world and how they work. After enough time you'll be able to see traps coming but if you perish from them, well that's on you. The game teaches you on how each enemy works and it does it very well.Even though I've only spent two hours playing it, I've been focusing on all the little details on how this game is very fun, very addicting and each time a very rewarding experience. Thoroughly enjoy this game and highly reccomend.			"

												Rogue Legacy. Damn, I love this game. It's so fun. Anyways, Rogue Legacy is a rogue-lite game that requires you to kill 4  bosses in order to open a golden throne room, that I have yet to know what's inside. The game is quite difficult, let me just say that. When you die, your children will succeed you. You pick one child and you use them you hopefull finish the game. Then when you die after, you always have 3 children to choose from. When you die, you don't have to completely restart. You keep all your equipment, and all the points you spent on the manor (your perks such as more health, more mana, attack power up, etc.) So you level up with each point in the manor. Now, the gameplay. You basically can move and jump and slash and cast spells to kill enemies. Pretty simple. You can also have a smithy who has the equipment *note: you must find blueprints for your smithy to be able to make it, then you buy it.* The enchantress can enchant your equipment with runes to give extra bonuses and power ups. *note: you must also find the runes yourself.* There's a lot more to the game, but that's all I can explain now. Verdict: 9/10. BUY THE GAME NOW! FULL PRICE! NOW! THE SECOND YOU READ THIS!			"

												My legacy has gone rogue. My 7-year-old has been playing it and he likes the Knight class so much he doesn't want to upgrade it to the Paladin... which means that he cannot unlock any upgrades and his potentially awe-inspiring castle remains a small fort. Each to their own, I suppose.Anyway, I enjoyed this game - great for a quick blast, plenty to explore and I felt great about finding the hidden class (at the top of the flagpole). It seems very much designed for an XBox controller, though, so playing on mouse and keyboard was difficult (I had to work out and write down the mappings from XBox controls to keyboard controls, plus the down-attack move to activate platforms is far too difficult on the default settings).It would be nice to carry over money from previous generations to allow the more casual player to build up a fortune... as it was, I found it increasingly difficult to be able to spend my money on anything useful (but did find that investing in the 'vampire' items and runes helped my character survive for longer to get the money). Also, some guidance on the order to attempt the other levels would be useful too (unless I missed something in the notes). Still, I enjoyed the various classes and weird hero traits, and the game overall.			"

												I was bored. I was looking for something fun and light to take my mind away from all the more serious games I'd been playing. I found it.Well, truth be told, I wasn't actually expecting to enjoy Rogue Legacy all that much, I really only picked it up because a friend had recommended it, and fully expected to get bored quickly. That's basically the opposite of what happened.The graphics are cute, and who doesn't like to do the occasional dungeon-crawl with adorable graphics? I was hooked within minutes. At this point, I find myself playing it for a little while most days. I'll decide ""just one more character, just one more dungeon-crawl and then I'll go to bed... A few hours and a whole bunch of deaths later, I usually do. This is probably one of the most addictive little games I've played in a long time. The idea behind it is really very simple. You play a child from each of a succession of generations of one family, you can choose which, out of three random options, and in you go. The dungeon is different each time, unless you pay the Architect to give you the same one again, and until you pay for the upgrade that lets you pay Charon a little less, the ferryman charges you all your gold to get in. That's a real pain, makes it harder to stockpile your gold. You need that gold to upgrade your stats. Eventually, you face the bosses in it, but you can choose when to go through those doors, and they stay defeated through each generation after they're beaten. The story itself is told through diary pages that you find randomly.But sometimes the simplest ideas are the best, and this game is a whole lot of fun.			"

												When you think of roguelikes, you normally think of randomness, high difficulty, and most importantly, permadeath. Dying in those games is very serious, you lose everything: Characters, stats, items, all gone. In that genre, death really means Game Over. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? Enter Rogue Legacy.You are a warrior tasked with exploring a magical castle and defeating monsters within, with Castlevania-like gameplay that should be familiar to everyone. The twist is that, when you die, that character is gone, and you start playing as one of their heirs, with different traits and classes. The money and treasure gathered by the deceased are passed on, and you can spend them on upgrades and equipments for the new generations.The game manages to keep a constant sense of progress with the upgrade system; dying is not the end, it’s the beginning of a new adventure where you’re likely to be better prepared. It’s not just about getting better stats and armor, either, you’ll also unlock new classes and mechanical improvements, like dashes and air jumps.Your descendants are, however, randomly generated. This goes for both class and traits, the latter of which are characteristics like ""Glaucoma"" or ""Dwarfism"" that can be very helpful, irrelevant, or highly crippling. The unreliability inherent to the heirs often forces you to adapt to something that ""will do"" instead of having the best for the task available, which makes victory all the more sweet.And of course, it wouldn’t be a roguelike if the journey through the castle was always the same. It changes, but not simply for each game: It changes on every single generation. This is why you don’t want to die too early: You miss the chance to get a lot of loot, and boss rooms are transferred elsewhere. On the other hand, a new character means new treasure to find, so it’s not that bad. It’s fun, both to win, and to lose.And that is Rogue Legacy: A game that avoids being frustrating, but still without making you feel you’re getting off easy. All the balance in the gameplay elements really shows that a lot of effort was put into making this game, and it paid off, because Rogue Legacy makes for a fantastic roguelike*, and probably for one of the best Castlevanias out there, too.* “Roguelite”, if you prefer.PS: Use of a controller is highly recommended.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/rogue-legacy-game-review/Ahh, Rogue Legacy. My favorite rogue-like game, although it also served as my introduction to the genre. Even after playing a lot of others from the genre now, I still look back on Rogue Legacy as my favorite out of the bunch.The game is presented in a pixel fashion, making use of some nice looking sprites for the various people and enemies you will meet along your journey. This style fits well, especially for a game of this genre. Come to think of it, I don't think I've played a rogue-like that was not in this style, and I've played several of them over the past several months. Can't really complain either, there's nothing wrong with it and I'd actually prefer this style in a rogue-like game, although I may be a bit biased there (heh).Rogue Legacy's niche is the rebirth mechanic. Upon dying as one character, you'll have the choice as to which of the three offspring of that character you'll play as next. The interesting thing about this mechanic however, is that each child has separate traits, disguised as real world disorders and conditions. These can either be in your favor or against it. ADHD, for example, works in your favor in that your character will move 30% faster than usual. My favorite defect is vertigo, which mirrors the screen vertically. Yes, everything, including menus. Vertigo is a pain to deal with as I cannot rotate my monitor upside down, forcing me to play upside-down.Aside from that gimmick, the other half of the game is the immense class and upgrade system. You'll start off with no skills, playing as the default class, the knight. Upon death, the opportunity to choose offspring with a different class is presented. The basic classes to choose from contain classes such as: mage, knave, knight, barbarian, shinobi, miner, etc. Each class can be upgraded, getting a name change in the process. The shinobi, for example, changes into the hokage, my favorite class. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, keep that in mind.The shinobi/hokage has the benefit of upgraded strength (175% to be exact), but at the cost of only having 60% HP, 40% MP, and not being able to take advantage of critical hits. I never really used the game's spells, so the MP cut didn't have much of an effect on me, but the HP and critical hits were quite the drawback. Even so, whenever I was given the opportunity to play as a hokage, I always took it. You can't beat 175% damage. I found it crucial to defeating some of the game's bosses. I actually defeated the forest boss (the second one I took on) without getting hit as a hokage, quite the achievement.On top of the classes, there's also a plethora of upgrades to choose from each time you die. The upgrades are laid out in a branching format, with certain upgrades unlocking others. The first one made available is Smithy, the blacksmith. Once purchased, you'll be able to purchase both armor and weapons from him. There's also an architect (who can keep the last layout of the castle if you choose to not want the game to randomly generate another castle again) and an enchantress, who sells runes, which can be equipped to provide various abilities (like the ability to jump while in air).The other upgrades consist of class upgrades (like barbarian -> barbarian king) and stat upgrades. This consists of mana, health, and equip upgrades. Equip upgrades allow you to carry more weight and is required if you ever want to wear good armor. There's plenty of other upgrades to base skills (attack up, magic damage up, armor up, etc.) and a few unique ones, like ""death defy"" and ""haggle"". Death defy, as you can probably tell, allows you to defy death (1.5% everytime the upgrade is purchased). Haggle, on the other hand, lowers Charon's toll when entering the castle.The game's map is divided into five zones: the front ""safe"" area at the entrance to the castle, the castle, the maya (above the castle), the dungeon (below the castle), and the forest (to the right of the castle). Each area (aside from the safe area) has its own boss that needs to be defeated if you want to unlock the golden door at the entrance of the castle. These bosses are very difficult if you're not properly equipped (I did tell you about my love for the hokage class, right?). Each time you die and want to re-enter the castle, you'll have to give up all of your funds earned during the previous run to Charon, who guards the entrance to the castle.Rogue Legacy is a fantastic game overall. The sense of progression is really profound and it just feels really, really satisfying to defeat the bosses and open that golden door. Now that it's only $15, why not give it a shot?			"

I also enjoyed the concept of each play through being your heir which you pass your wealth to.My only gripe is that after 10 hours or so you're about ready to bottle it up and put it away. Levels randomize but eventually it doesn't FEEL random. Still, I like it overall. "

												This would have been a great game but the publishers that made it forgot to put in a saving feature. Every time you die you have to start ALL over again. Also sometimes there are weird glitches like the screen will be blurry or black and white or something. If they fixed the saving thing and the glitches it would be a pretty good game.			"

												After years of playing overly involved games like EVE-Online, Elder Scrolls series games and other assorted RPG's, I've decided that maybe my gaming was taking up too much of my time and decided to go with games that can get me a quick fix then I can move on with my life.Damn you Rouge Legacy, damn you.  Yes, it does fit the quick fix.   But it's like smoke crack.  Just one more time!  I promise..   I used to curse Eve Online for the sheer planning and time consumed carrying out mundane things like putting up a player owned station...  Now I'm cursing Rouge Legacy because there comparitively little planning involved, yet it still consumes too much of my time.  It's a stupid platformer.  I hate it.  But I can't stop playing it.  So I am highly recommending this game to everyone but my children because misery loves company.On a more serious note --  this is a great little ""rouge-like"".  The controls aren't exactly tight as some other reviews will lead you to believe - they are however twich based and Castlevania styled.  The gimmick of having heirs works suprisingly well.  My biggest gripe is not having Steam Cloud support - just lost a hard drive - and while I was mirroring a large portion of my data, my save games didn't make it.I would recommend buying this game when it is on sale.  As much as I like it, $14.99 is asking a lot for what amounts to an arcade game.			"

												This game is amazingly good, one of the only games that I would truly recommend to anybody, like I would reccomend Hotline Miami to just about anyone. The game isn't a Rogue-like, but a Rogue-lite, meaning that however perma-death is still permanent (Rest in peace Lady Chun Li XVI), you will become progressively stronger and stronger with the ability to upgrade your character and buy runes and armor to prepare yourself for the next run. The game's mechanics are soo smooth so that your sprints easily transitions into double jumps and maybe even flight (If you are about that life). I just love this game, the only thing bad about it is that the story is lacking, just like all of the other Rogue-likes, and that the enemies are just recolored as they level up throughout your time playing the game. The game changes a lot over the new game +'s to the point where the bloodshots from floating eyeballs don't seem so bad compared to the spam from flamelocks, and then those flamelocks seem scrawny nexy to those dang plinkies. This game has so much entertainment to offer that it is definitively one of my favorite singleplayer games of all time (Bastion is still the best).			"

BUY IT ALREADY! you pick a hero and then go off into the castle. in there you can find big knights, mages(or whatever the hell they are), haunted paintings, spikey balls shooting fireballs, hauntedghost balls (lots of balls in this game). there is more enemies but i can't remember them all.NOTE: if you are gonna play this game you'll need a xbox or playstation controller because the gameplay feels more comfortable with a controller (I recommend a xbox controller).SECOND NOTE: this game is pretty hard once you start off but once you turn into ""a pro"" its a little easier.

It's always a new adventure every time you die, because when you die, you get to choose from three of your last character's offsprings, who each have their own traits and spells, also, you can buy armor to put on your characters, AND since you have to venture through the castle, the insides of the castle are randomly generated everytime.

												A very fun ""rogue-lite"" Metroid-vania game. Its controls are tight, kills are satisfying, and the game is difficult but reasonably so.

Almost to a fault, but not really.- Infinite replay value- Creative level design- Unique enemies and bosses- Unique upgrade system/passive skill tree, which is actually incredibly useful and even required in order to progress.The bad:- A bit of a steep price.Overall I highly reccomend if you've got nothing else you want to buy.

												Truth be told, I am not a huge fan of Roguelike games on a whole. Despite their mechanical purity and focus on strong gameplay, they often suffer from poor level design and a lack of emotional connection or progression. Rogue Legacy, however, manages to subvert the latter in a very intriguing way, even if I feel that many of the more negative trappings of Roguelike games haunt this title.The game continues to suffer from the poor level design of its contemporaries. Being a Metroidvania inspired title, with a massive vania and a small sobbing Metroid being dragged along with it, this isn't as big of an issue as it could be. But in a genre which so clearly has great level design laid out for it, it would've easily been possible to make this game have fantastic level design, due to the way it randomizes levels. At current, it has large amounts of enemy spam and doesn't really let you take advantage of your characters' particular abilities very well, aside from the base core mechanics.Unlike other Metroidvania titles, this game doesn't introduce new weapons or game mechanics as you progress through the game, but linear upgrades like higher HP stats, strength, and different classes whom usually have a unique ability not directly related to combat or movement, and shuffled stats. The game's character progression is relatively weak, is what I'm saying.But despite suffering from weak character progression and poor level design, this game has a certain permanence to your actions which other roguelikes don't. Your upgrades and unlocks stay with you as you play. Even with what is ostensibly the game's prestige mode, old upgrades and traits are kept and even enhanced. It culminates in a very enjoyable experience where you never necessarily feel like you've 'lost' much outside of the dungeons resetting, and you can pick up the game and continue right from where you left off again.In terms of game design, this is a rather poor title, but it participates in filling the niche of a more replayable game following the core concepts of Metroidvania style action platforming. A niche which was previously very empty.If the idea of a Metroidvania game which focuses on replayability sounds good to you, even if it has fairly poor level design and a progression system that leaves me lukewarm to it, it's very much so worth a try.I look forward to seeing the future offerings of Cellar Door Games. It's rumored that they're planning to start work on a Rogue Legacy sequel in the future, to which I would say that it should basically be this, with a more varied progression system featuring more substantial changes to movement mechanics and weapons, along with more stark level design, potentially killing the 'castle' segments altogether.But as it stands, this game fills both a unique niche, and one with very wide appeal. It is worth playing in many senses of the word, but with clear flaws and a lack of polish regarding many of the core ideas.			"

												Rogue Legacy is one of those games that perfectly balances the simple with the hectic. The game could be called simple, like many side-scrollers can, but there's a lot worth thinking about and strategic decisions to be made in regard to the upgrade tree for your character. While the various rooms of the castle explored by your hero can be quite chaotic, it's never completely overwhelming. The difficulty level in this game is perfectly balanced for it's play-style (dying a lot but not too much or in a bad way.) The game has great replay-ability as when you ""beat"" the game, the difficulty is notched up and you simply continue on, with the same character even.The game does a fantastic job with it's subtleties and humor without losing sight of the actual gameplay. The two are spliced together almost perfectly. It's supported by solid achievements and trading cards. Rogue Legacy is completely enjoyable. It'd be hard to regret purchasing it. I know I never will.Strongly suggest giving it a try! It really is a great experience.			"

												Rogue Legacy is easily one of the most addicting games I have played in a while.At first, it is frustratingly difficult - but that is okay, as with every one of your pitiful deaths, the gold you collect through your adventure can be used to buy upgrades for your future heirs - be it unlocking new classes, or increasing health. Each of your heirs is flawed in some way - be it the curse of I.B.S., dementia, or savantism, every adventure will be different with your new hero through a dynamically generated castle, forest, and other spooky areas.This game is best played on an Xbox 360 controller -I have both wired PS2 and Xbox 360 controllers, and the 360 one works best for me.The nice part about this game is you can play pickup games whenever you want to blow a little steam off without getting too heavily invested in the game. 5 minutes early for a meeting?

												While the rogue-like (permadeath) system coupled with the randomizing castle can make you feel like you aren't making any progress initially, the game surprises with the gradual gains of building out your manor to unlock new classes and bonuses.The inclusion of traits adds more depth to the experience, even when the traits do nothing from a gameplay standpoint (e.g. baldness or being gay). It's kind of fulfilling in its own right to power through the castle with a lesbian dwarf ninja.The game has a good sense of humor, and there are nodding references here and there to other media (e.g. Skyrim, Naruto), and there is enough of a rhythm once you've upgraded things a bit to offset the frustration of starting from scratch every time you die (and you will die many, many times). Note that you do have the option to ""freeze"" the castle layout at a -40% gold intake penalty once you unlock the Architect.The concept is great, and the execution is clever and full of charm. I hope to see more games from this team.Notes:-Spellsword+Vampirism is a mighty combination.-The game can frustrate you by offering puzzles that are only possible if you re-equip and lock the castle layout.-Some traits that sound negative can be surprisingly useful (e.g. P.A.D., Dwarfism, O.C.D.).-It's nice to play as a gay hero (without any stereotypical humor), especially after reading the developer's comments on why they included it.

												At first, I only bought this game because i liked the art style, but now, after beating the main story, I absolutely love this game.To start, the whole concept of ""no two castles are the same"" is done very well, with defferent rooms challenging different classes, plus there being secrets for characters with specific traits. The enimies are varied and intersting, esepcially the mini-bosses, even though at the beginning, you won't last very long. If you continue playing though, your skills will increase, as well as your armour, runes and stats. The 4 main bosses of each area are fun and are diffuclt, being extremley hard to beat them on your first time ( except the 4th boss, he is too weak to be the 4th area boss.) The controls are very good, with all the key assingments feeling natural. The finally thing is that the music in Rogue Legacy is some of the finest indie music I've heard. Overall, If you are a fan of Metroid, or the Metroid-Vanias, or are looking for a great indie game, this is the game for you. Also, on a side note, my longest living character was a midget, bald, assaisan.			"

												An absolutely amazing game. Rogue Legacy delivers on all levels. The music brings back memories of Diablo II. The look of the game is definitely classic Super Nintendo Ghouls and Ghosts, however the gameplay has merit in its own right. It does not really play like Ghosts and Goblins or its successor Ghouls and Ghosts, which is not a bad thing. Many different character classes can be unlocked and each class has its own special ability that takes mana. You will find new pieces of armor and runes as you play, which you can purchase after your character's inevitable permanent death. Upon death you will then choose an heir to keep your legacy alive. Each character has its own special traits that can help or hinder you along the way. The runes that you acquire will give your character new abilities or they can do things such as make enemies harder, but also give you more gold.Rogue Legacy is challenging, it will test your prowess. The game features a new game + mode, which makes it even more difficult and allows you to continue upgrading your manor and purchasing new armor and runes even after you have completed the game. The short storyline is good and it will keep you motivated to keep going.			"

												Great platformer for casual gamers. There is a game mechanic to prevent steady grinding away at it for gradual increase in resources, equipment, etc. where Charon requires you give up all (or, later on, a majority) of your currency to get back into the dungeon for each generation.This is the type of game where the player must primarily level up their real-life skills with the controller (or keyboard) for more success in the game, only mildly supplemented by in-game powerups that can be earned.While definitely geared toward a casual game here and there as time permits, the powerups are very diverse with a skill tree, collectible artifacts that unlock purchasable armor or abilities, and boss characters that are near impossible to beat without a very distinct strategy and some luck make this appealing for more hardcore retro-style players.One thing I would prefer is to have Steam Cloud enabled on here. I've already reinstalled my operating system twice since I started playing this and kicked myself for not making a backup of my save file.			"

												At first, I only bought this game because i liked the art style, but now, after beating the main story, I absolutely love this game.To start, the whole concept of ""no two castles are the same"" is done very well, with defferent rooms challenging different classes, plus there being secrets for characters with specific traits. The enimies are varied and intersting, esepcially the mini-bosses, even though at the beginning, you won't last very long. If you continue playing though, your skills will increase, as well as your armour, runes and stats. The 4 main bosses of each area are fun and are diffuclt, being extremley hard to beat them on your first time ( except the 4th boss, he is too weak to be the 4th area boss.) The controls are very good, with all the key assingments feeling natural. The finally thing is that the music in Rogue Legacy is some of the finest indie music I've heard. Overall, If you are a fan of Metroid, or the Metroid-Vanias, or are looking for a great indie game, this is the game for you. Also, on a side note, my longest living character was a midget, bald, assaisan.			"

												In a nutshell: Roguelike-lite Metroidvania with upgrades. I was hooked once I played the demo, and the full game is significantly more awesome and fleshed-out. Difficulty is good, maybe a little on the hard side if you're rusty on action platformers (like me). The game is genuninely funny, too. It's hard not to grin when Pricila IX, a nearsighted, bald assassin, goes charging into battle with her massive sword lifted above the tiny pink bow on her helmet.Edit: New Game+ increases the difficulty sharply. I do NOT recommend finishing your first runthrough in a hurry!			"

												I just keep coming back to this game.  Rogue Legacy is a game that can be enjoyed in small pieces but it takes a long time to master.  I love getting a little bit better every time I play.  The basic mechanic is that every time you die you start over as a new character, but any upgrades you've purchased persist.  I still have only beaten the first two bosses after 26 hours, but the randomly generated dungeons have stayed fresh and interesting.  I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Great 2d platformer with a random roguelike castle system, gameplay in the vein of castlevania to be enjoyed with a controller. The roguelike and heritage system fits perfectly in the hard to master play style where you are bound to die often, by dieing you get to buy and spend your loot to come back again to a new generated castle with your more powerful heir. The traits mechanics add a fun twist and a lot of variety to the basic concept of 2d platform fighting.Is real easy to get into it and has a quick return which sets it apart from other games of the genre that usually have to be mastered before getting a real enjoyment out of it.

												This is a game that I didn't expect to get addicted to. Then again how would one know beforehand what one would be addicted to in a game?The genre of this one is RPG roguelike 2d platformer. I have seen so many reviews of people comparing this to the Binding of Issac. ♥♥♥♥ those reviews, this is nothing like that game. The only thing they have in common is that each run is different. In Rogue Legacy, you are basically running around in a castle collecting as much money as you can (for your legacy) and killing monsters (for yourself). Each time you enter the castle, it is different inside. Once dead, you must choose a new heir (1 of 3) to explore the castle. Everyone is different. Everyone has a unique name, a class, a gender, and random attributes that make them unique. The money you earn goes to that heir and is used for purchases of items/upgrades/unlocks and must be used before going into the castle. What you choose to purchase stays for every character (equipable items can be switched/unequipped). Everyone gets 1 life to live. There are some small exceptions to things I've mentioned, but that's via unlocks anyway.			"

												First of all whoever coined the term ""Roguelike"" should be shot.That aside, Rogue Legacy is a short 2d (I refuse to say roguelike) platformer with some twists. As probably ever other review tells you, your hero changes to your next heir when you die and the heir has the potential to be born with some positive or negative traits. You level by dying which is a strange system in itself. The castle randomly changes with every heir unless you choose to pay a fee to save your previous layout with the ""Architect."" Each heir retains stat and armor upgrades your previous heirs had. As your characters get stronger, so do the mobs.Pros: - Harder than most platformers. The difficulty level was perfect for me, not rage inducing, but hard enough to be of a challenge.- Castle layout changes and different challenges spawning kept the maps interesting.- Well planned bosses, except the last boss was kind of easy...- AddictiveCons:- If you're used to old school platformer controls, this feels nothing like them. Slow attacking forces you to play very differently.- Mage classes don't really feel like mage classes.- Can't hold the d-pad down + attack like in Adventures of Link. Downward attack doesn't hold. Lasts for only a split second.- Game balance could use some work as sometimes the scaling just felt off.			"

In terms of challenge, lol you WILL be challenged, thats for sure. Plus the game doesnt really end lol, nope. You finish it and you get to play a harder version, with monster lvls scaling with yours.... yea, its tough, it scales and it allows for hours and hours of fun.Rpg, action, platformer, that will make you laugh everynow and then and get you playing for hours without an end, because when it ends, did it really?Btw, the story is really legit.

I appriciate how this game offers options to cool down the difficulty (although personally I haven't had to use them yet, I anticipate it later on in the game, as it is found by many players to be a useful, natural option) for players who find themselves overwhelmed in any way, shape or form.

												After almost 15 hours of playing rogue legacy, I've started to notice how much improved I've become.Many might think after and hour of playing this game ""I'm terrible"" and such, and just stop playing, but thats where you have to keep playing. The more you play, the better you get. At the start I was earning no more than 100 gold per run. Now I'm earning over 3000. It's increadible. The game has so much availible to it, you can just continue playing for ages. There are different classes, they all do different things. Some can take more damage, some can deal out more damage, Some can cast spells better, some can collect more gold. But thats not it. Each character has randomly generated traits, some effect the game, others don't. You could be playing upsidedown, or move faster. You could be a giant! Or be super small. Its always different.Although this game is great, There are still some annoying bugs. So be fair warned. Some projectiles tend to glitch through walls that aren't supposed too. Aswell as attacks not hitting.But with those aside. The game is great. Probably my best purchase on steam yet. Ill continue to play untill I beat the game.I highly reccomend			"

												Rogue Legacy is a roguelike platformer where you play as the offspring of your previous character, with varying abilities and quirks in the hopes of conquering the castle and claiming your birthrite. I completed Rogue Legacy, while doing a YouTube playthrough on YOGSCAST Nilesy, in around 22 hours. The game is incredibly fun and self-aware, leading to a super fun and enjoyable experience.My favourite part of the game were the character quirks: one character may be an Endomorph, so maybe they can't be knocked back, or an Exomorph who is very likely to be knocked back, another can only see in black and white, another is a Dwarf and thus a shortened version of the others, and many, many others. The character quirks lead to immediately engaging gameplay, as every time you start the castle you are forced to play dependant on the character you have. The seamless interaction between character quirks and skill level is perfect and balanced, leading me to consider this to be one of the best current roguelikes on the market.The humour in the game is also fantastic and witty. The story is a little obvious and a little contrived, but the game is fully aware of the fact, and feeds off of it to deliver a poignant and satisfying conclusion.I should add that JUST after my 22 hour completion, the developers added a major content patch which added a hell of a lot of new content, so if you're a new player there will be tonnes for you to do.Highly recommended.Nilesy			"

												Let me start this off by saying I'm not a huge fan of 2D games with elements similar to this (Castlevania, etc..) but Rogue Legacy is a very refreshing take on the genre. The goal of the game is to fight your way through several areas including a castle, a forest, a tower, and a dungeon; all of which feel connected yet set apart from each other.There is one twist on the game however. Every time you die you will lose your character forever. FOREVER. While that may seem a bit dramatic and perma-deathy fear not! You will retain everything you previously earned with your character and pass it on to an heir who will inherit your treasures and continue your quest! With the gold you have earned you will be able to buy new armor, buy runes to enchant your armor, and upgrade the very extensive skill tree represented by your own castle! As you upgrade the skills tree it will branch off into different sections allowing you to unlock more classes to play as and more passive bonuses to your character.Now onto the characters.. you can play as several character classes off the bat and have the ability to unlock many more by upgrading your skill tree. Every character you play as will be different from the last, not only set apart by their different class abilities and stats, but also by randomized traits and magic abilities! Have you ever wanted your protagonist to be a gay, color blind barbarian? Well that is one of hundreds (possibly thousands) of different character combinations you can have! These traits can have either positive, negative, or neutral effects on your gameplay. You could gain the ability to knock enemies back further, or you could take more damage from enemies, or you might have irritable bowels and flatulate while jumping! Now finally in conclusion I feel like a pros and cons list would suit this game well, here you go!Pros:+ Randomized dungeons make dungeons fresh every time you play!+ The boss fights in this game are brilliantly designed and a blast to play, including the buffed up, more difficult versions of the fights.+ The extensive skill tree will satisfy that need to upgrade.+ Death doesn't feel as devestating as other games.+ Different character classes and traits keep the game interesting.+ Excellent comedy factors Cons:- While your first playthrough may take a long while because you need to learn how to play, the game is very small.- For casual players the game could get boring very quickly.- Classes don't feel too much different from each other- Not much depth in combat (Could be a pro or con)? F*CKING CARNIVAL GAMESAll in all I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, 2D dungeon crawler/lootpalooza game to keep them occupied for a while. 85/100			"

												Very fun game. The rouge elements combined with choosing your heir is very creative, and all the unique random traits they could get mixes up the game. The random dungeon system makes you feel like you're not being tedious with every run, which is well done for a rouge game. Although fairly short, you can spend a lot of time beating the game over and over again, with the increasing difficulty during NG+ to NG^n+. Although a steep curve to start off, it does get easier over time after you have mastered the different classes and their playstyles.			"

												Rogue Legacy is as you could imagine a game about getting money, remember Binding of Isaac and how that seemed challenging? Well when you play this game you will change your mind, this game is filled with challanges, powerful mobs, heroes with annoting, hard and sometimes useful traits but most of all a lot of fun.This game has been designed for people that know how to play hack and slash games and get get through the hard territories even with Vertigo, Stereo blindess and Colour Blindness.Through out the game you gotta earn money to expand your mannor, that's the only way you will survive further through the endless corridors of the castle in order to defeat the 1st out of 4 beasts, expanding your mannor will grant you things like more health, armour, attack and armour capacity, but also you'll be able to unlock new classes, upgrades to those classes, and other utilities, but importantly, unlock the Blacksmith, that will sell armour, Enchantress who will sell runes (NOTE: all those things you first gotta find in the castle) and an arichtect who for a a 30% of your money will lock the castle, why would it be useful? Say if you found a good spot to get money or found the boss room or even just you like the castle, well then that's useful (Looted chests will stay looted when you lock the castle).About a story, well the story isn't told to your directly, but me telling you it would ruin the fun, basically the story is contained in the Prince's Journals that you will find through out the castle and it definately is worth a read.So is the game worth buying, I say yes, I myself haven't seen many people deny that, this game is a lot of fun and a challenge, I like challenges myself and although the game is sometimes frustrating of how hard it can get, however after a few seconds break I get back to the game and I've already killed two of the four bosses.Sory wise once you start reading the story you might actually not want to stop, the story gets quite intense plus it kinda ruins the ending once you do get to the ending of the journals, but its still a good read, unless you have dyslexia... then its just confusing.Anyway I rate this game 9 evil paintings out of 10, my highest rating yet but I can see the game deserves it. So go ahead, buy it since its on sale! You won't regret it!			"

 ""I have lived a rogue's legacy...""	  SO MANY BABIES!	 So you're reading a review about Rogue Legacy? Odds are you either are coming to see if the hype around this game is warranted, or you've seen it was on sale and need that one last push to convince you that your purchase won't be in vain. While a bit lengthy, this review holds everything you could ever want to know before buying. WELL LET ME TELL YOU!!! This game is by far one of the most fun games I've purchased in a long while. I'll start with a synopsis of the game's plot, followed by the pros and cons of the game, and end it with an official rating and some inside info on gameplay.  Just scroll to the end and find my header titled ""Gameplay"" if all you want to know is ""gameplay mechanics please, I don't need story info"".	  Synopsis	  You are the heir to a throne occupied by a king who has fallen ill. To what, you don't entirely know. The king has set out on a quest to remedy himself by venturing in to a castle that has been rumored to be haunted for years on the outskirts of his land. Within this castle is the key to curing all sickness. If a hero proves himself worthy to battle through the arduous citadel, they will find themselves with the ultimate power to cure themselves of any ailment. Your father has disappeared. It was rumored he found himself the treasure within and decided to stay with his new found riches. Others believe he fell to the beasts that inhabit the dangerous depths. Regardless of his fate, this prompts your brother, the antagonist of the story, to begin his own journey into the castle and claim the fortune for himself. You play as a generation of heroes, all dedicated to saving the king, and rescuing your brother who also has appeared to be lost. Throughout your exploration of the castle, you stumble across various journal entries, chronicling your brothers advancements. I won't reveal the ending, but I will hint that the castle's riches are far more evil than any monster ever could be. As you begin your journey you find that the castle is most certainly under some type of spell... Every time a traveler enters the cold, unwelcoming halls, the rooms are randomized entirely. No floor plan is ever the same, causing confusion and plenty of surprises for any weary guest. Being a fortress for countless foes inhabiting the keep, your only reference is a map you create as you navigate each room. Moving from area to area, you find that the castle leads out to a haunted forest, a miasma of ghouls, and a crypt of darkness. Of course there is a mighty enemy that dominates each territory. These boss-like creatures are found out eventually to be previous explorers who have fallen victim to the castle's ultimate secret. The further your travels take you, the more accomplished you feel each time. But at what cost? At the end of each life, you reawaken as new kin. A son or daughter to the previous explorer's family. Countless years pass, and you find that entire generations of warriors are dedicated to a pointless cause it would feel. Will your efforts prove fruitless? Will the castle's secrets finally be unlocked? What of the long lost king, and your traitor of a brother? Spoilers:  Play the game. It takes less than 20 hours to beat it no matter how new you are to it. You don't need spoilers <3	  Pros	 - Every new life leads to a highly randomized generation of soldiers, ready to fight your fight. This means that you will be able to constantly explore new play styles, receive new perks, and have a great time laughing at some of the unfortunate traits you receive. - The replay value of this game is through the roof. It's never the same, meaning each playthrough yields a new experience. - New Game + mode is exceptional. Like most games, there are new items, harder enemies, and even the storyline changes in minor ways. - The traits each character inherits that causes them to be unique, on top of their abilities their class grants them, leads to a fantastic character selection that makes each run memorable.  Cons	 - Many have reviewed this game to say that it is too difficult. I will not disagree with the thought that it is difficult, however, I will counter the argument with this: Once you get the momentum rolling, and build your character up a bit, the difficulty is something you enjoy and crave. Building your characters up is far more enjoyable with a real challenge before you. The difficulty that crushes so many is only temporary, as most will not play past the first hour due to frustration. - One major drawback of the game is that the skill tree is too limited and feels pointless at times. Once you've unlocked everything, you spend the rest of the time building small things like health and defense. You no longer have any real goal to aim for, you're simply buffing up your character. This occurs approximately 14-15 hours in, usually just before you defeat the penultimate boss, or clear the third area. A shame as new game + offers so much, yet leaves the skill tree lacking.  Gameplay/Rating	  Controls/Movement	 The game's controls are a bit difficult. As simple as they are, you'll find yourself going out of your way to execute a much more difficult approach to combat, rather than the intended one. An example of this is the ""downstrike"" ability. You should have the ability to jump over an enemy, and attack below you. However, the attack is too fast, and you end up hurting yourself, by being susceptible to enemies. Instead, now you'll learn that it's best to jump around all over place, narrowly avoiding attacks, and attacking from the side, to avoid damage. Movement does feel very fluid despite its speed, and you are able to manipulate your character well. The additional perks of certain traits lends itself greatly to gameplay, as some characters have the ability to go where others cannot, some are not knocked back by hits, and some are able to send enemies flying.  Items/Skills/Stats	 Cellar Door Games outdid themselves with the items and skills in this game. The various weapons you can find, equipment you can earn, runes that will allow for special techniques or perks, and items that can assist you (or one in particular that horribly ruins you), are all brilliantly put together in this game. As said before, the only area where they fall short, is the stat system. Once you've unlocked everything in the skill tree, you are left to adding to stats while you yearn for more unlockables. The character system that has you choosing between being ""The One"" and going on a Tron-esque journey into the grid, or having insatiable bowels that cannot stop playing you the song of its people, helps really flesh out this game and give you a feel of infinite scenarios/builds.  Rating/Recommendation On a scale of 0-10 (keeping it simple), I'll give this game a fantastic 9/10. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has even gotten this far in the review. Trust me, it is extremely deserving of your time. Cellar Door Games has created a fantastic way to expend your time. A few honorable mentions are that this game does a great job of helping you truly appreciate the story... The tutorial portion of the game ends up being the last path you take before the end of the game. The dialogue is fantastic and makes you laugh from to time, and of the last statements by the last boss... ""Truly I have lived a rogue's legacy""... it definitely struck me. This game is fantastic. I will find myself playing it again and again, restarting a character or continuing off of an accomplished one. Please enjoy this, and see what all the hype is about. Would I invest my time in writing so much if I didn't think this game was freaking amazing?! Thanks for reading. The fact that you did means you and I both are great at wasting time.   "

												TL;DR: Fun, challenging roguelike platformer that'll take you a solid 20-30 hours of playtime to fully complete.  Things I Wish I'd Known To anyone thinking of getting the game and just starting out, a few recommendations. First, a controller is almost mandatory for this game. There's no mouse support, and while you can use two hands on a keyboard, it feels pretty awkward (and this game involves a lot of twitch reflexes and precision jumping). Also, there's an option to just press down to perform down attacks in the air or fall off platforms (I forget the name, but it should be obvious in the options menu) that's very helpful. And finally, try not to spend an excessive amount of time on the grind - if it's getting repetitive, clear through the bosses and attempt the next game mode. The Steam achievements for this game are actually a good balance of ""difficult but not impossible,"" and getting all of them should indicate that you're essentially ""done"" with the game. You'll likely get 20-30 hours out of this game before getting that feeling of "" why did I just waste all my time on that? "" but if you enjoy a challenge and find it at a good price, it's definitely worth a look. Regular Review-y Part Rogue Legacy is an excellent roguelike platformer with a clever continuity mechanic. Gold and items collected during dungeon attempts can be used to provide static stat bonuses for future attempts, allowing the player to shore up their weak spots and fueling the game's progression system. The different classes and powers (via glyphs) provide enough variety to keep subsequent dungeon runs varied and interesting.The game can be punishing at first, but this is intentional, as it allows the player to see the effects of their stat purchases and armor upgrades, as well as their improving play. Rogue Legacy is a game that encourages player mastery - better play will lead to greater completion of the dungeon and more gold to spend for the next round. And just when you've gotten good enough to clear the dungeon and defeat all the bosses, the game will ramp up the difficulty with a ""New Game +"" mode. The new mode allows you to keep all your progress, but is balanced well enough that the previously easy intro part of the dungeon is now challenging again. The game also includes five ""hidden"" bosses, which are far more challenging versions of the standard bosses. These can be taken on at any time (your purchased stat bonuses don't affect the stats of the avatar during these challenges), but they provide a sort of endgame for players who have found the rest of the dungeon too repetitive. That said, I'd recommend looking up the slightly gamey strategy for defeating Alexander IV, as the ""normal"" strategy will lead to an absurdly challenging and probably frustrating fight.The game isn't without its downsides. The grind can feel a little repetitive at times, and there could be more indication that defeating the bosses on the first run through isn't the end of the game (as it is, it's confusing that by the time you're able to tackle the bosses in the first playthrough you've barely bought into the stats, and you won't have found all the armors). Not helping the repetitiveness is the music. It's not bad, at first, but after a few hours you'll want to turn on something else with more variety. But in the end, those are two relatively minor downsides in an otherwise great game.			"

												An excellent Castlevania-style platformer with roguelike elements. Because gold and upgrades carry over between characters, permadeath doesn't make you feel like your run was wasted when you eventually miss a jump and fall onto a bed of spikes. Combat is fairly simple, but pleasantly fast-paced, and the assorted challenge rooms, random positive and negative perks, and various other nuances make repeated trips into the castle very entertaining. I do wish there was a bit more enemy variety (there's a fair number of palette swaps), and some of the rooms show up more often than I'd like, but overall Rogue Legacy is definitely worth a look for platformer fans and roguelike fans alike.

												Challenging but rarely frustrating, the randomized dungeons and heroes keep this dungeon delver fresh and fun for a long time. I've been having a blast playing it, learning enemies' attack patterns and tells, figuring out the nuances of each class and how best to utilize them. The soundtrack is great and atmospheric, making an already awesome game AWESOMER.The game also has a fun sense of humor, what with some of the purely-for-flavor traits and the general jerkishness of the other humans within the castle. I'd recommend this game to anybody who likes fun.			"

If you like old school titles such as Castlevania and Metroid you should definitely get it. It can be a little hard on the beginning (and it doesn't get THAT much easier), but trust me: If you keep playing, this game will simply eat you alive.

												A very fun ""rogue-lite"" Metroid-vania game. Its controls are tight, kills are satisfying, and the game is difficult but reasonably so. It's got a small learning curve, but eventually it becomes easy to get lost in it, and time flies while you're playing.The good:- *Very* tight control system. Almost to a fault, but not really.- Infinite replay value- Creative level design- Unique enemies and bosses- Unique upgrade system/passive skill tree, which is actually incredibly useful and even required in order to progress.The bad:- A bit of a steep price.Overall I highly reccomend if you've got nothing else you want to buy.

												Rogue Legacy is easily one of the most addicting games I have played in a while.At first, it is frustratingly difficult - but that is okay, as with every one of your pitiful deaths, the gold you collect through your adventure can be used to buy upgrades for your future heirs - be it unlocking new classes, or increasing health. Each of your heirs is flawed in some way - be it the curse of I.B.S., dementia, or savantism, every adventure will be different with your new hero through a dynamically generated castle, forest, and other spooky areas.This game is best played on an Xbox 360 controller -I have both wired PS2 and Xbox 360 controllers, and the 360 one works best for me.The nice part about this game is you can play pickup games whenever you want to blow a little steam off without getting too heavily invested in the game. 5 minutes early for a meeting? Play a little Rogue, and be on your way.			"

												This Rogue-Lite (death costs money, but stats and equips are kept) offers Castlevania SotN play and controls with an ever changing castle/dungeon system. Several different character types allow for different play-styles and advantages in certain situations and against some enemies. The enemies scale with you and, though your stat, equip, and gamer skills improve, you will notice the enemies do not have to be one-hit kills if you do not want them to be. The bosses add a level of strategy and pattern memorization which is exciting the first time through; however, certain hidden bosses require more than a little luck.Overall, I found this to be a very fun SotN tribute and the progression kept me hooked for hundreds of generations. Enjoy!			"

												10/10I can’t overstate how great this game is. This might be one of my favorite games of all time. It’s incredibly challenging yet deeply rewarding. You will find yourself dying over and over again yet you are happy to come back for more punishment. The idea of having to pick a character – each with their own strengths and weaknesses – from a randomized gene pool is a great concept. Sometimes you will simply have to concede defeat and sometimes you will luck out and prepare yourself for a long run into unknown worlds. The randomized castles are a great mechanic that provides a fresh experience every time you restart. The ability to unlock power ups and game-changing mechanics is unique and fresh and allows for much more gradual difficulty curve. Eventually you should be able to beat the game; the question is how many hours will it take? It took me just under 20 hours to beat the final boss. The game is hard but not Spelunky hard. "

												I was bored. I was looking for something fun and light to take my mind away from all the more serious games I'd been playing. I found it.Well, truth be told, I wasn't actually expecting to enjoy Rogue Legacy all that much, I really only picked it up because a friend had recommended it, and fully expected to get bored quickly. That's basically the opposite of what happened.The graphics are cute, and who doesn't like to do the occasional dungeon-crawl with adorable graphics? I was hooked within minutes. At this point, I find myself playing it for a little while most days. I'll decide ""just one more character, just one more dungeon-crawl and then I'll go to bed... A few hours and a whole bunch of deaths later, I usually do. This is probably one of the most addictive little games I've played in a long time. The idea behind it is really very simple. You play a child from each of a succession of generations of one family, you can choose which, out of three random options, and in you go. The dungeon is different each time, unless you pay the Architect to give you the same one again, and until you pay for the upgrade that lets you pay Charon a little less, the ferryman charges you all your gold to get in. That's a real pain, makes it harder to stockpile your gold. You need that gold to upgrade your stats. Eventually, you face the bosses in it, but you can choose when to go through those doors, and they stay defeated through each generation after they're beaten. The story itself is told through diary pages that you find randomly.But sometimes the simplest ideas are the best, and this game is a whole lot of fun.			"

												This game isn't as one dimensional as it may seem.  I picked it up back in December and have had difficulty putting it down.  Up to this point I have beaten the game twice, but that means nothing.  The enemies in the dungeon have scaled upward, making sure that my heir has a hell of a time contending with the beasts that lay in wait for him/her.

If you do get this game, partition your time wisely. If you are skilled, you will probably get through this with more ease than I had.The game offers many many many upgrades that you can get through finding gold inside the castle (which changes all the rooms everytime your [new] heir enters). You have a manor that allows you to upgrade health, magic, armor, you know, the regular stuff, but also allows you to upgrade rooms to get new styles of play.It is much more deep than that.Trust me, you want in.Good luck, it it a fun treck.

												My legacy has gone rogue. My 7-year-old has been playing it and he likes the Knight class so much he doesn't want to upgrade it to the Paladin... which means that he cannot unlock any upgrades and his potentially awe-inspiring castle remains a small fort. Each to their own, I suppose.Anyway, I enjoyed this game - great for a quick blast, plenty to explore and I felt great about finding the hidden class (at the top of the flagpole). It seems very much designed for an XBox controller, though, so playing on mouse and keyboard was difficult (I had to work out and write down the mappings from XBox controls to keyboard controls, plus the down-attack move to activate platforms is far too difficult on the default settings).It would be nice to carry over money from previous generations to allow the more casual player to build up a fortune... as it was, I found it increasingly difficult to be able to spend my money on anything useful (but did find that investing in the 'vampire' items and runes helped my character survive for longer to get the money). Also, some guidance on the order to attempt the other levels would be useful too (unless I missed something in the notes). Still, I enjoyed the various classes and weird hero traits, and the game overall.			"

												While the rogue-like (permadeath) system coupled with the randomizing castle can make you feel like you aren't making any progress initially, the game surprises with the gradual gains of building out your manor to unlock new classes and bonuses.The inclusion of traits adds more depth to the experience, even when the traits do nothing from a gameplay standpoint (e.g. baldness or being gay). It's kind of fulfilling in its own right to power through the castle with a lesbian dwarf ninja.The game has a good sense of humor, and there are nodding references here and there to other media (e.g. Skyrim, Naruto), and there is enough of a rhythm once you've upgraded things a bit to offset the frustration of starting from scratch every time you die (and you will die many, many times). Note that you do have the option to ""freeze"" the castle layout at a -40% gold intake penalty once you unlock the Architect.The concept is great, and the execution is clever and full of charm. I hope to see more games from this team.Notes:-Spellsword+Vampirism is a mighty combination.-The game can frustrate you by offering puzzles that are only possible if you re-equip and lock the castle layout.-Some traits that sound negative can be surprisingly useful (e.g. P.A.D., Dwarfism, O.C.D.).-It's nice to play as a gay hero (without any stereotypical humor), especially after reading the developer's comments on why they included it.

												When you think of roguelikes, you normally think of randomness, high difficulty, and most importantly, permadeath. Dying in those games is very serious, you lose everything: Characters, stats, items, all gone. In that genre, death really means Game Over. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? Enter Rogue Legacy.You are a warrior tasked with exploring a magical castle and defeating monsters within, with Castlevania-like gameplay that should be familiar to everyone. The twist is that, when you die, that character is gone, and you start playing as one of their heirs, with different traits and classes. The money and treasure gathered by the deceased are passed on, and you can spend them on upgrades and equipments for the new generations.The game manages to keep a constant sense of progress with the upgrade system; dying is not the end, it’s the beginning of a new adventure where you’re likely to be better prepared. It’s not just about getting better stats and armor, either, you’ll also unlock new classes and mechanical improvements, like dashes and air jumps.Your descendants are, however, randomly generated. This goes for both class and traits, the latter of which are characteristics like ""Glaucoma"" or ""Dwarfism"" that can be very helpful, irrelevant, or highly crippling. The unreliability inherent to the heirs often forces you to adapt to something that ""will do"" instead of having the best for the task available, which makes victory all the more sweet.And of course, it wouldn’t be a roguelike if the journey through the castle was always the same. It changes, but not simply for each game: It changes on every single generation. This is why you don’t want to die too early: You miss the chance to get a lot of loot, and boss rooms are transferred elsewhere. On the other hand, a new character means new treasure to find, so it’s not that bad. It’s fun, both to win, and to lose.And that is Rogue Legacy: A game that avoids being frustrating, but still without making you feel you’re getting off easy. All the balance in the gameplay elements really shows that a lot of effort was put into making this game, and it paid off, because Rogue Legacy makes for a fantastic roguelike*, and probably for one of the best Castlevanias out there, too.* “Roguelite”, if you prefer.PS: Use of a controller is highly recommended.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/rogue-legacy-game-review/Ahh, Rogue Legacy. My favorite rogue-like game, although it also served as my introduction to the genre. Even after playing a lot of others from the genre now, I still look back on Rogue Legacy as my favorite out of the bunch.The game is presented in a pixel fashion, making use of some nice looking sprites for the various people and enemies you will meet along your journey. This style fits well, especially for a game of this genre. Come to think of it, I don't think I've played a rogue-like that was not in this style, and I've played several of them over the past several months. Can't really complain either, there's nothing wrong with it and I'd actually prefer this style in a rogue-like game, although I may be a bit biased there (heh).Rogue Legacy's niche is the rebirth mechanic. Upon dying as one character, you'll have the choice as to which of the three offspring of that character you'll play as next. The interesting thing about this mechanic however, is that each child has separate traits, disguised as real world disorders and conditions. These can either be in your favor or against it. ADHD, for example, works in your favor in that your character will move 30% faster than usual. My favorite defect is vertigo, which mirrors the screen vertically. Yes, everything, including menus. Vertigo is a pain to deal with as I cannot rotate my monitor upside down, forcing me to play upside-down.Aside from that gimmick, the other half of the game is the immense class and upgrade system. You'll start off with no skills, playing as the default class, the knight. Upon death, the opportunity to choose offspring with a different class is presented. The basic classes to choose from contain classes such as: mage, knave, knight, barbarian, shinobi, miner, etc. Each class can be upgraded, getting a name change in the process. The shinobi, for example, changes into the hokage, my favorite class. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, keep that in mind.The shinobi/hokage has the benefit of upgraded strength (175% to be exact), but at the cost of only having 60% HP, 40% MP, and not being able to take advantage of critical hits. I never really used the game's spells, so the MP cut didn't have much of an effect on me, but the HP and critical hits were quite the drawback. Even so, whenever I was given the opportunity to play as a hokage, I always took it. You can't beat 175% damage. I found it crucial to defeating some of the game's bosses. I actually defeated the forest boss (the second one I took on) without getting hit as a hokage, quite the achievement.On top of the classes, there's also a plethora of upgrades to choose from each time you die. The upgrades are laid out in a branching format, with certain upgrades unlocking others. The first one made available is Smithy, the blacksmith. Once purchased, you'll be able to purchase both armor and weapons from him. There's also an architect (who can keep the last layout of the castle if you choose to not want the game to randomly generate another castle again) and an enchantress, who sells runes, which can be equipped to provide various abilities (like the ability to jump while in air).The other upgrades consist of class upgrades (like barbarian -> barbarian king) and stat upgrades. This consists of mana, health, and equip upgrades. Equip upgrades allow you to carry more weight and is required if you ever want to wear good armor. There's plenty of other upgrades to base skills (attack up, magic damage up, armor up, etc.) and a few unique ones, like ""death defy"" and ""haggle"". Death defy, as you can probably tell, allows you to defy death (1.5% everytime the upgrade is purchased). Haggle, on the other hand, lowers Charon's toll when entering the castle.The game's map is divided into five zones: the front ""safe"" area at the entrance to the castle, the castle, the maya (above the castle), the dungeon (below the castle), and the forest (to the right of the castle). Each area (aside from the safe area) has its own boss that needs to be defeated if you want to unlock the golden door at the entrance of the castle. These bosses are very difficult if you're not properly equipped (I did tell you about my love for the hokage class, right?). Each time you die and want to re-enter the castle, you'll have to give up all of your funds earned during the previous run to Charon, who guards the entrance to the castle.Rogue Legacy is a fantastic game overall. The sense of progression is really profound and it just feels really, really satisfying to defeat the bosses and open that golden door. Now that it's only $15, why not give it a shot?			"

												While the game starts slow (you're going to die very often and very quickly), the nature of the gameplay works to its own advantage--you can play for so long, get frustrated at dying so quickly, stop for a bit, and then come back to it later. The game itself is incredibly fun and charming, with so many little extras that make every new character feel unique and worth playing (even if sometimes your heir options suck). It definitely keeps you coming back for more, and well worth the price. Good for gamers who can't focus for very long periods of time!			"

												Rogue Legacy is apply named it's very 'Rogue' like. You're not expected to win on your first playthrough, you're just supposed to do a little bit better, each time spending your hard earned gold on upgrades, runes & abilities. The game mechanics are in a way close to Binding of Isaac & Dark Souls, the death isn't the end but instead a teaching tool. After each time you die, you get a little farther because it let's you get a feel of the enemies, the traps, the world and how they work. After enough time you'll be able to see traps coming but if you perish from them, well that's on you. The game teaches you on how each enemy works and it does it very well.Even though I've only spent two hours playing it, I've been focusing on all the little details on how this game is very fun, very addicting and each time a very rewarding experience. Thoroughly enjoy this game and highly reccomend.			"

												Variety of classes, randomized dungeons, and stupidly hard: Rogue Legacy is everything I've ever wanted in a game since I was a kid.  If you like insanely challenging 2D platformers like Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, or even the dreaded Legend of Zelda 2, I absolutely reccomend this title.  Not for the faint of heart nor the weekend gamers.			"

												This game is really fun and addicting to play, it has the 'just one more game' feel to it. The game is challenging at first but allows you to upgrade your stats so that you can always play at your skill level. It gives you the option of rushing to the end and the option of taking your time and grinding to get past the first boss.The game is continual so that you can keep playing with tougher and tougher enemies as you complete the game more times so there is a lot of replayability involved.There are many items to collect, hidden secrets, mini-bosses, stats to upgrade/characters to unlock, strange abilities to be unlocked during play (can be a detriment) and of course - lots of gold.The game also has humourous elements which you will quickly discover when playing with a character who has vertigo.Overall I rate this game 8/10 and reccomend it for fans of random layout/rogue-lite games and 2D platformer fans.

9/10, Best roguelike I've ever playedI'm going to be honest right from the start; one of the main reasons I purchased this game is because of this right here.Originally posted by RogueLegacy Devs: Ever wanted to be dyslexic? Now you can! Seriously though, this game can be casual (General dungeon crawling, looting, etc) or hardcore (Each boss has a more powerful ""remixed"" form), and it is just fun to play. There is just so much for me to say about this game and I don't know where to start. The combat, the upgrades, the classes, the traits, the death (so much death), it all just comes together in a legendary game. Pros:+++ Replayabiltiy. This game has a lot of it. +++ Classes and traits that actually do stuff. Are you tired of upgrades and skills that just add % modifiers and generic bonuses? The trait system in this game actually affects gameplay in a meaningful way, whether its vertigo flipping the screen upside-down, or runes that let you fly. They also threw in generic bonuses. But ya' know.++ Satisfying kills. When you hit or kill an enemy, it'll just feel plain good. ++ Remix bosses. Its like playing dark souls, if the bosses in dark souls were optional, on a 2d platformer, and had weaker forms (The actual bosses). If you're not looking for a hardcore, half-impossible experience, you can just ignore them altogether and its still an awesome game.++ Procedurally generated. Randomness is the spice of life.+ Nice music. Always good to have.+ No penalty for death. If you're like me and have biophobia (the fear of life), then you'll be golden.Cons--- The controls. Default controls for keyboard are simply terrible. There's just no way to sugarcoat it. I spent the better part of my first hour playing constantly readjusting them. BUT. But there is an option of using a controller, and many people (I haven't used one) say that it is a lot better. Don't worry too much if you don't have a controller, a keyboard worked well for me.I'm not going to tell you that everybody should buy this game. If you don't like roguelikes or if you have a burning hatred of platformers, then this game isn't for you. It can be played casually or not, so it covers most people on that front. Its a hack 'n slash at heart, featuring dungeon crawling and lucrative chests. It has ""fairy chests"" which require you to complete a specific goal before they can be opened, and they contain a rune which can be applied to give your character special powers and buffs. I just realized I didn't even talk about one of the core mechanics, children. When you die, your current hero will be gone forever, but thankfully 3 of his children will be nominated to take his place. You can pick any one of them to wander off into the castle and risk their lives for treasure (Sorry, but it turns out momma did pick favorites!). These 3 children are of a random class, granted you've unlocked that class, and have 0-2 random traits. Each class differs in stats, and each has a unique ""special"" ability that can avoid damage, clear a room, etc. Traits will affect gameplay in various ways. Some are very helpful, others can be harmful, and some can be good in some situations, while terrible in others. I would keep rambling about how great this game is, but if you've made it this far in the review, then you're obviously interested in the game and should just buy it already. You know you want to.

												Rogue Legacy is a highly addicting procedurally-generated rogue-like that is definitely worth playing. You battle your way through a castle, unraveling it's mysteries, and upon your death, your child succeeds you in your quest. You have your pick from three children every time, each one unique in that it may have positive or negative mutations. You also get to continuously upgrade your armor/weapons/skills/stats after death with the gold collected in your previous run. The upgrading mixed with the simple but fun platforming makes Rogue Legacy a delightfully addicting game. It is a great choice for anyone who enjoys rogue-likes and definitely worth picking up.			"

Difficulty is good, maybe a little on the hard side if you're rusty on action platformers (like me). The game is genuninely funny, too. It's hard not to grin when Pricila IX, a nearsighted, bald assassin, goes charging into battle with her massive sword lifted above the tiny pink bow on her helmet.Edit: New Game+ increases the difficulty sharply.

												Rogue Legacy is an amazing platformer.  Controls are tight, tons of loot, a vast array of baddies, and a lot of customization options.However, there isn't much of a story.  Boss battles are fun, but can be quite challenging.  That's good though, as you can get many hours out of this title because of it's challenge and replay value.  There are a good deal of characters you can pick from, each with their own abilities.  It should be noted, however, that each character usually also has a querk, too.  For instance, some characters play the game up-side-down.  Others are color-blind.  Some have flatulence issues.So, I HIGHLY reccamend Rogue Legacy.  It's a terrifically fun platformer, which has a great soundtrack, and boasts hours of play time.			"

												Very fun game. The rouge elements combined with choosing your heir is very creative, and all the unique random traits they could get mixes up the game. The random dungeon system makes you feel like you're not being tedious with every run, which is well done for a rouge game. Although fairly short, you can spend a lot of time beating the game over and over again, with the increasing difficulty during NG+ to NG^n+. Although a steep curve to start off, it does get easier over time after you have mastered the different classes and their playstyles.			"

												Rogue Legacy is as you could imagine a game about getting money, remember Binding of Isaac and how that seemed challenging? Well when you play this game you will change your mind, this game is filled with challanges, powerful mobs, heroes with annoting, hard and sometimes useful traits but most of all a lot of fun.This game has been designed for people that know how to play hack and slash games and get get through the hard territories even with Vertigo, Stereo blindess and Colour Blindness.Through out the game you gotta earn money to expand your mannor, that's the only way you will survive further through the endless corridors of the castle in order to defeat the 1st out of 4 beasts, expanding your mannor will grant you things like more health, armour, attack and armour capacity, but also you'll be able to unlock new classes, upgrades to those classes, and other utilities, but importantly, unlock the Blacksmith, that will sell armour, Enchantress who will sell runes (NOTE: all those things you first gotta find in the castle) and an arichtect who for a a 30% of your money will lock the castle, why would it be useful? Say if you found a good spot to get money or found the boss room or even just you like the castle, well then that's useful (Looted chests will stay looted when you lock the castle).About a story, well the story isn't told to your directly, but me telling you it would ruin the fun, basically the story is contained in the Prince's Journals that you will find through out the castle and it definately is worth a read.So is the game worth buying, I say yes, I myself haven't seen many people deny that, this game is a lot of fun and a challenge, I like challenges myself and although the game is sometimes frustrating of how hard it can get, however after a few seconds break I get back to the game and I've already killed two of the four bosses.Sory wise once you start reading the story you might actually not want to stop, the story gets quite intense plus it kinda ruins the ending once you do get to the ending of the journals, but its still a good read, unless you have dyslexia... then its just confusing.Anyway I rate this game 9 evil paintings out of 10, my highest rating yet but I can see the game deserves it. So go ahead, buy it since its on sale! You won't regret it!			"

												In a nutshell: Roguelike-lite Metroidvania with upgrades. I was hooked once I played the demo, and the full game is significantly more awesome and fleshed-out. Difficulty is good, maybe a little on the hard side if you're rusty on action platformers (like me). The game is genuninely funny, too. It's hard not to grin when Pricila IX, a nearsighted, bald assassin, goes charging into battle with her massive sword lifted above the tiny pink bow on her helmet.Edit: New Game+ increases the difficulty sharply. I do NOT recommend finishing your first runthrough in a hurry!			"

												Rogue Legacy is a rougelike game made by Celler Door Games, who also made Don't **** your pants and Tribal Tallies. So you're thinking this won't be a great game based of their previous games. It isn't. Rogue Legacy brings in some very unique gameplay that makes it fun and enjoyable. You play as a hero with a class as they enter the castle looting and killing baddies until they die. They will be remembered by how well you played in the castle and each time you die, your descendants will continue where you left off, or at least do better than you did. And sometimes they can have good or bad traits depending on what the RNG gives you. But each time you enter the castle. You have to pay a fee with Cheron before you can enter and each time you enter, the castle will randomize itself, so you always expect different results each time (unless you use the architect to keep the castle the way it is).There are RPG elements added in the game to beef off your heroes. Such as increasing stats and gaining new classes and abilities in the manor. You can also gain runes and blueprints for equipment in the castle for your son/daughter to wield the next time they enter, some giving them unique abilities when equip. There's also a training dummy to see how strong your attacks are. Sometimes there will be fairy chest challenges that will be needed to be done before you can obtain the runes and later stats upgrade once you obtained all the runes. Some are nearly impossible to do and others are really simple if you have the right tools or you know what you are doing. There are minibosses you can fight too for bluepritns and stats upgrade too that appear rarely. So it's worth it to fight them if you have enough health to withstand their attacks.The story is simple. The tutorials give you a hint on what happened before you entered the castle with your heroes and later near the end explains what happens. It may not be heavily story based, but the story seems to work well with the game.There are also minigames you can play too, such as carnival games and pick the right chest to gain profits or lose it all. They are hard, but with the right tools and strageties, you can earn some neat stuff.There are negative stuff to be had too. One, this game is really frustrating. Expect to die alot from careless mistakes or not being lucky enough. It even sucks when the characters you choose will have really bad traits and can't trade them in (until you get a upgrade that allows you to reroll your children). And second, it's a grindfest. If you want to beat bosses and enemies and last longer in the castle, get alot of money for upgrades. Usually Cheron takes all your money, but upgrading the haggle skill allows you to keep some money for later purchases, which is good. All in all, this is a wonderful game. It has neat graphics, cool soundtracks, and it's addicting to play. But the frustrating levels and the hardcore grinding makes it hard to really love this game when it's not being evil to you.Rating 8/10			"

												Rogue Legacy...at first glance this may seem like just another ""indy title"" but after the first few deaths you start to realize that this is NOT your typical indy game. Seen as a mix of Ghost and Goblins, Super Mario Bros, and Castlevania, you play as one of many heirs in your quest to conquer the castle. Each death allows your successor to continue the forward progress of leveling up different skill categories and equipping different gear to adapt to each playthrough. Each time you enter the castle the layout is different, which adds to the replayability of a game that prides itself on killing you over and over.So far i've killed 2 out of the 5 bosses and I cannot stop now...for $3 on sale i've played this game more than most in my catalog.

9/10, Best roguelike I've ever playedI'm going to be honest right from the start; one of the main reasons I purchased this game is because of this right here.Originally posted by RogueLegacy Devs: Ever wanted to be dyslexic? Now you can! Seriously though, this game can be casual (General dungeon crawling, looting, etc) or hardcore (Each boss has a more powerful ""remixed"" form), and it is just fun to play. There is just so much for me to say about this game and I don't know where to start. The combat, the upgrades, the classes, the traits, the death (so much death), it all just comes together in a legendary game. Pros:+++ Replayabiltiy. This game has a lot of it. +++ Classes and traits that actually do stuff. Are you tired of upgrades and skills that just add % modifiers and generic bonuses? The trait system in this game actually affects gameplay in a meaningful way, whether its vertigo flipping the screen upside-down, or runes that let you fly. They also threw in generic bonuses. But ya' know.++ Satisfying kills. When you hit or kill an enemy, it'll just feel plain good. ++ Remix bosses. Its like playing dark souls, if the bosses in dark souls were optional, on a 2d platformer, and had weaker forms (The actual bosses). If you're not looking for a hardcore, half-impossible experience, you can just ignore them altogether and its still an awesome game.++ Procedurally generated. Randomness is the spice of life.+ Nice music. Always good to have.+ No penalty for death. If you're like me and have biophobia (the fear of life), then you'll be golden.Cons--- The controls. Default controls for keyboard are simply terrible. There's just no way to sugarcoat it. I spent the better part of my first hour playing constantly readjusting them. BUT. But there is an option of using a controller, and many people (I haven't used one) say that it is a lot better. Don't worry too much if you don't have a controller, a keyboard worked well for me.I'm not going to tell you that everybody should buy this game. If you don't like roguelikes or if you have a burning hatred of platformers, then this game isn't for you. It can be played casually or not, so it covers most people on that front. Its a hack 'n slash at heart, featuring dungeon crawling and lucrative chests. It has ""fairy chests"" which require you to complete a specific goal before they can be opened, and they contain a rune which can be applied to give your character special powers and buffs. I just realized I didn't even talk about one of the core mechanics, children. When you die, your current hero will be gone forever, but thankfully 3 of his children will be nominated to take his place. You can pick any one of them to wander off into the castle and risk their lives for treasure (Sorry, but it turns out momma did pick favorites!). These 3 children are of a random class, granted you've unlocked that class, and have 0-2 random traits. Each class differs in stats, and each has a unique ""special"" ability that can avoid damage, clear a room, etc. Traits will affect gameplay in various ways. Some are very helpful, others can be harmful, and some can be good in some situations, while terrible in others. I would keep rambling about how great this game is, but if you've made it this far in the review, then you're obviously interested in the game and should just buy it already. You know you want to.

												An excellent Castlevania-style platformer with roguelike elements. Because gold and upgrades carry over between characters, permadeath doesn't make you feel like your run was wasted when you eventually miss a jump and fall onto a bed of spikes. Combat is fairly simple, but pleasantly fast-paced, and the assorted challenge rooms, random positive and negative perks, and various other nuances make repeated trips into the castle very entertaining. I do wish there was a bit more enemy variety (there's a fair number of palette swaps), and some of the rooms show up more often than I'd like, but overall Rogue Legacy is definitely worth a look for platformer fans and roguelike fans alike.

												Let me start this off by saying I'm not a huge fan of 2D games with elements similar to this (Castlevania, etc..) but Rogue Legacy is a very refreshing take on the genre. The goal of the game is to fight your way through several areas including a castle, a forest, a tower, and a dungeon; all of which feel connected yet set apart from each other.There is one twist on the game however. Every time you die you will lose your character forever. FOREVER. While that may seem a bit dramatic and perma-deathy fear not! You will retain everything you previously earned with your character and pass it on to an heir who will inherit your treasures and continue your quest! With the gold you have earned you will be able to buy new armor, buy runes to enchant your armor, and upgrade the very extensive skill tree represented by your own castle! As you upgrade the skills tree it will branch off into different sections allowing you to unlock more classes to play as and more passive bonuses to your character.Now onto the characters.. you can play as several character classes off the bat and have the ability to unlock many more by upgrading your skill tree. Every character you play as will be different from the last, not only set apart by their different class abilities and stats, but also by randomized traits and magic abilities! Have you ever wanted your protagonist to be a gay, color blind barbarian? Well that is one of hundreds (possibly thousands) of different character combinations you can have! These traits can have either positive, negative, or neutral effects on your gameplay. You could gain the ability to knock enemies back further, or you could take more damage from enemies, or you might have irritable bowels and flatulate while jumping! Now finally in conclusion I feel like a pros and cons list would suit this game well, here you go!Pros:+ Randomized dungeons make dungeons fresh every time you play!+ The boss fights in this game are brilliantly designed and a blast to play, including the buffed up, more difficult versions of the fights.+ The extensive skill tree will satisfy that need to upgrade.+ Death doesn't feel as devestating as other games.+ Different character classes and traits keep the game interesting.+ Excellent comedy factors Cons:- While your first playthrough may take a long while because you need to learn how to play, the game is very small.- For casual players the game could get boring very quickly.- Classes don't feel too much different from each other- Not much depth in combat (Could be a pro or con)? F*CKING CARNIVAL GAMESAll in all I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, 2D dungeon crawler/lootpalooza game to keep them occupied for a while. 85/100			"

												Have you ever tried out a roguelike and wanted to like it, but just couldn't get into its punishing nature?I have, and no matter how many times I tried to get into the genre, for the most part I couldn't find one that was for me.And then Rogue Legacy came around, with its Castlevania-inspired gameplay, randomized character-trait system that always added a unique flair to the gameplay, and the constant sense of accomplishment with the numerous upgrades available at your keep, and I couldn't stop playing the game.Every time I'd get to the point of ""just one more run,"" I'd find myself getting even more gold than I did the previous run, and then I'd want to go spend it on something in the keep, and then I'd try again, and before I knew it I had played another hour.Addictive doesn't even begin to describe it.Buy this game, hook up your favorite gamepad (or buy one because this game plays SOOO good with one), and then watch as time flies as you try to uncover more and more of the castle and/or find tons of gold.

												A qute rougelike-lite that allows you to pick from one of three ""descendents"" to tackle a randomly generated castle featuring four areas and four bosses and loot out the butt (in the form of shekels). When you die, you die for reals and you need to pick another descendent. There's a wall that keeps track of all of your failures so you can see how many people have died in the pursuit of a few more shekels of gold.Every descendent has random stats and abilities which range from useful (everything you hit goes flying, you're as big as a giant, you can absorb a lot of damage) to stupid (everything is reflected like in a mirror, you have IBS, you are afraid of chickens). Each character also has random magic spells provided to them. At the end of every ""run"" you spend all your shekels on upgrades which can expand the range of classes randomly available to you, provide stat upgrades, or new abilities. There's also a blacksmith and magical rune person that eat your money as well.The goal is to power yourself up to kill the four bosses in the game which reign in four separate areas (since the game is randomly generated, you can generally find them by going far enough in any direction (i.e. up, down, left, right, etc). The game is a lot like Yugioh where it's based on the heart of the cards or the luck of the draw because you never dun know what you're gonna get in each room. Can be annoyingly brootal. I think it would have been nice if they added different weapons for each class BUT HEY I AINT NO DEV.			"

												Score: 9/10Amazing game for fans of plataformer, reminded me of the old Mega Man and Castelvania games. Go into the randomized castle, kill the creatures, loot the gold, buy equipment, upgrades and improve your Manor (a family castle) to give permanent boosts to your characters. Every time you die your heirs will take swords and keep your legacy in your place, as long as you want! After a while the creatures start to become very powerful, which really shows how unforgiven this game can be! Fairly short game, but very enjoyable, I would definitely recommend!			"

												Rogue Legacy is quite a bit more inspired than most indie platformers, combining key elements of Metroidvania, Roguelike, and Bullet Hell games into a charming enough little package. However, a few crucial shortcomings prevent the game from living up to its potential. There's a noticeable lack of overall content that leaves your adventures in the castle feeling samey very quickly in spite of the randomly-generated layout. What's more, to say that this game is grindy is a severe understatement. Still, the core gameplay is hallmarked by tight controls and rewarding challenges, and a randomly-generated castle coupled with two New Game+ modes ensures no small amount of replayability. Rogue Legacy should be approached as an ambitious and addictive little diversion whose indiscretions can be forgiven by its solid fundamentals.			"

												First of all, If you hate dying, dying, dying... dying, again, again and again then you'll hate this game cause you do die a lot, It should be called Rogue Legacy DIE Edition.Let's be serious, It's not that hard but like most of the roguelike games you'll have to play to get better, your character will gets better but so the enemies, It's a nice platformer game, It can be kind of repetetive after a time but It's still a really great game that I would suggest to any roguelike fans.What would make this game even more epic is if you could be able to create your own castle/level and also more characters, more weapons, more genre of levels (outside, snowy, etc etc...).But I'm not complaining, It's still a really good game.8.5/10			"

												Rogue Legacy is an amazing platformer.  Controls are tight, tons of loot, a vast array of baddies, and a lot of customization options.However, there isn't much of a story.  Boss battles are fun, but can be quite challenging.  That's good though, as you can get many hours out of this title because of it's challenge and replay value.  There are a good deal of characters you can pick from, each with their own abilities.  It should be noted, however, that each character usually also has a querk, too.  For instance, some characters play the game up-side-down.  Others are color-blind.  Some have flatulence issues.So, I HIGHLY reccamend Rogue Legacy.  It's a terrifically fun platformer, which has a great soundtrack, and boasts hours of play time.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a fantastic game that combines the classic action-platforming style (and look) of Castlevania & Ghosts & Ghouls with a modern compulsion based structure that is as clever and innovative as it is challenging.The game is far from easy, designed to be a ""Rogue-Like"" game where upon each death, you have to start over and delve once again into the randomly generated castle.However, Cellar Door Games have lightened this hardcore feature in a creative and intelligent way through their Lineage System, allowing a sense of advancement and progression in a game fundamentally about perma-death and skill runs.Upon each death, you are asked to choose an heir to your legacy. Your heir inherits the gold collected on your previous runs and can use it to upgrade Castle Components for new classes and permanent benefits, Forge New Weapons and Armor with statistical upgrades and powers and Enchant Runes that slot into each piece of equipment which grant you important skills to customize your character to your play style. All these upgrades carry forward to each heir in succession, slowly growing your legacy and power and allowing you to more quickly dispatch enemies and make more and more progress.Humorous randomly assigned Traits (some cosmetic, some debilitating, some extremely beneficial) keep things fresh and endearingly hilarious on each run. This allows you to stay invested until your skills are good enough that the challenge of the level matches your understanding of the system and you to begin to use strategy to plan our your next assault choosing the hero with the class, traits or spells that would best suit your next run's goals.Secret Areas, Chests and Skill Based Challenges make each new room of the castle an intriguing surprise as you hope for another armor blueprint, magic rune, or pile of gold that will allow you to purchase more upgrades and finally defeat that next ridiculous boss that has haunted you for generations.The game's nostalgia value, smooth, simple controls and delightful humor draw you in, and it's upgrade and advancement system keeps you eagerly playing. The game overall is an impressive, innovative and rewarding title and aside from the difficulty, there is little not to like about this incredible indie game.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a Metroidvania-style game with a twist. True to its name, Rogue Legacy is about family, and in that sense, death is your friend. You start out at level zero, but you don't get more levels through fighting, you get them through developing a rather comprehensive skill tree. Here's the kicker, though: you can't develop the skill tree (in other words, your manor) after you enter the castle that the game takes place in. So, to get stronger, you have to die.This is why the game is so unique, upon death, you become of the the children of the character that you just died as, each with different classes and different traits. Some of those traits will help (or hurt) in battle, such as being athletic or being insane, and some are just for individuality, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrom and swearing whenever they're hit. When you make your new character, you have to start the game over again. However, now you have whatever gold your previous character is, and you can develop your manor to upgrade your skills and stats and make for a stronger warrior.Fighting is a delight as well. I'd recommend either a gamepad or the keyboard, both of them work pretty well. To make each game over unique, the castle that the game takes place it randomizes on each death. The game feels closer to a mix of traditional Castlevania and one of the newer titles, with the character having the use of a subeapon that can be used should they have the mana. From magic, to subweapons, to the variety of main weapons and the attack options for it, as well as the amount of abilities and supplements that can be unlocked from the manor/skill tree, the game never feels like a straightforward ""jump and slash"", and the action seems more responsive because of it.Also, don't worry about backtracking. Because of its story-lite nature, you won't have to worry about getting new abilities that allow you to go to new places and backtracking to get to them. Having said that, be prepared to die a lot, because this game can be brutal. Not that it should matter, it's the amount of death and challenge that this game presents that makes it open to all types of gamers, regardless of whether they consider themselves hardcore, casual, or non-gamers. It's only through death that one will experience the game for what it truly is.Still, if you want Rogue Legacy or if you're interested, check it out. It's a great experience and is probably worth whatever you pay for it.			"

												I really, really enjoyed this game, and if the following words mean anything to you, I think you will as well:Arcade platformer metroidvania roguelike.Still with me?It took me 102 deaths and 16.5 hours to beat this thing. Unlike other roguelikes, it's very probable that you will beat this game after investing enough time into it, thanks to a life-to-life upgrade progression system that other roguelikes don't possess. As Rogue Legacy is super fun to play, that won't be hard to consider doing.Like most roguelikes the game's dungeon is different every time you play, but you can sacrifice a bug chunk of your money of your money (used for upgrades between lives) to keep the dungeon the same, keeping access to all the warp points you've uncovered, etc. This feature is theoretically good for fighting the game's bosses until you win, as they are very difficult and will take multiple tries to beat. But as bosses always drop a ton of cash, I never bothered with that. In fact, I effectively never used the feature -- not because I'm super hardcore, but it's just in my best interests. The more money I get, the faster I upgrade, the faster I will eventually beat the boss in its due time.Even if you have played other roguelikes and didn't enjoy them, I recommend you download the demo to Rogue Legacy and give it a shot. As death is your chance to spend your money and upgrade your lineage; like it's the only way to Level Up and if you're an RPG fan, you know Leveling Up is fun.  This is a rare example of a game that actually makes it fun to fail.  If you like action platforming, the game is an incredible value with fun mechanics and charming aesthetics.			"

												After almost 15 hours of playing rogue legacy, I've started to notice how much improved I've become.Many might think after and hour of playing this game ""I'm terrible"" and such, and just stop playing, but thats where you have to keep playing. The more you play, the better you get. At the start I was earning no more than 100 gold per run. Now I'm earning over 3000. It's increadible. The game has so much availible to it, you can just continue playing for ages. There are different classes, they all do different things. Some can take more damage, some can deal out more damage, Some can cast spells better, some can collect more gold. But thats not it. Each character has randomly generated traits, some effect the game, others don't. You could be playing upsidedown, or move faster. You could be a giant! Or be super small. Its always different.Although this game is great, There are still some annoying bugs. So be fair warned. Some projectiles tend to glitch through walls that aren't supposed too. Aswell as attacks not hitting.But with those aside. The game is great. Probably my best purchase on steam yet. Ill continue to play untill I beat the game.I highly reccomend			"

												Here's the premise: you explore an ancient castle, but each time you die, the interior layout changes. When you die, you choose an heir amongst your children. Each potential heir has different abilities, classes, and traits. The traits sometimes affect gameplay (such as size, weaknesses, or abilities) or aesthetics (such as colorblindness, vertigo, or insanity).The fact that you play as different characters and that the castle changes makes each run unique and interesting. There are also global RPG elements (upgrades, unlockable classes, etc.) that carry over, making the game even more addictive. Like most roguelikes (or rogue-lites, whatever), the game is crushingly difficult at first, and making any progress is really rewarding. But no matter how good you become, the game makes sure you're always challenged.Rogue Legacy is challenging yet rewarding, brutal yet satisfying, accessible yet deep. Once you get into it, you won't want to stop.			"

I appriciate how this game offers options to cool down the difficulty (although personally I haven't had to use them yet, I anticipate it later on in the game, as it is found by many players to be a useful, natural option) for players who find themselves overwhelmed in any way, shape or form.

												I loved this game!I love rogue-likes for many reasons, but I also really enjoyed that this game included some carry-over from character to character (improvements stick around.) My first few characters got destroyed. Almost instantly. With each new generation though, I was able to get stronger, and buy better equipment (as well as learn the enemies.) Eventually I could clear out all of the areas (not counting bosses) with ease.When I beat the first boss, it was a turning point for me. I felt accomplished, and gained a ton of gold with which to upgrade my lineage. Then I spent a fair amount of time grinding gold to upgrade (NOTE: you would not need to do this as much as I did.) When I decided to go after the remaining bosses I was able to easily take out the 2nd, then grind a bit more before the 3rd. By that point, the 4th as well as the final boss were both easy for me (as I tend to grind too much.)If you like platformers, with or without rogue-like elements, or vice-versa, definitely pick this game up. I think I put in about 20 hours before going after the final couple bosses (could have done it much sooner probably,) and I am looking forward to new challenges with the Neo-bosses and New Game+ run-throughs.

												Absolutely amazing game, and the greatest game of it's kind I've played since Castlevania Symphony of the Night. My only problem with this game is that the upgrade tree only took around 70 hours to complete, which isn't much of a problem.

												This game is addicting not only because the heritage system is fun and the puns WILL make you laugh- whether you want it or not- but also because there is a ton of customization options available to be unlocked. The more you unlock, the more new options you'll want to unlock next. The game starts slow and you will probably die a lot if you dont play with a controller. It will also take time to get used to the floaty jumping physics. But once you get used to it- oh boy, will you have fun with this game.Also quite entertaining when playing it with one more person.

												Rogue Legacy is an overall awesome game. Although the game starts slow, the more you play the better the game gets. Lots of enemies, rewarding battles and a ton of unlockables throughout. The character choices, traits and abilities definitely are expansive. The controls are tight and feel great, and the options for mobility upgrades are very cool. The difficulty of the game overall I'd say is harder, but well worth the effort. This is the kind of game where playing it longer means better rewards; you can get hooked easily. That being said, you'll need as much practice as you can get if you choose to try and 100% complete the game.Rogue Legacy is just flat out fun. If you like action and platformers, then you'll have a great time. I recommend this game to anybody; it is well worth the money.			"

												Great indie game, the game makes you push yourself to your limits all the time. It has some really hard sidequests after you beat the game, and also makes you want to get all collectables for lots of replayability. the main game (not counting new game+) takes about 5-15 hours depending how good you are. After that you can still play the game for at least 30hours if you want to do everything possible.If you like rogue like games you need to try this game, like right now. Don't buy it if you don't own a controller though, keyboard controls are absolute garbage.			"

												Chalenging mideval action-based RPG. You have to rely on dodging and quick wits to avoid taking hits if and at all possible. Players comming from games such as Castlevania (the series) or Zelda II The Adventures of Link will find a familar but fresh and  most likely unique and enjoyable expirence. I appriciate how this game offers options to cool down the difficulty (although personally I haven't had to use them yet, I anticipate it later on in the game, as it is found by many players to be a useful, natural option) for players who find themselves overwhelmed in any way, shape or form. It is a famillar concept but a unique and enjoyable expirence nonetheless.			"

												I loved this game!I love rogue-likes for many reasons, but I also really enjoyed that this game included some carry-over from character to character (improvements stick around.) My first few characters got destroyed. Almost instantly. With each new generation though, I was able to get stronger, and buy better equipment (as well as learn the enemies.) Eventually I could clear out all of the areas (not counting bosses) with ease.When I beat the first boss, it was a turning point for me. I felt accomplished, and gained a ton of gold with which to upgrade my lineage. Then I spent a fair amount of time grinding gold to upgrade (NOTE: you would not need to do this as much as I did.) When I decided to go after the remaining bosses I was able to easily take out the 2nd, then grind a bit more before the 3rd. By that point, the 4th as well as the final boss were both easy for me (as I tend to grind too much.)If you like platformers, with or without rogue-like elements, or vice-versa, definitely pick this game up. I think I put in about 20 hours before going after the final couple bosses (could have done it much sooner probably,) and I am looking forward to new challenges with the Neo-bosses and New Game+ run-throughs.

												I love this game! Normally, I'm not such a huge fan of these insanely difficult ""roguelikes"" but this one really gets it right. Sure, it's hard as hell and you'll die a gazillion times, but the cool part is that you get to keep the rewards of every attempt, slowly making it easier for yourself as you also get the hang of it. That combination makes it rewarding to try over and over, just to test out newly unlocked skills, new items, better armor, or a new type of character. It balances its punishing difficulty with rewards, humor and the fact that it really captures the responsive, old-school platformer feeling.It's truly fun to try running in as a giant, but near-sighted ninja with some extra-buff armor slapped on and then, once you inevitably die, go in as a high-hitpoint barbarian lady with dwarfism, wearing health-stealing vampiric runes and armor who curses every time she's hit. It's a blast to play and I highly recommend picking it up on sale!			"

												I just finished the game and I have to say it is one of the better indie games i have played. It requires skill to be able to get anywhere although you can achieve most things by grinding gold to upgrade everything.The game is playes in 2d, castlevania like way. You get a sword and a random magic power as well as a uniqe class power to help you out in combat.The game offers NG+, you can use everything you upgraded in your playthorugh in the next much harder playthorugh. In the start of of every game you have you play as a an heir to your last character with random traits. This traits might not have much to say in your game or they might be an advantage or a disadvantage, many of the traits are quite funny but annoying at the same time. Other than the traits, the 3 heirs you may play as have different classes like the barbarian, knight and mage and more which is also entirely random forcing you to play as everything every once in a while. Rouge Legacy is a rougelike, which makes every playthrough of the castle different from the last time you where there. However, you can lock the previous castle down by talking to an architect, and he will do it for you for a quite heavy price, but this is exellent for defeating the many hard bosses in the game. The game is recommended to everyone who likes rougelikes and likes the challenges of this types of games.At least check it out on youtube and get a feel for the gameplayEdit(new update):New additions to such a great game is always great, the new bosses required som skills in the game and a lot of replays to be able to beat, the new class is also a nice addition to the game.

												A great game which provides you with a great challenge. Although you will die a lot in this game you'll never feel cheated by the game. Traversing through the castle and surviving the onslaught of monsters feels very rewarding, since you'll gain currency with every monster you kill and object you break. With this currency you'll buy upgrades which will make your next character stronger and will allow you to move further into the castle untill you die again. Rinse and repeat untill you can take on all the bosses. This may sound repetitive, but the castle get randomly generated each time you enter it (unless you want to fork over 40% of your earnings!) so each playthrough provides it's own challenges and ways to solve them. It keeps the action fresh, while you feel yourself improving from getting better equipment and stats as well as experience. Afraid you'll over level and the game becomes easy? Well, the game has a nice solution to that in store for you. Buy this game when you get the chance. And if it's on sale don't hesitate, just get it. It will be a fun and rewarding experience.			"

												I have had to make myself stop playing this during every session. Yeah, that's probably indicative of some deeper problems, but what I mean is that Rogue Legacy absolutely nails the ""Just one more"" itch. After every run, you'll promise yourself you'll step after this next one, and then three hours later you'll still be playing.I'm consistently surprised by how many new things there are to unlock with the gold earned during my runs, which in turn improve future characters and enable more options for those future characters to potentially have. Initially, you can use a Knave, a Knight, a Mage, and a Barbarian. At this point in the game, my heir can potentially be a Paladin, a Barbarian King, a Archmage, a Assassin, a Hokage, a Miner, a Lich King, or a Spellsword. Adding to that the numerous traits, like ADHD, Dementia, Dwarfism, etc, many of which have actual gameplay benefits/downsides, and the amount of variables is ♥♥♥♥ing enormous.You should play this game.

												This is the game for people who like dying both in and out of game.Right off the bat I have to say that this is my current favorite game. Yeah I've played others more, but have I talked about them to the extent that it nearly cost me one friend and the ones who are slightly more tolerant are still rolling their eyes? No. I am almost willing to bet that I have a bounty on my head. ""Kill this person!"" someone has said. ""They won't stop talking about this game!""To make things crazier, the thing I'm willing to risk my own life for also involves a cuss-ton of death. I've literally gotten an achievement for dying so much.  The fact that you will die is a given; the biggest draw of the game is in the very title. This is a story about your legacy. Your lineage. Yes, you have to start at the beginning of the game when you die (albeit with much more power and better items and stuff). But maybe this time your kid will have some cussing useful traits, like not having a pulse in their feet, or a really awesome memory. Of course, they could also have any number of vision problems (which will cuss with you like you won't believe), or maybe they'll be upside down for their entire life. With a good hero, you'll be rooting for them not to die. A bad one practically has you throwing them in front of the monsters.While the ""rogue-lite"" setup is draw in and of itself, I found myself sticking around for the awful (and by awful I mean hilarious) humor. References abound. Naruto, Skyrim, an internet meme or two. References aren't your thing? The characters you'll come across are among the most sarcastic you'll meet in gaming. None are afraid to openly mock you for being very, very awful at Rogue Legacy. Even the training dummy joins in: ""Dost thou even hoist?"" he sneers. If sarcasm is also not your thing, it's easy to be delighted by the random things you'll find in your exploration of the dungeons in this game. Jukeboxes, random carnival games, and for those who just literally have no sense of humor, the pieces of a (mostly) serious journal that tell a grim tale when read together.I recommend this to anyone with a lot of time to spare (you'll need it), a mountain of patience, and a love of platformers. A controller is optional (the keyboard controls work well, and some even say they work better, though I disagree). Thinking price-wise, I got this on sale, but would have paid the full price if I knew how much fun I was going to have playing it. The only complaint that I can even vaguely form is that there is no multiplayer/co-op. This is probably a good thing, because if there was I would likely force my friends to play it with me and then they'd hate me even more than they already do.I'm not saying you should get this game, but you should definitely get this game.

												This innocent little game will always have you hating it, and, coming back for more at the same time. One unique feature is that every time you die, that's it. No respawns, no lives, no second chances. But, fear not! You can select an offspring to continue your journey. Each child will have different characteristics that define them. For example, they might have dwarfism, and be really small, or have vertigo, where you have to play the entire game upside down! Obviously, not all of the traits are good, but they do serve to spice up the game. On top of that, each life, the castle has a new layout, which means you will never have the same map... unless you lock the castle. This is the one feature I didn't like; You can give up a percentage of your gold to lock the castle and keep your progress. It feels like cheating to me. You should have to find all the bosses, not just teleport to them! Despite that, it's a really fun game that will have you hooked. Buy it!			"

												I love this game! Normally, I'm not such a huge fan of these insanely difficult ""roguelikes"" but this one really gets it right. Sure, it's hard as hell and you'll die a gazillion times, but the cool part is that you get to keep the rewards of every attempt, slowly making it easier for yourself as you also get the hang of it. That combination makes it rewarding to try over and over, just to test out newly unlocked skills, new items, better armor, or a new type of character. It balances its punishing difficulty with rewards, humor and the fact that it really captures the responsive, old-school platformer feeling.It's truly fun to try running in as a giant, but near-sighted ninja with some extra-buff armor slapped on and then, once you inevitably die, go in as a high-hitpoint barbarian lady with dwarfism, wearing health-stealing vampiric runes and armor who curses every time she's hit. It's a blast to play and I highly recommend picking it up on sale!			"

												One of the most painfully addictive platformers I've ever played.  The layout is randomly generated each generation, so no two castles are built quite the same way.  Though, really, that's a *bit* dishonest: the castle rooms are generated from prefab modules, so things make a bit of sense, in terms of layout for each room.  But there's hundreds of different kinds of rooms.  In fact, I kept noticing new layouts even after my fourth time beating the game.And that's the other thing -- each time you beat the game, it gets much harder than before.  Once you think you've mastered it, you're in for a bit of humbling as you begin the game again.  But ,as you advance your skills, upgrade your descendants, and learn how to deal with the newer versions of the enemies, you'll eventually win out. I'm on ""New Game Plus #4"" right now... and I intended to beat it at least one more time. If you have any love for high precision platformers, this is a dead simple buy.  It's frustrating, downright evil, and thoroughly enjoyable, polished game that deserves much more exposure than it currently has.Leave the keyboard at home, though, guys.  No matter what you may think: a gamepad is absolutely essential if you realistically hope to finish this.  (And you will want to!)*****			"

However as other reviewers have stated it does get easier if you can tolerate a little grindage. Using a logitech gamepad on this one similiar to the PS3 controller.. and I must say this game is ultra fun, pretty addictive.. the unlocks do come slowy after many deaths but this only fuels your desire to fight back and become more powerful. Your liniege continues familiy member after family member as you pick and chose your successor with each inherited trait/spell you move on one step closer to dominance. Hack and Slash your way through droves of enemies, avoid traps and enjoy totaly random dungeons. Rogue Legacy at the discounted price right now is a must have!

												To put it simply, if you like action/platformer/rpg hybrids in any combination or roguelikes, you'll probably enjoy this game quite a bit.  The tricky part comes when you think about just how muhc you want to play it.If you just want to finish the game a single time, there are not many flaws, all things considered; a very fun, colorful, charming, unique experience awaits you, and you'll have a great time building up your lineage's permanent stat boosts, equipment and enchanment options while you simultaneously build actual skill at playing the game as you discover and suffer through more and more different types of enemies, minibosses and unique room setups.  The bosses are fairly challenging but fun, and  conveniences like the architect which keeps the castle from changing for a price will keep you from ever becoming too frustrated.  Mix in the plethora of classes to try and unique 'afflictions' that your descendants may possess, many of which carry with them both positive and negative aspects, and just a very solid, fun, well-tuned gameplay all around, and what you have is a very solid 8, if not 8.5/10 experience.But then... Spoilers.  There's a New Game + mode.  And from that point... things get a bit different.  Now, you can do EVERYTHING else in the game that wasn't available in the first playthrough in this mode -- collect all the rest of the equipment, earn the last achievements and actually be able to feasibly afford all of the upgrades, chiefly.  But as you venture into this mode and beyond (the game has an infinite NG+ system where every NG+ increases monster strength and gold value drastically) the game's flaws start to become very apparent; Many of the worse afflictions that may have seemed funny or charming the first time become nothing more than annoyances that you'd rather didn't exist; Many of the CLASSES, particularly spellcasters and the treasure-seeking miners, become utterly outclassed and overshadowed by their melee counterparts, especially in NG2+ and higher when critical hits become required to really do damage, and alas, magic cannot crit.  Eventually only Assassins and Barbarians are truly capable to even play as, and many afflictions make gameplay impossible in the higher difficulties, or severely hinder it -- and each time you move up a NG+ number you can never go back without completely wiping your save.  Long story short, the game becomes less and less fun the further you get.Perhaps eventually some of these issues will be patched and smoothed out, but currently, I'd very heartily give you this advice; Do everything you possibly can in the original game (and GET THE CARNIVAL ACHIEVEMENT if you care, before beating the final boss!  I can't stress that enough, if you don't want to pull your hair out!);  In NG+ get ALL the rest of the equipment and enchantments and then when you slay the final boss a second time, move on to a different game.7.5/10			"

												I don't write reviews often, but this game completely stole my heart. Not only does it take me back to the old retro game style with the NES and SNES, but concept of each run being randomly generated, and the progression of slowly building your stats and taking out rooms that would wipe the floor with you a few characters back keeps you coming back for more. Extremely addicting game with multiple hours of gameplay. Even after completing the first run though, I still feel like there's much more left to do.			"

												The best part of this game for me is the variation,No castle is the same ( except on lock-down )There is many different heros for you to test and analyseThis game challenges you and hooks you in by making you think ""1 more go"" and at times it is VERY frustrating Beating the bosses with the Obol took me over 30 Hrs of gameplay but it was well worth it for the sense of achievement you recieve when the gates lights change.There is so many different swords and gear which you collect by doing challenges in the castle which also hooks you in by wanting to collect them all.If I had to describe this game in one word it would be""outstanding"" Great work developers10/10			"

I spendt most of my time dungeon-crawling for gold so I could unlock everything but most people get by with the basics. This game can be hard or easy at the same time, offers something new every play-through, and has near-unlimited replay-ability. Bosses are unique and every situation can be approached in different ways depending on your build and your current class. I would definitely suggest this game to literally any kind of player; young or old, casual or hardcore.5/5 Do I recommend this game Steam asks of me? Yes I do.			"

												I think with over 260 hours of playtime, I can definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.Everything about this game is perfect, from the responsive controls to the visual style, the story and the upgrade system. The game is absolutely fair, it may be a little difficult in the beginning, but you will get the hang of how it works in no time.There is also a story, but, at least for me, it was not the most important part. Just playing for a few hours with randomized characters and dungeons is so much fun. It might get a little repetetive, but only after...like 100+ hours or so. I play this game daily for about an hour and I still don't find it boring. All of the positive opinions you may have heard about this are true. It is definitely worth the price. Buy it now.			"

However as other reviewers have stated it does get easier if you can tolerate a little grindage. Using a logitech gamepad on this one similiar to the PS3 controller.. and I must say this game is ultra fun, pretty addictive.. the unlocks do come slowy after many deaths but this only fuels your desire to fight back and become more powerful. Your liniege continues familiy member after family member as you pick and chose your successor with each inherited trait/spell you move on one step closer to dominance.

There are more environments to go to like a forest, the sky and I think the other one is hell.It's an RPG, so it has skilltrees and a shop in which you can buy better swords, armour and upgrades like double jump.When you die, its all over for the character you play as. You play as a new character. It gives you a choice of 3 everytime, and they are different all the time. One may be dyslexic, blind, have a spike ball and is really giant and doesn't do a lot of damage. Another may be small and does loads of damage, extra crit hit damage, old fashioned, there are just loads of different variations.It can also get very repetive and can easily get you bored if you play for a couple of hours straight.I wouldn't recommend this game at full price, so try and get it in a sale which is 50% off or more.I give it a 7/10			"

But things get more and more expensive, so the game encourages you to get good, so you can buy the next upgrade, which i really like.

												Dangerously addictive. Sometimes the game doesn't explain things that it really should, and the lack of choice in which character class you spawn with (you only get 3 choices) is annoying. Still, running through the castle and gathering treasure is great.			"

												It's pretty much Metroidvania with randomly generated rooms, which is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.  Challenging as hell, fun as hell.  I mean, I got this game not even two days ago and I have 18 hours and have gotten to new game 8+ and plan to continue onward.If you like some challenging metroidvania gameplay and endless onslaught of baddies to murder with dumb little twists to your character everytime you select a new one after being brutually cut down in your prime, this is the jam for you.There's more to it but who wants to read what I have to say, go look up a real review.Then buy the game and send countless of your bloodline to their death.

												I think having gotten all the achievements, even the crazy hard ones, is a testament to how much I like this game.Rogue Legacy is a great bit of Metroidvania meets rogue-like fun. It's whimsical, it's challenging, and it even has a decent story that gets really interesting towards the end. I think its greatest fault is its potentially frustrating beginning though. The short tutorial is fine, but unlike another famous rogue-like platformer Spelunky, you probably won't have a ""fair chance"" at completing even the early content until you grind for a certain number of persistent upgrades. Many rogue-likes and rouge-like hybrids always start you off the same way and just force you to use your skill, wits, and luck to complete any given run. Even though you certainly need wits and skill to get you through Rogue Legacy, you can progressively and permenantly soften the difficulty of different sections by collecting gold, equipment, character classes, and runes. This is great for those who find rogue-likes in general too hard for their tastes, but it does mean that you may occasionally hit difficulty spikes that make you feel like you have to grind before you can tackle further content. (I'd say that each area is roughly tuned to increments of 25 character / upgrade levels. So you probably won't complete your first run of the game until you are about level 75 - 100.) Still, as more stuff unlocks I feel the game gets progressively better and more ""fair"", so it's worth sticking through the rough bits for the fun bits if you have the patience. By the time you unlock everything, the world is your oyster in terms of how you want to customize yourself for the challenges that still lie ahead.			"

												I started playing Rogue Legacy on a whim one day when none of my co-op friends were online and immediately got sucked into it. I really like pretty much everything about this game and would recommend it for pretty much everyone.The gameplay is solid, if you like 2D sidescrolling games. The combat is fluid, and the enemies are diverse. The different classes you unlock also give you some diversity in gameplay style and allow you to pick what you prefer (tanky vs fast vs magic) I really enjoy the presentation as well as the art style is clean and congruous, but they aren't afraid to play with things for fun.What really sets Rogue Legacy apart though is the character selection. As with a proper rogue-like, you will be dying a lot. Like, a lot. And once you do, you are giving the option of picking between 3 successors, with random rolled characteristics. The traits are interesting and add a really fun element to the game. I don't want to go into detail about what they do because it's fun to discover them, but it's a nice design that keeps the game fresh.Speaking of rogue-likes, this is how they should be. You expect to die constantly, but I rarely find it frustrating because that's part of the experience. The goal isn't to finish everything in one life, it's to live long enough to collect loot and gear to unlock permanent upgrades for your lineage. Thus, each attempt gives you a slightly better chance at getting farther the next time. The scaling works really well too. You will slow creep farther and farther into deeper areas, sometimes without even realizing right away that you're making progress. I'm finding that balance to be well executed as I can reasonably proceed to harder areas around the time I'm starting to find the area I've been playing in too easy.This is a game that it's easy to get sucked into. I often find myself playing for an hour or two longer than I planned on because I've unlocked something new and say ""just one more run before I quit"" several times in a row. It's fun, amusing, challenging, and gives you something to work towards. You really can't ask for more than that.			"

												It's undeniably a great game, but unfortunately the lack of variety when it comes to the locations (i.e. Castle, Forest, Dungeon - rinse and repeat) did tend to lessen my enjoyment on my subsequent playthrough.That said, it's highly addictive and the jump-in, jump-out style of gameplay makes it great to play during coffee breaks or when you're unable to commit a heftier chunk of time to a larger title. The simplistic controls definitely make it quite easy for even the most casual of gamers to get into, while also being somewhat difficult to master for those looking to dig deep into the base mechanics and speed-run like a crazed mofo.P.S. Bonus points for the full controller support, feels great with a pad.			"

												I should dislike this game.  I should hate it.  You die... a LOT.  You lose the money you have collected every life.  Your character changes every life.  Sometimes the layout of the castle is downright obtuse and painful.  Sometimes everything seems to be against you.  And yet, this is an awesome game that if you stick with it will have you coming back for more over and over again.While everything can sometimes feel like it's against you dying is always your fault.  You either were not quick enough or didn't plan ahead or was too desperate to reach the chest.Respawning is quick and provides choice, will you be a vampire lich who leaches health from your kills or a giant mage?  There are many choices here all with their pros and cons.  And there are a multitude of ways to spend your money, do you focus on equipment and runes or skills?  (The skill tree is huge)  Combat is satisfying and the enemies are varied.  The boss battles are tough and rewarding, mini bosses are also a challenge.  There is a lot to explore and the randomized castle and dungeon layouts keeps things fresh.  You can't do anything by rote, you are always challenged and trying out new things.But the game isn't without issues.  Losing your remaining money everytime you enter the castle is downright annoying (you can lower the % amount via costly upgrades but it's still painful to lose 1000 coins).  Upgrades can cost too much which makes you sometimes feel like it's a grind.  Money isn't as plentiful as it could be and the randomized layouts mean that you can't go straight to tougher areas directly.  You can lock the layout but at a cost to how much money you recieve which negates the value.  It can also be hard to find the right balance between your character and equipment and sometimes the quirky traits your character has means that you just wish they would die so you can respawn (what value is there to everything being upside down?).  Allowing you to stockpile more money would be a definite improvement and perhaps having the castle and dungeons larger.  Letting you warp directly to previously found areas would also be a plus grinding through the main castle everytime can be a drag.Overall this is a very fun game with few downsides but you have to stick at it and get past the initial difficulty curve.

												This game is a very good platformer with Roguelike elements and a lot of bullet-dodging. You enter a castle which is randomized each time, with areas generally close to the same locations: Castle (easy part) at the entrance, the Forest (a bit harder) to the left, the Tower (hard) above the Castle section, and the Dungeon (hardest part) below the castle section. A boss guards each area, are not randomized, and have bullet-hell patterns. Once those are defeated, the door to the final boss is unlocked and you can finish the game.This game is really hard, as are most Roguelikes and games that are inspired by Roguelikes. It features perma-death (you die once and it's over) which adds to an already challenging game, although you can ""lock down"" the castle so that it will have the same layout as last time, for a percentage of your gold. Also, any bosses you kill, stay dead on subsequent playthroughs, so once you defeat all four bosses, you can keep challenging the final boss even without locking the castle down.After your inevitable death, your heir will take up the mantle. You choose between three characters with randomized names, classes, and traits. Some traits are good, most are bad. There's some funny ones such as IBS (every time you jump, you fart), ones that mess with the screen such as Vertigo (play the game upside down), crippling ones such as CIP (can't see your HP), and very beneficial ones such as Eid. Mem. (see the locations of enemies and chests in visited rooms even when you leave). Traits boost the replayability of this game a ton, and most of them are fun, except for two of them which I will get to in a minute.You will also be able to dull the sharp edge of the difficulty and the RNG by upgrading your manor. Basically, you spend gold you collect in the castle on new, stronger classes, better starting stats, and things of that nature. You will also be able to find new equipment and skills to take with you: up to 5 skills can be equipped at once (dash, double-jump, vampirism, etc).The game also has tons of really fun things in it. There's a diary you can read that help the storyline, often lampshading itself. There's minigames where you have to hit all the targets. There's rooms you can find that will show previous games that were developed by the makers of this game. There's even a jukebox that can be found where you can listen to all of the game's soundtrack, though sadly the music you choose does not remain when you leave the room. For the challenge gamer, there's the Fairy Chest Challenges as well, where you must complete a room under specific conditions to get a Fairy Chest. The Fairy Chest always contains something good, like equipment or stat increases.Now for the bad. Those two traits I listed earlier that are not fun? That would be Far-Sighted and Near-Sighted. This game seems to be optimized for high-end video cards, not processing power, so the game is supposed to run at 60 fps. For me, it runs at 20 ~ 30 fps, and there is no way to change any of the graphical options. Far- and Near-Sighted traits slow this down to a crawl of less than 5 fps, as the blur effects it creates to block your vision demand high resources from your video card.In fact, the only real complaint I have about this awesome game is that it may not run at full speed for you, and apart from upgrading your video card, there's nothing you can do about it. Hopefully this will get fixed in the near future. I would play this game a lot more if it ran at full speed. On the other hand, it may make the game a bit easier for some, since everything is half-speed (which is still playable; I thought that was the normal speed... the game runs pretty fast at 60 fps).If you like Spelunky or you like games where you must dodge a lot of bullets, I strongly recommend this purchase, even if you don't have a powerful video card. It has tons of replay value and lots of content to offer even after you beat the game.			"

												I love this game so, so much. This is probably one of my Top 20 games, ever.I love Castlevania, I love procedurally generated games, and I love roguelikes. This game is a fantastic mashing-together of all three. I really don't feel that they could have integrated these three genres any better.The character progression and growth feels amazing. I suppose it's technically possible to beat the end boss on your first non-tutorial life, but it feels exactly as horrible and impossble a task as it should, with no powers, wealth, or weapons to help you out. As you get the hang of the game and learn its secrets, you unlock more and more powers to pass on to future generations, and eventually manage to barely scrape past bosses you've been pouring incredible amounts of time into. It's refreshing for a modern game to demand this much of you, and it's a lot of fun to take the challenge.Protip: If you buy this, it's playable and fun without a controller, but it's so much better with one. The controls really feel natural on a controller, which is something that I feel is pretty rare. The characters' movements feel tight, but also really fluid, which is something I've really only experienced previously with Super Meat Boy.At the time I'm recommending this, the game's on sale for less than $5. This game is worth so much more than that. It felt like a steal for $15. If there's ever any DLC for this, I'm impulse-buying it.Buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

I say semi because, the dungeon are always different but 4 things always remain the same .The 4 general areas, the castle (entrance), tower (Top of the castle), forest (Behind the castle) and dungeon (Underneath the castle). Game play is what you expect but! Instead of a constant hero upgrading and leveling over time. You get heirs, instead and they inherit the levels and equipment. Which you choose every time you're hero dies. An awesome game and it's worth the small amount you pay for it.			"

												★★★★★★★★☆☆Rogue Legacy is an interesting rogue-like platformer which involves no perma-death mechanic. Instead, you progress as your current character's heir. The layout of the castle you storm changes each playthrough, with the option of locking the layout down at a loss of gold income.It has plenty to keep you occupied, ranging from blueprints of new armour and weapons to runes to empower your gear with a range of effects which greatly impact your chances of success. There are also permanent upgrades to your character and unlockable classes which count as ""levels"" for your characters which in turn scale the difficulty of the castle.Due to this, the game should become more difficult as it goes along, but in my experiences it didn't. As it's not perma-death, the more you play the more powerful you become to the point where it was much easier to survive than it was to die which is a shame as the game was initially challenging.Pros:  First playthrough very fun, lots of unlocks and character classes.Cons: Not much replayability, game potentially too easy end-game.8/10.

												PREPARE TO DIE - ALOT - IN 2D - SOMETIMES WHILE FARTING UPSIDE DOWN IN BLACK & WHITE - AS A DWARF SIZED LICH KING - should be the Box Quote of Rogue Legacy. Castlevania + Dark Souls is the simplest comparison I can make with a randomly generated 2D-style Castle filled to the brink with crazy traps, bountiful treasure and hoards of enemies who will test your patience and kill you over and over again. Luckily, there are multiple character classes (Barbarian, Assassin, Mage to name a few) to unlock with different stats and abilities as well as multiple randomized starting traits (Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Near-Sighted, Dwarfism, etc.) each with their own perks and disadvantages to keep you playing over and over again as you progressively get stronger and stronger with each play-through. The soundtrack is also really well done with each track matching the different areas of the castle albeit I do sometimes get sick of hearing the starting area music over and over again after constantly dying. In short, this completely randomized rogue-like game is fun, enjoyable in short bursts, supports multiple play-through's (thanks to NG+) and shouldn't take more than 10 hours to finish. Would totally recommend for anybody looking for a game to scratch a nostalgic Dark Souls itch.			"

												Many failed generations get you closer to a winning genetic masterpiece as you progress through a lineage of quirky characters. Cellar Door Games also display their failed games as pieces of art work as you get further into the Legacy. Each new character you play has some kind of fault and this is reflected in the descriptions they give you about Cellar Door's past games. Creating a masterpiece takes many failed attempts but previous adventures help guide the way. TLDR: It's super ghouls and ghost meets symphony of the night.			"

I look forward it. More challenge, more enemy and more ""surprises"" à la Binding of Isaac will be welcome.Anyway, the game worth it.Go go Cellar Game !			"

												Rogue Legacy is a semi-Rogue-like Metroid/Castlevania-style 2D action/platformer, where you explore a changing mansion and try to clear the enemies and treasure out of it. Death is permanent, but when you die, your offspring take your place, and with the money you collected in your last run, you can buy items that will help with every future attempt.Rogue Legacy is a difficult game, and you will die many times as you play. The nice thing is that when you die, the castle layout changes, meaning that you won't keep dying to the same stupid trap. You do lose all of your money when you re-enter the castle, so you'll have to purchase upgrades with only the money you got on your last run, So, if you well on your run, you can buy a nice upgrade. If you do poorly, just enter the castle again and hope for a better layout. So, while this game is pretty difficult, it's not nearly as frustrating as a lot of other tough games are, even on those early runs where you die without getting anything at all.If course, the gimmick of this game is that each different hero has different traits that alter gameplay. It's funny, but doesn't significantly change things most of the time.I played with an XBox controller, and the controls worked pretty well for me. The music is solid. The graphics are pretty nice, though some of the filters that certain traits add get very annoying.If this sort of game looks interesting to you, definitely pick it up. I've had a lot of fun with Rogue Legacy. Inexperienced gamers may have a difficult time getting very far, though.			"

												Castlevania + rougelike elements + megamen x like controlls + progression system = somewhat oldschool awesomeness. Game takes around 12 hours to beat. I think it plays much better with a controller, since mouse accuracy is pretty much useless here, and you'll be mashing buttons a lot.			"

												Rogue Legacy is like an indie version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  The game is polished for what it is.  The intro starts as you're a knight that kills an evil king in a castle.  Flash forward to present where you play as the son of that knight that goes into this castle to find out what happened to your father.  Each time you die in the game you play as the son or daughter of the previous knight.  Each generation has different traits and character types that change how you play the game.  The castle layout changes each time you die and enter the castle.  Also, when you pick a new heir to go questing you get the inheritance money of the previous knight which you can use to purchase new swords, armors, or build your own castle to unlock power-ups and new knight types.  This game is loads of fun and has great replayability.  It's a steal at $5 and worth the regular price.			"

												I'm really torn on this game.  On the one hand, it's fun and somewhat frustrating, always keeps you on your toes, and is a pretty good example of a rogue-like.  On the other hand, it's the grindiest grind I've ever grinded.  Warcraft dailies aren't as grindy as this game.  After 16 hours, it's just gotten tedious.  Sure, I could play for another 4 hours to get the stats to beat the fourth boss, and then 4 more hours to beat the boss after that, but there's no sense of accomplishment for having done it.  There's no cry of victory, just an exasperated ""Finally!""  The fact there's a 'beat the game a second time' achievement exhausts me to think about.  The gameplay is alright, but it's not so great I could see myself sticking with it for another 20 hours.There are worse ways to spend your time, but there are much better ways too.			"

												You would think this is a simple roguelike/platformer, but there's more than that to this game. You will die a lot and you will learn a lot. The genetic traits aspect of the game is pretty good, although there's a limited set of traits and some of them are not really affecting anything (at least to my knowledge). The latest update (Dec. 2013)  introduced some new traits and content, so I expect more to come in the future.The combination of RPG elements (equipment, runes, upgrades), proceduraly generated levels and the mechanics of traits makes this a really enjoyable game. Highly recommended.			"

												So, eventually I really liked the game, or maybe I just got into the ”not giving up now” mode. TL;DR in bottom. :)After almost 16 hours I finally killed the last boss, having died 183 times, reached level 117 and unlocked a bunch of gear and stats. After this I can continue on New Game+, but to be honest it’s enough for now. :) The game is a platformer where you are tasked with avenging your family (I think) and with your sword and mighty legs of jumping-really-high, you set out into a randomly generated castle. In the beginning both you and your character will be horrible, not getting very far into the castle or getting a lot of loot or money out of it. But for each try you will dodge a bit better, hit a bit harder, take another punch and walk out rich. Eventually you will find the first boss and mightily die like a scrub again.As you level and reach each a new area, you will feel severely underdressed and weak once again, and each area release upgraded versions of the bullet hell monsters or fast monsters or tough monsters from the last area, forcing you to improve and learn their new sets of attack patterns.Each time you die, you get to choose a new randomly generated heir to continue the quest, and depending on what traits and class you play as you have different bonuses, spells and detriments.Your new heir will keep the collected gold from your previous life and will be able to upgrade his/her stats or purchase new equipment for the next generations, you also have a choice of “locking” the castle so you can try to kill any boss again without having to fight your way there again.Right, so the game is good, but also extremely unfair, many times you will find that the camera is too zoomed in, too many monsters shoot through walls and you just don’t have enough space to dodge the 15 bullets that are shot from off-screen. Each of these examples pretty much guaranteeing you to take a lot of damage. All enemies deal a lot of damage, so what you got to do is be fast on the dodging and killing, but if you have no space to dodge, you can’t dodge. And health is often far between.Not only that, if you touch an enemy with anything other than your sword, you will also take damage. This is especially a problem when fighting bosses that take up 1/3rd of the screen, them moving after you so you have to constantly run away, dodge whatever attacks they use and at the same time turn around so your sword hits in the right direction.Anyway, I digress. Much like Dark Souls, it’s a hard game, but if you stick with it you will get better and will probably enjoy the game. But if you are fast on giving up and dislike dying. This will probably not be for you. That said, it’s not as deep or rewarding as Dark Souls, so if you haven’t played that yet. Please, I implore you, do buy it, it’s worth its weight in gold.Here’s a link for it: Graphics are alright, you probably won’t be blown away by the pixel graphics, but it’s certainly not the worst game I have seen.Music is alright, nothing special though.Technically it worked fine, I can’t remember anything bad happening. Though apparently it doesn’t work on Windows 8 yet, so if you have upgraded to that, you should probably wait until it’s officially supported.Right, closing words. It’s a fun and very challenging/unfair platformer with well working mechanics and a fun gimmick. Again, if you dislike dying and grinding to improve your skill and your characters stats, this is probably not for you. However if you are fine with this and want to be challenged (and superchallenged in new game+/++) then this will definitely fit your taste I think.If you have any further questions or comments, please write them in the comments or send me a message. Have a great day! :)			"

												★★★★★★★★☆☆Rogue Legacy is an interesting rogue-like platformer which involves no perma-death mechanic. Instead, you progress as your current character's heir. The layout of the castle you storm changes each playthrough, with the option of locking the layout down at a loss of gold income.It has plenty to keep you occupied, ranging from blueprints of new armour and weapons to runes to empower your gear with a range of effects which greatly impact your chances of success. There are also permanent upgrades to your character and unlockable classes which count as ""levels"" for your characters which in turn scale the difficulty of the castle.Due to this, the game should become more difficult as it goes along, but in my experiences it didn't. As it's not perma-death, the more you play the more powerful you become to the point where it was much easier to survive than it was to die which is a shame as the game was initially challenging.Pros:  First playthrough very fun, lots of unlocks and character classes.Cons: Not much replayability, game potentially too easy end-game.8/10.

												PREPARE TO DIE - ALOT - IN 2D - SOMETIMES WHILE FARTING UPSIDE DOWN IN BLACK & WHITE - AS A DWARF SIZED LICH KING - should be the Box Quote of Rogue Legacy. Castlevania + Dark Souls is the simplest comparison I can make with a randomly generated 2D-style Castle filled to the brink with crazy traps, bountiful treasure and hoards of enemies who will test your patience and kill you over and over again. Luckily, there are multiple character classes (Barbarian, Assassin, Mage to name a few) to unlock with different stats and abilities as well as multiple randomized starting traits (Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Near-Sighted, Dwarfism, etc.) each with their own perks and disadvantages to keep you playing over and over again as you progressively get stronger and stronger with each play-through. The soundtrack is also really well done with each track matching the different areas of the castle albeit I do sometimes get sick of hearing the starting area music over and over again after constantly dying. In short, this completely randomized rogue-like game is fun, enjoyable in short bursts, supports multiple play-through's (thanks to NG+) and shouldn't take more than 10 hours to finish. Would totally recommend for anybody looking for a game to scratch a nostalgic Dark Souls itch.			"

												Many failed generations get you closer to a winning genetic masterpiece as you progress through a lineage of quirky characters. Cellar Door Games also display their failed games as pieces of art work as you get further into the Legacy. Each new character you play has some kind of fault and this is reflected in the descriptions they give you about Cellar Door's past games. Creating a masterpiece takes many failed attempts but previous adventures help guide the way. TLDR: It's super ghouls and ghost meets symphony of the night.			"

												First let me get this outta the way, this is in no way a Rogue-like game at all, it's as much of one as is any old school NES game like Mario or Contra, what is it then? An Action/Platformer type with some RPG lite elements mixed in (later it becomes a stupid as hell Bullet-Hell dodging game), it's very grindy in nature having you repeat the same things over and over again to gaining money little by little so you can strengthen you guy with unlocks to make the game easier, that's pretty much the game, its quite shallow with only 5 bosses total and the enemies are all re-skins with the same patterns/move-sets that you will learn soon enough. It's also clearly only balanced for your first and second playthrough, then the Dev's just went all lazy on it and pulled a Jay Wilson ""And then we doubled It"" (This is when it turns into a stupid Bullet-Hell dodging game, so never go beyond NG+1).All in all it's still a really fun game for two playthoughs, the first clear will probably take you 8 hours and the second another 3, so 11~ hours of fun for 15 bucks is great deal IMO, just be prepared to do lots of money farming which is very repetitive.Tip time:The Dragon class sucks balls, do not unlock it ever because it will take spots in your gene pool and screw your RNG and make you made, other classes that suck are the Miner/Spelunker and to a lesser extent Lich/Lich King class, so try and avoid them but you can't really because they ♥♥♥♥ block you from other Castle upgrades.As I said earlier do not move onto New Game+2 until you have every achievement unlocked and have farmed up a storm getting your self up around level 250 or higher, because once you hit NG+2 it becomes stupid hard and no fun, you'll just end up rushing to boss rooms and skipping everything else, and there is no going back.Upgrades you should focus on making your character stronger and more survivable, don't waste money on the fluff stuff, Attack Power > Health > Crit > Mana > Magic Dmg for example.

												I think having gotten all the achievements, even the crazy hard ones, is a testament to how much I like this game.Rogue Legacy is a great bit of Metroidvania meets rogue-like fun. It's whimsical, it's challenging, and it even has a decent story that gets really interesting towards the end. I think its greatest fault is its potentially frustrating beginning though. The short tutorial is fine, but unlike another famous rogue-like platformer Spelunky, you probably won't have a ""fair chance"" at completing even the early content until you grind for a certain number of persistent upgrades. Many rogue-likes and rouge-like hybrids always start you off the same way and just force you to use your skill, wits, and luck to complete any given run. Even though you certainly need wits and skill to get you through Rogue Legacy, you can progressively and permenantly soften the difficulty of different sections by collecting gold, equipment, character classes, and runes. This is great for those who find rogue-likes in general too hard for their tastes, but it does mean that you may occasionally hit difficulty spikes that make you feel like you have to grind before you can tackle further content. (I'd say that each area is roughly tuned to increments of 25 character / upgrade levels. So you probably won't complete your first run of the game until you are about level 75 - 100.) Still, as more stuff unlocks I feel the game gets progressively better and more ""fair"", so it's worth sticking through the rough bits for the fun bits if you have the patience. By the time you unlock everything, the world is your oyster in terms of how you want to customize yourself for the challenges that still lie ahead.			"

												I started playing Rogue Legacy on a whim one day when none of my co-op friends were online and immediately got sucked into it. I really like pretty much everything about this game and would recommend it for pretty much everyone.The gameplay is solid, if you like 2D sidescrolling games. The combat is fluid, and the enemies are diverse. The different classes you unlock also give you some diversity in gameplay style and allow you to pick what you prefer (tanky vs fast vs magic) I really enjoy the presentation as well as the art style is clean and congruous, but they aren't afraid to play with things for fun.What really sets Rogue Legacy apart though is the character selection. As with a proper rogue-like, you will be dying a lot. Like, a lot. And once you do, you are giving the option of picking between 3 successors, with random rolled characteristics. The traits are interesting and add a really fun element to the game. I don't want to go into detail about what they do because it's fun to discover them, but it's a nice design that keeps the game fresh.Speaking of rogue-likes, this is how they should be. You expect to die constantly, but I rarely find it frustrating because that's part of the experience. The goal isn't to finish everything in one life, it's to live long enough to collect loot and gear to unlock permanent upgrades for your lineage. Thus, each attempt gives you a slightly better chance at getting farther the next time. The scaling works really well too. You will slow creep farther and farther into deeper areas, sometimes without even realizing right away that you're making progress. I'm finding that balance to be well executed as I can reasonably proceed to harder areas around the time I'm starting to find the area I've been playing in too easy.This is a game that it's easy to get sucked into. I often find myself playing for an hour or two longer than I planned on because I've unlocked something new and say ""just one more run before I quit"" several times in a row. It's fun, amusing, challenging, and gives you something to work towards. You really can't ask for more than that.			"

												★★★★★★★★☆☆Rogue Legacy is an interesting rogue-like platformer which involves no perma-death mechanic. Instead, you progress as your current character's heir. The layout of the castle you storm changes each playthrough, with the option of locking the layout down at a loss of gold income.It has plenty to keep you occupied, ranging from blueprints of new armour and weapons to runes to empower your gear with a range of effects which greatly impact your chances of success. There are also permanent upgrades to your character and unlockable classes which count as ""levels"" for your characters which in turn scale the difficulty of the castle.Due to this, the game should become more difficult as it goes along, but in my experiences it didn't. As it's not perma-death, the more you play the more powerful you become to the point where it was much easier to survive than it was to die which is a shame as the game was initially challenging.Pros:  First playthrough very fun, lots of unlocks and character classes.Cons: Not much replayability, game potentially too easy end-game.8/10.

												PREPARE TO DIE - ALOT - IN 2D - SOMETIMES WHILE FARTING UPSIDE DOWN IN BLACK & WHITE - AS A DWARF SIZED LICH KING - should be the Box Quote of Rogue Legacy. Castlevania + Dark Souls is the simplest comparison I can make with a randomly generated 2D-style Castle filled to the brink with crazy traps, bountiful treasure and hoards of enemies who will test your patience and kill you over and over again. Luckily, there are multiple character classes (Barbarian, Assassin, Mage to name a few) to unlock with different stats and abilities as well as multiple randomized starting traits (Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Near-Sighted, Dwarfism, etc.) each with their own perks and disadvantages to keep you playing over and over again as you progressively get stronger and stronger with each play-through. The soundtrack is also really well done with each track matching the different areas of the castle albeit I do sometimes get sick of hearing the starting area music over and over again after constantly dying. In short, this completely randomized rogue-like game is fun, enjoyable in short bursts, supports multiple play-through's (thanks to NG+) and shouldn't take more than 10 hours to finish. Would totally recommend for anybody looking for a game to scratch a nostalgic Dark Souls itch.			"

												This is an awesome game. Rogue Legacy is great for any time length. you can spend a few minutes on one run or much longer working through each generation. There is a steady feeling of progression as you die (which is pretty counter to traditional games). Several upgrades to buy and the random 'children' that you get to pick from means that in addition to the dungeon changing up, the style of play will change as well. Mind you, the randomness is more akin to diablo map building, in that it isnt a brand new world each time, more like the rooms have all switched places. This wasn't a big deal for me and I enjoy just sitting back and messing around.			"

												Rogue Legacy is quite simply the best platformer I've played in years. It has virtually endless replayability and it's upgrade tree is vast, deep, and makes every playthrough feel worthwhile. You owe it to yourself to play this game.

												Right off the bat: I suck at challenging platformer games, but I'm already addicted to Rogue Legacy. Hopefully one day I'll manage to reach the end of this game, but even if I can't, I'm loving every bit of it. If you're like me and you're not sure if you'll like this game, grab it on sale just to test it out, but if you love challenging platformers and especially if you dig roguelike games, you gotta get this right away!

												I should dislike this game.  I should hate it.  You die... a LOT.  You lose the money you have collected every life.  Your character changes every life.  Sometimes the layout of the castle is downright obtuse and painful.  Sometimes everything seems to be against you.  And yet, this is an awesome game that if you stick with it will have you coming back for more over and over again.While everything can sometimes feel like it's against you dying is always your fault.  You either were not quick enough or didn't plan ahead or was too desperate to reach the chest.Respawning is quick and provides choice, will you be a vampire lich who leaches health from your kills or a giant mage?  There are many choices here all with their pros and cons.  And there are a multitude of ways to spend your money, do you focus on equipment and runes or skills?  (The skill tree is huge)  Combat is satisfying and the enemies are varied.  The boss battles are tough and rewarding, mini bosses are also a challenge.  There is a lot to explore and the randomized castle and dungeon layouts keeps things fresh.  You can't do anything by rote, you are always challenged and trying out new things.But the game isn't without issues.  Losing your remaining money everytime you enter the castle is downright annoying (you can lower the % amount via costly upgrades but it's still painful to lose 1000 coins).  Upgrades can cost too much which makes you sometimes feel like it's a grind.  Money isn't as plentiful as it could be and the randomized layouts mean that you can't go straight to tougher areas directly.  You can lock the layout but at a cost to how much money you recieve which negates the value.  It can also be hard to find the right balance between your character and equipment and sometimes the quirky traits your character has means that you just wish they would die so you can respawn (what value is there to everything being upside down?).  Allowing you to stockpile more money would be a definite improvement and perhaps having the castle and dungeons larger.  Letting you warp directly to previously found areas would also be a plus grinding through the main castle everytime can be a drag.Overall this is a very fun game with few downsides but you have to stick at it and get past the initial difficulty curve.

												This game is a very good platformer with Roguelike elements and a lot of bullet-dodging. You enter a castle which is randomized each time, with areas generally close to the same locations: Castle (easy part) at the entrance, the Forest (a bit harder) to the left, the Tower (hard) above the Castle section, and the Dungeon (hardest part) below the castle section. A boss guards each area, are not randomized, and have bullet-hell patterns. Once those are defeated, the door to the final boss is unlocked and you can finish the game.This game is really hard, as are most Roguelikes and games that are inspired by Roguelikes. It features perma-death (you die once and it's over) which adds to an already challenging game, although you can ""lock down"" the castle so that it will have the same layout as last time, for a percentage of your gold. Also, any bosses you kill, stay dead on subsequent playthroughs, so once you defeat all four bosses, you can keep challenging the final boss even without locking the castle down.After your inevitable death, your heir will take up the mantle. You choose between three characters with randomized names, classes, and traits. Some traits are good, most are bad. There's some funny ones such as IBS (every time you jump, you fart), ones that mess with the screen such as Vertigo (play the game upside down), crippling ones such as CIP (can't see your HP), and very beneficial ones such as Eid. Mem. (see the locations of enemies and chests in visited rooms even when you leave). Traits boost the replayability of this game a ton, and most of them are fun, except for two of them which I will get to in a minute.You will also be able to dull the sharp edge of the difficulty and the RNG by upgrading your manor. Basically, you spend gold you collect in the castle on new, stronger classes, better starting stats, and things of that nature. You will also be able to find new equipment and skills to take with you: up to 5 skills can be equipped at once (dash, double-jump, vampirism, etc).The game also has tons of really fun things in it. There's a diary you can read that help the storyline, often lampshading itself. There's minigames where you have to hit all the targets. There's rooms you can find that will show previous games that were developed by the makers of this game. There's even a jukebox that can be found where you can listen to all of the game's soundtrack, though sadly the music you choose does not remain when you leave the room. For the challenge gamer, there's the Fairy Chest Challenges as well, where you must complete a room under specific conditions to get a Fairy Chest. The Fairy Chest always contains something good, like equipment or stat increases.Now for the bad. Those two traits I listed earlier that are not fun? That would be Far-Sighted and Near-Sighted. This game seems to be optimized for high-end video cards, not processing power, so the game is supposed to run at 60 fps. For me, it runs at 20 ~ 30 fps, and there is no way to change any of the graphical options. Far- and Near-Sighted traits slow this down to a crawl of less than 5 fps, as the blur effects it creates to block your vision demand high resources from your video card.In fact, the only real complaint I have about this awesome game is that it may not run at full speed for you, and apart from upgrading your video card, there's nothing you can do about it. Hopefully this will get fixed in the near future. I would play this game a lot more if it ran at full speed. On the other hand, it may make the game a bit easier for some, since everything is half-speed (which is still playable; I thought that was the normal speed... the game runs pretty fast at 60 fps).If you like Spelunky or you like games where you must dodge a lot of bullets, I strongly recommend this purchase, even if you don't have a powerful video card. It has tons of replay value and lots of content to offer even after you beat the game.			"

												I love this game so, so much. This is probably one of my Top 20 games, ever.I love Castlevania, I love procedurally generated games, and I love roguelikes. This game is a fantastic mashing-together of all three. I really don't feel that they could have integrated these three genres any better.The character progression and growth feels amazing. I suppose it's technically possible to beat the end boss on your first non-tutorial life, but it feels exactly as horrible and impossble a task as it should, with no powers, wealth, or weapons to help you out. As you get the hang of the game and learn its secrets, you unlock more and more powers to pass on to future generations, and eventually manage to barely scrape past bosses you've been pouring incredible amounts of time into. It's refreshing for a modern game to demand this much of you, and it's a lot of fun to take the challenge.Protip: If you buy this, it's playable and fun without a controller, but it's so much better with one. The controls really feel natural on a controller, which is something that I feel is pretty rare. The characters' movements feel tight, but also really fluid, which is something I've really only experienced previously with Super Meat Boy.At the time I'm recommending this, the game's on sale for less than $5. This game is worth so much more than that. It felt like a steal for $15. If there's ever any DLC for this, I'm impulse-buying it.Buy this game. You won't regret it.			"

												Rogue Legacy is a semi-Rogue-like Metroid/Castlevania-style 2D action/platformer, where you explore a changing mansion and try to clear the enemies and treasure out of it. Death is permanent, but when you die, your offspring take your place, and with the money you collected in your last run, you can buy items that will help with every future attempt.Rogue Legacy is a difficult game, and you will die many times as you play. The nice thing is that when you die, the castle layout changes, meaning that you won't keep dying to the same stupid trap. You do lose all of your money when you re-enter the castle, so you'll have to purchase upgrades with only the money you got on your last run, So, if you well on your run, you can buy a nice upgrade. If you do poorly, just enter the castle again and hope for a better layout. So, while this game is pretty difficult, it's not nearly as frustrating as a lot of other tough games are, even on those early runs where you die without getting anything at all.If course, the gimmick of this game is that each different hero has different traits that alter gameplay. It's funny, but doesn't significantly change things most of the time.I played with an XBox controller, and the controls worked pretty well for me. The music is solid. The graphics are pretty nice, though some of the filters that certain traits add get very annoying.If this sort of game looks interesting to you, definitely pick it up. I've had a lot of fun with Rogue Legacy. Inexperienced gamers may have a difficult time getting very far, though.			"

												Many failed generations get you closer to a winning genetic masterpiece as you progress through a lineage of quirky characters. Cellar Door Games also display their failed games as pieces of art work as you get further into the Legacy. Each new character you play has some kind of fault and this is reflected in the descriptions they give you about Cellar Door's past games. Creating a masterpiece takes many failed attempts but previous adventures help guide the way. TLDR: It's super ghouls and ghost meets symphony of the night.			"

												Rogue Legacy is like an indie version of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  The game is polished for what it is.  The intro starts as you're a knight that kills an evil king in a castle.  Flash forward to present where you play as the son of that knight that goes into this castle to find out what happened to your father.  Each time you die in the game you play as the son or daughter of the previous knight.  Each generation has different traits and character types that change how you play the game.  The castle layout changes each time you die and enter the castle.  Also, when you pick a new heir to go questing you get the inheritance money of the previous knight which you can use to purchase new swords, armors, or build your own castle to unlock power-ups and new knight types.  This game is loads of fun and has great replayability.  It's a steal at $5 and worth the regular price.			"

Game play is what you expect but! Instead of a constant hero upgrading and leveling over time. You get heirs, instead and they inherit the levels and equipment.

												The name already says what this game is about. Its an awesome rogue-like. You try to conquer a castle of your ancestors while you jump and kill in a beautiful 2D-world. You can play multiple classes and all of them are different to each other. But not only the classes make every of your characters unique. Also your characters have some random attributes, like genes, which can be very useful or even negative, usually those negative genes are meant for fun-runs, an example for this is that your controls are reversed. Next step for your character is gathering some gear. You can receive them in chests, which you get from bosses, minibosses and some special rooms. I recommend this game to every rogue-like fan and to everyone whos not afraid of dying.			"

Randomly generated maps and rooms, keep the gameplay fresh and exciting, with 4 different 'worlds' to explore and about as many variations of enemies you can imagine. The 'hero' choice is very refreshing, and each character has a randomly assigned class and features. For example colourblind, or gigantism. There really are a lot of those little touches and they change the gameplay tremendously even if you don't think they could. The bosses are challenging, but you can quickly find your favourite strategy to beat them. Thedifficulty might seam a bit unfair at the strt since you will die... a lot, but at the same time, it's easy enough to learn how to avid enemy attacks and navigate in the tight spaces filled with spikes from every side.All in all I recomend this game completely to anyeone and everyone.

But as you progress through the game, you notice the improvements and get better and better. Some people have said that it is a bit grindy. I have hit that point after 40+ hours, when I started New Game+.The grindy bit is that in order to get the final sets of equipment, you need to grind quite a bit to handle New Game+. Also some of the last achievements require playing New Game+. Regardless of the grindy aspect, that you don't HAVE to deal with, this game sucked me in for a solid week, and considering I got it in sale, some of the best money I spent during the summer sale. 10/10 - I will grind again.

												Ghosts 'n Goblins meets roguelike but without the frustration of having to completely start over.  In fact, after dying you look forward to what whacky genetic trait your next child (playthough) gets.  It's an addicting feedback loop.  Great platformer, great roguelike, great ideas implemented smartly!			"

												A fun, procedural rogue-lite, rouge-like, whatever you what to call it.  The randomization of rooms and enemies is well-done, despite the different zones sharing a ton of similarities with the big difference being a coat of paint.  Rogue Legacy also controls really tight, even when you're triple-jumping or flying around the screen with about a dozen enemies crowding around you.  Since you're going to spend most of the game jumping and dodging, good controls are extremely important.The big push of the game, playing as your offspring with different traits, actually is a bit of a letdown.  All characters have the same basic controls and models and share most of the same skills.  Playing as a mage character will involve a lot of the same running, jumping, and sword-swinging as a knight, just with a few minor differences.  The character traits are mostly a mixed bag, with a decent bit of them being one-off things you try once (like vertigo) and never bother with it again.  Some are useful, but more often than not you're going to end up picking the heir with the least negative traits rather than any with a particularly cool effect.Enemies are heavily re-skinned in Rogue Legacy, you'll be fighting same 8-12 enemies most of the game.  This doesn't really bother me since the gampelay is smooth and controls so well and combat is more of a mortal affair where enemies and the player character can both die rather quickly.  Then there's the bosses, easily the worst part of the game for me.  They're not even original enemies, just the same ones you fight over and over but much bigger.  That's the not bad part though.  The actual boss fights are mostly bullet hell sequences when you have to avoid twenty other things going on, dodging the huge boss, and trying to fight all the while.  It's quite annoying to fall onto one of a half-dozen floating spike balls or twenty lingering flames and die while jumping frantically to avoid a boss.  All five bosses in the game have this type of gimmick and they're more frustrating than entertaining.Rogue Legacy is also a bit on the bland side visually.  The character art and backgrounds are perfunctory and that's it.  Music is catchy but not particularly memorable.While it seems I spent most of the review nit-picking about the game, I greatly enjoyed most of my playthough.  The most important aspect of this sort the game, the gameplay, is really good.  The progression system is pretty rewarding and just exploring the castle is fun.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys 2-D platformers or fans of the traditional Castlevanias.			"

												I ran forward through the castle complex, but no matter how hard I squinted, the world outside the small bubble of clarity around me remained blurry and out of focus. “Damn this short-sightedness,” I muttered before hacking at a beast in my path. Nothing. The damn blade passed right through it. Oh great, I’m seeing things again. Dementia’s a ♥♥♥♥♥.Welcome to Rogue Legacy, a game quite unlike anything else I’ve come across. Looking for all the world like a 2D action-platformer, behind the charming pixel art presentation is a consistently surprising experience, packing a dizzying array of variables.It’s all anchored by robust Roguelike game design, which means a procedurally generated world and perma-death. Each time you enter the castle, its layout and the challenge ahead will be different, and if you die, well, that’s the end of that hero - it’s time to send one of his heirs in to try and finish the job. Thankfully, the meta-game lets you spend any gold earned during the last run on your family’s fort, which means unlocking new classes and perks, and upping your stats for the next attempt.CaptionThe core sword and spell action-platforming is tightly designed.And boy, there’s going to be a lot of attempts. When you first start playing Rogue Legacy you might last a minute or two before succumbing to one of the ghouls, undead, or other nasties that lurk inside the castle complex. It’s a classic 30-second gameplay loop – hacking, slashing, running, jumping, dashing, evading, and spellcasting, repeated until you die. This core gameplay is compelling in and of itself - Rogue Legacy is wonderful to control provided you have a good gamepad - but to make true progress you’ll need to boost your stats, get better equipment and activate perks. Gradually your runs will get longer and longer. Then you’ll wander into a higher-level area and die almost instantly.The cycle of life, eh?It’s an excellent way to structure the challenge, and really puts the fear of god into you. You may be kicking ♥♥♥ in what amounts to Rogue Legacy’s foyer, but boy, you’re not ready for the forest yet, or – god forbid – the dank dungeons underneath the castle. This is a game where your best option is to turn and run away if you enter an area you’re not ready for. This is a game where it may be several hours before you beat the first boss – despite being able to reach it in a matter of minutes - and many more before you’re ready for the next. Good thing the bosses stay dead after you die, otherwise beating Rogue Legacy would be an even more distant prospect.CaptionThe bosses can be next to impossible with the wrong character, but as you'd expect, learning their attack patterns is key.Now, levelling up is all well and good, but Rogue Legacy has one very unique trick up its sleeve in addition to this. I’ve already mentioned that you send an heir in to continue the fight after each death, but you actually get a choice of three, and each has a random class, random spell, and random traits. Traits? Yup, and they’re glorious, surprising and bewildering. Ever played as a hero suffering from vertigo and OCD? How about a colour blind protagonist who also has Alzheimer’s? ADHD and dementia anyone? Tunnel vision and irritable bowel syndrome? The list goes on and on.The really clever part of this system is that many of these traits have significant gameplay ramifications: ADHD means you move faster, far-sightedness and near-sightedness leave areas of the screen blurry, and characters with dementia will hear things and see enemies that aren’t there. Dwarves, meanwhile, are so light and small they don’t activate spiked floor panels and can access areas no other characters can.Of course, some traits really have been included just for fun. Dyslexia, for instance, means any in-game text is garbled, while a character with coprolalia (Tourette’s syndrome) will swear any time he or she gets hit. Heroes with hypochondria, on the other hand, will have much larger numbers pop up any time they take damage, while you’ll probably avoid vertigo at all costs – unless you’re a masochist – because who wants their world to be upside down? Getting your head around the traits system is all about working out what comes with meaningful changes to the world and how that factors into your play style.The world near long-sighted heroes is out of focus.Cool, right? And that’s really just a taste – there’s plenty more for you to discover when you play it yourself... which you absolutely should. The traits are just one facet, too. Once you factor in the ten classes and all the spells characters can have, the list of potential combinations is incredibly long.It really is pot luck, and no matter how far through the meta-game you are, you will never know exactly what to expect. Of course, the further in you are, the more you’ve honed your skills and come to know how best to use each class, trait, and spell, and – crucially – how to select the random character that you can best utilise.The learning curve is right on the money, and almost every run has something to teach you, whether it’s an epic boss-killing mission with a heaven-sent character that’s able to survive a wide-roaming journey through the castle, or an abject, miserable failure with the best of a bad bunch. Mind you, the random nature of Rogue Legacy won’t be to everyone’s tastes - getting a series of dud characters can definitely feel punitive at times, as opposed to a learning experience.CaptionEvery class differs in core stats and special ability, while equipment and enchantments are class agnostic.Thankfully, the mix of enemies is quite compelling. Each area introduces new enemies - ninjas in Hannya masks, headless horses that charge the player - as well as fresh variants on old designs. Juggling a set of monsters with their own disparate attack patterns is a big part of the challenge. The five bosses represent a good mix of bullet hell and precision platforming too, whether you’re facing a huge flaming skull or a gigantic gelatinous blob.The castle holds more surprises than just rooms full of enemies. Special rooms abound, including carnival games, shrines, mini-boss battles, and plenty more. Perhaps the most interesting, however, are the fairy chest rooms. Each has a very specific challenge for you to beat. Kill everything! Get to the chest without jumping! Don’t fight! Don’t take damage! You get the idea.Unlocking a fairy chest will net you a rune that can be equipped for specific perks, like air-jumping, dashes, limited flight, extra gold, reflecting damage taken back onto enemies, gaining health/mana from kills, and so on. Best of all, these runes stack. So if you want to, you can spec your character with highly customised ability sets. Multiple air-jumps? Don’t mind if I do!While some of the fairy chest rooms can be conquered by almost any character, others require particular traits or sets of runes. Thankfully, you can use the Architect - one of three characters unlocked via your fort (alongside the Smithy and Enchantress) - to lock down the layout of the castle for successive attempts. He’s a great inclusion, and indicative of Rogue Legacy’s ability to balance random elements with tight, fair game design.In fact, if that balance was wrong, this game wouldn’t be anywhere near as compelling. It’s a testament to Cellar Door Games that the team was able to juggle so many elements and make it work.It’s one hell of a meaty undertaking too. The most adept players will be able to beat it in about 15 hours, whereas I sunk in considerably more time than that. It’s a lot of gaming for only $15 (USD $17 on PlayStation), and once you’ve finished your first play-through, New Game + awaits, which lets you keep all your stats, weapons and runes, but gives you a much harder variant of the castle to beat.9/10 "

												*clap* *clap* *clap*Congratulations, Cellar door, you may don't know it, but you made a game that (at least for me) is almost perfect! The impression I had while playing this game is that the developers thought trought about everything, i mean, they even gave an explanation for your hundreds of deaths in a rogue-like game! I bought this game in a sale, because I didn't know it was THAT good, if I knew earlier, i would have bought full price. It totally worth it!Gameplay is awesome, the puzzles are great, the art is cute, the story and content are funny and everything else was very well made. THE ONLY THING I think it could be better was the music. It's cool, but I think that if had something like castlevania symphony of the night this game would be perfect. I was really impressed by this game, every class this game have, forces you to think of a new combat strategy and different gameplay, even when you think you found the ""best character"", you'll realise that with the right upgrades, other classes could be the best! The balance is great!Also the new game+ gives you a whole new gameplay, because it's challenging and the enemies are very different from the normal new game.If you like rogue-like games, I strongly recommend Rogue Legacy. For me, it's one of the best game in the genre that was released so far. Congratulations again, Cellar Door. You really did a incredible job in this game!ps: forgive me for the ""engrish""			"

												Rogue Legacy is one of those games that is so simple, multiple layers of replayability and next thing you know you have spent 3 hours just to kill the first boss. It is one of those games that you play when you have to much time on your hands like terraira. It is hard to get started and to get the controls, monster, and items but when you do, you will burn hours of ""fun"" and totally not frustrating at all at times. I would recommend this game to anyone. Plus the controller port is great. I recommend you use a controller, it is just easier.			"

												So, if you love things like Super Mario Bros. and Ghosts & Goblins and all that. And, if you love other things like Binding of Isaac and FTL and all that. Well, you are going to run around this castle pooping with glee.You've probably read that you can play as a gay dwarf or a stereo-blind assassin or whatever. And that's cool.Basically, there's some kind of mystery going on and your lineage keeps dashing into this big ole creepy castle because ... ADVENTURE. FAMILY. HUBRIS. Maybe the generation you're playing as will be the best castle explorer/fighter ever. Probably you'll die.But along the way you'll earn some gold. Through the magics of big ole creepy castles, all your gold will -- I dunno -- teleport or something back to your family manor. (NOT A SPOILER ALERT: I have no idea how this works. I have a feeling it is part of the mystery and maybe there's a big twist at the end where you find out something like ... the current manor is the past castle.) However it works, your color-blind son or gigantic daughter gets to buy some sweet new genetic traits with all that gold, and while you're doing that your manor gets bigger.Dash to castle. Die. Repeat.Oh. Also these three weirdos build a camp in between the manor and the castle. And they have armor and weapons and enchantments OR can freeze the castle the way you last saw it. FOR A PRICE.So, do that or don't do that. Then dash back into the castle. Kill flying wizard ghosts. Stab some giant skulls. Head out to the garden. To the haunted attic. Or to the scary basement. (You're more likely to die in each of those respectively.)As your family gets cooler and fiercer and dark artsier, you can venture a little longer and get more golds and build a cooler, fiercer, dark artsier gene pool.It's fun.If you're not a huge 2D platformer fan, you'll enjoy it but you probably won't be all like BINDINGOFISAACISTHEBESTGAMEEVER all over it, unlike Binding of Isaac or FTL or Risk of Rain.BUT. If 2D platformers are amongst your things. Be sure to bring a rag to clean up after yourself. Because that castle might be your manor. (HONESTLY. I HAVE NO IDEA.)			"

												From interview with BigSushi.fm (http://bigsushi.fm/episode-79-cellar-door-games/)There’s something charming about talking to two developers who don’t know that they made a good game. When they released the trailer for the game, they were surprised it got so much attention. When they released a demo of the game to press, they weren’t confident about the praises being heaped upon them.""It’s been a little overwhelming. We weren’t expecting this sort of response. I’ve been working under a rock for the last year and a half. At this point I’m sick of the game and I was certain it was garbage.""It’s a sentiment shared by a lot of developers we talk with that haven’t reached critical appeal. When the brothers recollect the number of games they’ve worked on together they remember a lot of Flash games that were fun to make, but not commercially viable. But their not strangers to game development: Kenny worked for Capcom Mobile and Teddy was Lead Designer on Guacamelee! However, they consider Rogue Legacy their first big commercial release as Cellar Door Games.Rogue Legacy is described as a rogue-”lite” and is certainly not as punishing as a lot of rogue-like games. While dying in a lot of games is trying for many players, the legacy mechanic in their game makes each life unique and funny. The child you choose to avenge your death may have tourettes, irritable bowels, or have some form of gigantism creating a lot of interesting flair for your next play through.""We like to take genres and twist them.""The legacy mechanic along with unlocking upgrades to your castle, a massive skill tree, equipment and magic makes the game much more forgiving than other rogue-likes. You’re going to die, your children will have some problems, but you won’t be able to put the controller down.The brothers recognized the rogue-like mechanics in one of their favorite games, Demon’s Souls. It became an inspiration for their game as they described wanting to make something similar: a 2D Cartoony Demon’s Souls. When they started looking for artists, Glauber Kotaki had the exact style they wanted. The soundtrack from Gordon McGladdery and Judson Cowan (Tettix) is also fantastic. Although, we’ll still play a few sessions with the jazz music they originally were considering.Kenny and Teddy were a lot of fun to talk with about their history making games together, design docs, memes, Denny’s, and another entry in our unofficial poll on poutine.

												Rogue Legacy is a platformer roguelike combined with RPG elements. During each run of the castle, it is possible to find new equipment and bonuses that are permanent. The next run through the castle you normally can buy a new stat or skill or some piece of equipment. The best way to find rare blueprints for the good equipment is by using a shrine in hopes to get a compass that will lead to a otherwise invisible room with 1 or 2 blueprints. However, this shrine also gives out CURSE OF THE HEDGEHOG. This curse causes you to lose hundreds of gold every time you take damage. If the gold doesn't land on spikes or impossible to reach places, it can be picked up again. When you receive this curse, the best thing to do unfortunately is to suicide on a monster while trying to pick up as much of your gold as possible. If this occurs in a low level area, it is even more annoying if your character has a lot of hit points left and a good armor rating.There is no mod to get rid of this ""feature"" and the game doesn't have steam workshop. The only way to advance your character is with gold, after you die. If you try to continue playing through a run with the curse on, it will not be a good use of your time or fun picking up tons of gold every single time any damage is taken.If the game was patched so that when instead of getting CURSE OF THE HEDGEHOG your character just lost 10% of his gold and instantly died while a big middle finger was displayed on the screen it would be an improvement.When running the game on OSX operating system, exiting the game will not shut it down. It has to be force quitted, or will continue running in the background and steam will record it as time played. The OSX version also suffers from periodic freezes or stutters. These usually aren't too bad, but it can mess up a boss fight or tricky jump.Other than that the game is fun and has a good soundtrack. It is fun to finish a run and go back into the castle with a new character and try out a new combination of gear. Hopefully the bad things are patched out at some point.			"

												The whole retro-gaming thing is getting out of hand. I picked this up because it was only $5 on sale, and it looked like a nice casual break from other games. I immediately felt cheated. I have never wanted a refund so badly before. The feature of your descendants carrying on after you die sounded very cool, but the implementation is simply this: every time you start, you get to choose from only three characters with random traits and classes. The characters don't really have anything that ties them to the previous generation. Let's talk about the retro aspect of the game. What this means is it is very hard and repetitive. If I was playing with a controller, I would be constantly throwing it across the room. Progress is extremely slow and unrewarding. The worst part is, you cannot persistantly chip away at the game. Any progress can only be gained by massively successful rounds. This is because every time you upgrade your character, the cost increases. Combine this with the fact that every time you re-enter the castle, you forfeit all your gold. The impact of this game design choice is that you make ZERO progress over and over and over again, unless you have an amazing round. Then you are rewarded by increase perhaps one stat by 1 out of 100, or something like that. I cannot stress how much I hate this game.			"
