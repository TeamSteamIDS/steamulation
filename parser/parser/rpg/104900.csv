												Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game ""Orion"" where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.			"

												If this game was priced at $30+ I would say avoid it like the plague.If this game was priced at $20 I would say don't bother waiting for a sale.If this game was priced at $10 I would say just buy anything else.If this game was priced at $5 I would say you could buy lunch instead.If this game was priced at $1 I would say you have no reason not to own this.So what I'm saying is you have no reason not to own this. If you even get one hour of entertainment out of it from soley looking at some nice graphics and laughing at some bugs and glitches that was a dollar well spent. It beats the hell out of paying $70 for a AAA-title for the same effect. The devs know this is not the greatest game ever made, but they have made leaps and bounds in progress from the days when this was considered ""one of the worst games on Steam."" And for precisely this reason they have dropped the price so much. They want to redeem themselves. They want people to play their game and give it a chance. What are you waiting for, you heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? It's only a dollar. Play their game.			"

ORION: PreludeThis game is like junk food. You know it's not the best quality, you know that you have over a hundred better ways of spending your time, and that's excluding your vast library of games, but you...just...keep...playing.What is this game about? It's exactly what it looks like. You are going to shoot that raptor in the face. You are going to get in a big stompy mech and force-feed a T-Rex a rocket sandwich slathered with molten lead. You are going to pistol whip a pterodactyl that's been annoying you for half the wave.All of this, for less than it costs you to buy a soda.----Now, onto the useful bits of this review:This game is geared towards five and ten-player matches. While the game offers a wealth of game mode options, you are primarily going to be concerned with PvE content, or Conquest and Survival, both of which are co-op.Straight out of the door, you are equipped with a pistol, and absolutely nothing else. There is a minute of downtime each round in Survival/Conquest, in which you can buy weapons and augmentations for your character. Pistols will never run out of ammunition. Secondary weapons consist of SMGs and shotguns. Primary weapons are automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and burstfire rifles, all usually with some form of scope for ranged shooting.Augmentations are permanent upgrades for your character that you buy with credits from killing dinos. Three augmentations are specific to your class, while the rest beef you up as the going gets rough.There are three classes in this game: Assault, Support, and Recon. Assault players have access to a jetpack with a generous amount of energy to use to get in hard-to-reach spots. Support players are equipped with a Medigun, with the ability to heal (and, with an augmentation, repair) other players and vehicles, as well as the ability to self-heal with right-click. Recon players have access to cloaking devices, allowing you to shed off your attackers as you run like hell slink away into the darkness.Adrenaline weapons are power weapons, supposedly unique to each class. It is worth saving up the credits to get one, trust me.Progression. This game has progression for yourself, as well as your three classes. The more you play, the more permanent upgrades you get for them. Things like 10% higher jumps, available weapons on spawn in PvE modes, and so on.Now, here's the thing. This game is, for better and for worse, a tad wonky at times. The menus aren't snappy, the third-person animations are offensive (and, in the case of certain taunt packs, deliberately so), and the game isn't exactly Crysis 3. The game also has cosmetic microtransactions (gun skin, armor color/skin, silly hat, cape, and taunt pack), but the vast majority of the items available are as cheap as $1. You know, like an actual microtransaction. This would normally be a huge turn-off for me, but the game's price allows it some wiggle room.TL;DR: for the money spent, this game serves as a good distraction, especially if you're not fussed about a sci-fi shooter in which you reenact the meteor that extinct-ified everything.

UPDATE : ORION PRELUDEThere simply aren't enough games with dinosaurs & even fewer of these that are actually worth playing! For me, Orion: Prelude (O:P) is that rare exception. Although not much in way of a story in the game (no single player after all), there is quite a tale on how Orion came to be the game it is today...The short version is, that O:P is an evolution of previous Orion titles, Dino Horde & Dino Beatdown originally dating back to a successful 2011 Kickstarter campaign. Although recieving early criticism (that would normally kill a game ..dead.. disappearing into obscurity), the game continued to evolve with constant updates (big & small) over the years from the developers. Spiral stuck with it! This dedication & gradual refinement of the game has resulted in an excellent first-person co-op experience, with a well rounded collection of modes, weapons, enviromental effects, vehicles & more to enjoy. PvP isn't forgotten; it's also selectable. PvP feels more alike to a retro deathmatches, than a modern PvP (in a good way!), but I mainly enjoy the co-op modes. In co-op, you essentially have to defend your power core against waves of bloodthursty dinosaurs. Dinosaur kills will reward you credits, which you can use to buy perks & weapon upgrades, in-turn helping you survive the later, harder waves. Some waves also have you securing objectives. Co-op doesn't feel ultra competitive, most of the time you don't watch your credits/kills, rather finding yourself just having fun surviving & helping your teammates! I've found the community to generally be helpful & friendly in-game too.One of the real stand-out features in O:P has to be the enviromental effects randomly cycling on the alien world. From the day/night cycles to the extreme variety of climates & types of weather. Adds so much to the atmosphere. Couple this with excellent lighting effects through what seems to be a thicker atmosphere and the results can sometimes be spectacular! Even overwhelming! You definitely get that feeling when your final wave gets a night cycle with heavy rain .. you know you are gonna see an epic close quarter battle!Along with the awesome effects, there are 3 distinct classes to mix-up the gameplay. Each has unique strengths & each you can progress/level-up in online play to unlock starting weapons, power-ups & perks. Initial learning curve isn't steep, so once you get the hang of the basic flow it becomes very easy to sink multiple hours killing dinos! O:P rarely feels like a grind; even at lower levels (without a lot of perks) you competently kill dinos & gain good XP. Plenty of dinos to go around too :)If you can't find a friend to play with, there is also bot-support added in O:P to fill the ranks. This can be helpful to get playing quickly if server populations are low (which regrettably does happen).The trilogy of classes are well balanced (no need for any other classes), as is the gameplay in general. Difficulty is super scalable. Weapons are mainly shared between classes so quickly become familiar, and vehicles are easy to use & offer a good range of practical & destructive uses. Repetitive? Sure, to a degree, it is the same thing over & over and despite there being a lot of 'accessories' to the spice up the character classes & tactics, modes etc, there are not a huge number of maps for each mode. I expect this will change soon with Steam Workshop support being added.The A.I. generally employed by the dinosaurs is a fairly basic 'rush' tactic, which can feel pretty predictable (there are a few surprises though), but I find the larger dino numbers to counteract this limitation to a degree anyway. There are also the occasional technical glitches like querky physics (flying Stegosaurus anyone?) or clipping inside a dinosaur. Nothing game-breaking that I have experienced, but sure does make for some funny moments! Just like my many failed attempts at some of the more creative 'Ride a Dino for 10secs' & 'Slap T-Rex 100 times' achievements :)O:P reminds me a bit of those classic, simple shooters like a Serious Sam or Left 4 Dead, but with a bit of high-tech sci-fi flavor. This future-tech feel across the game contradicts the jurassic era dinosaurs & remote wilderness landscapes nicely! O:P is not as complex mechanically or technically when compared to a top end AAA FPS, but its simplicity is also its underlying strength. It is great value ($1!), has strong replayability and the focused, balanced gameplay (some bonus ..ahem.. querks) offers a truely fun & intense, dino killin' co-operative survival experience! Too much to read? Yeah ok then (fair call lol)..  I'll let Dave Chappelle quickly summarise what O:P is really all about:

												The Metacritic score is misleading. That was for Dino Beatdown, not for Horde.The game has been changed a lot since the days of Beatdown. From the original 3, it has been updated to 10 different dinosaurs. 4 of which are playable in a game mode. Balancing patches, as well as optimization patches have been implemented and the game now runs like butter on my computer. There's a combonation of 50+ weapons and gear, customization of armor color and hats and other cosmetics. The Developers have been working their asses off making this game as fun as possible and it paid off.So, what is this game like? Halo + Turok + Killing Floor. You've got your standard pistols, machineguns and shotguns and then you get your rocket launchers, laser guns and heavy weapons. Each class has their own special abilities like Jetpacks, cloaking and healing beams, all which can be augmented to be more effective. You can also level your classes for better performance like in Killing Floor which lifts the burden of having to buy certain augments and use that money for other things. You've got player vs dinosaurs, player vs player dinosaurs, player vs player, player vs harder dinosaur waves and Conquest which is coming up soon.My only gripes right now with it are the animations being a little rough, dinosaurs can be a little derpy and the music is the same in EVERY map. I know that old music from Beatdown will be implemented once Conquest rolls out, but not sure if that's just for the Conquest maps or for all the maps.But other than that, it's a pretty great game that has my full love.

												Seriously, if you were paying 0.99$ for it, then why are you expecting a 29.99$ game ?As lots of you may have known that there are some bugs and immature 3D imaging issues, including shooting delay and broken graphics, but I actually have had a lot of fun in it.Killing dinos with friends is simply fun, with various choices of maps and gameplay mode. If you don't see it as a dedicated gun game, you'll probably make it easier to enjoy.In short, personally, paying 0.99$ for a 200-hrs+ game, that was just worth enough to me. Would like to see how this game improve in the future.ORION: Prelude[7/10]			"

												Ah yes, Orion: Prelude, or as it will always be known to me, Orion: Dino Horde! This game has been quite criticized through the years (and in all honestly quite rightly so). they game if filled with bugs and lots of tedious grinding achievements. Still, despite all that I can't help but to love it. In fact it is the only game which I haven't uninstalled after reaching 100%.So, there's no story to follow in this game and it's a pretty straightforward king of game. You're dropped as one of three classes (assault, recon and support) into a base where you're supposed to defend a generator against incoming waves of attacking dinos that don't enjoy your presence there. If all teammates dies or the generator is destroyed (a timer starts when it reaches 0% health and if it isn't repaired before time runs out it's destroyed) you all loose. If you survive all waves (10 for normal games and 30 for conquest games) then you win. Pretty simple. To your help you can buy a quite big assortment of weapons and perks and each class comes with a specific perk of their own (assault can jetpack, recon can cloak and support can heal).This game has a lot of various pvps but there are only a couple which I really enjoy such as king of the hill and team elimination. The place where this game really shines is in regular Survival mode when you play together with a good, tight and cooperative team. This is where this game is at it's best! I don't think I've made as many friends in any game as I've made in this one.So, in conclusion, if you want a good cooperative game and don't mind a few bugs here and there and can either ignore, or work through all the grinding achievements then yes, you will enjoy this game!

												It's bad... In the best way possible. Will Dinohorde go down in history as an innovative piece of gaming? Not in any sense of the phrase. Will it be remembered for its cutting edge graphics, intuitive gameplay or captivating story? Negative. What you will remember about Dinohorde is the unreasonable amount of fun you will have playing it with a few of your best gaming buddies. Its difficult to describe why, and it might just be how ridiculous the whole thing is, but Dinohorde is one of the most fun games I've played in 2014. The quality isn't quite there but you won't regret dropping a couple dollars on this inexplicable gem.			"

												Some advice:1) Kill the flying jerks first. The larger ones can pick you up and drop you out of the sky. Very disconcerting.2) If you get picked up by a large flying jerk, melee it. It will drop you.3) T-Rex's can 360 no-scope you with rocks. Keep your rear end in motion.4) Save up your dough and buy the greedy perk first. Then buy stopping power. Life gets easier after that.5) When you buy this game - and you should buy this game - remember that stealing your teammate's speeder bike is a big no-no.6) Keep the generators up and running. Because reasons. Also because the game will end if it stays offline too long.7) The vampire perk is gross but cool.8) T-Rex's that 360 no-scope you with rock throws... Did I mention that? Pretty sure I mentioned that...			"

TLDR version;Co-op or versus horde mode shooter with dinosaurs. Some bugs and lacks polish, but for its price (50 Euro Cents thereabout?) this is a shockingly FUN game.  If you're looking for a co-op game to play with up to four other friends, I'm giving this game a glowing recommendation!In a bit more detail:What's good: Dirt cheap Large maps with obvious inspiration from the Halo games Surprising amount of depth thanks to the three classes, gear choices, augments and vehicles Competent and frantic horde mode gameplay Dinosaurs Silly wavesWhat's bad: Some obvious bugs here and there Some nice shaders and lighting effects but ultimately not a great looking game, player models in particular are butt ugly Poor volume normalization, you'll know what I mean when you hear the gatling guns fire Solo play with  pretty basic bots is supported but feels very lacklustreVerdict:I'm quite frankly blown away at how many hours of very entertaining horde mode shooter action my friends and I have had with this game already, value for money wise I don't think I've ever seen any game quite like this.  As such I can't recommend this game enough.  If you compare 'ORION: Prelude' to 'Killing Floor 2' it doesn't hold a candle of course, but that would be silly, wouldn't it ?  I love this game! "

												OLD REVIEW IS OLD. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING TO UPDATE IT BECAUSE I'M A LAZY ♥♥♥First off: Metacritic score is wrong as it's for the previous game ""Dino Beatdown"". Now, let's go with the review:The game is awesome, I've never seen a dev team update a game this much. Since release they added lots of weapons, maps, game modes, dinosaurs...Sure, it's rough around the edges and some things could use some improvement, but the overall experience is good. Really good.Just imagine a team of space marines flying around and shooting at dinosaurs in various settings, jungle, forest, desert, you can even shoot dinos in the snow now!The game modes add a lot of variety to the game, there's Survival (where you have to defend a base against the horde), Rampage (classic survival, just stay alive) or Conquest. Conquest is the newest game mode and it's like Survival x10, multiple bases, open world, day-night cycles...Then there's the PvP for all you guys tired of shoot at dinos, you can shoot your former teammates or even challenge them into a duel (1v1 pvp mode) where you use laser swords to kill each other like the Jedi.Oh, and there's this game mode where you can play as the dinos. From the Spinosaurus to the Compy.There's level progression too, leveling up unlocks starting weapons and habilities like, for example, in Killing Floor.I give it a 8/10, really fun and addictive.

												Many people asked me about the game „Orion: Dino Horde“. So I have written a review now. ^^First I have to say that the game has just 36/100 Metascore. But the Metascore was for the game ""Dino Beatdown"", not for ""Orion: Dino Horde"" and the game hasn’t only changed the name, its totally different now.For many people it’s still not a good game, because of a not perfect graphic (uff.. for me the graphic looks alright – I would give for it 7/10 points. – You can take a look at my Screenshots), some bugs (really the most Shooter Multiplayer Games have bugs/glitches…) and the not so realistic weapon sounds or I DON’T KNOW WHY!Really… I LOVE THIS GAME! For me it’s like a mix out of “Primal Carnage” (Jurassic Park Style) and “Killing Floor” plus you have more possibilities in this game. The aim of the game depends on the mission you choose (but in general it’s about shooting dinosaur (1st Person shooting view / 3rd Person Hybrid Gameplay), surviving and protecting the base).Possible Game Modes: Slaughter (lots of enemies)Survival (protecting base, activating objects and surviving the growing waves of dinosaur)Rampage (like in “Primal Carnage” there are 2 teams “Dinosaurs” and “Humans” who play against each other and switch after that)1v1 Duel • Team Duel • Team Elimination • Free for all Duel • King of the Hill • Instagib • Conquest • Gun GameYou can play it solo, friendsonly (Co-op) or public (Multiplayer).You can choose the difficulty (Noob, Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, Redikulous) you want to play and one out of 40+ possible maps!During the game you earn Credits to buy other weapons (50+ weapons, Tech & Gear) and (depending on the game mode) you can also use 7 different vehicles.But you also earn EXP with killing dinosaur which increases your level. Yeah your level – there is also a level system in this game and the different human classes have all unique abilities.Classes:Assault He has a Jetpack which makes him able to fly for a while (That’s freaking awesome! It’s so funny when the T-Rex is really nearly to eat you and you just fly away BYE BYE T-REX lol). But back to the topic the Assault starts with a CV-10 Pistol (better weapons you get with killing and purchasing). His Grenade is “Frag Grenade”.Recon The Recon has the ability to use his cloak which makes him invisible for the enemies for some seconds. He starts with the CV-10 Silenced Pistol and uses the EMP Grenades.Support The Supporter people have medic guns. They can heal themselves or other teammates whenever they want but they really need it because they can’t just fly away. They start with the M-40 Magnum and have Smoke Grenades. I like those Smoke Grenades because when you get into trouble with the Supporter because you have to reload your weapon but you can’t - because too many dinosaur are attacking you - and you are just healing yourself the whole time, it’s possible to throw such a Smoke Grenade and the dinosaur run away. Good time for reloading and healing. ^^Back to the level system:You unlock more abilities with a higher level (for example less fall damage or more jump height). The current maximum reachable level is 50. Achievements: Oh it’s just HEAVEN for achievement hunters! There are 250+ achievements and the most of them are not that hard to get. There is really for everything an achievement.. for kills with all weapons, healing, flying, riding, surviving and and and.So all in all.. what should I say… this game offers much and makes a lot of fun! Sure it’s not perfect (e. g. weapon sound isn’t realistic) but who cares.. which game is really that realistic? In Left for Dead 2 you can shoot through a wall but not through a TENT! LOL So I tell you to give this game a try and maybe you join my games and we smash those dinosaur together! ^.~			"

												Orion: Prelude is the revised version of Orion: Dino Horde, which itself, is a revised version of Orion: Dino Beatdown. Confusing, isn't it?Orion: Dino Beatdown; the original, was a terrible game that launched as an alpha, with terrible netcode, and justly received a Metacritic rating of 36. Ironically, if you check the Metacritic rating, it'll be for Orion: Dino Horde. Apparently Metacritic hasn't received word from the developer that they've changed the name yet again.But enough about how Spiral Game Studios keeps trying to reinvent the game by renaming it and patching problems that should have been fixed at release; what is the game like? Orion: Prelude is a team-based, cooperative, sci-fi, wave-based, FPS where your goal is to kill dinosaurs and complete objectives. The game is essentially what you'd get if you took Killing Floor and Halo and mixed them together. It's borrows Killing Floor's wave-based combat, where every kill gives you money to better arm yourself, and every wave gets progressively harder; and it borrows from Halo in the Shield mechanic, the vehicular combat, (although this could be atributable to other games as well) and the overall look of the game.Up to five players can play together on a single server. Within the game, there are three classes which further distinguish your role from the role of the other four players. The classes are Assault, Support, and Recon. While I'd normally explain in depth the differences between these classes, I can't because there really isn't much of a reason. If you're playing this game, you're playing it in either Survival or Conquest. Sure, there are other gamemodes to choose from, but they're all variations of standard PvP gamemodes that exist in better incarnations in other games, so you'd be better served playing them there. If you bought this game, you bought it for the dinosaurs, which means it's Survival or Conquest for you. In that case, pick Assault if you want to kill things, and pick Support if you want to keep teammates alive. There's no reason to pick Rogue in these gamemodes. It seems as though the developers made it for PvP only, as in Survival and Conquest, it suffers greatly.The differences between the classes really come down to the single class skill you get at spawn. The Assault class gets a jetpack ability which can be improved by purchasing augments. (more on this later) The Support class gets access to a medigun which can heal a player, and with the proper augment, replenish their ammo supply. The Rogue class can turn invisible which can act as an effective temporary invulnerability, as all Dinosaurs will immediately de-aggro from you and never attack you while stealthed. Those are the differences. There's also some weapon differences, but all weapons can be bought by purchasing an augment that allows you to purchase class restricted weapons.What are these augments I keep referring to? Just like in Killing Floor, at the end of a wave which is usually around 20-30 dinosaurs, you have a minute to buy weapons or augments at their respective shops. Weapons are divided into four categories: primary weapons, secondary weapons, pistols, and Adrenaline weapons. Primary weapons are your standard rifles, LMG's, and Sniper Rifles. Secondary Weapons are SMG's and shotguns. Pistols are pistols, and Adrenaline weapons are class-specific weapons.Augments provide boosts to your character's fighting ability; from double jumping to boost jumping, to additional armor. There's even an augment which allows you to feast upon dinosaur corpses for health which sounds neat, but is utterly worthless. While Augments are important, there's really a select few which are far and away better than the rest which you'll find yourself buying in the same order every game, irrespective of what class you are. There are a few class-specfic augments which I alluded to earlier, but most of the desired ones are shared amongst the classes.Onto the dinosaurs. There are tiny dinosaurs like Compies, medium sized dinosaurs like Raptors and some larger spitting dinosaur, then there are large Dinosaurs like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, and of course, the T-Rex. Instead of being smart and making the large dinosaurs the primary objective of the game, the entire game focuses around killing the small dinosaurs, because the waves are determined by a specific number of dinosaurs that spawn, not the type of dinosaur. A dinosaur killed is a dinosaur killed no matter what type it is. So your best bet is to just kill all of the easy-to-kill dinosaurs, and leave the large ones alive to clean up after the wave has ended, assuming you don't have anything pressing to buy. This is the main gripe I have with the game. The main pull of the game, fighting giant dinosaurs, has been relegated to a mere distraction and nothing more. If you stop and spend time killing the large dinosaurs, you're opening yourself up to a whole lot more damage by the smaller raptors.When I refer to the large dinosaurs as distractions, I really mean annoyances. They'll hone in on one particular player, then constantly harass that player until one of the two dies. The T-Rex is especially annoying because it has this weird snare effect when it's damaging you which prevents you from getting away from it, so you just get caught and repeatedly bitten until you go down.When you lose all of your health, the game borrows the downed system from Left 4 Dead, where you can be helped up. I say they borrowed it because it seems to be a combination of the system from Left 4 Dead and Payday. Your character can fall three times. If it falls a fourth time, you're dead and can only respawn next wave. Killing a dinosaur while downed gives you a second wind, or you can be helped up by another player.The graphics are shockingly mediocre. It seriously looks like Halo 2 on Xbox circa 2004. The Source Engine has never looked as dated as this in a long time. The character models are all low poly count, and the environments are all bland and uninspired. They are large, so there's plenty of blandness to go around.Overall, Orion: Prelude is exactly what you'd expect it to be; a bland cooperative shooter which has no identity of its own. The developers apparently tried to ride off of the novelty of players fighting dinosaurs in a sci-fi setting, but the game requires more than that. On top of that, there's something rather deceptive about trying to hide your failure by re-releasing the game under a different name, as if to try and avoid that ugly metacritic rating.The game is nothing more than Orion: Dino Beatdown, just patched to be a working copy of it, rather than a buggy, laggy mess that shouldn't have been released. All these complaints aside, the game will provide you with a few hours of entertainment before the repitition and realization that all of these gameplay choices have been pulled from more successfull games. Considering that at the time of this review, the game is being sold on Steam for $1, with a 4-pack of it costing a grand total of $3, I struggle to think of another Steam title which you can get several hours of entertainment for four people, for just $3. Perhaps in that regard, Orion: Dino Beatdown/Dino Horde/Prelude succeeds.			"

												This game has made its way through my friends list like a sneaky case of cheap herpes. We all seem to have ended up with it somehow and now that we have it, we're stuck with it forever. Some of us were ashamed to have acquired it, so we thought we'd feel less lonely in our shame by giving it to someone else. Although the game is about as glamorous as herpes, it has turned out to be far more enjoyable. I won't defend the technical quality of the game (it is herpes after all), but I will defend its entertainment value. A survival co-op based on killing dinosaurs with cool guns and vehicles is just good fun. The gameplay is perfectly fine and lends itself well to many hours of pleasurable dino-slaying with a group of fellow herpes victims. The game even offers various ways of enjoying your herpes: several game modes that change things up and offer a good time even when you aren't in the mood for survival co-op. So the next time you see this on sale for a dollar, and think to yourself, ""I don't wanna join the destitute of Steam and engage in this nasty transmission of cheap fun,"" remind yourself that you probably have some variant of herpes in real life, and you shouldn't be such a judgmental, pretentious, snob who can't put aside petty scruples in the name of good fun. Buy the game when its on sale (don't you dare pay full price for herpes), and come join us.			"

												After 3 years and 3 Steam releases, I expected an improvement on the controversial game I had heard so much about.First released as Orion: Dino Beatdown for $15, then Orion: Dino Horde which dropped to $1, and now Orion: Prelude which has recently gone Free-to-Play. This is where I entered the picture.I had first heard about this game with such catchy headlines as ""The Worst Video Game EVER!"" and ""Is Orion: Prelude still the Worst Game Ever?"". I then saw trailers which showed the game in its new polished state and heard the feedback stating it was ""the best turn-around in video game history!"". Outside of these he-said/she-said discusions I didn't pay much attention to this game. ""It's Halo with Dinosaurs"" they said, ""Nonsense!"" I'd say. It wasn't until the game literally screamed ""I'm free now, please play me! It would be very nice if you would play me!""So I did, and while a awaited the game's download I decided to research the critisim of this game. What I saw was a buggy unfinished mess, multiple instances of theft of video game assets by the developers, and radical reactions to negative feedback by the creator. But that was for the older versions of the game, right?What I played in Prelude, and what I saw in Dino Beatdown/Horde, I could not distinguish. I really like the idea of this game and I wish it all worked, but ultimately the game lacks polish: it's horribly optimized, animations are amateur at best, Ai is atrocious, and weapon handling is nonexistant.The saddest part is, it seems this game will never be improved because the developers refuse any meaningful critisim and/or are incapable of coding a better functioning game. They have big plans ahead, but I don't know how they can realize them if they can't manage to properly make this.Try the game if you want, you're free to do so, but as someone who wanted to like this game I warn you of what I have experienced.EDIT:In light of some recent criticism I have decided to put a bit more time into this game,but my recommendation stays the same.To put into perspective: You hear your friend talking about this guy but all he keeps saying is how much of an ***hole he is. You think to yourself ""he can't be that bad"". Then you finally meet him and the first thing he does is slap you across the face. Do you stick around to see how many more times he hits you?This is a bad game, there is nothing objective about that. Programing is bad, animations are sometimes nonexistant, and it's difficult to run on some of the best computers. ""Can you still have fun with it?"" Of course you can! There is nothing stopping you from enjoying a bad game. I myself enjoy several bad games. That does not excuse the corners that this game has cut.There is a difference between a good game and a game that you as an individual can enjoy. Because I and many others do not enjoy this game, that does not render our opinions irrelevent.You Are Allowed To Like Bad Games! but after the amount of time I have played I cannot recommend this game.

												What can I say about ORION: Prelude? Let's start with what it's not...It's not a perfect game.It's not 100% bug-free.It's not a contender for Game Of The Year.But more importantly, let's go on to what it is...It's extremely fun.It's very well supported.It's extremely fun.It's got a great community.It's extremely fun.It's amazing value for money.Did I mention that it's extremely fun?For the price, you wouldn't believe that this is a fully-fledged multiplayer FPS with solid progression, numerous weapons and power-ups, a decent array of vehicles and goddam dinosaurs to gun down! But that's exactly what it is. You probably won't put hundreds of hours into it but it certainly doesn't feel like a £0.79p / $0.99c game. In fact, I reckon this is the single best value for money of any game in my entire collection. I've certainly got my 79p worth and then some - and I still keep coming back for more!If you like multiplayer FPS and you're not literally penniless, why are you still reading this review? At this price, just buy it already!			"

												Over the years this game has been bashed as one of the worst games to be released on steam, however now I'd say get it.For £0.79 game the graphics look like they are from a game costing £30, and the weather effects you get on your helmet is a nice addtion too, the main enemys in this game are dinosaurs and there are 7 of them and 2 flying reptiles and a giant Crocodile, all 10 of them feel unquie and fun to fight against.You can get vechicles in this game, theres the average jeep with turret, a jet and a tank, but best of all theres a MECH! YES A MECH YOU CAN FIGHT A TREX WITH A MECH! All of the vechicles are great to drive and are really helpful overall.Game breaking glitches like map glitches or crashes are very rare in this game, the only one I can think of is where you can leave a map by playing as a flying reptile or playing Assault with the jetpack and fly above the boundires, luckly this is only on one map and it's unplayed often.However this game does have a few downsides....1. A lot of weapon clipping, sound glitches and firing glitches, most noticeable with the default pistol, duo pistols and using reload speed upgrade.2. Ragdolls are really glitchy at times, however more tame then any from the Source engine.3. Playing as Dinosaurs is nearly impossible with the terrible camara angle and controls.4. Soundtrack is really stock.5. Small, but very friendly commuintyOverall the game is much more better then it orignally was, a fun CO-OP horde game to play with your friends!			"

ORION: Prelude is worth a look. It sells for 0,79€. I’d say the price is right. I’d also say the price point is probably another move by the developer to try and earn back some brownie points. It’s a fun little time waster and I can see it being a good game to play with friends over a few drinks.  Glitching through a building you have just climbed on to might be funny then.			"

												Yes, buy this game. Its Killing floor + Halo + Turok. It has its flaws, but the devs seem devoted and are present on the steam forums. If you played this game in beta and not again(like me) give it another shot, it is now playable(LoL) and quite awesome. The difference is uncanny. I reinstalled it yesterday and I'm already level 11. It never felt like grinding.Buy a four pack, get some friends who will play installed and have a blast together. For me the biggest con is the limited players. That easy to solve though, buy and play this WAY under priced game.			"

 About ORION: Prelude Prelude is a FPS where you primarily defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops, but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar but perhaps not much more. GraphicsLooks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, bot costumes -> horrific. Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.The GameplayI've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you.One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can for some reason accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.All in All ORION: Prelude is a really good Dinosaur-Action Game!8/10 From MeSweep	 "

Good graphics, no story mode(single player), 5 different difficulties, pvp and co-op mods, three classes and many equipments to choose from, vehicles, simple serverlists, simple level system that rewards you boosts, ''starting weapons'' and more.

												This game is a lot of fun, just know what you are getting. First, it costs $.99, and if that's too much wait for it to go on sale for $.49! Yes, the bots on your team are incredibly dumb, but they manage to get a few kills. Yes, there are some glitches and unpolished aspects, but this game is a lot of fun! The co-op is just great. My buddy drives, running down the smaller dinos, while I man the gun and go for the bigger ones. Great times... It is well worth the price (either price) if you get some friends to buy it too (don't think I'd care to just play solo). At that price, just buy it for your friends and make them play it!			"

												I have to say...when i first saw the reviews for this game a year ago, I avoided it deliberately. However, the developers didn't just sit on their asses while they got bad reviews. ""Games don't fail, only developers do"" (love that quote because it's so true). They did something about it, and now I find myself buying this game for my friends who aren't fortunate enough to experience this wonderful FPS.This game mixes dinosaurs, Team Fortress 2, and Halo. The skins are cool, the taunts are hilarious, the gameplay is a dimond in the rough, and it's only a dollar! So if you ever find yourself with a dollar after buying an expensive game, I would strongly recommend getting this game, because it may be better than the one you just purchased.			"

												Long story short ORION: Prelude (Competitive PvP) was the original game announced in 2010, a spiritual successor to the ORION: Source Beta. It was not able to release due to a series of events and we had to focus on a smaller scaled experience. This was called Dino Beatdown (Open World Co-Op). It was a disaster and so we continued to work on improving it using the revenue made and the next massive chunk was ORION: Dino Horde (Arena PvP, Duel). With the success of Dino Horde we were finally were able to deliver the experience originally promised (Prelude) back in 2010. And then some - considering the original Prelude was to be strictly PvP and only have three game modes (CTF, Vital, Deathmatch) compared to it's modern day predecessor (15 game modes and a variety of play styles). Comparison:Original Prelude / Modern Prelude3 Modes / 15 Modes5 Dinosaurs / 10 Dinosaurs (All Playable)30 Weapons&Gear / 50 Weapons&Gear5 Multiplayer Maps / 20+ Multiplayer Maps & SDKIt is now called ORION: Prelude because it *finally* is ORION: Prelude.You can read the full story here:http://artistryingames.com/spiraling-control-incredible-journey-spiral-game-studios/ "

 It's A Trap! Don't get confused, this game was actually called Orion: Dino Beatdown... And then called Orion: Dino Horde a year later. Hell if you were to open up the SteamApps folder, the main game folder is STILL called ""Orion Dino Beatdown."" Why the name changes? Well to hide all the negative reviews and feedback! The Devs have FINALLY updated the store page about this info. (Not exactly sure when they actually added it, but it's good to see they did.)""*Previous version names include ORION: Dino Beatdown (2012) and ORION: Dino Horde (2013).""The company Trek Industries (who used to be called 'Spiral Game Studios') fired the original Dev team, just before the release of the game, and did NOT pay them. On top of that, it has been proven multiple times on assets that were ""Stolen"" or purchasing assets and ""Flipping"" them to try and make a profit. *cough* TOON LEVELS *cough* They also tend to remove or ban any users that complain about problems the game has. They abandoned this game, is has issues that need to be fixed, but instead went onto making a ""new"" version of this game. Extra bonus though! Their new game got removed because Activision claimed a DMCA takedown and threatening to sue Trek Industries for stealing assets from Call of Duty Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare. (since been brought back on.)I will leave a link to all the juicy info here - https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/Now for the actual game.It sucks. It's a poorly designed and unbalanced horde mode/pvp game. The graphics are god awful and jump around in quality all over the place. The audio is horrible. Even turning off ALL sounds some sounds still play and are extremely loud. The FPS is all over the place depending on the maps and what's going on. Rain and lots of grass/plants will also drop the FPS to a low 10 or lower. The weapons are ok, but some suffer from impute lag and animation lag. Sometimes the gun will fire 1 or 2 seconds after you click the button, other times the actual animation is 1-2 seconds off from the actual shooting (you shoot when you clicked and see the pellets/bullets flying, but the animation starts a second later and looks really bad. Found that shotguns were the biggest offender for this.)Half the maps look like they were built from the ground up. They all are basically the same, just with different colors. They all play in ""canyon"" style maps, and either have a forest or desert aesthetic to them. The other half, like the ""Toon"" maps are straight out of an Asset Store, and don't really fit in with the game. They are just shoved in the game just to boast on having ""more content.""Playing as a human is super easy. All you have to do to avoid most damage is jump up onto a ledge high enough and nothing can touch you for the most part. The AI will either run around in circles, or sit below you letting you get easy kills. You can't play as dinosaurs unless you play PVP online (which no one plays anymore and I don't blame them.)The driving vehicles in this game suck. They either have poor handling, or act like they are driving on ice all the time, or get stuck on/in something too easily.The game uses Steam Workshop... BUT it's not in the main game. If you want that, you have to go into the BETA! Yes that's right, they never finished the game properly. They shoved stuff into a BETA and left the game to work on their next game.Looking for easy Achievements? NOPE NOT HERE! Avoid this! This has PAINFUL grindy achievements. Get 1,000 kills with each weapon. Fly around on your jetpack for 5 hours. Play each game mode 100 times (There is 15 gamemodes, so a Minimum of 1,500 games have to be played.) Kill 50k Dinosaurs. Get picked up 1,000 times. Spend 10,000,000 Credits. Find 1,000 Loot Crates. Spend 1 Game Year in the Arctic... Sounds like fun?This game also contains a ""cosmetic store"" that costs REAL money to buy the token credits to purchase hats/masks/helmets (all look terrible,) or armor/weapon color skins. Even some taunt packs were available to purchase, but as you would guess, the animation is top quality.Pros:- It's got Dinosaurs in it.- And weapons- Steam CardsCons:- Everything about the Devs and the bullchit they have done.- Everything about the game- Painful grindy achievementsYou see people, there is a reason why the game costs $0.50 most of the time! Don't let these guys trick you! It's not worth it! It's a trap!*I know some people will say I jumped on the hate bandwagon... But honestly I hated my old review and felt like re-doing it.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  ORION: PreludeDeveloper:  Spiral Game StudiosPublisher:  TREK IndustriesGenre:  First /Third Person ShooterGeneral ImpressionORION: Prelude could quite possibly be the most affordable game that involves both dinosaur hunting and multiplayer fun. It is definitely best played with a few friends by your side. The singleplayer mode features some pretty worthless bots so don’t expect much help from the AI. Graphics are a sight to behold, even with the occasional glitch popping in. The sheer diversity of weaponry and vehicles at your disposal as well as the dinosaur themselves, will have you entertained for hours on end while the inclusion of both Achievements and Trading Cards seems the perfect cherry on top, to an already great deal.Strong Points+ Beautiful  graphics.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.+ Great price for what it offers.+ MP mode is quite enjoyableWeak Points- Lack of tutorials and a storyline.- SP mode is less fun since the bots’ AI is weak.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

Don't expect much from this $1.00 game, its not bad but that doesnt mean its a great game. It has customization for your characters, three different classes each with their own abilites as well as enough weapons to make you want to keep playing just to try them outI was honestly surprised that we even played this game for as long as we did.

												Short review: It's Killing Floor with dinosaurs and I absolutely love it.Longer review: Despite a bumpy start upon release and many updates, this game was developed into something great. You essentially fight wave upon wave of dinosaurs while obtaining credits (in-game currency). Using credits to purchase player upgrades, weapons, vehicles and useful items. Some gamemodes include a generator you must defend and other objectives.Nothing really feels over-powered but you will notice that player weapons seem a little more powerful than vehicle weapons. I really only use vehicles to turtle myself and/or as a light defense for the generator. Player vs player battles can be fun but it's easy to take someone out with even mediocre weapons.My only real negative for this game is vehicles are way too squishy to larger dinosaurs. A tank takes no more then 3-4 hits before being destroyed and yet can take dozens of hits from smaller dinosaurs before being destroyed. In a way, I appreciate it because it forces you to compromise. I'm all about compromises, it keeps things interesting. See? The only negative I have about this game I honestly turned it into a positive. Overall, I had a lot of fun.You'd think flying dinosaurs would be annoying and impossible but they're well balanced.Similarly to Killing Floor, every new experience level gives you a small reward like spawning with upgrades, weapons or items. A max level player can spawn with a full loadout of weapons and upgrades. Useful for higher difficulties so obtaining experience and gaining levels is actually worth your while. It's not terribly grindy either, you can reach level 25 in a day. Level 70 is max level.Pros:Well balanced gameplay.Wide variety of things to purchase (with in-game currency).Multiple gamemodes.Decent graphics with nice filters and effects.Large maps that range from canyons to open plains.Many different weapons.Useful voice commands.Rewards at each new experience level (Level 70 is max).Nice sound effects and environment sounds.Cons:Vehicle weapons are slightly weaker than player weapons. The difference is subtle but noticeable. Every game that does this has driven me nuts.Bots will occassionally get stuck on rocks or other objects when running toward objectives.Some objectives have too many dinosaurs which can drag it out for some time... Standing on the point and shooting the occasional compy or raptor until all 300 dinosaurs are dead. This confuses new players who think it's a glitch. It's not a glitch, the point just has too many dinosaurs in the spawn queue.Neutral:PreludeBots aren't always helpful but they're good at being punching bag defenders for the generator.AI is somewhat predictable but it can be fun to take down hordes upon hordes.TREX rock throw ability is OP but that also keeps things interesting. Dodging is easy enough.Vehicles are easily destroyed by large dinosaurs. But this makes it more balanced, I think.I once hid behind a rock from a TREX and then I saw a jeep hurdling past me. Classic Jurassic Park moment. 9/10			"

There are wide valleys/arenas to play in and you mainly need to protect your power generator (base) from the mighty dinosaurs! Occasionally you must conquer outer bases (by simply standing there for a few seconds) and from time to time one or more Big Dinosaurs will be spawned like the Triceratops, T-Rex or the usually quiet (and herbivorous...) Brontosaurus and stegosaurus as kind of boss enemies.Between every wave you can purchase inside your base new abilities and weapons (with ingame credits, this isn't a pay-to-win, absolutely), tools, automated turrets and so on. Parked near outer bases you will find different kind of vehicles you can use to drive over dinosaurs or shoot at them (this depends whether it has a machinegun already or not).There are more game modes including the classic ones as deathmatch and capture the flag.This game is strongly recommended for Co-op gaming or online gaming but if you don't want to you can still play on your own sidekicked by bots. It won't be the same but better than nothing. Actually I'm playing on my own because my friends refuse to play with it as they say it simply sucks. And they're not totally mistaken actually. I like the game but it's not... well, let's say ""polished"".The first thing is the Engine. Orion Uses The Omnipresent Unreal Engine But I guess it has been abused or badly optimized because in my laptop it runs as if it was the Cryengine 12, I had to set almost everything off and Mid-Low details to get a decent framerate... And I agree, my laptop is not a Top-Gaming gear, but it's an i5 with 8Gb RAM and Geforce 840M. It can run better games with way better details. Even the cursor in the main menu is kind of stuttering.Apart from the technical issues the worlds are quite nice and pleasant to see. The real problem is the confusing aspect when The dinosaurs kick in. I understand it has to be difficult, and dinosaurs must camouflage themselves but it really looks kind of confusing.But still I personally like the game. Sure, this isn't a masterpiece, but the ideas are good, the game himself is fun for me and I really love the epic musics, which is somehow unexpected. I like the gameplay, the classes, the jetpack and cloacking device, the Dino mode... Because you can play as a dinosaur and go around eating human players as well! XDI personally see some potential in this team.+++PROs+++ MUSIC. This was really unexpected, all the music themes are very beautiful and intense orchestral tracks, with epic tones and quiet tunes. There aren't many tracks unfortunately, but they're really good, and I perlonally love them. CHEAP. I usually never consider the price of a game because some people have the money and never care and other people like me are quite broke. Personally I never care too much about it because I always wait a year or two for a game to lower its price and then go into full sale until it has such a ridiculous price that even I can afford it XD. And here, with this game, I've found the biggest offer ever: 4-pack at 0,99€!  DINOSAURS!!! I'm not the kind of guy that goes full hype as soon as I see a dinosaur but Honestly this is really a breath of fresh air considering the abused Zombie themed games... This is a reason good enough to appreciate the game... Or the developers at the very least...---CONs--- BAD OPTIMIZED ENGINE. This game uses The Unreal Engine, and it's quite clear considering the landscapes and the evel of details in the environment. But it looks to me quite badly optimized as it's quite stuttering and resource-demanding, even for my laptop which has been able to handle much more demanding games. CONFUSED. I'm not sure this is something wanted or something just badly designed, but the look of ambience and enemies is quite confusing: I mean it's hard to see the enemies in certain grassy environments and this is kind of discouraging. REPETITIVE. There are just a bunch of dinosaurs species, always the same. At least there are different and various game modes that help with that.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												So here is my review on this game. I was a bit confused when I first bought this game. EVERY review said this game was trash, worthless and not even worth playing even if it was free. Almost all reviews gave this game a 1/10, but since it was only 99 cents I figured why not give it a try.Then I started to play it with a friend of mine and I was amazed! It uses the unreal engine so it lacks graphics. Also the physics are quite terrible. However, if you look at the other aspects of this game, this is probably the most amazing zerg game that exists.The game offers A LOT of achievements. For every achievement run player this game is worth it even if it was 10 euro's. It offers great co-op gameplay with many different gameplay options. It's like risk or rain for example. The graphics are terrible but the game offers a system that makes it fun to replay the game, get achievements, unlock abilities and progress every run. For everyone that is not a graphics or storyplayer (read casual), this game is a MUST buy!One big thing with this game is the online play. So many people hate it and don't understand the great features of this game that the online play lacks quite a bit. It's hard to find a proper server with random people, so it's easier to play with people you know. I must agree, this game certainly isn't the best game in several aspects, but I'm still able to get a great amount of fun with the replay system. Get achievement, level you character and progress every time you restart a map.Also, another great thing about this game is the updates. DLC? What is dlc? ORION doesn't know the term DLC. If you buy this game you don't buy half a game that gets filled with ""updates"" like most games. ""You want to have additional maps or weapons? Sure, but you'll have to pay us another 5 euro's to get those items."" A normal way of selling a products in the game industry these days. ORION doesn't give a s**t. This is probably the most updated game there is atm and it won't cost you a single dime. It's all FREE, like it always was, until someone decided that everything had to be paid for. This is a complete game and it grows bigger every time there's an update. It might not be popular, but atleast ORION is a company that cares about their product, rather then screwing over the player base.Overall, this game gives a great amount of fun. Don't buy this game if you are either a casual, a storyline based player or a player that requires good graphics. For everyone else and especially the hardcore gamer that likes to complete the full game (100%, progress runs) this game is highly recommended.			"

												For the price it can't be beat.  To be honest i would have paid $10 for this game.  It's simple but challenging and fun.  it also, if accidentally, has a comedic side to it.  Though there are some bugs and the controls of the large dinos can be clunky it's still great.  Generally, the flaws are unnoticeable during play.  I highly recommend ORION: Prelude.			"

												As much as I absolutely despise games that try to be Halo, Doom and Dead Space all shifted into one blobby, stinking mess, I have to admit, this game caught me by surprise. When I saw the game on the Steam Store, and the big, hunky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with some sort of shiny, LED space suit caught my eye as he stood rather awkwardly next to the title, I thought ""Oh, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not this ♥♥♥♥♥ again."" However, then I began playing the game and, over the span of about four hours, I realized what it was all about.Most games pride themselves on intriguing characters, amazing, scripted scenes and all-out fantastic storylines. But, nope. Orion Prelude isn't about any of those things. Now, I know what you're going to say. ""Hold on there one second, Contorted. If it's not awesome, intriguing or fantastic, how is it a good game"" Well, let me tell you. Usually when playing Call of Duty, Far Cry, Halo, you name it. I sometimes find myself thinking. ""Isn't this practically another one of those stories but just happening a different way? I mean, you start the game out not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥'s going on, a villian is introduced. Somewhere down the line he does something terrible and probably kills off one of your mates and then you ♥♥♥♥ him up for it and the game ends with you walking cockily into the distance?"" With Orion, that kind of every-day ♥♥♥♥ doesn't happen. It's the simplicity and almost childlike logic on which the game prides itself on that makes it somewhat charming. It's one of the only games I've ever played that actually exists simply for fun and, somehow, the lack of anything huge or emotionally powerful happening actually works towards aplifying that charming simplicity. It literally exists for FUN.However, the game isn't perfect. The lack of logic may work towards the game's advantage and atmosphere, but in some places it does get a little annoying. The slightest nudge from a T-Rex can send you flying to the other side of the map screaming ""To infity and ♥♥♥♥ you"" in the opposite direction. Also, the idea that a flying Dinosaur that's about the size of a large Human can push away an air-based vehicle that's about five times its' size never fails to floppify my action boner. But, once again, these annoying little pockets of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is what makes it all the more satisfying when you unload enough bullets into the Dinosaurs that are coming at you to kill them and they flop dead to the ground. Watching a flying Dino fall about five hundred feet and splat on a rock never fails to make me giggle. Also, one of the most, and I can't find another word to describe it, 'epic' game mechanics ever is the fact that, when a teammate dies, or you kill a T-Rex or Spinosaurus, the screen flops into slow-motion. Why? Because it makes killing a Dinosaur all the more awesome when its' body falls limp in slow motion.Overall, Orion: Prelude is a fun little game, which is very childlike, but also quite charming and adorable to play. It's like you're one of the Spartans from Halo, stuck into a game of Primal Carnage, but you have a jetpack, medigun or a massive, armoured vehicle to help you out.			"

												ORION: Prelude. Previously known as Orion: Dino Horde, and previously known before that as Dino Beatdown. It's a nifty little FPS about...well, the mass killing of dinosaurs.The name changes, despite what the developers will claim on their forums, are repeated attempts to avoid their perpetually low metacritic scores.Each iteration of this dino slaughter game is merely just a shameless repackaging, in an attempt to shed it's horrible metagamer score. Perhaps neither here nor there, but it does give you an idea of how dishonest this publisher is willing to be to ensure the game continues to sell.The game has a glaring lack of polish, tends to run at very low framerates, even on powerful machines, and has the nasty habit of crashing...repeatedly, for no apparent reason.Notably, some people only rarely experience these crashes, but for many people, the game is rendered unplayable. And of course, when you're not crashing, your friends are disconnecting.Playing through a single match of any appreciable length becomes rather difficult.Pair that with the repetitive music and downright embarrasing voices the humans feature, you get the distinct feeling that there was a notable lack of love going into the visuals and sound in this game.Seriously, though. The voices are reminiscent of an athsmatic in a bathroom with seasonal allergies and a horrible headcold. (Looking at you, support class! If you call me ""homey"" one more time...)Notably, the lag and the crashes and the disconnects are issues that have persisted for me and my friends over a year, since the game was called ORION: Dino Horde.If you are among the lucky people who can play this game without crashing non-stop, then I suggest you immediately stop to thank your lucky stars. The game features a variety of modes, but most modes involve slaughtering dinos. (There are a few that allow you to play as dinos.) The game contains 3 classses of humans you can play as, support, assault, and recon. (Think of a clunkier version of Tom Clancy.) While assault is fun to play as with his jetpack, and the recon is nifty with her invisibility, the support class wins hands down, with his ability to heal himself and others....to an extreme degree. He can tank just about anything with his healing gun.Even though the support class is massively overpowered, playing the game as any other class is quite difficult.Between massive dinos that create unavoidable earthquakes, or even bigger dinos that merely swallow you whole, ORION exists on a strange difficulty spectrum.So long as one uses the support class, and uses the turrets on the backs of the vehicles you can ride, the game seems relatively easy. If you, like me, decide to explore what else the game has to offer, you'll run back to your support class/turret combo relatively quickly, as you find that the world of dino horde is quite a cruel one indeed.In short, Orion: Prelude, under any name, is a glitchy, laggy, poorly thought out PVP shooter/dino killing game/dinos vs humans, that attempts to excuse its mediocrity with a low price point.Considering the legions of pvp shooters out there, you're probably better off picking up any one of those and leaving this one be.

												Considering the dark past, this game is well worth revisiting.  The crazy low price, and the flood of updates make for quite an apology that I can readily accept.  A game that was broken pulled back from the brink is a rare find indeed.  ORION: Prelude is basically the combination of Halo and Killing floor reimagined by a 10 year old.  (Not a bad thing)  I'm of course referring to the survival and conquest modes that make up 90 percent of the server list.  There are an overabundance of game modes, some of which I haven't even touched.  But I don't feel like I'm missing much in some of them; but the creators definitely have thought through every possible angle an arena FPS like this could offer.  With that in mind, Orion has a crazy amount of depth for such a cheap game.  With leveling, perks, loadouts, upgrades, the list goes on.  It's got all the bells and whistles of a AAA title, just without the pretty graphics, models, or polish.  And if you don't mind that and just want to cut down a T-rex with a light saber, pistol whip a raptor, or set a pteradon on fire; then this is the game for you.  Did I mention the music is fittingly epic as well?Unfortunately for this gem, the amount of available players is sparse, so if you do buy it, I would suggest doing so with friends in mind, or firing it up during sale time.

Boy, was I wrong. Nothing in this game works. It starts with a buggy main menu; sounds cutting off, the server list not refreshing, unable to even connect to anything or anyone or even starting a solo game. Finally after restarting the game 3 times I was able to create a solo game. It's supposed to be a tower defense sort of game, but deeper. But it's terrible. It's buggy, it isn't fun, it's glitchy, it's... It's probably the worst game I've ever played (and I've played quite a few, thank you very much).Virtual garbage bin material.

												I'm torn.  For the $1 I paid for it during the promotion, it's tons of shameless fun (I thought), and a nice deviation from the standard Killing Floor/zombie wave mods out there.  That said, I have to look at this in the context of if it's worth its asking price and...No.The game is high production value Unreal Engine modification, but it lacks the attention to detail that makes Killing Floor so fun.  Animations are janky, player textures frequently disappear mid-match (leaving behind their primary-colored models), hitboxes are off (why is a shot to the crest of the neck of a raptor considered a headshot, but shooting them in the head isn't?), levels are uninspiring copy-paste affairs (how many times am I going to see the same wrecked drill in a level?) with incredibly linear objective design (Base 2 is always the same spot, as is base 3, etc).  Capturing the bases in Survival mode itself does nothing but progress the game to the next wave of dinosaurs, as even the vehicles spawn at the start of the match - you could have a buddy run to Base 3 for the Mech while you turn on the generator to start Wave One!That's not to say the game is /bad/.  Are there performance issues?  Yes.  Is the attention to detail lacking?  Absolutely.  Is it incredibly linear to the point of boredom after a while?  You betcha.  But until you really start to notice those things (about thirty minutes in, for me), the game is still fun in a mindless sort of way, especially with friends.  That said though, for $15, I expect a lot more for my money than copy-pasted levels and textures, braindead AI, movement animations from the original Tribes (in terms of ""skating"" over terrain), and a linear level experience.For the $1 I paid for it, it feels like a discounted iPad app.  Shame that when it's off sale, the developers are still asking for $15 for this thing.  I'd like to see a lot more polish (and better netcode) before plunking down that much cash, especially when you're competing against similarly priced titles like Killing Floor, Starbound, etc, that are way better experiences overall.

												Terrible game. Fun for first five minutes. After that it's problems show. Firstly, the dinos are all very static. Static in the sense that all the dinos ever do is just run at you with the same animations straight at you to attack. No lurking, no ai intelligence. The dinos are like tracking missiles just running directly at you. Next the vehicles feel very basic. The game's mech is a clunky mech which you click to fire a turret which is pretty much the same turret on every vehicle with a turret. The vehicles feel slow and not fun to drive. It is just endless waves repeating after each wave of dinos increasing in number and doing the same thing until you die. The game's mechanics could do a little better at some things also, like when a ptero picks you up and flies if u kill it while it is flying it drops u and u die from fall dmg(wth?). Weapons in this game don't feel powerful at all. Imagine just firing at this dino and the dino does not even flinch or stumble. There is just the same blood splatter backwards and you grind him down until he dies. The music is loud and makes it feel like some arcade shootout. Even without the music, the dinos sound even louder than your guns. This game is actually just Dino:Beatdown but re-released to try to get more players to buy after dino beatdown got bad reviews.Now don't get me wrong the game is supposed to be co-op fun, but even with friends after awhile it will be just the whole team split up running in circles around the rocks shooting dinosaurs which are herded behind them.What's good about this game though is that it had a nice concept and could be fun sometimes, but either buy it now at $1 or don't buy at all.

Go into it expecting to have a fun time killing dinosaurs with your friends. Game is worth a dollar but I would wait for it to go on sale and buy you and a few friends a copy. 7/10			"

												Ok so this is the best co-op game ever made. (Yes, even better than Killing Floor.) Why? It has what everyone wants in a FPS co-op; that being boiled down to one word ""FUN"". This game is pure awesome entertainment. With an easy learning curve and lots of different playing modes. Your co-op team never rage, bully or quit. Everyone is having too much ""fun"" for bad feelings to arise. There is so much you can do, there are three soldier proffesions or in the game ""Rampage"" you can be a dinosaur and eat other players! Then there is duel matches, king of the hill and much much more. There are also a good array of vehicles to run over or shoot dinosaurs with, as well as many weapons and heaps of augmentations and upgrades. I am completely addicted to this game. :)			"

												This game is very unique and one of its kind, in more ways than one. If you read the reviews of others who had been following this game since its beta/early access stages, you'll quickly notice that every one of them says that this game was practically a piece of garbage back then, and any games that get labelled as such will seldom get the opportunity to see the light of day years later.Enter a group of stubborn developers who refuse to back down and watch their work go down the drain, they salvaged whatever's left from the wreck of the cruiser and built a collosal aircraft carrier out of it. The story basically sums up the history of ORION: Prelude.With so many shooters involving zombies or aliens these days, this game's theme is very refreshing to say the least. It is a FPS where you get to shoot the long extinct reptile inhabitants of the universe that are dinosaurs. But that doesn't mean you're going to do that with makeshift bows crafted out of wood and stone-headed arrows. No no no no no, far from that. You'll be doing that with state-of-the-art futuristic gadgets and weaponries.Combine that with cooperative team action and you have yourself a top of the notch game that is teamplay-worthy. The audio is also impressive, sporting above average voice-acting comparable to some high-end games out there. For its price, this game is good. There aren't many other games quite like it.10 out of 10.I am aware of the recent, what could I call it, “scandal” that Spiral Game and TREK are involved in with the other game that is the spiritual successor of ORION: Prelude. However, I am only 2 things: a customer and a gamer. I purchased this game as a customer, and I play this game as a gamer. I’m not a game designer or a politician. Whether or not the game contains assets from games by other developers, stolen or otherwise unintentionally imitated, does not concern me as long as I get my money’s worth from the product I paid for. Even if the developers did mess up, it is up to the higher ups to settle the dispute. As gamers, you have the right to demand a refund or just boycott the product, but expressing your opinions on the developer’s actions is irrelevant because it is not going to change anything, and if you’re not an attorney who is going to represent either TREK or Activision in court, I’d advise you not to at all because it just makes you highly suspicious of being an employee of a competitor organization attempting to sabotage.Because let’s face it, having all the negative reviews arise after the incident is like having “this game now sucks because of that” written all over your review. If that is the case, it is funny how you still support games like Payday 2 by Overkill, Killing Floor 2 by Tripwire Interactive or Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide by Fatshark, because those developers are easily at the top of the ♥♥♥♥ tier list. See, your duty as a reviewer is to determine if the game is good, and if the developer did a good job. If the developer didn’t implement anything that are detrimental to your gameplay, you need not whine about it. In which case I’m fairly certain that implementing assets from some other games does not affect your gameplay at all. I’m not saying I support the idea of stealing assets from other developers, but I’m just a gamer trying to enjoy a game I paid for.			"

												+ Environmental visuals were very well presented+ Maps are extremely large, and you'll find yourself traversing them on your way to capture objectives+ You get to shoot dinosaurs in the face; I really cannot stress enough how ridiculous and awesome this concept is+ Weapon selection is not extensive, but the developers did a good job making sure that EVERY weapon is fun to use+ Weapons also felt balanced, in that there weren't one or two that seemed to stand out as the best; if you rely on skill in this game, you'll be able to get away with using pistols and a knife and that's it+ You can play a game mode that makes you a dinosaur+ Very fun and numerous character customization options that further serve to show you this game does not take itself seriously+ Vehicles were very fun to use, and had a contorl scheme reminiscient of the Halo franchise+ Still frequently updated; you can tell that the developers just adore their own game- Sound effects for the weapons were disappointing- The maps can be TOO big, turning a trip to capture an objective into a walking simulator- Needs more game modes; it has multiple game modes, currently, but they're all variations of a wave shooterLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Right now i have played around 20 hours on it and I'm still enjoying it! If you just want to relieve some stress, just play this game. It certainly helps. The fairness between Man and Dino is in favor of Man. It depends if YOU like that, but i certainly do. Note: With friends it's MUCH more fun.PROS:- A lot of variety in weapons and vehicles.- A lot of different game modes. It never gets boring.- Very well-made maps.- Different classes. (assault, support and recon)- Augments where you can buy all sorts of stuff.- It is strategic. e.g. which augments and weapons should you buy first?CONS:- There are some strange bugs. But they can always be solved.- When playing Solo. It kinda gets boring after a while.Over all, I REALLY enjoy this game and now my other friends can join too bc it's F2P now!P.S. I see a lot of people complaining it's F2P now and they want their money back. Jesus Christ it was ♥♥♥♥ing 99 cents and you even get helmets for it. Stop complaining for ♥♥♥♥s sake.			"

Ok to start off this review i'm gonna list some pros and cons for it below.+PROS++ Very affordable price+ Beatiful visuals (Graphics)+ Well made interfaces (Ex: Main menu, shop, in game HUD, all of its great really!)+Voice acting seems pretty good in my opinion+ Different classes (their is 3 classes)+Has vehicles (Suck on that cod fans!)+ Variety of guns (and are upgradable) + Awesome devs (They admit the game was bad when it was first released and made it so much better)+ Great multiplayer+ Lots of maps and game modes+ Even better deal when on sale (Dont even know how much lower the price could possibly go but it's great for you penny pinchers xD)+Has a uique art style mixed with dinos (Think Halo style mixed with Jurassic Park!)+Easy to make servers! and work well!-CONS-- Has glitches (like most every other game also has. Very few are game breaking)- Only three classes (not a huge deal cause the existing classes are great and fit in the game well)-Not much of a story (BUT who really needs stroy when you got DINOSAURS!!!)-Micro transactions (In game store for cosmetics only)=Summary=Overall this game is a blast with friends and leaves you satisfied after  blowing out a dino's brains! Also fun to take your teams vehicle and drive off (without them) and listen to the glorious sound of ""TEAMMATE DOWN!"" xD. If you are still hesitating what are you waiting for?

												I have not played this game for all it has to offer but I feel like I have already gotten my dollars worth so I do recommend this game, for a dollar it is amazing!I was looking for a dinosaur game to play with my young son and found Orion: Prelude on sale for a dollar so with great reviews I thought why not? Only playing one of the several game modes that this game offers (survival) here is my experience.  Survival is a game mode where you defend your base against waves of dinosaurs that get harder as it throws different types of dinosaurs as you progress.  You can upgrade your guns, items, get turrets, upgrade your character with different perks, and drive vehicles to fight the waves.  One of the best experiences of playing this mode was when I was on top of a bunch of rocks trying to stay out of harms way a terrordactyl picked me up and was taking me who knows where (maybe to just drop me from a height) so I had to spin my character around to kill it.  I thought that was pretty cool.The game feels well optimized playing on max settings at 1080 resolution on a dated system I have had no performance issues.  The graphics are not the best but for a dollar with all this game has to offer I think this can be overlooked.My last statement, if you are even considering Orion: Prelude please pick it up.  I mean you can even fight others with light sabers, or be a dinosaur in an online pvp dinosaur match.			"

A great summary here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/2 of many of their stunts...1. People on forums, discussing how the company is lying about various things to get good PR - get threatened with legal action and possible jailtime (nice try).2. Gives their game to a YouTube channel, with permission to even to give negative feedback, on assumption it would give good PR - doubles back on decision, and issues DCMA takedown request to remove the video.I believe an accurate description of David Prassel (of Trek Industries, developer of Orion) is that he is the filthy scum found in a gutter that can't be cleaned out.

												In just a little over 3 years, this decade of gaming will be coming to a close.  Eventually, when we're all just a bunch of nostalgiac old folks looking back at this era, what are we going to remember most?  In a discouraging period of unfinished games and broken promises, which productions will truly stand above the rest, leaving their mark on videogame history?  I've been a gamer as long as I can remember.  I've been waiting for that ""perfect game"", the one that grabs you by the shoulders and doesn't let go until you've experienced every little ounce of detail the developers so masterfully placed within its frame.  Today, I'm ecstatic to announce that my wait is over.  All the years of sifting through garbage have finally paid off.  ORION: Prelude is the game that I'm taking with me to my deathbed.  Even at surface level, ORION: Prelude is a beautifully crafted masterpiece.  Never before have we encountered such extensive level design that truly leaves the player breathless.  The first time I stomped into the world of ORION: Prelude as the bold, massive Spinosaurus, I was nearly brought to tears.  ORION: Prelude does not care that this decade still has a few years left.  It's fully prepared to present itself in all its prehistoric glory as the best game in recent history.  The intricately crafted but comfortable controls, gorgeous level design, and gripping story leave me yearning for nothing more.  It's all I've ever wanted in a game.			"

												I gave this game a chance, thinking it couldn't be as bad as people said it was; I was wrong.Let me put it this way: there are Source mods that have higher production value than this game, and that's not saying much when you consider that those very same Source mods have funding from their own pockets and not some Kickstarter. This game might be running on Unreal, but it looks and feels like a bad Half-Life 2: Deathmatch mod.Some could say that I can't compare this to AAA games, but I believe it's appropriate to add that I had more fulfillment out of both Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Aliens: Colonial Marines than I had with this.It's worth the $1 they're charging as of this review, but no more than that.

												Do you like killing dinosaurs and are on a budget?! Then grab your high powered bow cause its killing time.A simple arcane like defense came where you gain credits after every round to buy new skills and perks along with weapons depending on your class (and some neutral ones that everyone can buy) to help you survive the increasing hordes of small an large dinosaurs.Featuring a couple game types, you defend a generator from waves of enemies with vehicles and weapons. They perks allow certain feats to be obtained, like jumping high, being able to heal machines (as a medic) and many many more.Several different types of dinosaurs are present in this game, like pterodactyls, raptors, t-rex and spinosaurus. Depending on the round and which objective is present, certain dinos will spawn. These large giants are considered the bosses of the game, having very high health pools and insanely high damage.While the game isn't hard to master, and very easy to understand, I found it got boring playing by yourself or with random people online. I would recommend playing with a friend or two if you can.Its really cheap when its not on sale and a steal when it is. Give it a try, you will get atleast a couple hours out of it at the very least.

												A poorly-made, unashamedly dumb game that nevertheless offers equally dumb entertainment. Pros: -Drop-in co-operative multiplayer -Multiple classes -Customized loadouts (when unlocked) -Many upgrade paths once in game -Vehicles! Tanks, Mechs, and VTOLs if you're lucky enough to survive long enough to find them -Lots of achievements. You can actually unlock vanity items with enough of them! Cons: -Occasional crashes -Discouraging higher difficulties without teammates or unlocks -Lack of servers -Somewhat monotonous level design			"

ImpressionThis seem to be one of the excessively improved game by far, or perhaps all the reviews were written by their melodramatic competitors only. The ratings and scores the game has received and the complaint has misled me far too much that I cannot fathom anything else but my remorse for not purchasing this game earlier to see for myself.DisclaimerI received the game within a bundle, because I simply wanted to support charity. And then it was left to dust.The reviewUpon picking up on it and giving it a try, I must say it is certainly one of the very captivating and playful experiences I have ever had. The sizes of the reptiles is rather unrealistic, that you'd think the developers prioritized this game into a source of entertainment, a game by definition, rather than a lesson in jurassic era which is a no-no according to the critics.I'd say the game is a slight mix of 'Turok the dinosaur hunter', 'Halo' (Combat Evolved if I may, as we all kept dear), as well as a petite slice of Crysis. And spice it up with a bit of Serious Sam.The verdictThe graphics is astonishing, the animation is charming, the menu is nostalgic, along with the audio. There's these encouraging shouts when doing double, triple kills, endorsing your irrational lifelong dream of dinosaur or cyborg massacre.And lens flares. The pretty kind.			"

												Since the original release (which I never played), the game has been completely remade. So the old scores aren't valid.It's a little rough at the start when you're figuring out how to play it, as there's no tutorial. But it's easy to pick up.Then you kill a stegosaurus with a bow to the face, mow down a pack of raptors with a supercharged laser beam, and shoot a t-rex in the face with a tank.Extremely fun, very frantic gameplay.""Run or shoot.

												Orion: Prelude is a FPS where you (primarily) defend your base against waves of dinosaur enemies. It's not well-explained where you are or why dinosaurs are attacking your base (especially the herbivorous ones, like Stegosaurus and Triceratops), but that perhaps misses the point: shooting dinosaurs. This aspect feels pretty solid; big dinosaurs are hard to deal with and can easily kill you, little ones surround you and can take you down in a short period of time. I'll tackle major aspects of the game below instead of a list of pros and cons. If you're looking for deep gameplay, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a little bit of fun, especially with friends, this is well worth your one dollar (but perhaps not much more). OVERALL: 5/10Gameplay 6/10I've only ever played the standard co-op wave survival game type (with bots and/or friends), but there are other game modes. Each of three classes has a specific ability and set of weapons, which are adequately differentiated. Difficulty scales nicely over the ten waves, and rewards for defeating dinosaurs allows you to purchase weapons, turrets, and/or item upgrades. This all feels pretty good, but the weapons could be slotted into 4/5 categories which feel almost exactly the same. Vehicles (which seem mostly ripped from Halo's assets) are an interesting addition and are fun to use, but somewhat difficult to steer. Dinosaurs' models match their power level neatly, and you'd better be packing top-tier weapons when more than two at a time are nearby. Killing an enemy while downed allows a self-revive in addition to teammates' ability to revive you.One of my biggest issues with this game is the AI. The dinosaurs will not know what to do if you are outside of their attack range and will waggle back and forth below seemingly forever. Cloaking immediately breaks aggro of ANY dinosaur and seems to prevent re-acquiring you as a target for a few seconds. Teammate AI is even worse. They rarely revive you, fail to efficiently capture points, routinely fail to headshot dinosaurs sitting in front of their face, and have garish joke outfits like sandwich hats and wizard cloaks. Playing with bots is really only worth it for two reasons: they aggro dinosaurs and can (for some reason) accurately take down dinosaurs flying at/near the game ceiling.Graphics: 5/10Looks solid most of the time, but things get wonky when dinosaurs die, and when playing in 3rd person. Switching weapons results in a very low-quality model for the first second or so. Dino models are solid, character models less so, (bot costumes -> horrific). Environment looks good all around, weather effects look great, but hinder visibility in ways that are counterproductive to a FPS.Music/Sound: 4/10I have only ever heard two songs in this game, both of which are rousing and I quite like. If you didn't like them, they'd get old fast.Sound is less good overall. Sound balance is wonky: one pistol is about twice as loud as every other weapon; T-Rex roars seem to badly clip the audio (and my eardrums); slow-mo start sound blares unreasonably. Could be better balanced and menu audio options don't seem to affect all sounds. Everything else is solid, but leaves something to be desired.Performance: 4/10The game seems to be very poorly optimized and freezes for a few seconds when awarding class level ups, and uses far more system resources than I would expect from a game like this.

												Just played it for free, but I feel like they should have paid me to play it. It took me a while just to be able to play it. At first, I tried joining public games using the matchmaking option, but I was immediately kicked from the lobby every time. I finally got to at least try it out using the ""Play Solo"" option. The game is ridiculously glitchy. The game froze for about thirty seconds, I was constantly running into invisible barriers, which I had to jump over, I tried to purchase a certain augment and it purchased some random one I didn't want, and I spontaneously lost the ability to shoot or reload, despite it saying I had full ammo. Despite the PS2 era visuals (don't let the video previews fool you) I still suffered from a horribly low framerate. Oh, and all of that happened in less than 15 minutes.It was enough to make me think those giving this garbage positive reviews are either dummy accounts set up by the devs or they are just trolling me.

												The year was 1967. We'd just been deployed in the delta to keep the Cong and NVA from approaching some of the major trails. I was trudging through one of the tree covered marshes, soaked to the core, wondering what the hell I'd gotten myself into. We were two minutes away from setting up an M249 on a rigged turret when out of nowhere what looked like a pterodactyl flew down and exploded, killing four people in my unit. From there on out, it was hell, neon lights everywhere, and then the god damned t-rex had to come in and stomp our ♥♥♥♥.Either way, this is a 10/10 simulation of Vietnam War II's opening, with Far Cry Blood Dragon acting as a good reenactment of the end of VWII.

												I've fallen victim to made up quotes shown in the trailer. Where do I start? I'll start with the most trivial things - graphics.They are bad, like bad bad. Low res textures, game looks like late alpha/early beta. It's also poorly optimised and if you don't own a decent gaming rig (like you own an aging gaming laptop) then forget about your game looking anything close to what you can see in the trailer. Even setting everything out ot max makes you feel like all those blurs, blooms, dof effects are to cover how ugly this game actually is.Graphics are not deciding here, let me move on with the review.Gameplay is extremely boring and unsatysfying. Killing dinosaurs? That's cool. Well how about any progress, strategy, real objectives? All of that was replaced by run and fly tactic (also exploiting bugs and broken pathing of enemies), pretty much all the guns feel the same (like bb toys) and objectives are just to have a laugh at them every once in a while. Go the ♥♥♥♥ to the objective, stay there for 15 secs, get nothing but a vehicle so you can run back to the base asap. Wow, jesus!Enemies? All the ♥♥♥♥ing same, slaying a t-rex doesn't give any satisfaction whatsoever but some slow-motion for 15 seconds straight so you can meditate on your miserable life, since you're still playing this game and wasting your time.Audio is just crap. I think you can easily tell that by watching some gameplay video. I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥ around with onomathopeyas.Btw. Watching the trailer again - haven't you noticed this actually trolling? Who would believe this is ""the most fantastic game"" anyone ever played? It's not, unless it was this guy's first game. ""So cool I love it""? Now that's a cool quote. ""The metacritic score is misleading""? Of course it is, this game is 2/10 at best.Look, getting this game for its current price is kinda a bargain. But keep in mind you only want to get this if you're:-A hipster-A game collector-A suicidal maniac candy crush veteran who's got no cash in his pocket and wants to commit suicide during playing a co-op shooting game.

												 lot of people say this game is crap or weird, but everyone has different opinions, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. This game has more positive features than cons. I'd say that the only real problems with this game are that it's not well-optimized, it's somewhat repetitive, the animations kinda' suck, the graphics aren't impressive, not all the game-modes are good as horde, the dinosaur AI is extremely basic, some of the sounds are basic, and the dinosaurs aren't like their real-life counterparts. I also don't like the new name and logo, they should have just kept ""Orion: Dino Horde."" Looking past that, this is the best dollar I've ever spent. Dinosaurs, Jet-packs, guns, robots, vehicles, LIghtSaber, explosions?. And the soundtrack is freakin' amazing! Overall, I give this a 9/10. (Cheap But Way Better Than you Thinks) "

There is a diverse range of gamemodes and maps with a large selection of weapons and vehicles. Zoom around in your jetpack or revive your teammates or go incognito and tactically take out some dinosaurs or enemies. Customise your player model with hats and armour types. Who wouldnt want to do that? This game has great visuals and fantastic gameplay. Like seriously? Who doesnt have fun running dinosaurs over in jeeps and taking a t-rex down in a mech suit? Who doesnt love burning little raptors to a crisp? This game overall is fantastic and I highly recommend it.			"

What the devs have in store (Orion Prelude) looks amazing, and they'll evolve the current game into a much more beautiful and refined game for FREE. The devs are also producing free dlc, nothing you have to pay for.

												In short this game is almost free, gets updated all the time, has dinosaurs, a ton of modes/maps and is one of the most fun online FPS games on Steam.And even if you don't like it, it's not like you're wasting a substantial amount of money or anything. Just skip lunch for a day and you'll be able to buy 2 or 3 4-packs of the game, you fattie.But I doubt you'll not enjoy it (I mean, you can kill raptors with a giant robot).I've heard that a long time ago this game sucked and was full of glitches, but apparently they pretty much remade the whole game from scratch, so don't worry about it.Oh, and you can play as a T.Rex. <- this was the major selling point for meBuy it.

												Though lacking in polish, it's a fun game, for $1 or $4 you can have a fun afternoon playing around with your friends for free. The UI is pretty bad as is the quality of many of the interactables and markers, but it's functional.Some of the modes like the (Player)Dinos VS Marines(Player) require lots of players since they can't be played with bots.The netcode could use some work, PVP between 2 computers in the same network was pretty laggy, so LAN play would be a nice addition.It's a pretty basic game and on the lowest settings practically any PC can run it. Overall, I'd recommend it if you are looking for some fun co-op if you know you can get past the game's lack of polish, and no there's no barrier to entry.			"

												Every time this game was on sale, the low metacritic score made me keep my distance. I was still skeptical when the developers offered it at 90% off, but it's hard to not try something for a dollar. And that was a good decision. Burnt out on Killing Floor? Give Dino Horde a shot. There's lots of different game modes, plenty of weapons and augmentations, a few vehicles, three classes of characters with different abilities, 50 levels of character unlocks, several levels of difficulty, and even Borderlands style second wind. I've had an enormous amount of fun so far with this game. Ignore the useless metacritic score and check it out--a welcome addition to the coop club.			"

												This game has a lot of bad press about it, and it doesn't deserve it as much as it did in the past. Things have gotten a lot better since ORION: Dino Beatdown, and even from the original release of ORION: Dino Horde (which people got for free if they already had O:DB, so check if you already have it from the previous name), and the amount of fun you have with the game is linked to your disposition to it. If you go in thinking it's going to be a terrible game, you're not going to have fun with it. If you think it could be good, then you'll probably give it more of a chance. There's been a lot of updates and additions that probably fixed something you didn't like about it before. (I'm looking at you, TotalBiscuit, and everyone that follows him blindly about his first impressions.)With that said, this can be a lot of fun with friends, playing by yourself is okay, but it really shines with more people. If you get on Skype/TeamSpeak with some pals (because who uses in-game voice chats anymore, really?), you can coordinate and assist each other in your fight against waves of dinosaurs who apparently find the noise/smell of your energy generators really annoying/tasty. I've found it to be an enjoyable alternative to Killing Floor or especially any of the modes in the CoD games (save for MW1 or BO2).Sure, it's had a past behind it, and there's some concepts borrowed from other games, but if you wait for a sale (namely right now, it's free to play for the week of Feb 20-27, and you can have it forever if you pay a single dollar), then maybe you can justify the purchase. Personally, I don't think that it's worth it at full price, but once it goes under 50% discount, that should ease the hesitation. Now go ahead and try it on a sale (maybe get a 4-pack to share), bring some friends along, don't be a filthy public match joiner.			"

												When this was Orion: Dino Horde, I would have recommended this game.Most of my time spent playing this game was when it was under the previous title, and I throughly enjoyed my time with the game during that time. I randomly decided to try it once more, after its update to the new title to see if it was still okay.The menu UI for the game, with the transition, feels like it under went a 15+ year regression compared to what it was previously. They had a fairly sleek UI previously, that overall looked decent for a modern age game, and it functioned well enough, and now the new UI looks like something that might have been taken straight out of the late 90s, maybe early 2000s.Aside from that, the views while in the game, at least to me, went from feeling like a decent first/third shooter to feeling just cramped.  I could be wrong on what I recall on this point, but I remember having a wider field of vision for both first and third person views, and even as a spectator floating around, I recall a wider view than what is shown.On the positive side, it is still a good game for the price.. it just feels more deserving of that price now, instead of feeling like an amazing game for the price. If you need something to entertain you for a couple of hours, this will certainly do it, especially for the price on it.			"

Dont believe to those who tell you dont believe to metascore.If you want to try out an interesting multiplayer fps with asymmetric teams I can recommend Natural Selection 2. That is a well made game. This is not.Oh and I mostly forgot to mention the ingame shop where you have to buy extra skins, equipment and animations for real money - but fortunately that wont be a big temptation.			"

												ORION Prelude is a charming enough FPS with dinosaurs that only costs $.99 right? Wrong! while this game has some good qualities to it, there are far too many bugs/ issues with it to even consider playing in a more consistent capacity, with there being far more capable FPS for free on steam. You would think with the 99 cent price tag that the game is worth a shot and your right. But when you get in game and notice that the game also has in game purchases for cosmetics and everything else, bugs and very unrefined yet basic system. You'll be wondering why you even payed the $1 in the first place. Luckily I was one of the thousands of people who got this game for free and thankfully that means that I got free trading cards for my time spent playing the game. before I get to the pros and cons of this game, I'd like to put some of the comments in retrospect from my experience.This game has been compared to Halo, Borderlands, Killing floor, Jurassic park and a plethora of other AAA/ popular games.To clarify things for the hyped up buyer. This game is as similar to those games combines as power puff girls is to street fighter. To put some things into terms this game retains a cap of roughly 300 players per day, while the original Halo on PC still caps out at 400 users daily. So if your looking for Halo. Then just go back to the original PC community as it is still alive my friend.Sure this game has guns, but the shooting is generic and it's not realistic nor is it futuristic. The game can be played with the starting pistol and not challenge the user very much as he sits on a rock and kills all the boss dinos and everything in between. Even when I force myself to stay on the ground, the AI is poorly executed, even while on the hardest difficulties.Pros and Cons.Pros: *The game is fairly cheap.*The community is not dead for now.*The developers may fix all the issues at some point.*The developers give away thousands of copies of the game monthly, so you can expect new and exciting users to keep playing with while the fun lasts.*The graphics are quite nice for the price*You get a cute little shooter for 99 centsCons:*Even on a high performance gaming computer, this game does not function well in full screen what so ever.*The game forces it to launch in full screen no matter how many time you toggle it to windows.*The clipping isn't rendered correctly on full screen*The audio is horrible and often drops/ cuts out from gun fire to dino roars.*The vehicle control is highly generic and most often comparable to Halo 1(That's a lie) The vehicle controls are far worse than the original halo games, or almost any early shooter for that mater.*Full controller support is true, although it's highly glitchy and the controls don't always seem to register when using a controller vs mouse and keyboard.*combat is often boring and tedious as the AI is one of the worse AI's I've seen in a FPS.I could keep listing things wrong with the game but there is too many other games I could be playing during this time. I do hope that the developer takes the time to buckle down and release a good patch to fix most of the issues as the majority of them are common features in thousands of games that have way less funding/ following. My advice is simple, if you want a fps with dinosaurs in it. Then buy a game that has mods for dinosaurs in it. Like Star Wars Battlefront II or Arma II. Cheers and happy gaming			"

												If there ever was a game that combined Aliens, Dinosaurs, Space Marines and robots etc. It's this... People may say it's a bad game. That's because it ain't your avarage shooter. I love this game, and the first time I saw it, I said ""I want"". It may not have a storyline so far, and It may just be matches fighting people or Dinosaurs but it's so much fun and great all the same. Dino Horde is reguarlly updated and is about to 'evolve' into it's final stage, Prelude. And I can't wait, so far it's one of my favourite shooters. The company may be small but it has made a great game. There are tons of Dinosaurs you can play as and fight. Tons of customizations, weapons and weapons and vehicles. One thing annoys me though, you can only play team eliminations and free for all's a lot when it goes on sale for $1. When it's not on sale, all you see is survivals and conquests and very rarely a Duel or Gungame.It's still worth your money and attention. I would recommend getting Orion Dino Horde!(Also like how I heard T-mass on their trailers)			"

Playing with friends is even more fun, and if you're not interested in dinosaurs, you can disable them, receiving a normal FPS game.I'm very sorry for the developers, who optimized this game instead of just dropping it. It's sad that you are able to earn more cash with an unfinished, bad and buggy 'Early Access' game than actually with a real good game... :c			"

												If you are using Steam Enhanced and see that this game has many dislikes, dont act on that. This game, at launch was very buggy and needed a lot of content. The devs have made up for it and have cerrtainly improved the game a lot. I suggest this game A LOT. The metacritic is also another misleading score, it reflects the original games score, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then. Why should you buy it? This game is for people that like games like Killing Floor that send the players against waves of enemies that keep getting stronger wave after wave, occasionally there will be a boss dino which will be quite the destruction machine. My own suggestion is to play this game with stranger and/or friends, since the singleplayer can feel a bit devoid of hummanity.			"

												I know that the first version of Dino Horde didn't get very good reviews, and many people pass this game up because of that. The game has had a revival since then, and has gotten much better as a game. Having not actually played the earlier version, I personally find it hard to believe that a game so creative and well made could ever deserve the terrible metascore and overall hate that Dino Horde has recieved. This really is a great game, it probably won't be on a top five FPS list any time soon, but for people that love science fiction shooter games with simple objectives and a gun purchase system like in CS:GO, then this is the game for you. It also has dinosaurs in it, so that's a plus.Edit: This review is for dino horde. Prelude is a terrible game; the creators messed up big time.			"

												So everyone on the web apparently dislikes this game a lot.I don't see it.Dino Horde is a delightfully fun Horde shooter with various modes including pvp that pits friends up against waves of dinosaurs.Similar to Dino-D-Day, there is  pvp modes where one team are the dinos, and the other are humans. It's pretty fun and works about as much as dino d day does.The survival mode is where the game shines. You fight increasingly hard waves of dinos as you try to defend yourselves and various generators around the map. The maps are huge and the graphics are really nice to the eye.Right off the bat, the HUD looks like it was straight from Halo. The gameplay is a mix of Borderlands, Left 4 Dead, Serious Sam, and even TF2. When you go down, you have to either revive your teammate, or kill a dino to get back up, similar to Borderlands. The game is highly customizable, and is insanely fun.The Metacritic score can go ♥♥♥♥ itself. This game is great.			"

												I've never posted a serious review below a minimum playtime of 40 hours, but consider the following:the average wage in western europe is above €6/hthis game costs about 20% less than an espressoIf I ever want to get my money back, I'll have to work 8 minutes overtime, or walk past the coffee place next morning. I could never down-rate a game that cheap.Besides, just the mere existence of vehicles and sandbox maps give Orion a very good replay value. Sometimes it feels like back in 2007 on Halo 2. "

												After many game updates from the old title ORION: DinoHunt, they gave the game a new title called ORION: Prelude.The game is a lot of fun since they fixed it and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is casual on the FPS genre. Although a bit taxing on old computer hardware, it's really cheap and feels like a cross between Unreal Tournament and Jurassic Park.With many game modes to choose from, how the dinosaur action is played is up to you and able to play with other people as well.Go nuts!

												Few times in one's life do they get the opportunity to do the things that you can do in this game. I have been blessed with the oppurtunity to shoot dinosaurs in the crotch while driving mech suits and tanks. Doesn't sound relaxing enough? Perhaps you enjoy pushing your friends and dinosaur corpses through the blood and feces of a now endangered species with state of the art ragdoll physics?And how can we forget about the CryEngine level graphics and in-depth storyline? I was hooked from the beginning of the 10 level massacre to the end. I became legitimately worried about the sanity and morality of the characters and even the dinosaurs. The game creates a player-glitchy NPC bond that can only be created on the incredibly diverse levels that the developers have created. Don't even get me started on the animations! They were ""Transformers"" quality and left me in awe every time I looked at them in 3rd person mode.  Basically, this game gives you an oppurtunity to achieve your goals and conquer your greatest fears in one incredible experience. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------26/10 would recommend to public----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Best game on Steam.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												Old review was completely inaccurate and overly subjective, stating in a nutshell, ""this game has jetpacks and dinos what more could you want?"" Actually, that was the review in its entirety. An honest review of this game would be that it is a stupid buggy mess, that has its moments, but even when it has those moments, they're a result of the game's utter lunacy. Put that on the box and quote me with it. That said, you'd think I hate the game. You couldn't be more wrong. ORION is to Transformers (Bay Films) as Matt Damon is to a heaping pile of fecal matter. What exactly that means, I'm not sure; and I really only thought through the first bit of that analogy, but what I'm getting at here is that ORION: Beatdown/Horde/Prelude/WorkingTitle is stupid fun. Even more stupid and even more fun with friends, and really its best described as Just a Good Time. Quote that too. It's fun.			"

There was more than enough content to keep me occupied by myself for around 10 hours, and 10 more if you have friends to play with.  Of course it isn't perfect, the looping music can get very repetitive, but it does a good job of getting you hyped up.

												With 160++ hours on this game over the course of almost 1 years seeing this game in steam.Good game with high potential, sadly the devs take this game lightly. the game stopped developed after the 1$ promotion and later the F2P status. and lead to other kind of problems.I tell you with my honest point of view- no or too little guide for newcomers (in-game help)- bugs, frequent crashing problems and poorly optimized game mechanic.- time consuming steam achievements.- lags or high ping problems (if unlucky, mostly unlucky)- inactive community in forum- repetitive and easily get bored. nothing much to explore.- unforgiving for newcomers, you need to level up to get advantages on your characters.- too much game mode with each of them have under the mediocre optimization. (too little players play the game)- servers mostly empty. rarely seeing others game mode in play.- very bad radar display- glitched map.- bad optimization on rampage mode especially for dino part.the good things are:+ a lot of species of dino. flying one, small one compy, big one t-rex raptor, etc+ has fps style mixed with survival elements againts dino.+ vehicles. a lot of vehicles+ 3 classes to be played.+ it went F2P, so no harm if you regret playing this game.conclusion - no harm to try this game. sorry to say, due to its state i cannot recommend this game to you until the devs perform any responsible action to fix the current issues.

												I really love this game. The graphics, atmosphere, weapons, tactics, co-op, multiplayer, dinosaurs, and every other things are really awesome. This game reminds of Crysis sometime and other games too because this game is almost like it, halo, KF and others but having dinosaurs! You cannot only kill dinosaurs, you can also become a dinosaurs (rampage mode) which makes this game great fun to play with your friend. I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others. I really recommend this game - the developers put alot of effort into this game. Really this game is not really worth $0.99, I should've spend more money on this!			"

Great value for moneyPros:+ Very very cheap+ Great co-op experience+ Good variety of maps, 20++ 50 + weapons and gear to go nuts with+ Vehicles that add more fun into the game+ 10 dinosaurs to play and wreak havoc with+ Offers 250+ achievements and also trading cards+ Bots and offline play if you don't have friends or the best internet+ Good variety of modes, 15 in total, including versus, open world and co-op+ Level ups, rewards, unlockables and cosmetics to keep you feeling and looking snazzyNeutral Points:> The game itself is ok, not terrible but not great either> Achievements, while I do love to hunt and get them, there are a ton on this gameCons:- Animations are poor- A very low playerbase- Graphics are not too great- Performance is a hit and miss, it can be really bad or it can be good- Achievements can be hard to get for various reasons, mostly due to the low playerbase though- Despite offering lots of game modes, maps, weapons and the such, this game does easily get repetitiveDownload Size: 3854mbTrading cards: 12 in the setAchievement Difficulty: Very Hard to 100%Hours to 100%: 200+Rating: 5/10Recommendation: Due to it's extremely cheap price it is worth a go, however do note you will either like it or hate itMy Opinion: While its not the best game ever it certainly gives you a lot of bang for your buck. At a very cheap price this game can last you a very good amount of hours. Getting all the achievements has taken me a very long time, and for the 69p I got this game for it was obviously worth the price. Great for 4 co-op fun, and is also good for other modes.			"

												Can't...Stop...Playing...Vehicles with weapons, plenty of guns, different play styles, and teamwork! Dino Horde gets a 9.5/10 because, unlike other dev teams, here development and new content never ceases. The community of players are great and you quickly meet veterans ready to help you out, share credits, and help you level. Not to mention there are a variety of game modes, the most exciting (for me) being survival mode, where increasingly large waves of dinosaurs arrive in game to munch on you. On harder game levels the battles are so intense you find yourself narrowly escaping with your life by killing a t-rex just before he chomps down on you, or getting ground stomped by a stegosaur that sends your vehicle flying through the air...but it is okay because you got a jet-pack!

												This game for me was more of a Yes/No thoughts about it. I usually found a match, so that was good; Gameplay gets boring after about 2.5hrs you just do the same thing over and over unless you change gamemodes which may give you another 1hr of gameplay. The weapon buying system is decent, you can buy Turrets, Flamethrower, Minigun, Swords, New primary weapons, Grenades, ect. Some of the reloading animations can be buggy, such as fingers going through weapon. Overall this game just went below average.			"

												This game is like a combination of Starwars, Unreal Tournament, and Jurrasic park, by far 3 very popular things together couldnt turn out better than ORION. The dinosaurs will actually use pack strategy on you, and instead of being high and mighty in vehicles, larger dinos can put you in your place quite easily.  By far an epic game experience thats never the same twice.			"

												So I see a ton of reviews stating that ""This game is fun! This game is Awesome!! Best Co-oop ever!"", but none of them give you any details at all. I see some that do, but it annoys me that they put up a 'release' video that has multiple reviews doing just what I hate. Don't get me wrong though, I do love the idea of showing the communities love for a game by putting their name on the video, but at the same time it's bad. I'll get to the point though, the review of the game via pro and con list.Pros:The game is 0.99c.It has co-op in so many ways.It has pvpve.it has hordes of dinos.It is satisfying to kill a bunch of dinos with a big gun/tank.There are lots of weapons.Conquest mode has a very interesting concept.It has the old announcer styled ""Double Kill, Triple Kill, ect"".Cons:There is a bug that allows your ""Private"" server to become a public server without warning.There is no way to change the audio for the Dino's seperately from the other audio so if your game volume isn't low the T-rex will kill your ears.For all the guns, there are really only about 10 you will ever use.If one person is killing all the dinos they get all the money, and can share it, but usually won't since the good weapons cost so much.Getting a tank is a savior just as much as a death wish, as you can die in seconds to anything larger than the acid spitting dinos.(T-rex, stega, ect.)Getting stuck on spots is very likely.The tank's machine gun is ear ♥♥♥♥ much like the large dino roars.The Mech is awesome looking but will die even faster than a jeep without a gun will.There are turrets, but they only last for 60seconds.They have an apc that does tons more damage than the tank, and has seats that are supposed to allow passangers to shoot from, but they do not, and it has a main gun that was apparently taken out so the main weapon has a non-functional cannon on it now.The most viable way of killing dinos is running them over, but that will get you far far far less credits so you will be less useful versus large dinos.There are still other bugs that have not been adressed.Controllers still do not function properly with the game.The new update has brought in even more bugs than before it seems.This is supposedly the 3rd time the game has been 'redone' or whatever they would like to call it, and the ammount of change is so pitifully small that it's not worth mentioning.So after putting all that in, I'll say this for my final words. I have played the game quite a bit, I'm lvl20+, which I didn't put as a pro or con because I didn't think of it as especially one or the other. I have used most of the weapons except for a select few that I just have not wanted to use at all. I've played all the co-op maps so far for survival and conquest. I can say this from my experience. I would not pay 99c to play this game. It is fun for a short while, but after you get frustrated with it, and after you realize how buggy and glitchy the game is. You and your friends will quickly move onto other games, and the fact that they have renamed it(for reasons I didn't look into as I didn't really care.) along side pricing it at 99c now, makes me feel like they have possibly given up on fixing anything with it, and just want to squeeze this lemon for it's last drops of juice. They put out a fancy trailer that recognizes the positive short review from the community, and left it at that.So I say keep your dollar, and buy something else. This game will most likely rot in your steam library like it has mine. It has become that game that me and a few friends play for about 1hour every 2-3 months then forget it again because we hate the bugs and glitches.			"

												Ignore the metacritic score.  It's freakin' awesome.  I'd say it's like Halo meets a Tower Defense game (with one one tower to defend, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot), set in Jurassic Park after the dinosaurs broke out, but without all those pesky fences.In essence, X number of dinosaur waves come at your team (10-30-infinite I believe), and after each wave, your team has a chance to purchase weapons and upgrades.  There are also upgrades you can get for you whole account/player, but I've only gotten one so far, so I don't want to give any misinformation; I can't recall what I achieveved to get the upgrade.  That's how they work though, accomplish an ""acheivement"" and then in the future you'll always have that upgrade the ""acheivement"" granted you.I won't give too much away, but the vehicles are ALL awesome, and the whole game is loads of fun.  Not to mention, look in their ""recent updates"" area of thier Steam page: ""Buy ORION: Dino Horde, Get ANOTHER Game FREE!""  Read it.  Enough said.Buy this while on sale and you won't regret it.  If I knew it was this good, I would have probably already have bought it before Steam's ""Sales"" section got me again.It's the best game I've ever gotten on Steam for $0.99, and it's better than a lot of current FPS big name titles.Buy it.  Play it.  You won't regret it.  At least try the free 2 days!			"

The mountedcannon spins up and empties a volleyof lead into the Stegosaurus, sendingit to Reptile Heaven.The announcer yells that the wave isdefeated, and now a cooldown periodis in effect to stock up on weapons,ammo and upgrades. You attempt tobuy something with real world money,but the button in-game seems broken,and you shrug it off.

Mrs. Novocaine sneers again.""DAMN YOU!"" You fire, but a runningVelociraptor gets hit between you andMrs. Novocaine before the dust kicksup and dinosaurs and blaster fire rainabout everywhere around the both ofyou. ""Summer?!

												I had this game in my library for a while. I recently picked up Trek Industries newest game, which is in early access and I was impressed by what I saw so I thought I'd delve into ORION: Prelude to see what I could expect from them in the development of that game.When you know about the history of ORION: Prelude the state it's in now is pretty impressive. The developer clearly worked hard to turn something that was unplayable into a game that is actually really fun. There's no real depth to it but it's a slightly different take on your average horde mode game, the mechanics are solid and there's a nice variety of maps. It is only 79p so you can't really go wrong if you want to sink a few hours into a decent game that has a small but fairly active multiplayer community. It's definitely worth more than it's asking price.			"

												Orion: Prelude is really not a bad game like the price would suggest. It deserves a lot more players in my opinion. Parts of it remind me of the original Halo. The graphics are of course better than the original Halo, but still slightly on the outdated side if you compare it to something like Battlefield 4. ALTHOUGH, atmospheric conditions in the maps are some of the best I've seen. Fog rolling in, sunlight and rain, frost on your visor, day fading to night and then to moonlight; it all looks really beautiful in this game. There is a bit of a cartoonish appearance to the maps but I kind of like that. There's a good amount of weapons to pick from. I suggest playing the Gun Game mode first to figure out the controls and weapons if this is your first time. Start your own Gun Game server if there aren't any, preferably with a friend, and people will usually join. There is a leveling system but nothing that would really affect gameplay unless you were playing in a Deathmatch mode against some really high level/experienced players. Co-op against dinos is a blast. Co-op against Santa is a blast. This can be a really fun game.			"

												This game, like others have said, is a mixture of Halo and Left 4 Dead in gameplay, with maybe something else thrown in. My computer runs Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and Team Fortress 2 just fine, but for some reason, struggles with this game. I had to lower the graphics settings in-game to their lowest just to even get close to a decent performance. And even then, I didn't find the game that fun. I can see its potential, though. It's just not working for me personally. So my recommendation only comes half-heartedly, but only because I don't think it would be fair to say I don't recommend the game.			"

												If you're like me, you know the meta-score is the first impression of any game. If it's between 70-80 and above, it's worthe considering right?Let me tell you this, ORION: Dino Horde is a good game. Maybe not so much the $15...probably catch it on a sale (sorry devs, but it's a consumer opinion) ORION is pretty damn fun. Really great shoot 'em up, an original concept, and although it has a bug once every 50 play throughs, it's stable. You know how you're on skype with friends and you're all trying to figure out a game to play because you're all bored?

												This game has come a long way since it was initially released upon the public and made quite an impact for being a terrible game. At the time of it's release this game was clearly a half-♥♥♥♥♥ and unfinished game with uncountable amounts of bugs, only 2 or 3 maps and about 3 types of dinosaurs. This is all the past now, and though this may not be a perfect game it is a fun arcade style shooter to play with your friends.The game now sports about a dozen different game modes and maps, a nice selection of weapons and powerups, a working progression system with 3 class types, over 200 Steam achievements and most bugs have been fixed. If you have a couple of friends with you and you just want to mess around and have a fun time on a game with a silly premise and don't mind mediocre graphics and audio then this is absolutely for you, if on the otherhand you like to play a serious survival game then this might not be for you.This game as I mentioned is no where near perfect, the graphics are pretty mediocre as are the visual effects. The audio quality is quite good especially with the Dinosaur sound effects like the T-Rex's roar (you might want ear defenders for that), the voice acting however isn't the best but that's to be somewhat expected of this type of game. The game runs very smoothly for the most part with a couple of graphical artifacts here and there but nothing I've found gamebreaking yet, and there are lag spikes when waves end on survival.Taking a little step away from the technical problems of this game and looking into the gameplay though is where this game is great, it's perfectly fun to play for an hour or two every now and then prefferably with friends and just have a blast shooting dinosaurs with handcannons, shotguns, gatling guns, sniper rifles, lasers, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and so much more. It's great fun to try taking some risk with your friends and making bets like who can ride the T-rex without getting eaten or who can kill the spinosaurus with a knife and whatever else you can think of doing at the time. Theres plenty of objectives to keep you occupied in game and well paced time intervals between rounds and the large dinosaurs each have their own unique traits.Overall I'd give this game a solid 7/10 for being a great improvement on it's initial release and a stupid but fun arcade style shooter. I mean it's got jetpacks, dinosaurs and tanks! What more could you possibly ask for?			"

												Have you ever wanted to play Halo 3, or Borderlands but you were too ♥♥♥♥ing stingy? Well Orion Dino Horde is the game for you! Bungie, and 2k obviously stole many aspects from this game. Including the borderlands vehicle controls, the second wind, actions, and many other aspects from borderlands. Now on to the halo guns, textures, hornets, and character models. Great Game! This quote perfectly shows this game ""I paid $3.99 for this game, and its better than most of my other $60.00 games.			"

												If you hate dinosaurs, then this is your golden opportunity.Jokes aside, it's no doubt worth the money. It provides exciting and sometimes terrifying (spinosaurus, deinosuchus, t-rex) combat against various kinds of dinosaurs. You get to use many types of weapons and other tools of destruction such as VTOLs and tanks. Pros:- Surprising amounts of depth and customization via classes, their weapons and augments that let you play the way you want- Unreal engine means it runs smoothly and provides great visuals- Voice commands and taunts to help you communicate and annoy easily- Gigantic (and smaller) dinosaurs with very impressive animations and diverse approaches to combat- A leveling system to give you a feel of progression and achievement- An open-world game mode which I've not yet tried but sounds very interesting- The developers seem committed and appear to release updates frequently- Many large and beautiful maps to fight onCons:- It still needs some work, certain things such as player characters (and the mech) have lackluster animations- While it doesn't really hold any merit in deciding if a game is good or not, its ""Metascore"" is low (*)- I'm unsure of this, but it doesn't seem like you're able to earn any in-game cosmetics* = It depends on the person whether or not they think Metacritic provides an accurate review of the product. Dino Beatdown (the game's former name) didn't go too well and this most likely means that certain people will be discouraged from buying ORION: Dino Horde. There are rumors swirling around Metacritic, saying that the reviewers are paid off by larger corporations to make their product seem better. Besides, reviews are essentially opinions.			"

												The metascore is definitely something you should just ignore. The developers have really done a fantastic job and I hope that they will continue to do so. The gameplay (survival) can become boring since you're playing it over and over again but if you're playing it with your friends it can be extremely fun. With all the current features that it has e.g. gamemodes, weapons, vehicles etc. that will definitely expand in the future I recommend it.			"

												I probably paid somewhere around $10 for this game when it was actively being worked on. It was one of the first early access games that I purchased and my friend and I had a blast killing dinosaurs. You used to be able to purchase vehicles as well as weapons. For whatever reason they took out the vehicle purchasing building. There are still vehicles, but they are spread out across the map in little outpost like areas. You could say it makes it more challenging. I would say it takes away a bit of the tactical choices and freedom of playing the game the way you like. When I played the community wasn't huge, but usually saw a pretty high uptick in players when it went on sale. There are a lot worse games for $0.99 or less. I would recommend this game, if you you have a friend that would like to blow away a bunch of dinosaurs with you. Well worth the $0.99.			"

												Killing dinosaurs in a futuristic environment sounds fun... and it is. Especially if you play it with some friends. Grab your guns, upgrade yourself with some augments and kick some a$$. Leveling up gives you some bonuses.You can choose between three different classes (Assault, Support, Recon) which only vary slightly. What makes every player different is how they customize their augments. This is by no means a bad thing. You are not stuck to a special weapon set depending on your class. You want to be a jetpacking shotgun maniac or a sniping medic? No problem. It's all up to you.I have to admit the weapon balance isn't that great. There is no effective automatic gun. To do good damage you have to pick either a shotgun or sniper rifle.The maps are huge and it can take a few minutes to arrive on the other side without a vehicle. That's great but therefore they havent many maps available. For each map there is a day and a night variation but this makes nearly no difference to the actual gameplay. Map objectives seem to appear on random locations every time so it's at least not exactly the same experience every time.Vehicles variety is awesome. There aren't many different vehicles available but they are all different from each other. Steering a minigun welding mech or fly around in a harrier... It's fun. Navigating left or right by using the mouse is something you have to get used to. Other controls are easy to go.So the overall gameplay is pretty solid but at some points it's a little bit glitchy when it comes to player positioning. In some cases you can get stuck in walls and the hitboxes of the tiny dinosaurs are a little bit weird.What drives me mad somehow is the ""Spiral Store"" where you can buy Hats and colors for real money. This would be perfectly O.K. for me in a free to play game but not in a full priced game. It doesn't affect gameplay but getting them as rewards for achievements would be way more appreciated. It can get boring after a while since it's the same again and again. It offers some different gamemodes but in the end it is PvP or survival... Since player positioning sucks it's only surivival for me. This is why I would recommend to get this game only if you have some friends to play this game together in Co-Op since this makes it a lot more enjoyable.This is my opinion about the game and may differ from yours...TL;DRPersonal rating:6 Fair | out of 10The good:+ Alot of different perks/augments+ Vehicles+ Huge maps+ Plenty of gamemodes+ Simple controlsThe bad:- Weapon balance- Glitchy hitboxes- Low amount of maps- Fancy hats from the trailer only for real money- Gets boring if you play it alone			"

												I don't know what's so satisfying about an FPS with temporary and permanent upgrades that's all about killing dinosaurs but I love it. The music is repetative as hell but catchy, it'll be the only thing you might not like and will probably turn off or at least lower it, it's pretty much most the sound. If you haven't seen this game, it has a Kickstater called the Orion project and they plan on making this game an entire precedural universe with story and such. I can't wait for that, I bought this on a Steam sale way before I heard about that and I'm glad I did. I can only run this beasty in 720p or my 440GT takes a duece but that just shows that it wants to have more graphical power. The game runs gorgeously with dynamic lighting and has amazing textures.

												The Metascore given by critics to this game is very misleading as this game deserves somewhere between 80-90 score. Good gameplay - almost the same if you combine Halo and Jurassic Park together. Makes you nervous everytime you queue solo for the game. Best to play it in multiplayer. Slight bugs on the dinosaurs but its a great game to have.			"

IF YOU'VE ANSWERED NO TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS, DO A 360 AND RE-EVALUATE YOUR LIFE CHOICES IN LIFE. BECAUSE THIS IS THE GAME FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS (AND THE OCCASIONAL QUADRAPED) TO TRULY FEEL SWEET JUSTICE AGAINST THAT VEGETARIAN STEGASAURUS THAT KILLED YOUR FAMILY BACK IN 'NAM. YOU OWE IT TO THEM (AND THE PRESIDENT) TO SEEK JUSTICE AND REVENGE. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. TAKE IT, BECAUSE IT IS A DANGER TO YOURSELF IF YOU GO ALONE, SO BRING FRIENDS. NOT ME THOUGH, I'M BUSY.			"

												A cooperative, wave survival, class based FPS that forgoes pomp and circumstance for a more pick-up-and-play kind of experience. Similar to games like Killing floor, but with dinos instead of zambos. You fight little dinos, get better weapons, upgrades and perks, collect xp to strengthen 1 of 3 classes, fight big dinos, get killed, rage quit, drink heavily, rinse and repeat. The game is a little clunky at times, but it's solid fun with frands for just a buck.			"

I don't see why anyone could complain about such a well done FPS Dinosaur game- Freaking Dinosaurs man!!!!  I love the game mechanics, and the multiplayer is surprisingly solid.  By far the best game I've played seen on steam.  So many weapons, vehicles, upgrades, perks and maps make this game a HUGE online experience that everyone should have the opportunity to play.  Almost flawless, and still coming out with updates, I think Spiral developers are some of the greatest developers out there!  Keep doing what you're doing guys!			"

												At first, this is a game you'll hate a lot, but as I found out, it quickly gets to be more fun as you invest time into it.  Animations are, pretty sub par, and there are some questionable bugs in the game that break it, and, it's soundtrack is forgettable.  But ignoring those features to the basic bits, you've got a game built around co-op that has a competitive feature.  The co-op includes the 3 classes where each one contributes to the game in a major way.  Recons eliminate dinos and do stealthy revives/repairs on the generator.  Supports are the only class that can heal anyone on the team, as well as tanking with their beefy life.  Assault, well, it's pretty basic, he goes places fast and kills things fast.  Competitive allows the player to play as the dinosaurs too, which is actually kind of fun, though I must say I haven't had much experince in that department.Overall, all I can say is, you get a pretty good laugh and great feeling after you punch a T-rex in the face and either A. Kill it, or B. It eats you and regains life.7.5-8/10 It does need work, but hell, it makes you laugh and it has a good core.			"

												Hi. I'm going to review my thoughts on this game.Overall thoughts:This game is epic overall. It really sells the picture of a game you can enjoy. It's like buying a can of coffee, only this game keeps you awake for much longer. I wouldn't say this is like the greatest game ever, God knows this game is far from perfect. But this is the kind of game that makes you want to get ready to whatever you have to do later, like studying for a test, for example.Review:[ Note: Not just my opinion. Also using a critical standpoint right now. ]Pros:1: It's free to play.2: It keeps you awake, more than just coffee.3: It takes you to a place you've never been before.4: It has some really good customizable ♥♥♥♥ in the main menu.Cons:1: The game is full of glitches.2: No one really plays it anymore.Ratings and final review: I would say this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. I reccomend it to ANYONE. It is far from perfect, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Nothing is perfect. And that's part of the fun, right?My personal rating: 8.2/10.			"

												First of all, the metacritic review is off, yes. But the real score is not that high after adjusting it either.First off, the problems I encountered right off the bat:- Connecting to a game is hard, most lobbies are either full, or always stay in lobby mode. (On a side note, why do people make lobbies and never start a game is beyond me).-More than half the time you do try to connect to a game, its a time out error.Other issues:-Collision detection is akin to  early 2000-era fps games. You know, when you'd hit a couple of pixels and the target gets a a set amount of damage?-Small targets near impossible to hit, even when point blank. I'm not talking pin point accuracy, I'm talking a full shotgun blast at point blank range, the crosshair is on top of a compy, you fire... and no damage registers. The compy has no problems biting you all the while this happens.- You steer with the mouse. Very un ergonomic, and not very useful when you need to do some maneuvering and ensure your vehicle gives a proper firing angle while avoiding running into the big dinosaurs (which will essentially chain combo your vehicles into oblivion).- On a related note: if your vehicle is trapped against a wall (or any structure) and you need to get out, you better hope your exit point is not against it... as you'll see the getting out animation, the character hits the object, and you're magically in the seat you were again. Granted, this doesn""t happen often... no wait it does! It happens every time a dino hits your vehicle and you are sent flying to a place the developers never designed a vehicle to be positioned (hint: any place a dino can bump your vehicle to, that is not the ground).- Annoying slow down every time the game considers a ""great kill"" has been made. Useless, and more often than not throw off your timing when fighting as a team.When it works, it can be a rewarding experience. The problem is getting it to work.On a side note, I have played the original, and other than a graphical overhaul, I see no difference, heck the other version let me connect at least. "

												ORION: PreludeWould totally recommend this game! It's a fun dino FPS that's great for playing with friends. You capture bases, buy weapons, get upgrades, and fight off dino hordes!PLUS if you like getting achievements there are tons that come really easily, mostly from just casually playing the game.Picked this up for $1.50 in the steam summer sale and would give it an 8 - 10			"

												Pretty cool game. My friend bought the 4-pack when it was on sale for super cheap and gifted me a copy.It's a fun FPS game and it was definitely worth the 75 cents. I'm not 100% sure it would be worth 15 dollars though. If this game goes on sale for like 8 dollars, go ahead and snag it. I don't think it's great enough that you would want to buy it at the normal 15 dollar price.It's still a really cool game, especially with friends.Edit: Now that it's 99 cents, you really can't go wrong with this especially if you're new to steam and don't have many games.

												Hi. I'm going to review my thoughts on this game.Overall thoughts:This game is epic overall. It really sells the picture of a game you can enjoy. It's like buying a can of coffee, only this game keeps you awake for much longer. I wouldn't say this is like the greatest game ever, God knows this game is far from perfect. But this is the kind of game that makes you want to get ready to whatever you have to do later, like studying for a test, for example.Review:[ Note: Not just my opinion. Also using a critical standpoint right now. ]Pros:1: It's free to play.2: It keeps you awake, more than just coffee.3: It takes you to a place you've never been before.4: It has some really good customizable ♥♥♥♥ in the main menu.Cons:1: The game is full of glitches.2: No one really plays it anymore.Ratings and final review: I would say this game is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. I reccomend it to ANYONE. It is far from perfect, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Nothing is perfect. And that's part of the fun, right?My personal rating: 8.2/10.			"

												If you're looking for a triple AAA platnum seller, then go look somewhere else, but if you're looking for a shooter that runs decently where you kill dinosaurs just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, then you've come to the right store page! First of all, the game has a really cheap price tag attached to it, but that doesn't mean it's not a good game. Again, it's no game of the year award winner, but you really get a lot out of this for the price you pay, especially if you're buying it for only $1. If nothing else, it makes for a great game to play on rainy days when you lose your internet connection. Just fire up the game, turn on bots, and have more fun than you might expect. I played this once a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but recently I played it again and was surprised to see that the devs have been updating the game, which is really saying a lot when you think about how little most devs care once they get your money. So come on! Buy the game, install it, and have yourself some fun. It's $0.99 and I can pretty much guaranty that you'll get your money's worth out of it.			"

												You may expect a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game (as I did), but you are wrong - this is one of the best co-op shooters for a unreasonably low price. Futuristic soilders fighting dinosaurs is a weird combo, but it turns out great. Well-balanced classes, weapons and enemies is the most important part of a shooter, and this game has it. It's a little bit confusing at the beggining, but when you get used to it it's a easy to play.The only thing I dislike is the heavy GPU usage. It maxes out my 760 and only gives about 70fps, which is about the same as I get in BF4. The graphics are not something amazing, but good enough to not ruin the experience.Overall, this is an amazing game, well worth the 80 cents it costs. The developers are great people, pricing this game at such a low price, while it is surely worth at least 5x more and I respect that very much. Will be buying more copies for friends!			"

												After wading into this game with unceremoniously low expectations and a halfish-hour of actual game time solo (the rest was toying with tweaks to get some enhancements working), I can at least say my expectations were met and there is a decent game underneath this. Disregarding the, um, troubled history that I found out after.Sure, there's no tutorial, motion blur is apparently not working, the trailer is an amateur looking montage of gameplay with quotes from who knows where, the animation is abyssmally 1999 (a F- I'd say), the visuals are some sort of bland thing reminding me of Serious Sam 2 and Halo: Combat Evolved and the gameplay is a mix of older Unreal, current class based affairs and Halo gunplay and vehicular antics, but with DINOSAAAAURS. Still there's at least a fundamentally good game at the core.The HUD needs some better iconography (I had to guess at what the heck the two bars were), the animation completely ruins the look for me and the sound effects are absolutely terrible. Gameplay-wise the general mode seems to be Survival (I just tried that solo) where you have to protect or otherwise secure objectives from marauding waves of dinosaurs, with opportunities to buy character perks or equipment as you go. There are also some PvP modes and an apparent laundry list of features in this here store page, but they aren't elaborated much in game.It's kind of like Killing Floor in a Turok setting, but with terrible production values. If you're looking for the next bit of fun to spend 99 cents on, I'd certainly say okay.Sure, it's artistically strongly inspired, but uncreative ideas don't necessarily mean bad ones.			"

												I've got to admit, I was a little bit skeptical towards this game, for it was only half a buck and it was kind of a silly setting killing dinosaurs with heavy weapons and mechs and tanks and flying around firing missiles.On the other hand, it is kind of a silly setting killing dinosaurs with heavy weapons and mechs and tanks and flying around firing missiles. What could be better than that?It's like advanced Killing Floor with dinosaurs. Fewer classes but vehicles. Fewer weapons but augmentations. There are way more game modes and except for some tiny way finding problems, the bots in solo games are not that bad.In sum, ORION: Prelude is a great mind candy.			"

												I bought it at $0.62. Why haven't you?Didn't expect much from a $0.62 game initially but after playing i loved the horde based gameplay.Wave after wave will try to attack your generator which you have to defend or repair with occasional objectives you have to accomplish. The map has vehicles scattered all around and each map is different and the effect that comes with it makes it more appealing.""Peak"" is a winter map and your visor can get frozen while playing and this forces you to search for a warm place to melt the ice off. The light reflecting off the snow also makes it harder to spot smaller dinos.""Raupi"" is a tropical map where rain starts to pour in mid game. Really gotta love the rain droplet effect on your visor and the weather makes it hard to spot the pterodactyls flying overhead.During each round you'll get to access upgrades and different weapons while they throw at you different types of dinos that range from velociraptors to T-Rexs.However, if you're playing in Asia, you might find the servers lacking in number. You can still host listen servers or play singleplayer with bots.I'd say i got my money's worth from this game at that flash sale price ^_^			"

												I'm not too sure why this game has such a low meta score.  I only played this for 17 minutes and that was during the free weekend, to make a let's play, and during that time, I had a lot of fun.  Sure, the shooting isn't the best but the concept and the graphics are awesome!I only played this on easy so I don't know if the dinosaurs would be harder on the harder levels or if you just have less ammo etc... but shooting dinosaurs is quite good fun!This is one of them times where you shouldn't actually listen to metacritic and just go ahead and buy the game.I have to admit though, this game is not worth £11.99, maybe just £5 but I would recomend it to anyone for just 99p! This is a really good game overall and I liked it a lot! You can see a full let's play of it here: www.youtube.com/tomthecubegaming (the let's play will be going up later today)			"

Its like primal carnage or Dino D-day just more terrible and with crack down skin over it just with all the good elements ripped out.

												This game is terrible. First 2 minutes sure that was fun but after that its terrible. The reviews below are misleading the trailer is nothing like the game, this is just Halo with Dinosaurs. The game is full of microtransactions and full of glitches. Do not trust the trailers or reviews that are postitive the developers are lying and this is not even worth putting on your Hard Drive even if its free. DO NOT be pulled into the heap of trash which is Orion: Dino Horde			"

												So. The Dino bit is...ok. Not that good overall. Then you open up a new ugly can of worms with actual PVP. Oh, good god is that horrible. The guns all feel the same. Bad. It's clunky and rough. accidenally alt-tabbed out and everything froze. I mean my computer on a whole. It was weird and easily fixed but still didn't bode well when the Voice button is ALT. yeah.

												I ventured into this game excited by the void in my heart which could be filled with dinosaurs. However I came out of this game with half my brain missing. It is very poor. Furthermore this game along with Chivalry Medieval Warfare have been getting rather jealous recently as I havn't played them for a while. They have started to attack and pillage my internet connection. As a result i have rung up BT and they are sending me a new home hub. All because this game is garbage and gets jealous of other, better games on the market. Avoid if you enjoy your sanity/internet connection.			"

												This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is ♥♥♥♥, but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something.  You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it.  It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents.  If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself.  This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes.  You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans.  Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents.  This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support.  Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason.  Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos?  This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that.  Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.			"

												I know this has a horrible Metacritic score and lots of bad reviews here on Steam. But for the price (which is currently $0.99), it is worth it. At a dollar BUY THIS GAME. It's sort of like Killing Floor with better graphics but not as good of a trader system. The maps are large and vast. The dinosuars, especially the freaking flying ones do give a challenge. If you like Co-op games and can get the 4-pack for $3 and have friends who will play with you, it's fun. You'll enjoy it when you kill that large croc with a barrage of missles and gunfire from the flying croc killer (sorry don't know what that flying thing is called but it's fun). There is a community of players and that should tell you that the game is at least worth $1 or checking out.			"

												Let me start by saying this is by FAR the most poorly optimized game I've ever played. For the first hour or so of playing, the game would tab out every 5-10 minutes for windows to tell me that the game was a memory leak (though this did eventually stop for god knows what reason). Upon closing the game, the windows UI was glitched beyond recognition (probably due to all the window switching while in game) and I had to restart my computer to fix it.Regarding the gameplay, Original it is not. The art assets are ripped from Halo (except for the dinosaur models/skins, which are just plain hilariously bad), the sound clips are ripped from Left 4 Dead and the gameplay is a simplified Killing Floor. There are 3 classes to choose from, but it becomes immediately apparent that Assault is the only viable one because without a jetpack you WILL die. The enemy AI is godawful, so the game compensates by throwing EVERY DINOSAUR IN EXISTENCE at you. Orion: Dino Horde is just a mess of things thrown together. To its credit though, it does have its moments of enjoyability, and I'm sure this game would be EXTREMELY fun to play while under the influence. Though I'm not sure what I was expecting when even the trailer for the game is trying to tell me ""please don't listen to the metacritic reviews"".			"

ORION: Prelude ORION: Dino Beatdown ORION: Dino Horde ORION: Dino DLC is a shining light in an otherwise dark and gloomy sea of poorly thought out RPGs, Shooters, and MMOs. This game is completely flawless in every way, a perfect example of a 10/10 rating, a number given too often to sub-par titles such as Mass Effect and Call Of Duty. ORION: Dino Beatdown is an instant classic, and surely stands up to the best as an action adventure indie casual racing game. For only $8.99 $14.99 (Plus the price of any of the fabulous DLC you can purchase! I recommend the Gangnam Style dance pack myself!), you can't afford not to add this amazing title to your collection. Don't forget to donate to the Kickstarter for the upcoming ORION Project too!

												36/100.The score you see upon entering this page, and trust me, this is NOT for this state of the game, from what I can understand,this game got that score when it was released in an early version that had many problems with graphics, gameplay, etc,from which it gained poor reviews,and caused people to hate the game, leaving it with that score.I choose to ignore that score, and buy it in the sale.Thank god I did.I can say from my experience, this is, THE BEST, multiplayer dino game to play with friends, other games such as Primal Carnage and Dino D-Day are fun, but I haven't had quite as many laughs and fun from those games than this one. Me and my friend agree that this has the most variety of any dinosaur game out there, (which I will list in the good and bad points of this game). Now, by no means is this a ""10/10 OMG BEST GAME EVARS"" game, this game certainly has it's faults, for me it's the store, which involves *gasp* micro-transactions to buy hats and taunts[where does that sound familiar?], but again, buying in-game items is not necessary to win in game,*cough*EA*cough*.Good Points: Well optimized -At least for me. This game runs at a great FPS on my PC, and my computer isn't the best in the world by any means, ;-;Variety - Oh god, where do I start? Ride vehicles,Be a dinosaur,Be a human,choose from a large choice of weapons, so many gamemodes to choose from, (adding more apparently)CO-OP/Online Multiplayer - The spiral community seems to be one of the nicer end of the web game communities, playing online with friends/random peeps is always fun, there is always so much going on.Sound- The dialogue in this game (while little), is just a JOY to listen to, the 3 human classes all have something funny to say at the best of times,the music can sometimes be good, and the announcer, oh , the announcer, I won't dare spoil what he says when you get a 10+ kill streak, but it had me laughing for at least 30 seconds.Updates- I have never see any other developer update the game in so many good ways in such a short period of time, whether it being open worlds, new weapons, more detail in-game. As soon as I see this game update, I play it, just to seewhat they've added, and usually stay in for ages as I get hooked into it.Bad Points: Single Player- Sadly, this is what kinda lets it down for me, it is advertised as a ""Single-player"" game, and for me, it really isn't all that special, as it's basically the same mode as in co-op, just, on your own, *Insert forever alone face here*, also, here are many modes you CANNOT play alone.Sound(again)- However, some of the sound kinda lets it down, the dino sounds are quite poor, and often lacking from some, the music is OK but some sounds really need to be fixed, (If you're wearing headphones, like I was, be readyfor a T-Rex roar, it will break your headphones)Well, this is my first in-depth review, and for a good reason; this game doesn't deserve that 36/100 stamped on this page, if your interested in dinosaurs, good online play, or just a variety of things to do in a game, here's my advice to you;1. Wait for this game to go for a F2P weekend/watch some UPDATED gameplay videos.2. Buy it in a sale (Last time it was 99p!)Final words; I paid 99p in a sale for this, I would gladly pay the £11.99 for it, if the updates continued as good as this, and just for the sheer joy factor :)Thanks for reading!

												I love this game for what it is meant to be. Gotta get that out there first. If you are looking for a mature, story driven game with deep tactical combat, intelligent AI, and characters of any sort, you will be sorely dissapointed. This game is stupid fun, comically bad AI, silly unrealistic physics, oversimplified PVP, and less in depth than several of the games you might be used to.  It tries to do many things at once (it has PVP, PVE, open world, not open world, leveling systems, vehicle combat, augments like jetpacks and invisibility), and only does them all about half as well as it could. That said... The game is fully aware of what kind of game it is, and the developers know exactly what you wanted out of this kind of game, and boy do they deliver. The pvp is mostly laughable, but when you have been playing co-op with a group of friends it is perfect to switch to and just start murdering each other for a change. The game will make you laugh as you discover its secrets (you can surf dinosaurs and helicopters, and there are achievements for that too). The game is best when played with friends, but you do not have to bring any. I got the game alone and played random games without friends, but easily found a regular group of people to play with. People are helpful if you ask for help, and people WANT to be your friend. Be a little social in games and you will be rewarded. There are plenty of people that play this game, it has only gotten more popular with time, so you will never be in a situation where you cannot find an open game (or at least I have yet to ever be in that situation). Finally, the developers are active. They introduce new things all the time (like the open world Conquest mode) and apparently are going to upgrade everyone's game for free very soon (just like they did with their previous game). This game is easily worth the $15 price tag in my opinion, but goes on sale for less than a dollar all the time so you can just wait for when that happens. So all in all, 9/10 for the kind of game that it is and tries to be. Buy this game if you ever enjoy playing games for fun. You are sure to find many new friends in the game as you madly laugh like a wildman when you create a firey tornado of death with your flamethrower as you ride the back of a T-rex and hundreds of raptors flee before you in sheer terror.

												This game is more of a ""so bad it's good"" kinda deal. For literally 99 cents, you really shouldn't be expecting something along the lines of an actual good game. But for some reason, despite me not playing it much (only 4 hours clocked at the time of writing this), I've had some actual fun with it. There's some bugs and graphical problems. Not to mention that on the topic of graphics, the graphics are just mediocre. The variety of weapons is pretty standard along with the option to pick up insane Adrenaline weapons. Essentially this game can be described as something similar to Killing Floor on a budget. The concept of surviving incoming waves of enemies is standard, but ORION takes some liberties in the form of objectives that need securing, the occasional mini boss dinosaur in the form of a triceretops/stegosaurs/T-Rex. There's also the option to select perks while in game to boost your chances of survival.In all honesty the gameplay is pretty much the same as a lot of FPS's. You get a selection of three classes which all serve basic, generic roles. Assault are front line gunners and carry larger weapons. The medic is just that, a battle medic with the ability to heal teammates. Finally there's the Recon, the obligatory stealth class. The only slightly unique thing about the classes is that the Assault gets a jetpack that only serves limited use.All in all if you're looking for a cheap game that you can fart around with your friends in, this is a good game to pick up. Just don't expect anything grand and don't expect to play this game much except for the off night you and your pals are bored out of your skulls.			"

												 I would recommend this game, for sure. But it has it's up and downs, and I'll go through both.Positives: -There's nothing that compares to battling a T-Rex one-on-one with only a pistol and a medigun that can recharge yourself.-Team-play is quite fun, too. The gameplay is simple enough that you can slaughter dinos without doing much thinking, which is exactly what it says on the tin.-It is pretty stable, I didn't see any gamebreaking bugs and it works just as it's supposed to.-The Killing Floor styled gameplay works really well with dinosaurs.-The vehicles are varied and quite fun. -The Adrenaline weapons are a nice touch.-Do I really have to explain how fun it is to fight hordes of raptors while using a Jetpack? Steam, you should know this.-None of the weapons felt 'Useless' in the sense that I could do decent damage with almost anything.Negatives:-The Support Class has VERY racist dialogue, I don't appreciate the fact that he calls his teammates ""Homies"" and ""Dawg"" just because he's of African decent. It's not even well-done voice acting so the point of including it at all is mediocre at best and it kind of detracts from the experience. Why couldn't they have race-neutral dialogue? I am kind of disappointed as it lessens the experience of an otherwise solid game.-The price is way too high, however I bought it while it was on sale for only one dollar so I can't complain of this personally. If whoever is reading this doesn't own the game already, pick it up while it's on sale.-There aren't many maps to choose from. It's not that big of an issue, but I could do with a change of scenery. To address this issue, allowing custom maps would be preferable.-The game is very unbalanced, Supports are almost invincible if they have the Iron Pecs perk and the upgrades that make it so you can't die from heights or chomping. On the other hand Recon is nearly useless in all situations. However, this doesn't bug me very much considering I bought this game to casually slaughter lizards, not to engage the finer philosophical and strategic aspects of warfare in a futuristic society. The unbalance is entirely made up for by the fact there's a minigun.Overview:For a Unreal Mod, it has a high production quality, and it definitely deserves a higher metascore than it has in my honest opinion. It deserves at least a 65. If you wish to buy this game, do so while it's on sale, and have fun with it. It's not meant to be a realistic fighting simulator like Counter-Strike, so I don't see why people would complain of the unrealistic setting of a game where you're a space marine fighting dinosaurs on some alien planet. It lost it's realness at ""Dino Horde"", and that's okay. Games are just meant to be played, and I enjoyed every minute of playing this one.			"

												I know this has a horrible Metacritic score and lots of bad reviews here on Steam. But for the price (which is currently $0.99), it is worth it. At a dollar BUY THIS GAME. It's sort of like Killing Floor with better graphics but not as good of a trader system. The maps are large and vast. The dinosuars, especially the freaking flying ones do give a challenge. If you like Co-op games and can get the 4-pack for $3 and have friends who will play with you, it's fun. You'll enjoy it when you kill that large croc with a barrage of missles and gunfire from the flying croc killer (sorry don't know what that flying thing is called but it's fun). There is a community of players and that should tell you that the game is at least worth $1 or checking out.			"

												Quick review:  This is ""Getting Attacked by Endless Impossible to Hit Flying Enemies:  The Game""Seriously.  I can still hear the constant, endless, horrible screeching of the most annoying flying enemy I have ever encountered in a game.  It's Cliff Racers from Morrowind all over again.  I actually have fun playing this game despite the bugs, poor balancing, and lack luster presentation.  It has charm, like B grade sci-fi.  But those flying what-evers kill this game for me.  The guns are so hilariously innaccurate that there is no way you can reliably hit them, forcing you to listen to their screeching while they peck away at your armor, bit by bit, harassing you to the point of insanity.  Yes, my entire problem with the game is not the enumerable other issues that so many point out, but simply the fact that I spend the entire match beset on all sides by what amount to Cliff Racers.  No one liked Cliff Racers.  Not even the devs that made them.If you like Cliff Racers, this game is for you.  If you don't, then get the game when it's a dollar.  Still worth playing with friends.

												I was backed up next to a cliff, surrounded by dinosours, with no escape. Out of the corner of my HUD I see a ally driving over to my rescue in a jeep/car. He clambers out of the vehicle to help me with the growing horde of dinosours. Seeing the oppurtunity I jumped into the jeep and drove off without him. Quickly after leaving the player that had selflessly come to my rescue I see a death-message pop up saying he had died. 11/10; Would abandon an ally again.			"

												Do not buy this game. I installed it since it's free for a limited time. The only remotely unique thing about this game is that it has dinosaurs so I was like heck yeah I can play as my favorite dinosaurs. But they're slow and clunky and if a human player jumps up on a rock, or even stands next to a rock, there's no way to reach them. The attacks have absolutely no range and seem to do nothing even if the human player should be within range.The only good thing about this game is that you can see some dinosaur models that have animations. Beyond that, it's not even worth a dollar.			"

												What isn't there to say about this gem of a game?The developers took a common staple multiplayer game, L4D2, and challenged the concepts that make that game great.""Why are their zombies? The story just doesn't make sense!"" They exclaimed, and went to work fixing all they could.The end result? An amazing amalgamation of Amazing graphics backed by an abnormally high framerate, incredible gamemodes and features that make it a complete blast to play, and amazingly polished combat. Don't even get me started on the incredible menu design and feedback.If you're going to buy lunch, do yourself a favour and buy ORION: Dino Horde instead, and even better, buy some for your friends also.A solid 11/5 from me, if only I could go higher.

Its a great 11 round shooter that has a similar set up and play style to borderlands but its a survival game with vehicles youd see in Halo or mechwarrior. If you ever played Sanctum/orcs must die etc youll like the game. It reminds me of alot different game mechanics from other games. Online is solid, lots of bots to help you :3 My only issue that is the interface to buying weapon and augments are not the same and some what complicated/confusing, augments you double click and weapons you have to click the green purchase.

												ORION: Prelude is a game that had such a low price that I had no idea if it was actually going to be a quality product. Fortunate for me, this is a unique and fun shooter game, and all the problems I had did not subtract the overall fun I had with the game.ORION: Prelude is a game in which you shoot dinosaurs (or robo-santa in the Christmas map), but it is not a normal game with team deathmatch or anything. The player (and any friends or internet people, as this game has the multiplayer option) faces 10 waves of dinosaurs while buying weapons and upgrades. However, there are many different gameplay modes, many which I still need to experience.The game has good controls, if with a bit of a delay and a bit sluggish, but the sluggish controls can usually be fixed by editing the mouse sensitivity. The graphics are okay, and the dinosaurs looks rather stupid and not very well animated, to be honest (the bigger bosses in particular). However, they get the job of being a hitbox done pretty well.The sound and music is decent enough. Nothing spectacular, but worth listening to if you want to. However, where this game pulls through is the actual gameplay itself. It is incredibly satisfying to shoot dinosaurs and buy weapons, with loads of different weapons to try. The player can have different lives and be revived or, in a similar way to COD Zombies, take down one dinosaur to be revived with all weapons. Anyway, this game is designed for multiplayer, but the genius fact about the game is that there are bots in both modes. Therefore, when playing single player, bots will help you take down dinosaurs, and they actually are well programed and an actual help, which is a problem in a lot of games with bots on your team. Also, there is loads of content (different gamemodes and quite a few different maps), as well as achievements for those who like to collect those sorts of things. In total, this game entertaining buy and is certainly worth buying and revisisting from time to time. Playing it with friends is a good idea, but not required to enjoy the game, as there is single player and random online lobbies. Anyway, there are some hinderances, such as the sound, the graphics, and glitches (I didn't mention any yet, but I have heard of some glitches from others and have experienced a glitch myself in which the upper half of the screen has a purple tint. The purple tint is easily fixed by using ctr + alt + delete and to go to your desktop and then just entering the game again with no restart or anything). However, these can all be ignored and leave a fun game that can certainly be fun for a good while and kill time. Somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10.			"

												This game has brought me enjoyment it is true;  from its derpy triceratops to its ""laser swords"" that definitely were TOTALLY original. This game has brought me joy, not from its gameplay but by the pure BS that the developers have pulled to make this game into the guano it deserves to be. The graphics look like they should run on a potato, maybe 2 potatoes if they are small. The guns are ripped from other games and it is frustrating to see that there was a complete lack in creativity during the development of this game. I bought the game on a whim because all I would be losing was a dollar. Is this game worth what I paid for it? Not entirely based on the fact that the servers always dropped connection or that it took several minutes to boot properly. After playing this game for the amount I did, I am not sure if it can ever ""run"" properly. I laughed at the shear derpiness of the dinosaurs rather than enjoying the game itself and that is worrisome for me because now it just sits in my library. This game just taunts me now and I wonder what else I could have done with that dollar.			"

												Every bit worth what I paid for it...I should have prefaced this review with some facts:- I purchased this game at the last major Steam sale (or my wife did for me, rather)- You get to kill Dinosaurs- Clear plotline, but you get to kill dinosaurs- For the most part mechanically sound- The developers seem fairly responsive to the (reasonable) desires of customers- I think it's a great thing when a group of people like this comes together and designs something so very colorful, creative and minimally buggy, without the resources of a entertainment titan like EA, Activision, etc... If you want to argue the semantics of Unrealy Engine, whatever- Just try it if you've got the spare change and could use a good laugh.- It's fun, it's silly, and if you can look at it through that lens it's a great once in a while to do by yourself or with friends!- on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7. If you want to be ULTR@ SERIOUZZZ, go play Call of Duty; you will be (un)welcomed to play by scores of misogynists, racists, proto-rapists, fratboys, and <insert next offensive term here> in a super serious FPS!

												ORION: Dino Horde is a painfully average game and still feels like a Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, even with all the updates it received so far. There's nothing that makes it stand out from similar games and it has a long way to Killing Floor levels of greatness. However, if you think that aforementioned KF really need vehicles, dinosaurs and jetpacks, or you're really tired of zombies – wait for ORION to go on a sale and grab it. Everyone else, save yourselves some time.I've made a longer version of the review, available here - http://www.coffeebreakgaming.co.uk/pc-game-reviews/review-orion-dino-horde/ "

												Great Game actually. I see a lot of reviews sayin how the publisher is a piece of crap and all that stuff, I have to say that the game itself is pretty nice. The idea of the game is simple but hey, if you are a casual gamer like me who just need to wind down a bit after work, this game is perfect. It is an easy goin' dino shootin' fps with nice graphics and a very friendly game community. There is no fancy campaign or complicated mechanics in the game, no scheming no grand strategy, just some good old fashioned brainless action packed shooting. And that is good enough for me. Of course, if you are a hardcore gamer looking for a challege, this game is not for you. But if all you want is sometime away from it all, this game is the perfect choice. 9/10			"

												Every bit worth what I paid for it...I should have prefaced this review with some facts:- I purchased this game at the last major Steam sale (or my wife did for me, rather)- You get to kill Dinosaurs- Clear plotline, but you get to kill dinosaurs- For the most part mechanically sound- The developers seem fairly responsive to the (reasonable) desires of customers- I think it's a great thing when a group of people like this comes together and designs something so very colorful, creative and minimally buggy, without the resources of a entertainment titan like EA, Activision, etc... If you want to argue the semantics of Unrealy Engine, whatever- Just try it if you've got the spare change and could use a good laugh.- It's fun, it's silly, and if you can look at it through that lens it's a great once in a while to do by yourself or with friends!- on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7. If you want to be ULTR@ SERIOUZZZ, go play Call of Duty; you will be (un)welcomed to play by scores of misogynists, racists, proto-rapists, fratboys, and <insert next offensive term here> in a super serious FPS! Sounds great, right?!Recommend this game! "

												Oh what a mess. Looking through this game's history is quite the nightmare, and makes me glad I have nothing to do with Spiral's PR team (if one even exists). I think the most important thing for anyone looking at this game to note is that it is not at all what it used to be. Over the past couple of years this game has been nurtured and cared for with an obvious love and dedication that I don't often see these days from developers. While the original ORION: Dino Beatdown was a buggy mess, Dino Horde has grown out of that messy goo into something I think plenty of people will enjoy for hours on end.I recently acquired this game while it was on sale for ~$1.00 thinking I would have a good time playing it with my friends, not expecting a whole lot based on steam reviews and such. My goodness was I pleasantly surprised. The first thing that grabbed my attention when I loaded up the game was the depth of the options menu. The sheer amount of UI customization and graphical tweaking available is phenomenal. And they scored major points for allowing me to turn off bloom and motion blur. However I will note that I have not yet found a way to change the controller look sensitivity, which is quite the downside if you prefer to play this with a controller, and stands in stark contrast to the quality of the rest of the options menu.After tweaking controls and graphics options to my heart’s content, my friend and I jumped into a game of survival. Honestly, this is where I think the game suffers the most. We had absolutely no idea what we were doing, and there is very little help to be found online in the forms of wikis or guides. What we did know, was to follow the on screen prompts to turn on our generator. After we managed that, enough help popped up to lead us back to our base to buy weapons and augments (purchasable buffs that last until you die). With the starting money we grabbed a few SMGs and headed outside to kill us some dinos. Once they finally spawned we started frantically murderizing every giant reptile in sight, and they in turn began chewing on our faces. Seems dinosaurs don't appreciate bullets being hurled at them. We quickly discovered that setting the difficulty to medium for your first go might not be the best idea, and we were promptly turned into dino-chow. So we went back to the lobby, turned the difficulty down to easy and tried again. This time we were able to hold our own against the horde of angry reptiles bent on human consumption. Well, at least until wave 7. After we finished playing a few games of survival I found that I craved more, and dino horde was happy to oblige, allowing for an ""open world"" mode they dubbed conquest. In this game mode you can choose from one of two huge maps to play on. One in the arctic and one in the recently added plains. When you load this mode up you are presented with a vehicle or two for traversing the world, and a couple generators you can head towards. When you go to one of the generators and turn it on, you begin a very similar wave driven experience as survival mode, however, if you manage to last the ten waves and secure that outpost, you are rewarded with a load of cash, and the opportunity to go work on securing another outpost. I will admit that I do not know what happens if you secure more than one outpost (I saw three, but didn't have the time to play 30+ rounds). The biggest thing that stands out to me about this game is the fact that the more I play it, the more I discover about it and enjoy it. I have only played two of the twelve (yes, twelve) game modes and already I feel that this game is worth the money they are asking for it. Admittedly it has its share of issues such as no FoV slider, a lack of pertinent help documentation (took us forever to find out how to get more ammo) and a slightly overwhelming number of game modes that have no description. However, even with these things in mind, nothing beats the thrill of fighting a horde of raptors, a t-rex, a stegosaurus, two triceratops, and a deinosuchus all at once in the middle of a rainy night while trying to capture an outpost. I felt like a kid again, and there are so few games these days that give me that thrill and excitement. Definitely give this game a try.			"

												♥♥♥♥ Metacritic and their BS score they gave to the game, it has dinosaurs and thus is awesome as ♥♥♥♥. The game sure has its flaws but for an indie game such is expected, nevertheles a few cons don't rule out the awesomeness like badass close combat action you get to have with super sexy mother♥♥♥♥ing reptiles. 6/5, would bang (the dinosaurs I mean).Okay so Prelude is out and the game is even more awesome than before. They fixed almost all of the FPS drops which is really cool and the only problem I now have (randomly exploding sounds) is because of my sound card so nothing to complain about anymore. Totally worth the money, you definitely should support the makers so we would have more games like this. If you like dinosaurs, you will love the game. It sure can be kinda confusing at the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is the most fun you have had in a long time, especially when playing with friends.Tl;dr: You haven't even lived if you don't own the game already.

												The company responsible for this game stole many asset from Activision for their new game called ORION, more precisely Black Ops 3  and Advanced warfare. At first you might think that this is just some Big Guy is bullying a little company, but even if ACTIVISION is not a respectable company, theft is theft. Also, David Prassel of Trek Industries threatened many people on reddit to sue them if they didn't delete their thread calling out their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ behavior.For more information on their dirty deeds.https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/4q6xo5/activisions_dmca_claim_on_orion_is_legit_orions/Anyway, this game sucked harder than my vacuum cleaner (Repetetive, filled with microtransaction, physic was ridiculous, etc etc).

												Fun to play fighting wave after waves of dinosaurs. It can get boring after a while on your own, so try to play with your friends I enjoyed playing with one of my friend's soo much more than playing on my own. I would recommend you to pay for it.			"

												I can't play this game! I had to put myself into it to play just 1 match, frequent crashes, losing connection from hosts, the servers list doesn't load... there are just too many bugs in this game.When I finally got to play... god...The gameplay is messed up! When you shoot a dinosaur they don't feel anything, they don't stop running. They will only when you kill them. The audio of the guns is a mess. If you shoot with an automatic rifle 40% of the shots will be silent because they are too fast...If you enjoy this game is ok! It's just 0.99 cents right now, but don't buy it if you haven't tried it yet. I had enough after 2 games, there are too many bugs and glitches.			"

												I had this phase where i would buy most anything if it was on sale under 5$ on steam, that Phase ended with Orion dino horde, a very poor game that has mediocre visuals, gunplay, and creativity, its no more than a buggy mess that only pumps out enough entertainment to distract you for a few minutes while waitng for your favorite TV show to come on, and once it does, there's no hesitation to turning it off and getting on with your life. The cummulative money system for weapons is a probably the best idea in the game, and it wasn't ever their's, Counter strike had them beat by at least 10 years, and if you like that system, you should go get Counter strike: GO which is a much better game and i highly recommend it. It doesnt hurt to give them this rating what so ever, 3/10			"

												A game I bought because it was at such a low price, (Like a pound or something) I knew I couldn't of been getting anything great, but I excpected to get some enjoyment out of it.Where to start?First off, the entire game is a horde mode, so the game is essentially a side feature of most games trying to be a full game.The controls are okay, I can figure out how to move and use weapons.The graphics quality is alright, it's nothing at all special.The dinosaur models/textures are kind of out-of-place looking, they look a bit cartoony.Whenever you headshot a raptor, it's head explodes, and it looks awful.The game's lighting is overall very bland and reminds me of when my ENB for Fallout: New Vegas broke.I went down, it told me ""Fight to survive"", there were no dinosaurs around me, so I died.Gunplay is fairly weak.The weapons don't feel real, they still sound like a gentleman coughing on an operahouse.Voice acting is okay I guess.A wide variety of three classes, wow, so many classes to choose from, so hard to decide.Overall this doesn't live up to the reviews shown in the trailer at all, but then again, did you really excpect that?So what are terms for buying it on?If you're really really into dinosaur games, this might be for you, if you're not, well then why are you even here?Overall, boring game, nothing to keep me in it.

												ORION: Dino Horde is a game that brings forth many interesting gameplay mechanics but so far seems to falls short in its execution. The developers definitely have many ambitious goals set for Dino Horde but seem to lack the skill and/or funding to implement them properly. The animation quality is fairly poor and the game is still extremely buggy with texture detail fading in and out constantly, frame rates dropping (even on high end graphics cards) for no apparent reason, in-game audio buging out on occasions and with hitboxes that are just seemingly broken. I would be able to forgive a good many of these short comings if the game was an Early Access title however, seeing as this is a full release and updates have yet to fix these major issues, that’s sadly not the case. Overall the gameplay just feels clunky and underdeveloped with a lack of attention to detail as well as level design leaving much to be desired. I wanted to like this game but unfortunately, in short, I just can’t see myself recommending it in its current state. Rawwr!! 4/10Prelude update - About two days after I posted this review Orion Dino Horde was updated and changed names. I have yet to try Orion since it's update and second name change to Prelude (mainly cause I have no dersire) so I can't say much about the ""improvements"", however one thing I do approve of is the new $0.99 price tag. Still... Last time I played Orion it needed a lot of improvment for me to have given it my recommendation so I'd still be warry if you're considering purchasing this title.			"

												Are you looking for fun, excitement, adventure, and a one way trip to cool visuals?? Well then go and stare at a ♥♥♥♥ing wall. Better yet go and try to moon a King Kobra while 3 feet from it and stare at the ceiling in a hospital because atleast you'll get a nice view as you are in agonizing pain. Seriously, this game is like what would happen if Halo and Killing Floor made love and decided they had better things to do so they chucked the thing off a cliff. But then it was adopted by the brilliant minds that brought you Ride to Hell: Retribution.			"

												As someone who loves dinosaurs and violence this game is the saddest creation on Steam.  Not worth the .99 nor the time to install a free trial.The game has horrible matchmaking connectivity, match sizes are too small, and invites from friends don't work reliably.  The lobby menus are bloated with an obvious cash grab shop and ""look at me"" achievements.  After finally getting into the game the environments are so empty.  Sad textures on bland geometry.  The objectives are agonizingly simple, go here, push button, await dinosaurs.  The AI has simple charge maneuvers with little variance.  Other game modes offer different playstyles, but those are just as droll.  Playing as a dinosaur should be an exciting encounter with you as a 'boss' monster, instead you get mown down in seconds by standard weaponry and vehicles.  The bigger dinosaurs available are sluggish and their hit detection leaves you wondering if you're playing on the same map.  How did the developers attempt to balance smaller dinosaurs against their totally-not-spartan soldiers?  They've strapped 'dino-mite' (oh god this is probably what they called it) onto the back of Compy and Pterodactyls.  Orion: Dino Horde is supposed to be a dinosaur game, or at least about dinosaurs, but there are only two decent selections in the multiplayer.  It is more rewarding to be a faceless marine than the game's namesake.  I would call that a failure.Speaking of ""original"" protagonists.  Models, animations, and even the physics feel so similar to Halo titles it is like the budget was spent paying Bungie's royalties, as if they could afford them.  The guns are such obvious plagiarisms they appear to have been stripped from Halo 2 and altered in the simplest ways.  Round a barrel here, recolor there, different gun!  The worst example is the tank.  It is the Scorpion from Halo shamelessly reused.Orion: Dino Horde is a decent concept, horribly executed.  The developer must be trying some last ditch effort to squeeze money out of the dying player-base.  I've found out there is another game in the works, an open world dino warfare game.  I can only hope that they've learned from their mistakes and attempt to make something different from Dino Horde. Despite all that I've said I did play this game, I did laugh at it with friends, but I still feel shorted. I spent .99 on this game and I wish I could have it back.  It is that bad.TL:DR = One of the worst things you could play.			"

												Single Player: PVE review.  For PVP look for another review.in this, hopefully final, incarnation the game moves into the world of microtransactions.   the game is still unplayable in single player (its just multiplayer mode w/o other players, no bots).  best if experienced w/ friends for a laugh, the game has no fun factor asside from dying with style.  i bought the 4 pack for 4.99 and i feel ripped off.  if your going to support your product w/ microtransactions you need to make it free.  i know it was done to avoid login but do the microtransactions come right out of steam wallet?  (honest question.  i did not have the endurance to explore the store after discovering it)basically this is the same terrible game it has always been.  good for a laugh if in the dollar bin.i am The Evil Dr. F and i DO NOT recommend this game. (unless you and your hordemates can get it for about a buck)URGENT UPDATE 7JUN14: Game still has no realistic Single Player even though it boasts of it on catalog page.  Game still requires friends and a sense of humor to play.  To some extent a willingness to die with style instead of winning is recommended.  It STILL has a store.  Updates have made the game more easy to look at (when crippled, or abducted by a pteranodon).  Still cannot run and jump at same time (so no bunny hopping).			"

												Oh man, this game.Let us begin with the very beginning of this game.It was ♥♥♥♥, just utter ♥♥♥♥, a friend of mine couldn't even play the game back then because when one of us hosted the other couldn't join, we were frustrated by this and thought the game was horrible. We regretted ever buying this game and shelved it for all eternity. However, I remained faithul and watched the development going on from the shadows and I must say, good job Spiral Game Studios! You have shown people they you are one of the few developers that actually give a rats ♥♥♥ about your game and want to make it bigger and better! Gone with the DLC crap, you buy the game you get the updates and DLC for free! Period!I salute you, with the new updates I have gained faith in you again and the news about the Orion Project gave me new hope, I just installed the game again and will try it out, a full review will follow afterwards and I wish this will be my most favorite game, because the new additions are so many for me it should give me a lot of time to try them out, not a fan of PvP but that is my opinnion. Full review coming after real gameplay.Also, for all who see the rating of Metacritic, that was when the game first came out under a different name and was utter ♥♥♥♥, give it a try, show your support to these awesome ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, show them that Indie developers need more support then right corporations that care only for the money and not its fans!Extended Cut;So, I played some more and got into a solo match of Open World, man is that snow coming from the skies? Is that a fricking T-Rex walking around not noticing me? What is going on!I quickly found out that Open World is Open World, a place covered in and by snow, it was snowing when I spawned but after a few minutes it vanished, so I took my jeep, went to the generator and saw it was a generic survival mode, activate the generator and hold out, pff, easy I thought and so it was, I was bored and got the Cryo Blade (Lightsaber) and oh my gosh this thing is powerful, two hits against a mobs head with the 2x damage boost and you are set to go solo mode. Now, why would I continue playing after I defended the generator and have to go to the outpost? Easy, five huge beasts to slay with my trusty VTOL, now the VTOL is great and all, but if you DON'T kill the flying dinosaurs you are pretty much screwed, they chew away your VTOL's armor and the fact that T-Rex throw rocks at you, start flying boy. So, after I got downed I tried to fight the T-Rex who got his little T-Rex friend AND army with him to fight me, eventually I died and thought; ""Screw this, it was fun."" And to my surprise I could revive by killing an enemy, which was awesome, also could my shields regen after I got hit a few times, which worked only once because I got overwhelmed again. So, after a minute of fighting the T-Rex got me and digested me, woops.Also, the fact that there are chests and cabinets with money and/or weapons in them is a neat idea, first loot and then see if you can buy a better and bigger gun, a great idea for people who just hop in and need a bit of extra cash to win the battle!All in all I give it a 9/10, it is a great and awesome game and they did a great job, the snow effect made for some intense fighting because my vision got blurry and frozen as soon as I stepped outside, which made it harder and more challenging, I won't give the 10/10 until I actually play some multiplayer matches with random people and friends and see how it works then, overall a great game if you want to test you luck and survival skill against two T-Rex's and their little buddies, next time I bring my own army of four with me and see how long they can survive against us.

												A good game. Entertaining, Beutiful And- DINOSAURS! The maps are well made. The game is extremelly fun, though lacks a large player base. Deserves more than its current meta score for sure.			"

												I know what you're probably thinking. Someone who has barely any time put into this title wouldn't know anything. But, after shortly playing this game and watching gameplay, I can fully recommend this game. Though the graphics may not be technically 'there', the concept is. If you love to just kick back, relax, and kill, then this is your kind of game. Just ignore the Metacritic rating. In my opinion, it should be at least an 80. There is an amazing weapon selection to choose from along with great objectives and sudden horde bosses. It kind of has a MW3 Survival feel to it which is great. I personally enjoy this type of game and it's just action packed and will keep you on the edge of your chair.			"

												I tried the game serveral hours since it was free to play this week.I really wanted this game to be good since i'm always on the lookout for good coop games, but this game isn't it.Don't get me wrong i definitely had some fun moments when everything was working, some nice games but after a short while i had the feeling that i have seen everything there is to see.Enough fun for 99 cents, but still buggy, especially the server browser.I couldn't sort the servers by ping because it didn't how any ping for the first 2 hours i tested it. So it was gambling if i would find a server with acceptable ping.I couldn't join any game if i tried joining a password protected game until i completely restarted the game.There were some crashes, sending me directly back to the desktop, really annoing if we had a survival nearly finished and no idea how to find the server that i was playing on.In game it felt a little odd sometimes, the weapon handling seemed a little off and the physique of the dinos made for some hilarious sights from time to time. Also the penalty for dieing in the survival mode seems a little harsh. If you die you not only loos all your items, they can be picked up where you died, you loose all your perks and improvements. This penalises dieing in medium or higher difficulties so hard that you might not be able to win the later waves after getting eaten in one round.The only way you can influence the fight after a late death is driving vehicles.I know avoiding death is possible and the meaning of this game mode but somtimes there will be a T-Rex just eating you anyway.I can imagine this game being fun for a short while, if you have friends to play it with even if it crashes from time to time.But playing with randoms in the matchmaking system and then loosing the connection/game crashing mid game can be really dissapointing.Well if i hadn't had those crashes and a really hard time with the server browser i would have recommended this game.Even if it feels a little off from time to time you can still have some nice coop fun with it.Well they advertised in the trailer that they improved everything and made this a great game, after watching Totalbiscuits review of the first relaunch i can see that they actually improved the interface and animations a lot but the new advertising seems to promise too much.

												This game has changed A LOT since release.  What was once a shoddy, broken game is now one of the most jam-packed, jaw-dropping experiences I've ever encountered in a game.  Not only does it have literally every game mode I could ever want it's only $15.Do you like Dinosaurs?  GET IT.Do you like PLAYING as Dinosaurs?  It has 4 (soon to be 10).Do you like tons of guns?  Game has 50+.Do you like cooperative gaming with friends?  4 coop modes.Do you like competitive multiplayer?  It has like 10 modes!200+ achievements, 30+ maps, I don't know how, even in it's worst state, this game was so knocked.  Seriously check it out at the next f2p event or sale.			"

												I had a nice day today. I had a above average day at school today, and I came home to see that there was a free game on steam. Me and my buddy were very excited to see that the game was about dinosaurs, as there are very few of those today. So my friend and I said, ""why not?"", and dove in.After an hour of downloading, our hearts were racing. Thoughts of running wild as a gigantic dinosaur, eating anything in our path, running the jungle so to speak. We click ""play"", and off we are into the world of ORION: Dino Horde.Never in my life have I wanted to kill myself. I am one of the most postive people I know, and this game made me the most depressed, dark, and angry person on the planet. My blood was boiling at the sight of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dinosaur animations, and terrible gameplay. I am writing this with my neck in a noose, and plan on hanging myself after I post this review. God speed.			"

												I could recommend it, if something was done about the dinosaurs. Seriously, I'm higly doubting they did any modelling. It looks like a gif placed on your screen and they run very... weird? I can't explain, try if you want it, they did a good job on all the rest! I just can't get over the fact how crappy and ugly those dinosaurs are.			"

												This game is just... really bad. Not polished, poor shooting mechanics, poor survival wave mechanics (we never really knew why things were spawning in between waves), and a mess of other problems. In dino survival, when a player spawns they have to run for about twenty seconds to a point where they can buy a gun. Why is it designed this way? The player spawns next to the ability upgrade teriminals, why aren't the gun terminals next to that?The animations are so janky. The most common example is when a player is ""downed"". The player gets on their hands and knees and sort of hip fires their pistol at dinosaurs, but stands up on both knees to reload, dropping back down to their toddler crawl to fire some more. Aerial enemies move in little ""increments"" when on flight paths in this sort of jerky manner.Why does my health not regen when I'm in a vehicle? Why does the AI sometimes get hung up on players on rocks, and other times, they just vault right up? Why isn't there a prompt for raising an ally from the ground?It all just seems really basic and unpolished. I'm not really enamored with dinosaurs so I have to go by gameplay merits alone, and there just aren't any. A lot of other games do similar ideas better in a more cohesive manner. The scary part is I've never played this game when it was ""Dino Beatdown"" or whatever, and it's apparently improved a ton since then.Skip this one. Play one of the other various games in this genre instead.			"
