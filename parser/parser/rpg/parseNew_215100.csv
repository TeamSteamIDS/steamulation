												Playing RO for around 10 years. Ragnarok Online is a good time killer with very friendly community. Some people call it ""anime runescape"" even though it's quite different from the RS.(The game is ""anime-ish"" however there are not so many weebs as you could think)Ragnarok Online 2 is a terrible sequel, don't even bother trying it since you will regret doing it.Ragnarok Online on Steam (which is called iRO), is bad in my personal opinion. It might be good if you're playing for the first time and can't figure out what to do, but the amount of bots, donate items, premium features and lag make recommend you to also try other servers.tl;dr - Great game, bad server.

												After 2 weeks of coming back, it is obvious that this game is cashing out on its old legacy. It used to be an amazing game I admitted. But if you're looking to come back for the good old days, there's not much iRO can offer here. 1) Pay2Win system: It is against term of service to purchase in-game gold (zeny) using real cash. Yet it is ok to sell your warp portal energies into zeny ( which is obtained by cash). So the only way to cheat is to give money to WarpPortal. Cash shop items also rendered many other in-game gear useless. And the only way to upgrade safely to +9 is to choke up $20-$50 in game cash for it.2) CheatersThere are so many bots in this game. Honestly I only see around 100-300 active players in game, and the rest are either bots, vend bots, or afkers. Worst part is some bots are actually ok, I see them roaming around cities buffing people, and somehow that makes everything ok? Also there's this thing called ragial which is obviously run by third party bot systems. 3) Lag issues and DDOS:It's 2015 and this game is still constantly lagging and I am using 75mbps fiber optics internet.  Also their servers keep crashing very often,  and usually at the worst time of the day.4) Immature game design decision:For those who paid for VIP for leveling, the GM sometimes decide to change the turn in quests so impossibly difficult that only godly geared veterans can do them. So you're likely wasting 1 week of VIP time afking or slow grinding your level. Also good luck finding public parties to play with outside of the turn ins.5) Slow customer support:It literally takes them days weeks or months to answer ticket issues. Worst part is they will just ban you and give you no reason sometimes. So you have to open them a ticket just to find out that some of the items you bought may came from a cheater, causing you to have weeks of downtime.6) Good luck finding players to play with.Finally, good luck finding enough players to play with. It's a dying game, and most of the time you'll be spending time waiting for a party to setup (30min - 3 hours recruiting time just to setup 15 minute leveling session)I'd say save your money folks. The old days of Ragnarok is loong gone.			"

												One of the first MMORPGs to grace the Internet. It still has the same look and feel from 2004. Despite it's outdated graphics, the sprites and music make this game cute and nostalgic enough to re-try again. The game is still active after all these years and has a very familiar feel to it. It might be hard for newer players to just pick it up without any outside research but still worth it.			"

												This is for the Classic Loki server. I have not played on the Renewal server.In terms of a decade old MMORPG, Ragnarok really hits home for the nostalgia factor. Gameplay is still smooth and fun. I quite enjoy playing.That said....The botting is rampant, don't bother trying to sell anything through vending. Someone has more on sale for less because bots.War of Emperium is a cycle of 3-4 guilds exchanging castles on a weekly basis. If you want to try and bring a new guild in, be prepared to be squashed by maxed out veterans wearing god-items.The market is beyond skewed. The botters have so much on the market that you are LUCKY if you keep a vigilant eye on sites like ragial.com for good deals, as some poor sap tries to undercut the botters of their excessive amounts of loot.To counter the botters, folks will often crack ""dead branches"" (spawns high-level mobs) where bots frequent in an attempt to grief kill them. Chances are you will die a few dozen times to these things walking from Prontera to Izlude or just trying to get to your hunting grounds.Logging on, the server is usually at 500+ players. Of that, I suspect 150-200 are vending and about 100 are actual human players. The rest are botting.With the population so low, it does make the game a bit more fun, in terms of not having to fight over mob spawns (unless it is a profitable area with decent returns, in which case you'll be fighting with botters for mobs) and Prontera is, pretty much, the only place one will find Vendors. There are some in Payon, sometimes. Ragial.com's bot only survery's Prontera/Payon, so why vend elsewhere?There are constant ""jump"" events. Events where people can take their character from lvl 1 to 70 in a day with a few simple quests.Falling outside of the 15 level limit for shared exp in parties will leave you lonely and bored as the rest of your guild refuses to help you catch up because there is no profit for them in it, despite having helped them along...TL;DR, plan to play a solo game and you'll have fun. If you played this back in the day, Classic Loki is, pretty much, exactly the same game you played 10 years ago.Despite all the annoying and frustrating things I listed above, I still like the game. I just wish there were fewer botters. :(			"

												Can't help but recommend this game. Yes it's old like other people have said but it's graphics were setup in  way so they don't age. Wonderfull 2D sprites in a amazing easy on the eyes 3D world. I've actual played this game since late Alpha, early Beta, about the 1999-2000 time frame. And I still play to this day, though mainly on the classic server.Beside the easy on the eye graphics another amazing feature is the customization you can do with your character's stats and skills. Unlike nearly every other game on the market you stats matter. Your character's ablity will change massively based on what stats you take.Want a Swordsman that dodges attacks and hits faster instead of just taking hits and having high hit points ? Put points in to Agility instead of Vitality. This means you trade High Hitpoints and high defense for High Flee (dodge) and high Attack speed. You then could go on to make a Agility based knight or Crusader with your swordsman. Or go the middle of the ground and do a hybrid of Agility and Vitality, You might not dodge as well as pure agility or have as much hitpoints as pure Vitality but you can take less damage per hits then agility based characters, and dodge more then pure vitality. And this is just the start of it, You can go pure support acolyte forgoing increased melee damage for the ability to heal massive amounts of damage, or for a true acolyte and have a mix of Melee damage and Healing ability. Want a Mage that beats things as well as toss magic at them? Put points into Strength, Vitality, and Agility, instead of going pure intelligence. You lose magic damage but can dodge, take hits, and do better melee damage then a pure magic caster. Go the sage route and get the skills that let you move while casting and add the chance to auto cast a low level bolt spell while your hitting monsters.  Like making money, while beating on things with axes, swords or maces? Go a Merchant class character. They don't have the Melee skills of other classes but you can carry more loot or healing potions items then any other class, can buy cheaper and sell for more then any other classes, have access to a cart to carry even more loot/potions, and use your fortune to pay the god of the merchants to attack your enemies (Mammonite skill). Want to craft potions or weapons, take your Merchant to ether Alchemist or Blacksmith. And even Blacksmith and Alchemist have the ability to go Pure Battle, pure Crafting, or a Middle ground, not building items as well as their pure counter parts but still being able to fight for themselves.And there are many other classes to chose from like Archers, thief, TaeKwon Kid, Ninja, Gunslinger ans Super Novice. On top of all that it's free to play, with subscription players (only 7 bucks a month) only get 50% more experience and loot drops, larger storage and other minor abilities. I've spent most of my time since it's gone free to play not using a subscription (they call it VIP) and had no problems with it. So give it a try, nothing to lose but a lot of your free time, and a lot of fun to be had.edit: fixed some spelling issues			"

												Lets be clear: I love RO.  My username is a result of my love of RO.  I played on iRO all those years ago, and broke into tears when I hear the Prontera Theme for the first time in years.Thing is, all that love is nothing more than rose tinted glasses now.  This game is old.  REALLY old.Old time Thief players (like me!) will easily understand that much of the combat is literally just ""Right Click, AFK""  Sure it gets more involved once you go up against MVPs and play in PvP/WoE, but fact of the matter is that you still have to chew through the leveling to get there.  Fast travel is still ""Blow entire newbie fortune on Kafra, or blow entire newbie fortune on FWing spam"".  Unless you're a Priest.  There are also really archaic mechanics like how spell channeling is completely cancelled when you take damage; dumb fact, but that's the whole reason why I hate Mages to this day.Thankfully, at least the graphics aged well.  The styalized look somehow managed to hold up for more than a decade, and the game itself could literally run on a toaster.  Also, you don't have to deal with ye olde iRO ""Server Connection Failed"" shenanigans as often as we used to, nor do you need to deal with a steep grind (by today's standards) due to the questing system...although said system is rather haphazardly cobbled together.If you're an oldie, at least Warp Portal set up a Classic server because you'll be completely lost on the Renewal ones.  Quests are nice, but mob spawn locations and even spawn power were COMPLETELY overhauled.  Simple example: Zombies are now less dangerous than Skeletons.  The level of a Kobold is roughly 3x higher than it used to be.  At least Porings are still Porings...			"

												First MMO I've ever played.. This game brings back sooo many good memories. The music in this game never gets old and brought a tear to my eye when I came back to playing it after many years. I still remember that excitement I felt when I created my very first character all those years ago and all I wanted to do was explore the world of Rune Midgard. Sure the graphics can't compete with today's more modern games, but then again today's more modern games don't have the sentimental value this one will always have for people like me who remember talking about this game in school and then rushing home to continue an adventure with friends. I can only hope that they will make a (third) remake of the game that only involves making the graphics better while maintaining virtually everything else to preserve the ""feel"" of the original.

												This game... Oh boy this game. Where do i even start,  For starters i am what you would call an old time veteran when it comes to Ro1. This game and me go way back, I couldn't even tell you how many years/months/days i have spent running around in this game. This is one of those classics situations where i have a sudden wave of nostalgia and emotion run through my head just thinking about it.Now, here's the nitty. I have of course played this game, i was an avid hard core player of Ragnarok, But i moved on to other things and basically rarely ever turned back unless i was just casually hopping on to see what changed or for nostalgia purposes. And let me tell you this game is not the game it was back in 2002-2007. Oh no, The new IRO is just a mess of Trolls/Bots a very strange slapped on questing system as well as many other band-aided systems trying to keep this game afloat or up to par with what i would call mmorpg standardization. Many server merges causing lots of strange naming conflicts and renaming issues. Some people given free character name changes, While others somehow being skipped over.The game at its core is still the same old Ragnarok, But the magic that is Rune Midgard has just somehow been lost somewhere down the road these past years. Partially the community, and just the way the game is ran, The game even seems to somehow run worse now than it did years ago, as if the Server technology has been downgraded even tho computers have gotten better.So what is my final verdict? I would say give the game a shot, But don't go into the game expecting a lot, It's pretty laggy and seems very quiet at times. gravity definitely seems to be letting the game run its course, But on the bright side at least it seems to be alive and probably kicking for many years to come.

												New player experience:Downloaded the game only because I play Ragnarok Online 2 and wanted to see the original game that started it all.  I was amazed to see an old game filled with tons of players!  High levels as well as new ones. 11 hours into the game recieved a whisper from a lvl 99 who gifted me a large sum of zeny (in-game money)  and a sword and warmly welcomed me to the game.  Now this is what community is all about!  Here is my review...PROS:Very little to no lag despite a very high online population.Relaxing music that changes with each area, never boring, enjoyable+Amazing community! General chat is quiet with people mostly opting for private chat options.Old style graphics but very well done with cute sprites.F2P or VIP (F2P gets 9 character slots by default) Yay!Cash shop is available but never felt like it was in my face prompting me to buy every second like some games.Progressive class system with indepth character customization.Starter area tutorial. Don't skip reading this!CONS:City streets clogged with player vendor stalls. NEUTRAL: ( could be good or bad )Learning curve. Online research sort of required to fully understand Class progression.New players may not always know where to go but there are NPC city guides that help.Mostly a go kill X number of monsters game.Top down view though you can rotate view and zoom in a little.I highly recommend you give this one a try.

												This review is on certain parts of the community and usefulness to new or interested players. (For the record, I have invested several weeks into the game by now. I just use the exe from the installation folder to bypass Steam's account creation requirement)On to business: Ragnarok's main server Chaos, the most popolar Renewal server, isn't very accomodating to new players or returning players. The entire time I played I saw folks chatting to each other a grand total of twice. Oweing to the fact that half of the players are dual client shops, this still gives about 1500 active players who must already have their cliques or guilds and chat privately only. So, if you planned on asking questions to find out where to go in the very open world that is Ragnarok, plan to feel rather isolated.If you plan on visiting the forums, you will find that there seems to be an internal war of sorts between newcomers and veteran players, where new players don't truly feel welcome. This is very unfortunate, as I too am a returning player and I wanted to reinvest myself into the game, but have decided it is not worth my time.Don't expect timely updates in game, as it seems that the folks in charge of placing updates have to follow a specific schedule that is several months behind their Asian counterparts, which leaves players exposed to bugs and poor update planning.Based on these observations, I thus cannot recommend this game to new players, which is very sad for me as I wear thick nostalgia goggles from playing as a child. only play this if you have plyaed iRO in the past and are widely experienced with it.

												Where to start...This is one of those games that if you played it when it first came out, years would pass, you would try multiple other MMOs and realize that you keep coming back to Ragnarok. There's just a certain charm to it.  On the surface this might seem like a usual simple grind-fest, however the game is very complex. Mainly because it gives you complete freedom to build your characters the way you want (and make many, many mistakes in the process). Want to build a battle-priest because you do not like monks? - go for it.  Want to make a full-crit assassin with the sole purpose of hunting high-def monsters? - go right ahead. The beauty is that with enough research and equipment planning you could make even the most bizzare character builds work.  Or you will fail miserably and realize that you want to try again, with a different skill-set, different stats, different cards and equipment..possibilities are limited only by your imagination.Even though the game is quite old, it definitely held up very nicely and is worth a try.

You're out of luck if you're alone, if you're poor, and/or if you don't know the basics of RO. So either you study outside of RO, or you play with friends. Otherwise, Steam's server was a huge let down.			"

Seriously, this game, in my opinion , is by far the only mmorpg that uses mouse click to move your character I have ever enjoyed. I wish I had played this game during its Golden age as I have discerned a good number of people who regard this game as the reminiscent of their childhood.8.5/10 "

												A classic definitely. Clunky mechanic and does not work properly on Windows 8 nontheless (Run the options and the game in compatibility mode for XP S3 and you should be fine. Don't run it in full screen, you have been warned.) However, it retains the charm quite nicely and the new renewal patch makes grinding more fun with kill quests. If you are looking for a F2P MMORPG that is mindless, look no further. Also, since it is free, give it a try will ya. If it's a no go, then just uninstall it. :) Just... don't get addicted.			"

But server here is too lag for anything to feel good. The developer should ashame of themselves that offical server is not working as well as private servers.			"

												I've played RO since 2000, but only discovered that it was in steam a few months ago. The steam version itself is ok... Not the best definately not, but not the worst either. It is a pixel-ish game. So if graphics are a big thing for you, RO is not for you. RO is possibly one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Not just from nostalgia alone, but there are certain decisions Gravity made that was just amazing. Here are some of them:-You don't have to chose your class immediately.  -- it's a small design factor since you do go to a class system, but having the player wait till lvl 10 to get a class makes all     that grinding a bit better. You grind in every RPG, but knowing that that grind can really change your character progression in a more significant way than just a few skills and attributes for your already established class. -Player to player trade is encouraged with the merchant class  -- This is a big factor to me since it gives all that dead space worth something. Most MMORPGs have this grand city, with only 30-40% actually relevant. Having a AH does make trading simpler, but less exciting in my opinion. Since selling your stuff to another player is best with the merchant class, most guilds have at least one, and most players have at least one character that is a merchant, and you kinda do it with a stall in the city street, and since you dont want to be an a$$ the city streets have more purpose than simple pathways. RO is beyond its peak. I can say that out loud, but theres no doubt it is a great MMORPG. I wish  there are more games like RO.			"

												UPDATED 06/05/2015Games still Slow and Laggy Cant Enter Any Dungeons/towns/maps/houses Without the tremendous lag - Developers really know how to stick it to old fans of the game. this game is only playable living close the servers, I play on free servers and give my support to People Who host These Servers Better then the Actuall DEVELOPER OF THE GAME ITSELF.DO NOT LET DEVELOPERS LIKE THIS STICK A FORK DOWN YOUR THROAT AND EXPECT YOU TO SWALLOWThis Game Should Not Be Supported (AT LEAST NOT YET) Let me tell you whyI Remember a time when i played this game Day in and Day out Almost 10 years ago now, It was really my first mmo And one of the best still to date. the sense of community and love you feel for this world is somthing still not found anywhere else Comes down to being a very friendly and social Game.All these good things So why should i not play it. Cause this game has been Put to the side There is TREMENDOUS LAG Which Results in miss clicks, Getting killed, Miss casts, Aswell as terrible walking. I dont know what happened but i used to play this game on my OLD BAGE Desktop that was slower then molasis AND i was on dial up at the time an i never experinced this Much lag in the game.... So obviously the developers REFUSE to update servers for the huge surge of players... or for any reason from what my knowledge And I hear people Say ""oooo customize this, Download lag reducer that, And ping cleaner crap"" NO this game should work right out of install i shouldnt have to download 18 programs (PAID and FREE ALIKE) just to get to a BARELY playable stateAnd for those of you thinking he Dosent know what hes talking about, Well i have played This game Alot in the past And present.... And i can say without a shadow of doubt This game should not be supported untill WE THE COMMUNITY THAT MAKES THE GAME ARE SUPPORTED AS WELL			"

												One of the best MMOs I have ever (and still am) playing, it has stellar innovation and diversity between classes, coupled with a very friendly online and international community. There's a place for everyone in the the wide world of Rune-Midgard (and surrounding in-game countries), so why don't you hop on and give it a shot?

												Loved this game growing up.  Not quite the same as when I first started it though.  I think that the new additions to the ""Renewal"" version of the game are not nearly as bad as others had me believe.  However, I think that there is still room for some improvements.Personally, I would love a workshop workshop for this game.  Where we could vote for a new item that we would want.  Of course there would need to be some rules setup, but I would be happy to upload new headgears for the sake of this game.  If we could get custom stuff that are made by players, it would make the community that much better.			"

												Ragnarok Online is a 13 year old MMORPG that has charmed its way into the hearts of millions and continues to this day. Collect hats, PvP, PvE, run insances, make friends, and many many more activities can be done in this grandfather MMO.iRO is a F2P server, but you can purchase what is called VIP to speed up your leveling experience. I would reccomend this if you are serious about the game. I will not lie, the cash shop makes this game somewhat P2W but it is not impossible to play without spending a dime. Overall I love this game and it has been a part of my life for the past 8 years and I would change any of the time that I have spent on this server. Long live Ragnarok Online.			"

Played the game recently again, but it seems nothing has changed kinda hit rock bottom. I wouldnt recommend the game only because there is lack of active players,server filled with bots and lag is immense.If u like Anime style graphics, cute mmorpg's and grinding go for it !			"

Probably my first MMO, this was a well made game, worth it alone for the amazing upbeat and atmospheric music, the leveling system and character progression was awesome. Don't expect to find too many quests here, this was truely an MMO from the by gone days where leveling by grind was it's own reward.Current gen MMO's could learn a thing or two about how music can make your game so much more memorable from this game.

												Overall: 6.5/10Art: 8/10Design: 5/10Graphics: 4/10Sound: 9/10With more than 10 years of history, Ragnarok Online is an old MMORPG game to many. At a quick glance - it may seem fun to you but however, the community of this game really makes up a lot of your in-game experience. Talking about community, this game has real players who gave you the cold shoulders because of the vast amount of bots in the game. Lot's of Philipino and Asian players, you know you could reach out to them and make some friends if you are one of them - and assuming they don't ignore you. They are generally cocky and arrogant, but few handful would still help you out if you are lucky enough to meet them. Noobs start out weak (of course) and without a proper guild, party and friends, its almost impossible to get powerful unless you spend on the game. Well, duh. That's the main purpose.This game has a rich art base and many fans would draw them for fun, laughter, peace and joy. It's a 3D game, and a very successful one during its time - one would not simply ignore the art and just play the game. The art is great in my point of view and I do admit that their art makes me get hooked to the game. You will rave about the awesome sprite of your character, no matter the class you are in.The core design of the game offers you guild wars, Player VS Player, vending, and turn-ins. (for exp) It's a wonderful world out there to explore as well, though you might just go for the shortcut and teleport around the world if you purchase their premium services. With that said, the design is very multiplayer heavy - and you will only gain from it if you play with someone else. There will be events held often in the game, be sure to take advantage of it and not miss it ! Wide diversity of classes, you will always find a class that suits you most. However, some special classes do not offer you rebirths - so you lack some extra stat and skill points which makes you weaker than most players.Graphics is cool. The skills animation are awesome in my opinion and they are truly worth raving about as you scale later on in to the game where you do job advancement for your character. There are items in the game that needs to be purchased in real cash to exchange for better graphical aesthetics. Other than that, the animation might be a little choppy due to the latency of the game - it depends on where you are from and all.Sound. The reason why I gave sound a 9/10 is because they are really awesome. You can grab them in your directory for free as well, and I have used the BGMs of this game before in my school projects as well. They have a wide range from classical to metal, and different maps invoke your feelings and really puts you into the world of Ragnarok with their music.Summary: Do NOT try to play this game alone, because you will probably ragequit due to all these bots who would KS you and helpdesk takes a super long time in looking and solving your queries. It can be a very fun game despite my critics, you should try this timeless game out before giving judgement of your own. Support the game if you like it, but I would highly doubt it because of poor customer service. Lastly, great way to kill time with your friends! I have hundreds of playing hours in this game and and made awesome lifelong friends - talking about a gamer for 4 good years in here.			"

												Seems they allow you to play three different versions of Ragnarok I on Steam. Classic, RePlay, and their newest edition. I've been a constant fan ever since they first started; I still remember when they had issues properly coding the 'Bash' move for swordsmen. I started playing their newest server, and though it stays reminiscent of what I'm used to, it seems to have molded for the future that MMOs in general have carved out for themselves. Instead of monthly fees, they have a cash shop. They make items for new interesting events thta I wish I could take place in, for say, the hat quests, but even though I am a high enough level to collect the items, I am not a high enough level to initiate the holiday event. I find that fairly irritating, personally. Holiday events should be available to all, and accomplished by those whom can, but it shouldn't be limited to those that spend hours and hours, if not possibly days in front of their computer trying to speed level in order to catch the event in time.But, that's just an event. The market has certainly changed. I remember when a 4-leaf clover costed millions because of what you had to go through in order to afford it. You would have to painstakingly kill hundreds or thousands of vine whipping stationary, but pretty mean monsters, pretty much giving up the hours you normally would use to level in order to find that one item. Now, they're being sold on market for 50k. Advanced drop rate? Or is it because they're so easily accessible now as a chance item in Giftboxes?I have more virtues than vices for this game still. There are things that have changed, things that I wish was still what I am used to, but I can always play the 'classic' server. I still love the community, and it's pretty social! It's still worth hours of fun, and some time I want to see them have cool achievements for Steam for me to accomplish. I highly recomend this game as a simple MMO that has been striving with a several thousand person community for about ten years. It was my first MMO, and it will probably be my last, at that. Why? Because every time I step away from it, one month later I get another random craving for it and end up running right back to this amazing community.			"

												This is an old favorite of mine, I played on the private servers for years and was very excited to see this on the free to play list, I have not spent much time in this yet but I would recomend it to anyone who is looking to get into the MMO world.Full of quests and fascinating story lines, or the ability to grind through levels whichever you enjoy more. The classes are very balanced and each has it's advantages and disadvatages, but no class is better then the others, it all comes to play style and experience. The guild wars (War of Empirium) is always fun even if you only have a small guild.This game does take some investment of time to get up to the higher levels in, but personally I think it is worth the time. I have made some good friends in my years playing this game, and enjoyed every server I have had the pleasure of spending time on.			"

												An ancient gem that still shines today after many years and countless rivals including WoW, Guild Wars and many others who came and left. It is still lacking in questing content in modern standards but because of that that emptiness, players get to define who their own identity and create their very own story in the ever growing world of Rune Midgard.This is a must play for anyone who wants to know the history of MMORPGs.

												I'm not far into the game yet, but it seems good so far. I played Ragnarok 2 a bit, and this one definitely has a difference. So it was kinda nice to see a similar game in a different style. The only problem I have with this game would be that I have the hardest time getting my character to actually walk where I tell them to. My mouse will probably be broken before I finish this game, due to how many times I have to click before my character walks.			"

												The world of Midgard is currently under constant attack from monsters. And it is your job to become the hero, and drive the evil away from the once peaceful lands. The real question is. Is this game really the story driven game that the description says it is? Does your killing of monsters do anything to help the world? Technically, no. Once you create your character, you will either take the tutorial, or go straight to the main game. This often makes players feel very lost at the start of the game. But other then that, once you are on your way, you will very well be on your way to bash monsters around and make friends! It's that simple! Ragnarok Online is just the perfect game for starters of the MMORPG genre. If you are looking for a MMORPG and are just dieing to try one out, this may be the one for you. Not to mention it is one of the most popular MMORPG's around the globe. What is there to loose? Go out and download this game.			"

												AWESOME Massive Online Multiplayer Role Playing GameRagnarok has been my third RPG game that I have probably ever played. The first two, League of Legends and Dofus, really weren't the greatest thing- hence role playing games aren't my selectable game genre. But Ragnarok is quite pleasurable for casual gamers.The game features the usual Role Playing tactic in which you build your character in your first few levels, then take a pernmament ""job"" that determines the type of player you play forever. Of course, some people might get bored of their class eventually, but Ragnarok makes up for this lack. Ragnarok allows you to have three character profiles at a time. So if you are willing to start fresh or try another character class, you can! No more having to stick to one destiny for the rest of E T E R N I T Y .Ragnarok can be confusing to new players, the game is open freely and vast, and easy to get lost in. you will spawn at first near the heart of the entire game map, from there you can build up your job skill, then be let go into the depths of Ragnarok's world. All areas have different mobs that can be passive or hostile, they also vary by Level everywhere. You can find a relaxing spot here and there with easy passive mobs, or you can run into a mob that is 40 levels HIGHER than you, and it WILL ATTACK you at it's will. This leaves gamers to be adventureous, alert, and competitive. This concept is what probably brings in my attention.Ragnarok is also fun to play with friends. Beacause it is Free to Play, you can ask your friend to join without any worries. The probable downside is you have to create an account on their website, which shouldn't be too hard if you have spare emails for probable spam.I highly recommend this game to great RPG players who are looking for challenge, Ragnarok, despite the other RPGs I have played, really adds up to have many differences that give players more freedom. Role Playing Gamers would not be disappointed.I somewhat recommend this game to those who casually play RPGs, Ragnarok Online is a great game to play on your spare time, but sometimes you can get really lost like me - if that happens.... pray that you'll make it back without dying, or just die and respawn at the heart of the map, you get to keep your stuff, but you loose some of your experience. Oops.			"

												Seems they allow you to play three different versions of Ragnarok I on Steam. Classic, RePlay, and their newest edition. I've been a constant fan ever since they first started; I still remember when they had issues properly coding the 'Bash' move for swordsmen. I started playing their newest server, and though it stays reminiscent of what I'm used to, it seems to have molded for the future that MMOs in general have carved out for themselves. Instead of monthly fees, they have a cash shop. They make items for new interesting events thta I wish I could take place in, for say, the hat quests, but even though I am a high enough level to collect the items, I am not a high enough level to initiate the holiday event. I find that fairly irritating, personally. Holiday events should be available to all, and accomplished by those whom can, but it shouldn't be limited to those that spend hours and hours, if not possibly days in front of their computer trying to speed level in order to catch the event in time.But, that's just an event. The market has certainly changed. I remember when a 4-leaf clover costed millions because of what you had to go through in order to afford it. You would have to painstakingly kill hundreds or thousands of vine whipping stationary, but pretty mean monsters, pretty much giving up the hours you normally would use to level in order to find that one item. Now, they're being sold on market for 50k. Advanced drop rate? Or is it because they're so easily accessible now as a chance item in Giftboxes?I have more virtues than vices for this game still. There are things that have changed, things that I wish was still what I am used to, but I can always play the 'classic' server. I still love the community, and it's pretty social! It's still worth hours of fun, and some time I want to see them have cool achievements for Steam for me to accomplish. I highly recomend this game as a simple MMO that has been striving with a several thousand person community for about ten years. It was my first MMO, and it will probably be my last, at that. Why? Because every time I step away from it, one month later I get another random craving for it and end up running right back to this amazing community.			"

												Ragnarok Online is a free to play JRPG from a Korean developer.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is a old grind centered game, and level cap is 150.  I had problems with game not reponding on map transfers, maybe because game servers might be in Asia.  Try it, if you like old JRPGs. For more info:

												I grew up on this game.  Most of high school, me and my friends played this.  It was beautiful, and still is.  One of my favourite games of all timeI personally don't like the Steam version.  The original client is vastly superior.Music is still as beautiful as ever, probably one of the best soundtracks i've ever hear.  To this day I can still remember some of the songs.  Sound effects were also great.Not many people play this anymore, which is a shame, but expected.  If you can find a populated server with the orginal client, then definitely get it.			"

												Can't stop playing. Just as fun as it was years ago. The game has changed a little, I remember having to used to grind in the Payon dungeon in the early levels, but nowadays its a bit different. Overall it seems to be easier to reach the higher levels than before so that's either good or bad to some people. It can be a bit confusing at times but it still brings back the memories I've had of this game when I played in elementary school.			"

												I'd only recommend this game to people who loved it back then more than 10 years ago; as comparing this game to current MMORPG standards - it just fails in many aspects.Pros:~Great music~Nice community~Deep and plenty of customizations on how you build your characters~Tons of content to explore, unlock, and enjoy~Well done sprites that still looks awesome even after 10 yearsCons:~Outdated gameplay - compared to today's standards, RO is grindy, repetitive, and stale~Unforgiving character customization - it's easy to screw up your character if you do not understand how to build your skills and stats~Still tons of botters - 10 years and maps and dungeons are still infested with gold farming bots~Laggy servers - it says ""International"" but if you're playing anywhere outside the US, it's gonna be a laggy messOVERALL: 5/10~If you loved it back then and don't mind the current problems it has then go try it out - even if just for the sake of nostalgia.~If you haven't played RO before, and are looking for an F2P MMORPG, then skip this one and try one of the many, modern (and much better) MMORPGs out there.

												It's an open world MMORPG with fast combat (even insane at later levels) and a TON of class variation. 9 Character slots arent enough to explore even half of what it offers, and those classes change even more when you max out. Hitting 99 lets you become an improved class with new skills and higher stats, and hitting 99 again lets you break the cap as an entire new class and go for 150 with another whole skill tree. There is no specific path to take in the game, you can go anywhere at any time assuming you can survive. The farther you get from a town, the stronger the enemies become, and it's not uncommon to get into dangerous or challenging situations facing a horde of enemies. The game is best played with friends or a guild IMO, but out of 10 years of online gaming, i haven't played an overall better MMO, especially from KR.			"

												I've been playing Ragnarok Online on and off since open beta, and no matter what game comes out, I keep finding myself coming back to this game.  Some of it's nostalgia for me, but the game definitely has a lot going for it.Pros:-The skill trees and class system are hard to beat-Cute art and a decent amount of items and whatnot to personalize your character (Though most of it is headgear)-The music is beyond phenomenal-It's been around for a long time and still gets content updates.-Some of the newer updates have been to make the game more user-friendly and easily accessible to newer players, such as an in-game navigation/search function for NPCs/Zones/Mobs, an in-game map with general level guides for each zone, and an amazing quest setup to make levelling worlds easier.-Events!  Loads of events, including monthly dungeons getting double exp/drops, Lunar Festival celebrations, and other holidays!-Rich, vibrant community-Game's so old, you could run it on a Windows 98 machine (I did)Cons:-Combat is very simplistic, based around a point and click system (Think Diablo 2)-The grind is real.  Killing monsters, expect to be happy if a monster gives .04% exp.  (Update!  The exp grind is much better!  Monsters *seem* to give more exp, especially in double exp dungeons)-Droprates are similarly bad.  There's a lot of headgear customization and cool items and whatnot, but most of the items of note are at 0.01% doprate or less, including ones from rarer, MVP monsters that require groups and coordination for a handful of drops.-The game is basically running dungeons and collecting hats.  There's more to it, but it's almost like garnishing.-No Auction House, and an entire Merchant Class dedicated to buying and selling items.-Very defined class roles (Don't expect Support classes to be able to solo).Now, the cons seem to outnumber the pros on this, but let me break down some of them, starting towards the bottom.In regards to MVPs, there are items called Dead Branches which spawn a random monster.  They *can* be MVPs, but they can be any monster in the game.  There are Bloody Branches which, I dunno how to get them on official servers but, are always MVPs (no guarantee if it's the one you want).  The game relies heavily on casting lots and hoping the RNG gods favor you this day.In regards to the Merchant Class (And I apologize for the big shpiel here), it's heavily support in its first form.  But the way the class tree works is, everyone starts as a Novice and at Job level 10 (Normally your base level is around 6 by then), you can switch to your first job, of which there are 6.  Then, when you reach level 40 at a minimum, you can upgrade to your second class (Each of the base jobs branches off into two separate paths).  Every Job level, however, you get a Skill point to spend, so it's highly adviseable to go to job level 50 (max in most cases) to squeeze out all the skill points you can.  Merchants upgrade into Blacksmiths, which can make weapons for folks.  And that's great!  Incredibly profitable, and very useful, as they can be a stopgap for those super high-end dropped weapons, PLUS they can be made elemental to take advantage of weaknesses and allow you to hit ghost property enemies.  OR, Blacksmiths can focus their stats on damage, and be a devastating damage dealer.  There's also Alchemist in the other branch, which is a pretty decent damage dealer too.  So there's light at the end of the tunnel for this support class.  Other ones?  Not necessarily.  Most of them are incredibly group reliant.Being group reliant isn't so bad, though!  Because the community's pretty awesome, on the whole.  Sure, there are bad eggs, but you'll find them in any game (plus you're likely to find a bunch of friendly folks here).Not having an Auction House lets you set whatever price you want, but people have to manually find your store you've set up with your character, and hopefully buy at your prices.  You have to be logged in the whole time for that, as well, and ONLY Merchant class characters (or above) can set up a stall.Also, when it comes to stats for characters, you get to completely decide them for yourself!  Which is good and bad, since it's really difficult to reset your stats.  I would advise finding a guide on the character you want to play, and how you want to play it, because you *could* make a high evasion/max attack speed Paladin, but it really wouldn't suit... anyone's needs well.There's the RL money component of the game, but this game is far from P2W.  There are a few incredibly useful things in the store, but you can get almost all of them in-game, or from other players.If those cons don't sound off-putting, I'd highly recommend giving it a try.  What do you have to lose?  It's fast, it's easy, it's free, much like pouring river water on your socks (But much more rewarding).			"

												One of the very first MMOs I've played in my entire life (it was pRO, Philippine RO, though). I first played back in 2004, when it was still a P2P and when Payon still had it's old map up. Everytime I feel like playing RO, I would buy either a P100 or P350 everytime, this was before I discovered private servers lol. While iRO used credit cards, pRO used prepaid cards. I was ecstatic and overjoyed when I found out it is now Free to Play. As a veteran player, I have enjoyed this game over the years. The community is friendly but not too mellow. Crazy things happen, and by ""crazy"" I mean wacky... in a good way, like having fun. I love the players here. They are friendly and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rarely ever happens... only thing annoying now are the pesky bots roaming around the hunting maps (this never happened back then and don't worry, they don't appear in all maps). But they can be overlooked if you just simply ignore them, they don't KS or anything really.The gameplay itself is mediocre, considering it's a point-and-click, nothing too fancy. The sprites are adorable and the 3D background graphics are astonishing. The Eden and event quests are really fun to do. The tutorials teach you the basics really well and you get good stuff. There is a massive number of job class branches to choose from. (My favorite is the Assassin branch followed by the Wizard branch~) The merchant class is are something that is not so common in MMOs, so that's a plus too. There's also the guild siege or WoE (War of Emperium) which is really fun. The reasons why I enjoyed this game are the friendly community and the cute sprites. Some monsters are cute too and you can make them as pets. I love the idea that the entire game was based on the Norse Mythology.Truth be told, this is actually a game and depending on your preferences, you might either like it or don't like it. This is because there's no specific plot or any major storyline (there are quest lines that tell interesting stories though) and point-and-clicks can be boring at times. However, in spite of these, the events, quest lines, cute sprite, creative and realistic 3D maps, the nice visual effects when you use skills and magic, rebirths, and the merchant class are all the reasons why this is a pretty good MMO. I recommend this MMO to those who prefer the classic style of gaming and/or 2D games, because this is what Ragnarok Online gives. I grew up with clicky games which is why I came to love it.			"

												Played this for eight years on a private server previously called AnimaRO. It went from that to AnimusRO, AnesisRO and now it's apparently JellyRO. I had so many memories playing this game. I wasn't aware it was on Steam until a year or so ago and played a bit. The EXP rates and leveling are slow as hell I will admit. So different from the 5x/5x/3x rates I was used to. Overall I recommend this game to anyone. The music and lore are great and the monsters range from adorable to creepy as hell. Graphics are pretty good for a game that came out in the 90s. Classes are the usual RPG fare.			"

												I love this game. Would I recommend it to newbies? Thats always the hard question because of the learning curve. I always tell my friends when they try to play that either you suck or you rock those are the only ways to play RO and it takes some dedication to reach the good end. Aside from that it has great class selection, wonderful skill animations, and an overall art style that really enjoy aside from the low-rez 3d terrain. One of the things that I enjoy with this game is that it doesn't hold your hand like the new MMORPGs. Sure the new tutorial is designed for weiners but they made it so hard to find most of the instructors for the tutorial quests it balanced out anyways.10/10 no wieners allowed so b gud			"

												Nostalgia vs Reality - not a review~ Nostalgia got the better of me and seeing this available on Steam, I just had to install it. This was afterall, the first MMO I ever played back in 2000-2003 and also the first MMO community (twRO) with whom I had the good fortune to go adventuring with. Only five minutes into RO, I was entranced by the comfortable familiarity of it all. -/lazy insert everything I love about RO-Soon though, the nostalgic glow started to wear off...I missed the feeling of being a wide-eyed newbie, falling down and picking myself up again, bravely exploring a whole new world. I missed the community of twRO, I missed...I missed...Reality was, the RO of today is somewhat the same but different. Without going into details, some game mechanics are different, simply put. Anyways, my time on RO again after a decade (half of which was subsconsciously spent wishing that I was somehow still playing RO!) was deeply conflicting instead. Also, the awesome fun I had back then in RO also seemed to pale a little in comparison to the 'newer' fun I had in more recent MMOs; what a fickle mistress the human mind is when it comes to comparisons? The best of nostalgia can only happen when we look back at something and remember only the good but none of the bad and do no comparisons! My dear RO, I'll stick to remembering that lovely and familiar smile of yours, marvelling at the chemistry we had with each other and the good old times together with that community of twRO. :)I am not allowing myself to be stuck in the worse, for moving forward is as simple as trying something new: a relationship, creative projects, a new television show or game while holding fast to the firm knowledge that I was fortunate enough to have these fond memories of Ragnarok Online in my lifetime. tl;dr***Try it casually if you are new to RO (and to most modern 'action' MMOs) - but don't compare amongst them for RO can come across as antiquated; that won't bode well for the game nor for ya. I also had lag issues with this now and annoying chunky rubberbanding. ***Don't even try RO again, if you had played it before and especially if you had loved it to bits previously. There's no need to make new memories, your old ones of RO are precious enough and good enough forever.			"

												Основа игрового процесса это конечно же выбор класса персонажа. Раскачав персонажа-новичка до десятого уровня вы можете выбрать ему начальную профессию. От выбора первой профессии будет зависеть кем персонаж будет на более высоких уровнях, т.к. в игре присутствует разветвление классовых навыков: к примеру если вначале вы избрали себе мечника, то впоследствии перед вами встанет выбор - Рыцарем он будет в дальнейшем или Крестоносцем. Также достигнув максимального уровня в игре у вас будет возможность взять и продвинутую профессию - он сделает  персонажа еще сильнее одарив его всевозможными бонусами. В Рагнарёке достаточно развитая и продуманная система PvP, что делает возможным проведение чемпионатов, самый популярный из которых мировой, определяющий сильнейшие комманды среди стран - Ragnarok World.

												Ragnarok Online is one of the few MMORPG i have ever played. Back then Ragnarok Online was entirely pay to play so in order to play, private servers were made. Until gravity made it free-to-play which made people play the original servers rather than private servers.So, Ragnarok Online is a animated 3D fantasy MMORPG. Players can move around and explore the world through a simple yet polish point and click controls. Ragnarok Online has an interesting system where players have two levels, a base level and a job level, How you raise those levels is by gaining experience either by clearing quests or killing monsters, but the job level tends to level up slower. Each base level earns you status points that can be allocated into different attribute and each job level earns you job points which you can allocate into skills which the player can use.What makes Ragnarok Online feel like a complete game is the large selection of job advancements.

												Haven't played the Steam version but this is basically the very first MMORPG game I've played :) Brings back memories! I would love to try this out again one day. I rate this game as one of the best MMORPG games around! There are so many job classes, including 2nd and 3rd jobs and a lot of maps to grind from. Quests isn't the main focus for this game but you will have to grind a lot in order to become useful in its best feature, the WOE (guild war). The WOE or War of Emperium is basically a guild vs guild taking over castles when its WOE time and it is the most enjoying part of the game! I also think this game has the BEST soundtrack of ALL MMORPGs around. I would sometimes login just to hear the music. Each city/map has their own theme song! My favorites are Prontera city, Gonyryun, Alberta, and even the WOE music!The game does look childish because of its graphics but what do you expect from a very very old game? Try it out and meet people to guild with and get stronger and get better in WOE and you won't be disappointed. This game is a MASTERPIECE!11/10			"

												Old classic. It used to be a great game full of teamwork, endless monster mashing and fun hat collecting. With the arrival of new systems, the game balance shattered, the direction of the mechanics felt a bit unsure. There is still a server with ""Classic"" settings, but the development on it is nothing new. The gameplay still feels satisfying, it is a really charming game, but a hard game to get into and requires a lot of patience.It's still a good game to boot up, but i wouldn't recommend it for newcomers.

												Don't get me wrong I was a huge RO fan back in the day. I even went to the trouble of digging up my old account and playing my lv 96 hunter. Or I should say I would have however there was one problem. The game is unbearably laggy, unplayable as it is now. Which is really sad because I would have liked to start playing again however it is impossible.I used to play this game on 56k dial up with less lag than this so obviously the devs have it running on some crap hardware with crap connection. Oh well it was nice to see my old characters again but there is no point trying since you will die over and over due to massive lag.I cannot recommend this game even though I put a stupid amount of time into it in the past. It is nothing but nostalgia value now. How people actually manage to play this game now I do not know.			"

												While I have fond memories of old school RO, I'd like to say that in the past 10 years we've advanced tech wise. Not so.This game does not even allow you to load it up to enter a simple log in screen. I already have an account and I'm asked again and again to sign up. I can't bypass this step, there's no ""I already have an account, skip me past this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"". Selecting cancel just throws you out of the client.From the numerous threads I've read, warp portal is having a number of issues, I do not recommend their track record to solve it.At this time, I do not recomend you play this game, with the plethora of MMO's out there, please do not waste your time, and/or money on Warp Portal, relying on the hope that they'll fix their busted♥♥♥♥♥launcher software.

												I've died a countless amount of times (meaning you lose a lot of experience) thanks to the lag and movement delay which I highly doubt they'll ever fix it or even look into. I could try attacking an aggro enemy and my character will move until he's two feet away from it and instead take the monster's abuse. The lag makes it so melee npcs can attack you from like 6 feet away.All in all, it might be better to simply move to a server with better latency...			"

												While I have fond memories of old school RO, I'd like to say that in the past 10 years we've advanced tech wise. Not so.This game does not even allow you to load it up to enter a simple log in screen. I already have an account and I'm asked again and again to sign up. I can't bypass this step, there's no ""I already have an account, skip me past this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"". Selecting cancel just throws you out of the client.From the numerous threads I've read, warp portal is having a number of issues, I do not recommend their track record to solve it.At this time, I do not recomend you play this game, with the plethora of MMO's out there, please do not waste your time, and/or money on Warp Portal, relying on the hope that they'll fix their busted♥♥♥♥♥launcher software.

												I cant see other warp portal, people, npc and monster, yet I can see their chat, portal. When I googling how to fix this most this kind of question got ignored by other player. When they said need to repatch (on the asker question, of course), I tried the method and every single time I lauch either as adminstrator or not, the game is crash. Not to mention player are supposely edit their stats during character creation. Man, I miss old RO day, it seems it become worse and more worse. But so far this is the only (dev/warpportal) RO that I encounter such bug while the other RO that I last played still fine (around 2011, but the server is closed permanently).			"

												One word: YUSSS!!! This is quite possibly the only game on my pc that works and is anime, its adorable the graphics are a pleasure to the eyes and the speed is extroadinary especially comparing to the other games ive attempted on my pc. Other than the fact it is free it is also fun just moving around in the game, the only possible complaint i would have so  far is the small letters, viewable but not the easiest to read. That and the loading time is a few minuates long versus instant entry. but personally i believe it is worth the wait. Im so happy this game works i was going to be so dissapointed if i had to delete yet another game from my computer. ANIME + FREE + ACTUALLY WORKS = MUST HAVE!			"

												I admit, this game is a guilty pleasure of mine. I found it randomly on the internet when looking for games to play on my decade-old piece of scrap metal that was my last computer and, to my amazement, was pretty hooked. Back in the iRO days when I didn't have the money for a subscription I used to make multiple accounts just to play the 72-hour trial until I was told about private servers. Played those for a bit, found a few fun ones with a healthy population and then found out that WarpPortal had come out with RO for North America, free to play.Bursting with excitement I left my friends from the private servers to play this new completely legit, completely free server and...bots. Bots everywhere. Not once would I ever be around levelling and come across someone who isn't botting in one way or another, which had me feeling really down. Even when I played iRO my most favorite thing to do was explore the scenic places with my friends (the floating islands near Geffen, ruins in Morroc, Prontera's west gate garden) and hang out. So now that I had upgraded my computer I have long since left Ragnarok behind...Every now and then I get a rush of nostalgia that makes me want to play the game again and lo and behold I'm currently downloading it to play it again. Do I recommend this game to others? Absolutely. Botters aside, this game has an amazing soundtrack, neat places to explore and if you happen to come across a genuine player and you like each other, BE FRIENDS. Because you'll never know when another one like them will show up the next time you play.			"

												It's a cute enough MMO. However, if you're looking for an MMO in which you can jump right into and play, this isn't the one for you. With an interface that can be overwhelming and confusing, if you mess up and don't know how to undo, it can be really frustrating. Not to mention the tutorial will take a good amount of time, longer than most.			"

												2002... i was a teenager discovering mmo's for the first time... boi let me tell you.. it was GLORIOUS... spending the end of primary and almost all high-school playing this game.. we're talking about farming.. like no kidding 1% exp in a day was an achievement and then we had.. delays... lag.. loading time.. you know the drill, but we were enjoying this game because HELL it was fun.. But i must say this, we are... 14 years later.... FOURTEEN years.. and... it didn't change.. same lag, same delay.. oh hey more job classes..and content/dungeons/etc.. Yet when you play a game that lags/delays on every single commands you do you might say..: "" Eh... can't be THAT bad right?"" Well honestly.. it's THAT bad.. it really is.. I'd give this game a 11/10 but since nothing improved for the lag/delay over so many years... all i can give it is a 4/10 because it's a great game but performance impact will give you a hard time enjoying it..I do recommend this game if you're RPG lover and like the old stylish format in 2D top-down view.. Give it a shot but try to find stable ""cough"" private ""cough"" servers  both pre-renewal and renewal once you got the basics in.. they are both different game type.Only reason i don't recommend it here is because of the server have huge lag/delay making it less than enjoyable compared to other one around.Hope you guys like this game as much as i did.

												A game with good music, a variety of zones and classes, buttloads of interesting monsters and cultural references. Aside from that, it's an insufferable grindfest. This isn't a path you should embark upon. Other games will give you much more joy and satisfaction for your time and effort. This will give very little, and you will work so very hard. I would consider recommending this game if the exp rates weren't so laughable. They are a joke! Haha!			"

So now I bust my♥♥♥♥♥trying to acquire the items myself, which luckily I already had a higher level character otherwise I would have never been able to farm the monsters that dropped them.

												Ragnarok looked like a very promising MMORPG. However, the game has one major flaw... it doesn't open. I downloaded Ragnarok, set up my profile, and opened the launcher. I hit ""play classic,"" (and if that's not what I was supposed to do, please tell me,) and it began to load, and brought me back to my computer's home screen; and closed the launcher. After countless attempts at starting the game, I began to feel a bit of deja vu... (Meaning it didn't work.) I understand it's a free game, and they have their limits, but not opening is just unacceptable.			"

												I have years of Ragnarok experience, but the vast majority has been on private servers. Even with this having been officially on Steam for a while, I still recommend finding a private server you like, instead. The grind isn't *quite* as bad as it used to be as you do at least get your early levels and can start playing around with your class' skills a little earlier, and there's more ways to get experience than simply killing stuff now...you can get quests to kill a specific amount of stuff. Huge improvement, there.Because of its slow progress, mid-to-late game grinding is best done in organized groups to improve the speed at which you kill mobs with coordination and drip-feeds of buffs and heals. Unfortunately, the official server's population is fairly volatile so finding these groups is going to be up in the air. Ragnarok has a somewhat archaic system in that by lategame if you're gonna be grinding alone, you might as well not bother - most mobs that give decent exp yields need at least a  minor degree of teamwork to take on, in part because few classes have the tools to manage aggro alone without running their MP batteries dry, so even those that can drop all the mobs after their blood spend a fortune on MP recovery without help.The heart and soul of Ragnarok still exists, but you should seek it elsewhere. The vanilla experience has too many flaws to let the game's strengths really shine.			"

												                      Its like runescape and maplestory jacked off all over my anime collection.Pros: people actually play it, im walking around and it doesnt feel like im walking around a dead mmo.         unforgiving and monsters that are your level actually can kill you.         comunity is allright, and i harldy see any bots spamming the chat about a website to buy gold.         theres a bit of classes: warrior, mage ,gunman, archer, merchant, monk ,healer , and a thief. Cons: you have 3 character slots unless you pay        you need to assign stat points correctly without knowing the stats  of the classes you want to be,wiki recommended                the only costomization for your character is in hats thats right hats, so its a tf2 rippoff.      All and all I think its a pretty cool game unforgiving, but I like my games, that way bretty fun. 7/10.			"

												I've played Ragnarok for over 10 years now, wow I feel old! It's a great game, and despite the complaints about the official, it's no worse than any other game with a ""cash shop"" or ""bot problem"". Honestly, they've improved a ton of stuff. I'm mostly just excited for the new hats. I'm not upset a free game has a cash shop, especially one this old... how else do you expect them to make money and keep it running?I'll admit, it's grindy and slow at times but it's nostalgic and fun for me. Glad to see it on Steam, makes it much easier to play!			"

												I was pretty excited to see this game come onto steam after dumping many hours into it at the expense of my education (high school at the time).However, after losing all value in my account when they deleted all of my items and in-game money (apparently due to trading with bots, and the second time when I attempted to sell of what was left after the first delete)... I just can't get into it anymore.Any one that knows me, knows that I am happy enough to dump money into games for hats (and Ragnarok was no exception at the time)... however their over zealous mod team killed any further interest in the game.Add to this:- There really hasn't been any further innovation in the game- Warportal to Steam integration is as broken as in all of their previous games (if you already have an account, you can't launch via steam and making a new account that is tied to your steam always fails)- Horrible lag- Filled with bots and not many people- Insane grinding if you are starting from scratch (exponential levelling and drop chances less than 0.01% for all of the ""good"" equipment)- No facilitation of a ""Steam"" economy			"

												It's a classic with STELLAR music and great Artwork....but the new stuff they added has the absolute worst English Translation I have ever laid my eyes on, and I can't possibly recommend something with so little effort put into it. They've done some interesting new things with Quests and Navigation but the dialogue is just so ridiculous that it doesnt even matter.If they consistantly keep the Quest Flow going throughout the game, that could be interesting (assuming the Translation wasn't God Awful) but I have a feeling it's just the same grindfest it's always been, with the same stuck up wierd♥♥♥♥♥community it's always had.

												Only delusional vets who have invested more than 1000$ minimum, nostalgia fuccbois and girly girls pretending to be boy boys play this game. It's all about the pay2win kafra shop, refine gambling simulator and kawaii hats. Lots of bots that populate AT LEAST 50% of Chaos server. After pRO closed down, all the pinoys have been segregated into Thor server where no one knows how to speak english and is 1/4 that many players than Chaos server. Everyone likes to RMT although most never admit it in forums and there is a dedicated facebook group for each server. Some get caught some don't. All MvP cards are account bound and you 'd have to trust a GM to verify if it is legittimate or not. Some GMs are so incompetent that A.) they dupe your card and consider it legit B.) they take it out because it is NOT legit C.) They ban you without giving an explanation. D.) They don't respond to you after 1 month. The community is so small you will the same people in-game over and over and over again. There is also this one outvoiced vet who plays sinx that is the reason why classic server gets DDOSed everytime and have had guilds perma banned. Now you know why classic server is♥♥♥♥♥♥and will always be♥♥♥♥♥♥ Better off playing private servers or yet play an AAA mmo like guilds wars 2 or WOW or FF14 "

												Yet another English translation disaster. Spelling and grammar is terrible, some sentences just make no sense at all. The very first quest you get as a tutorial from the Information Staff can't be completed because the ""hidden item"" is so well hidden - it's not there at all! The Warp Portal website that you must register with doesn't sync your login info to the rest of the site, like the forums. I tried to get into the forum to find out how to finish the tutorial quest, but it refused my login. When I tried to register, it refused my email address because it was ""not available"" which ostensibly means, it's all ready recognized and therefore I should be able to login with it! So far, I've been trying to play the game 2 hours, the first hour spent trying to find out how to switch from windowed to fullscreen because the in-game font is tiny and I couldn't enlarge it except to enlarge the window (fullscreen), the 2nd hour trying to get into their website, find support, submit a ticket, SOMETHING to help get past the tutorial. So, yeah, this game isn't worth this much hassle, save yourself the headache, play something else!			"

												Well I should tell you that i have played many servers for this game. The servers are animaRO, AnthemRO, CakeRO, HiddenRo, RareRo, mysticRO. I'm a huge fan of this game and well this server is the worst server i have ever played. I believe the conpany running the server is in it for the money but the thats not the only problem. So lets start with the money problem. I dont have a problem with dontations until the items are break the game or you get more exp for paying. This server does the ladder and that means there is a gap among the players. Next the server basically lets you bot. This kills the community aspect of this game. This leads to the guilds being unbalanced because people who pay have extra exp and bots that follow the person usually healing them. So this means the economy is unbalanced too. I estimate their to be about 300 actually people to be playing this server. Even the most experinced players would have a hard time in this enviroment. In the end, i wouldnt even bother with this server and i would go to ratemyserver and find a good server to play. Im sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors i made.			"

												RO now is just like any other MMO's that have less cloth for tanking, and heavy armor suits for supportive class..Im not blamming on the cloths, im fine with it.. But, for some reason, the developers nowadays are sucks.. I really damn missed the old RO, where knights and crussaders holds the role of tank.. I really not recomended this game for a long term and serious game to play.. Since there's a lot of changes to it. Some classes are OP, and some classes are useless..Point form for all review :-Gameplay : for the sake of old memmoriesCurrency : uses a lot of cash item to survive in 3rd class (especially for 150 to 175)Variety of class usefull : less, only 5 classes that are really2 usefull (sura/tank, priest/healer, genetict/DPS, ranger/AOE, and maestro/strings) other than that are supportive classesResidence : almost 30% (or more) of the players boting on few mapsGuild system : are not developted as a proper guild system should be. Example (guild bank, storage, etc)Other reviews :           1. The game now kinda PAY TO WIN, since who have the good equips, wins.           2. There's a bias on some class (on stats, and bonuses), classes are cosly are less.           3. Party booking system are useless, and never used by anyone. (Plus it is not a proper system to called party booking system)           4. Common server lag issues from the iro servers. (while stream any vids are fine, RO still lags)           5. The Homunculus and Mercenaries AI didnt include in the RO package folder. (so u have to download it manually from 3rd party)As a player who played since the beta, this game really2 changed from awesome to sucks. RO1 and RO2 have its own gameplay, but for players who likes to TANK, RO1 is the game that tankers can't use heavy♥♥♥♥♥armor and they wear robes. While in RO2 tankers works fine, but the gameplay are suckier than RO1.So, thats my review for this game after few years playing it and review the system of the game. Hope this review helps some of u guys.. Thanks.			"

												Hi, I accidently typed in the wrong email (jakeyu132@gmail.com), which is not linked to my this steam account, and while launching WarpPortal i can't get to login, is it because of the e-mail i inserted is not matched with the email that i used to link with steam? If yes, can I know where to edit or replace with the email that i use to link with my steam account ?I tried register account from WP website too, for both the e-mails that i used, but still it is not working.

												I didn't play this game during its original release as I was a poorfag and couldn't afford the subscription fee.As a brand new player I understand MMOS change over the years, to appeal to people such as myself.With those two things in mind, this game is fun.I am playing an Acolyte, more or less solo, and even though it's challenging, I am having a lot of fun. Even though I am killing 150 monsters then turning in, somehow I'm still having fun.Even though I die a lot, I'm an Acolyte, so I can save the point and just warp back, so even though I'm handicapped, I'm still overpowered.I hear a lot of complaints from previous players, so if you played back in the day, apparently the game is ruined or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ butIF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS AND LIKE OLD SCHOOL MMOS LIKE MAPLESTORY, RUNESCAPE, FIESTA, ETC, THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE REALLY GOOD ONES TRY IT!

												There was an update along time ago that unblanced the game and it still hasnt been reslovedMonk class was absolutly destoryedExample.Hunter can dubble strafe for 15 mp and deal 2000 damage.Monk can cast Summon Spirit Sphere 8mp 5 times (40mp) then casts Throw Spirit Sphere 10mp and deals 800 damage.The hunter needs only dex where the monk needs str, dex and intThe theifs skill dubble attack works on empirum but the tripple attack from a monk doesn't. Yes its one more attack but the theifs bonuses are applyed to each hit, where the monk only gets bonuses added once for the 3 attacks.Because monks at level 99 with a very specific gear could do insane damage using Asura Strike, they then desided to nuke to death the monk class by halfing their base HP and almost 1/3 their MP.

Btw the artwork on the splash screens is low res and looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥which doesn't make sense considering how nice the sprites look. Did they pay someone to draw those?			"

												Yeah no. Here is the deal. So registration is 3rd party but it is linked to steam.Whatever account you registered with Steam will stay as that account. Accounts are Gender based, which means whatever gender you identify as during account registration will be fixed for that gender in the game. Even though the game gives you 9 character slots per server and some classes are gender locked.Here is the rundown of the game. At first it is simple, but there are technical problems. First is there is no screen resolution adjustment in game. There is no adjustments in the client launcher. You would have to find the Setup.exe in the Steam folder where the game is located to modify graphic settings. Without the convenience of how to or FAQ I would say I spent more time trying to find out how to get the game to not play in 640x480 windowed.GameplayThe worst part is finding out what to do with a character that cannot defeat the first monster at lvl 1. So errand quests are the only reliable way for building enough Exp to survive. The combat for whatever server or performance is not up to latency performance. The short end, I ended up getting killed to a 0 Hp enemy before it actually died and dropped an item during the respawn menu. This is what I cannot handle in any game, this is no longer 2008. At a 1/4 chance of entering a new instance, control becomes completely unresponsive. In that case just Alt+Tab close the game and uninstall because it seems that game also does not want you to play it. "

												Hm. Im not entirely sure. In my time when RO was in my country, the GMs dont give a sheet if you bot. If everyone bots, why not just allow it? Most people who bot are usually the ones paying money to play. Instead, based on my current playing time, I get banned twice in a row, because the GM's are so called on a patrol. Hm. At first I believed. But then maybe now not. I think I may stop playing iRO entirely. I hope you guys get a grip and just let us bots. 2k players and mostly 1.5k is bots. And the bots usually dont get banned. Why? As a user here stated that is what makes me think twice. What he said could be true and also a confirmation to what I have in mind, the GMs are so called doing their jobs because those who are not friends with them will get the most damage. Ive spent quite a lot. But maybe I may spend more on my PC hardware now. Thank you RO for the years of fun. Maybe, just maybe someday I will get a server for my country and allow bots. :) Just. Maybe though.. Lol. So yea. I'll still log in, once in awhile. So have fun with the 2k bots.			"

   My Playthrough     The Review I can't believe that I use to play this game a lot back in the day. I have no idea what I used to like about the game?This game is one of the most boring and repetitive games that I have ever played and it is made worse by the ridiculous amount of exp you need in order to level up. The drop rate is also way lower than it should be. No wonder I went to so many private servers back in the day as they fixed most of the grinding issues but even with that the game becomes basically a glorified chat room.  "

												This is an amazing game and really fun to play, especially if you enjoy a good grinder game. BE WARNED, this game is much better with a guild or friends, also I won't vouch for these servers and they seem to be in the process of screwing up the classes which will quickly ruin the game if that is true.So by all means try the game but keep an eye on the changes they are making.

												Raggy is pretty fun : 3The typical RPG that requires some strategy, team-work, and it has a cool world and storyline.A couple of downsides are it's a little hard to walk around, but that might be because of my inexperience, and also for a widely-known game that has been out around the globe for years, it has a LOT of grammatical errors. Like, everywhere.So I assume players focus more on the action, guilds, and such.But it's still really fun, and the 2D graphics are displayed in a cute, interesting way.This is a game like no other, and everyone should try it at least once.

												This's a pretty good MMO but this kind of MMO is pretty common, the kind that when they have problems they will try to solve it by adding new function rather than trying to figure out how/why it happen and how to prevent it from happening again, this kind of MMO is fun, but easy to get bored, after a couple of weeks/months the player will get bored, and to avoid this problem they come up with a solution like adding a new job class/skill/item/monster/pet/city/map. They don't really have much staff to handle the game, I'm not even sure if there's any in game moderator, because if there's one, he/she is either not doing their job or just plain lazy.Well this's pretty common MMO so yeah..whatever, I'll still play it. But the thing that get in my nerve is this game is filled with TOO MANY DAMN BOTS and Spammer, what was it? Why don't we try helping by sending a ticket? Ohh sure, WHY NOT YOU MAKE THE DAMN TICKET EASIER TO DO LIKE PLACING IN GAME MODERATOR OR SCREENSHOT PLACE WHERE WE CAN POST A SCREENSHOT WITH THE BOT AND YOU CAN TELEPORT THERE AND JAIL EM??!!! Sigh...sorry bout that...So yeah...this's a pretty decent game, but filled with bots and spammer, play at your own risk.			"

												It's an old game, a severly flawed game, with lots of bugs and some game design that leaves you scratching your head, but regardless, it's still a classic that paved way for an era of MMORPG's. It's kinda fun to re-visit every now and then, but the Renewal server is just so far behind in new content, while the Classic server I think is worth playing more, but it has a lower population, and it's alot harder starting out on classic as well.I'd only recommend playing this game if you have friends to play with, because playing it solo sucks really hard.

												Oh god. What can I say about Ragnarok Online...? It's messy, outdated, unpolished, broken, and the economy has been absolutely CRUSHED by bots, which now likely outnumber players 8 to 1. And yet there is no other game in the world like it! I've gone back to this game more times that I care to confess, and it's because of just how damn unique it is. On paper, this game is outstanding! There's a crazy amount of content, the branching class system is unmatched, the specs each class can follow are wonderfully diverse, the soundtrack is whimsical, and everything about it is so damn enchanting! But then you find out everything costs a billion zeny, high level players troll outside of major cities to unleash boss monsters that kill everyone on the map, the UI is horribly outdated, there's no direction or guidance in the game, not every class spec is good or even viable, most classes need to follow very specific online builds to be good, and there are basically only 2 or 3 classes fit for PvP. Once upon a time, grinding was one of the absolute worst parts of the game. It would take actual months of straight grinding enemies just to level up once. One death costs you 1% of your experience, 5 months or more wasted, once you reached the mid 90s. Thankfully, that much has been fixed! Getting to level 40 alone may take you just a few days and its much less stressful. And while the game is still a broken mess, laggy as all hell, and outdated by over a decade, you may still find this game as enthralling as I have. The community is great, as well. There's an unbelievably vast number of online resources, from guides to metadata about every area, item, and monster--mostly due to the game data being cracked really early on, everything about the game is now available everywhere online! It's at least worth a run through level 40. And bring friends! Nothing livens up a busted system like a bunch of comrades to laugh and play with.There really is no other game in the world remotely like Ragnarok Online~			"

												This game holds a lot of memories for me. Started playing it back when it first came out back in the 2000s and stil playing it now.I've always loved the customization, and how you can allocate stats and make totally random character combinations (agility-based dagger mage? hell yeah!). The graphics are outdated, but still pleasant to watch.The soundtrack is pretty damn awesome.One of the downside I've noticed in comparison from the old days is how it's not very newbie-friendly anymore, with HUGE price inflations and complicated ""tutorial"" quests. People also complain about bots, though once you've gotten the hang of the game, you'll probably don't care as much about them.TLDR, I recommend it. Now get out there and bash some monsters!			"

												This game just shows that fancy graphics aren't what makes the game amazing when you play it. Simple enough to get on and make great progress in a few minutes and yet complex enough that there is allways more you can do, these combine to make playing the game for hours very easy. The older sprite-style design of the characters, monsters and gameplay also seem to add to the game letting the player know they are being lost in their word of fantasy, which can be lost on the graphics we have today, which make everything seem so realistic that we can't seperate them from our average boring world. I am not so far in the story at this point that I feel any compliment I could make would do it justice but what I have experienced so far has allowed me enough room to say that it is a fantasy epic that could rival those of Final Fantasy and Star Ocean. I know that I will be enjoying my adventrues with my little poring for hours to come with this game, that is if my friends don't kill me first for talking endlessly about the game. I give it a four out of five for gemplay and enjoyability, and a five for the graphics for the unique way they bring the user to a new life. Lastly I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys MMO's, dungeon crawlers and Fantasy games.			"

												There customer support is terrible, I submit a ticket i have no idea what happened to the ticket after i finally find the ticket after like 4 or 5 hours with their poor navigation on their website through warpportal still to no avail no one replied to help recover my old account. Warpportal requires its own registration account the game requires another account and if you go to the website on warp portal it tells you to login with your email address so is that a 3rd?! 3 accounts just to play 1 game. The wait time on a issue is so BAD i gave up trying Gravity did better independantly on its navigation and helpful services. if its so bad on volume of customers how about you throw some GMS on the job? This is the reason why private servers dominate better then IRO its sad but true. If they want customers to stay they need to fix that especially considering i didnt even LOGIN to play the game and I'm ready to uninstall it. Also there new mechanics are tougher in my opinion it seems like the game got more tidious to the old veterans of this game it use to be grind and exp now its more like quest by yourself and figure out how to level even though the adventures guide is helpful its still easy to lose track of what your doing. All in all the game is fine the customer support is bad to the point that they might as well hold a sign up on their webpage saying *Gone out to lunch wont come back till your not here"".			"

												I played this game in 2006 and I loved it. The game was a masterpiece, the classes are amazing and fun to play as. I play with a Lord Knight as my main, and a ninja as my alt. The games population is still surprisingly high reason why I say this is because the games old and its been out since 2002. So much like really good and old mmorpgs(Ever quest) they slowly died off. I enjoy this game and I would gladly keep coming back to it. Pros-amazing class system, huge world to explore, fun culinary system, a nice pet taming system, and a loyale and dedicated fan base.Cons-Bots i think(ive talked to people who say there arent any), and some server lag but i havent experienced any.

												Oh yeah... That's the stuff!Nostalgia. I don't have to say much more.If you were an mmorpg'er in the 90's, You KNOW this title. It's been updated yet it's still the same good ole shtuffs it used to be. Simply delighted.For those of you that's aren't familiar with this one, it's an anime-ish styled mmorpg based upon Nordic mythology. You can play the game as many different classes and many different ways. The customization is AMAZING as you pretty much see all of your gear that you put on as is. You craft it, buy it, find it in drops, raids, etc.The role playing gets deep too! If you're into the hardcore rp aspect, you'll find many scenic areas to hang out to rp it up! Everything from storage services, warp gates, schools for skill inscruction, hair stylists, merchant cart rentals (if you'd rather be the money maker type, there's even a class like that), guild wars, mariages, pet taming, etc.Trust.You can find things to do.Be forewarned though! It will suck some hours out of you... ^_^			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. Thousands of unique weapons and armors that have distinct effects. Ontop of that you can add additional effects to them through cards.The card system is so creative; each monster has a chance to drop their unique card. You can attach that card to weapons and armor to give it additional effects such as increased damage, crit, attack speed, chance to cast certain skills when attacking, reflect damage, enchant armor/weapons with properties, chance to drop hp items, lifesteal. I don't know even know how they found the time to make them all.It's the kind of game that you shouldn't plan on getting to max level, though. This game is all about the journey. Play with a friend or join a guild and it will be a blast. The game itself is challenging. Boss monsters are scary and they can still kill tanks in 1-2 shots, so it takes a lot of working together.

												This's a pretty good MMO but this kind of MMO is pretty common, the kind that when they have problems they will try to solve it by adding new function rather than trying to figure out how/why it happen and how to prevent it from happening again, this kind of MMO is fun, but easy to get bored, after a couple of weeks/months the player will get bored, and to avoid this problem they come up with a solution like adding a new job class/skill/item/monster/pet/city/map. They don't really have much staff to handle the game, I'm not even sure if there's any in game moderator, because if there's one, he/she is either not doing their job or just plain lazy.Well this's pretty common MMO so yeah..whatever, I'll still play it. But the thing that get in my nerve is this game is filled with TOO MANY DAMN BOTS and Spammer, what was it? Why don't we try helping by sending a ticket? Ohh sure, WHY NOT YOU MAKE THE DAMN TICKET EASIER TO DO LIKE PLACING IN GAME MODERATOR OR SCREENSHOT PLACE WHERE WE CAN POST A SCREENSHOT WITH THE BOT AND YOU CAN TELEPORT THERE AND JAIL EM??!!! Sigh...sorry bout that...So yeah...this's a pretty decent game, but filled with bots and spammer, play at your own risk.			"

												Raggy is pretty fun : 3The typical RPG that requires some strategy, team-work, and it has a cool world and storyline.A couple of downsides are it's a little hard to walk around, but that might be because of my inexperience, and also for a widely-known game that has been out around the globe for years, it has a LOT of grammatical errors. Like, everywhere.So I assume players focus more on the action, guilds, and such.But it's still really fun, and the 2D graphics are displayed in a cute, interesting way.This is a game like no other, and everyone should try it at least once.

												This game holds a lot of memories for me. Started playing it back when it first came out back in the 2000s and stil playing it now.I've always loved the customization, and how you can allocate stats and make totally random character combinations (agility-based dagger mage? hell yeah!). The graphics are outdated, but still pleasant to watch.The soundtrack is pretty damn awesome.One of the downside I've noticed in comparison from the old days is how it's not very newbie-friendly anymore, with HUGE price inflations and complicated ""tutorial"" quests. People also complain about bots, though once you've gotten the hang of the game, you'll probably don't care as much about them.TLDR, I recommend it. Now get out there and bash some monsters!			"

												This is the first MMORPG that I discovered by chance and played when it was still Pay to Play. The highest character classes during those times were the Priest, Knight, Wizard, Merchant, and Hunter classes. I took a long break from playing due to my studies at school.This is based on Norse mythology and on the manhwa title ""Ragnarok"" by Lee Myun-Jin. Sadly, the manhwa was left unfinished but the game goes on.Character designs are 2D but in a sort of 3D environment.The game itself will run even on a ""normal"" or non-gaming GPU.OST is great to hear.The quest stories are great if you read those dialogs.As with other online games, there are bots that farms for items but the game masters are doing whatever they can to reduce the impact on legitimate players leveling up their characters. There is no in-game advertising from other companies except by those bots that sells in-game currency in exchange for real money (scam). That practice is illegal though and if a player is found to be involved in that transaction. Then, character ban will result and sometimes character and items deletion.Just don't do something illegal in-game and this will be a good game. Lots of grinding if you go solo. So join a party and do quests to avoid too much grinding.			"

												THis game brings back Memories back when i was still in my high school. Me and my frineds would go down to a Cybercafe and play this game for hours up to a point that we would stay at a Cybercafe for days. After a few hours of the nostalgic experience, i realize that i still don't know anything about this game.			"

												Oh yeah... That's the stuff!Nostalgia. I don't have to say much more.If you were an mmorpg'er in the 90's, You KNOW this title. It's been updated yet it's still the same good ole shtuffs it used to be. Simply delighted.For those of you that's aren't familiar with this one, it's an anime-ish styled mmorpg based upon Nordic mythology. You can play the game as many different classes and many different ways. The customization is AMAZING as you pretty much see all of your gear that you put on as is. You craft it, buy it, find it in drops, raids, etc.The role playing gets deep too! If you're into the hardcore rp aspect, you'll find many scenic areas to hang out to rp it up! Everything from storage services, warp gates, schools for skill inscruction, hair stylists, merchant cart rentals (if you'd rather be the money maker type, there's even a class like that), guild wars, mariages, pet taming, etc.Trust.You can find things to do.Be forewarned though! It will suck some hours out of you... ^_^			"

												This game had it's golden day back in early 2000's.  It was an awesome game that had anime style emoticons and the music from soundTEMP was dope as hell.  I lost 3-4 years playing this game and met a bunch of acquaintance online.Just like any MMORPG, this game is generally more fun if you have some friends playing with you, not unless you have friends that lives in different timezone that will play with you.I feel like this game is pretty close to a dead community.If you're looking to play a new game that's SUPPOSEDLY have the same feel as RO, you should check out Tree of Saviors.  Rumor goes that game will be the next Ragnarok Online.Even if you don't play this game, I suggest you check out the OST for it.  It's quite beautiful.			"

												8/10 FREE TO PLAYMy only complaint is sluggish servers. I see people complaining that it's pay2win however it's less to an extent compared to other MMO's out there. People don't realize there are only two business models to run a video game long term...have a cash shop or pay to play monthly/expansion packs. Pick your poison people LOL.			"

												I'd recommend this to anyone who has played this game and enjoyed it. Getting good at this game requires study and effort, which goes without saying for any mmorpg. Don't complain about this when you've clock a major number of your years in WoW or DoTA. The only horrendous downside is when you got hampered by a bug, expect intense aggravation as the support staff is highly incompetent on both the game and Steam's side.			"

												I played this game a lot in college but over time it's lost it's appeal to me.  It's a beautiful game with lush environments and colorful sprites and monsters.  However, it gets repetitive and boring when you start leveling up in hours instead of minutes and the charm wears off.  For a purely casual RPG gamer side step this one.  This is also not a game you can play on your own which is bad for a solo player like me.  You will need friends or join a guild or you will never see all of the game's content.  To it's credit the combat is solid and the skill trees are good and leveling is satisfying.  I did though spend a lot of time trying to close out a dozen hot-key bars I accidentally opened.  All 100 different maps, charts, bars, screens have a macro to turn them on and off in your display and each one is explained briefly and only once in the 2+ hour tutorial section and good luck figuring out how to close them.   If you can spare the time to grind all the way to 100 twice, create another character to craft all your gear and potions, farm for card drops for weeks, and turn Ragnarok into essentially a full time job then go for it.  I am already tired of it and I'm not even level 30 so there's no way I have the patience for that.			"

												Some people are going to review this game negatively even though Classic exists and Renewal is still good.A lot of it will probably be that they think it doesn't hold up.I don't know about all that, but for me this was the only MMO I played at that time that was ever entertaining. Truly surpassed all its competitors back then.Over ten years later, I still feel the same way. It's still the most entertaining to me and its sequel, while possibly enjoyable, truly sucked in comparison to the original when I played it. Disregarding gameplay, RO is a game that will never expire: its art style with beautiful sprites is still fantastic and its environments while dated are done just well enough that they hold up well from the angle you play the game at. Many hours were burned through with this game and having not played it in two years, I'm sure many more will be, this time on Steam. Even after the game went free to play, it maintened everything that made it great. It's gone through so many changes but its core is still the same, and I can't recommend it enough to someone who wants to play a MMO that's satisfying and not completely generic.			"

												One of the best Old School MMORPG ever!I've been playing this game for a very long time on and off, ever since 10 years ago or something. Even until this point, new content still comes out every few months or so and makes the game pretty fun with different things to do.It's also not too hard for beginners to catch up to just enjoy some of the features in game due to many new quests and equipments catered to help beginners start (Eden quests). The best part, is of course, the very developed class system in Ragnarok, being an over 10 years old game, with many many classes to play and enjoy.			"
