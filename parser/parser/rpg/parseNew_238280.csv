												It's a rogue indie game, but it's not another rogue indie game. Legend of Dungeon is an addictive romp on classic dungeon crawlers. The graphics in this mix 8- bit characters, modern day textures, and AMAZING lighting that work so well together you'll find yourself just stopping to appreciate it time and again. The story is simple, you are generic adventurer A in search of treasure, and go searching a dungeon. You make your way down gaining exp as you desecend by killing monsters. The farther you go down the stronger the enimies, with it all being random each playthrough.Items give the game a good idea of how seriously you should take the game. Hats are the armour for the game. Different hats giving different stats. They can vary from a miners hat that lights up an area, to a cat helmet, to a literal cat sitting on your head and so much more. Weapons vary from all shapes and sizes. You can be very lucky with weapons, or just get nothing. I've had playthroughs where on the 5th floor obtained a Scythe that did +199 damage, and enimies were mearly targets, until a giant minatour appeared from a trap door and tossed me to the side. The only way to heal yourself is by eating apples, or finding a health potion, but potions are random depending on their color. An Aqua potion could be a health potion one game, and make you vomit the next game.In the end Legend of Dungeon will always have me trying again to see if I can make it to the bottom of the dungeon. It's simple and easy on the eyes, but provides a challenge if the playthough allows it. It's a great time consumer and is definetly worth the buy.			"

												Legend of Dungeon has no story whatsoever. You are simply an adventurer (or four adventurers, if you have three friends who are willing to crowd around your computer screen) attempting to reach the 26th floor of the dungeon to find and retrieve the legendary treasure there. The controls are configurable, and gamepads are supported, so a session full of yelling at three friends to give you that new helmet can be yours if you've got the hardware for it. There aren't many buttons required for each player, but I don't relish the idea of putting more than two people on the same keyboard; a gamepad just feels more natural for this game. Still, as long as one player remains alive, anyone who dies has the chance to avoid the aforementioned permadeath by collecting orbs that will bring them back to life, and that's the kind of perk that makes a little keyboard crowding feel like less of a hassle. Whether you're playing alone or with friends, randomness is the main characteristic of Legend of Dungeon. The levels are randomly-generated, as are the enemies you find there and the items you pick up along the way. In fact, although you find a rainbow's worth of potions as you progress, even those are randomized at the start of each playthrough. In one play, the inky black potion may put you to sleep, but in another, it may heal 100 HP. The game never tells you what a potion does, even if you've already tried one of that color during the current game, but the developers have hinted that this may change in a future patch. How you feel about this chaos will almost entirely determine your overall reaction to the game. I've played it quite a few times now, and I've never reached the end, but the intrigue of what items may appear next time brings me back. Will I get a machine gun? A top hat that spews smoke like a chimney? A miner's helmet with a light for dark rooms? Or maybe something else that I've never seen before? There's no way to know, and the creativity the developers put into the items makes it fun to find out each time. Of course, the flip side is that when you don't know what you'll get, every time you play can begin to feel the same and you may feel that there's more luck involved in your success than skill. The game's visual presentation is another element that could strike some gamers differently than others. It's an intentionally pixelated style, similar to that seen in Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. There's no denying that it is a frequently-used style these days, and that turns some gamers off, but I think it's done well here. Legend of Dungeon's environments and enemies are all clearly defined, and the particle effects fit well with the game's overall look. Light can play a big factor in your survival, so it's fortunate that plenty of attention was focused into creating a lighting engine that works well. Some rooms are pitch black and, unless you've found an item that provides more light, you must inch forward and watch for any hint of a monster coming near your tiny pool of visibility. And even if you have your own light, is it a helmet, or is it something you'll have to carry in your hands instead of a weapon? Is that worth the risk? The sounds of enemies play a similar role in your survival, particularly in those dark rooms. Each type makes a distinct noise when they notice you and come to attack, and you quickly begin to recognize common foes. This helps not just in dark rooms, but in knowing how to time your attacks in any room where you're facing a number of enemies. There is no voice acting and only occasional, but perfectly serviceable, music. This might be a negative in some games, but in this one the crucial need to hear the monsters makes the lack of constant music a good thing.Legend of Dungeon is fun to play, but it's a game that you're unlikely to actually finish without trying a great number of times. And since you can't save your game, each attempt is a fresh start. The question is whether you'll continue to enjoy the game's randomness long enough to attempt it that many times. As for me, it's the kind of game I find myself thinking about when I'm not playing it; making plans for the next round; trying to decide what I could do better and how to progress farther. I'd rate that as a pretty good indicator of success for any game.Recommended "

												If you havn't completed this game then shouldn't be writing a review for this game as alot of the reviews people have written are stating incorrect facts.""You can only move and do one type of sword attack"" wrong you can do charged attacks, shoot guns, bows&arrows, cats with laser beam eyes etc.""You can only use items such as apples to refill your health"" apart from the 30hp and 100hp heal potions ?""Your appearance is randomized every once in a while"" you can change your appearance at any time in the tavern even going back to the beginning to do so. Gear also changes your appearance.""The combat engine is: attack button."" you can move and jump to dodge attacks, cast spells(alot of spells including enchanted weapons shooting skulls from being able to summon allied monsters or every item in the game meaning boxes with apples and snakes inside to powerful weapons and enemy monsters), ranged attacks (rocket launchers, muskets, lasers),  Its a great game and the only downfall of this dungeon crawler is that it isnt online multiplayer.

												When I started playing this, I thought that the controls were too simple to make an interesting game. There’s only movement, a jump button, an action button, and a simple inventory system.But it turns out that there’s such a variety of interesting items to use, that it’s not a simple game at all. You’ve got melee weapons, guns, spell books that can summon monsters, different hats to equip for different abilities, potions with random effects, light sources, item magnets, cats which shoot lasers from their eyes, unicorn shaped shields, and other stuff. And there’s also a massive variety of enemies, which will require different strategies to defeat or avoid.There’s a lot of interesting ways that the entities in the game can interact with each other. For example: I summon a bunch of skeletons to defeat my foes, one of the skeletons touches a torch and is set on fire, the fire spreads to the other skeletons and eventually to me, and I burn to death.I should also mention that the lighting effects in Legend of Dungeon are amazing, especially in the dark rooms where you need to carry a light source with you. The game is best played in a dark room, for maximum atmosphere. I found the controls quite hard to master on a keyboard, but they work very well with a controller.Also, the shield is overpowered.

												That may seem surprising if you just look at the screenshots, but this game actually supports the Oculus Rift. And that literally adds a whole new dimension to it. Played normally, it's a 2d game that uses 3d techniques for its rendering but sill looks and feels very 2d and retro. But in the Rift you can see the whole level in true 3d from any angle just by moving your head. It's like the game is an animated diorama or board game. That works surprisingly well and I'm sure this kind of perspective will become very common in VR games in the future.This is not the type of game I would normally consider playing on a flat screen, but in the Rift it's a lot of fun.(Note: currently steam does not count my play time in VR as it's a different .exe) "

As with most of my reviews I'll keep this straight and to the point, Legend of Dungeon is a great game and deserves a lot more than it recieves though it has some annoying flaws. As of when this review was written, I have played 25.1 hours of Legend of Dungeon.The Pros and Cons.Pros: There are lots of good items, each with randomized stats and perks though it is nothing compared to BoI: Rebirth Enemies are varied and require multiple strategys to defeat Bosses are EXTREMELY hard The potion system works very well and provides an intresting twist into the game CATS! The Class sytem works very well [BETA]  The way to complete the game (retrieving the treasure) makes it different from other games in which you 'kill the boss and The End' Multiplayer is very useful and makes it more fun to play, it's better together! MOAR CATS!Cons: You die a LOT! Game sometimes gets repetitive as you adapt to a routine strategy Floating Green Death Eyes are COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED AND SHOULD BE REMOVED OR NERFED, PLEASE LISTEN ROBOT LOVES KITTY! Updates are released every 4 months A giant rebalance of Monsters should be done, some are really OP whereas some aren't. Though they have tried to balance them in Wraith [BETA], only the slime has been worked on so it's more of a challenge. Gameplay gets repetitive after a while Updates are somewhat infrequentMy OpinionI think it's really fun to play but needs to have some things looked at. Final ScoreI give Legend of Dungeon an:7/10Because: They need to adress some minor problems and add more content in but it's an overall fun experience, if you have friends to play it with.			"

												Simple and fun. Wander around a dungeon and beat up various monsters who try to screw you up in various ways. Chug colorful potions and regret it when you start puking rainbows. Blast mummies in the face with a tommygun while wearing a cat on your head. Encounter a gigantic evil skull and abandon all hope of survival forever.It's great is what i'm saying. One of those games where failiure merely encourages you to try harder and try again.			"

												As good as a rougelite should ever look, interesting lighting effects help break the monotony of these games. Other than that, most of what you'd expect, randomly generated levels, enemies, & Loot. The loot in the game seems a bit sparse, might not entice the most hardcore of rougelite fans. If your looking for a cool indi-game like I was, this one is not bad, worth the sale price. One thing to mention the the fighting system uses a ""negative edge"" style attack, where your character attacks when you release the button, took me a bit of time to realize, although I improved, I still thought this to be difficult to time the release of button while in the heat of battle. Also, the ""streets of rage"" perspective is a bit awkward to judge where you are in space but that's whats kinda cool about it too. Overall, It's a good game, great replay value. 8/10			"

												I was really hoping this game would be good. You can only move and do one type of sword attack, and use items such as apples to refill your health. The level art is always the same no matter what dungeon floor you are on. The game lacks a good inventory system for the tons of items you pick up. Your only way of switching items is cycling through them in a long list.The little art that appears in the game is fantastic, and the music is great too. It might be more fun as a co-op game, but you can only play local co-op. I'm not sure who does that on PC. For some reason the pre-release videos of this game made me assume that you had a party of AI heroes, but that is not the case.Overall, feels a bit half-baked, like an early access title. The game has no back story or lore, it is like an Atari game with pretty graphics. Could be great with some more features such as block and roll commands, real inventory system, and changing dungeon art design every few floors. Needs a save system too. I played for awhile yesterday, came back today and my progress was nowhere to be found.Edit: After playing the game some more I managed to have a decent run until the game crashed on Level 7. Still not sure I could recommend it yet, but that was the most fun I had with it. Got a badass fire sword and upgraded the hell out of it at the random blacksmith. Also had a magic item that summoned a dark warrior to fight for me. Pretty cool. Realllly needs a quicksave system like Dungeons of Dredmor so you can stop and come back to that point later. I don't have the time to sit down and try to run through all at once.			"

												I love this game. It's FUN: my #1 reason for playing games.The goal sounds simple: start in the tavern, work your way down to the 26th level, get the treasure, and bring it back up to the tavern, and you win. Simple, right? HA!Ha!Nope.I usually play this game late in the evening, after I've done everything for the day and am winding down. I can't beat it, I can't even get close to beating it, but I enjoy every moment playing it. When I die, then I go to bed. ;-)Legend of Dungeon is colorful and gorgeous. The pixel art style here is well drawn & attractive. The colored lighting of effects, with light sources & real-time shadows vault what might have been an ""ordinary"" pixel art game of the '90s into a beautiful, 21st century game.It combines the randomly generated levels/rooms/monsters/objects of a rogue-like with a classic ""beat 'em up"" style of movement & gameplay which I enjoy more than normal 2-D side-scrollers or classic top-down games.The neat quirks of this game keep it interesting. Everything's randomly generated, even the color of the potion bottles to their effects; different every game. The swing of your melee weapons need to be timed well to hit your enemy best: you don't just button mash. Spellbooks that shoot flaming skulls or spawn monster companions mix up your strategy as you go, as do rare projectile weapons. A spray paint can will help you mark your path on walls (or just vandalize the walls!). Sometimes you get a room with so many baddies, or really wicked ones, that the only thing you can do is RUN! Or get lucky and find a path of rooms around.I really enjoy playing the Daily generated dungeon, and this is the only game where I've cared to know where my score ranks world-wide.If I had to use 1 word to describe Legend of Dungeon: FUN.2 words? Colorful fun. =)UPDATE August 2016: Legend of Dungeon now has a VR mode!When played in VR, the level that you're playing on is floating in black space in front of you. The game is then like a live diorama that you play in/on!  And it can be up to 7 feet long IRL, so you will need to side-step along your roomscale space to stay with your character.This experience should set the bar for making side-scroller games in VR.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is one of those games you will either love or hate depending on how much you like pixel-art dungeon crawlers. I got this game as part of a games bundle and tried on several occasions to 'get into it' but couldn't. All the time while playing it I couldn't help but feel there are much better Dungeon Crawling RPGs out there, granted, rogue-like games aren't for everyone but I've enjoyed other rogue-like games in the past so I don't think that was a contributing factor. I want go get something straight, Legend of Dungeon isn't necessarily a bad game, it's just average. There is nothing about this game (aside from the price) that would make it worth playing over the dozens of better dungeon-crawlers out there.  Local co-op might spark interest in this the game for some players but I didn't have the opportunity to try it myself. The overall objective in the game is a bit underwhelming; in the main room of the tavern the barkeeper gives you your one and only quest. It is as basic as saying 'LEGEND HAS IT: there is a treasure on level x'. At the moment there don't appear to be any side quests, just the one sparse main one which is somewhat understandable considering Legend of Dungeon's Rogue-like nature. Still, it doesn't motivate me to explore the dungeons any which I consider a fail.The graphics are fine - if you like pixel art; if you don't like pixel art you will think you are playing a port of a game from the early nineties. The music is pretty contemporary, not 8 bit like the graphics, and overall adds to the ephemeral joys of Rogue-like spelunking.I find the combat somewhat hit and miss, despite the fact that Legend of Dungeon is a side scrolling dungeon crawler there are in fact several dimension you can move through meaning that if you want to strike an enemy you will need to align yourself with your enemy's dimension, otherwise your attacks are ineffective. Despite the fact that your character can gain levels there isn't a whole lot of attribute customization that can be done, certain attributes increase but you can't specialize your character and once your character dies you loose everything. I think it would be nice if you could keep at least one item from your past adventurers for the start on future ones. Just to give the game a better feeling of progression. In one playthrough, after leaving and then reentering the Tavern, I was unable to head back down into the dungeon. Try as I would, nothing happened when I moved toward the first level down the stairs. This meant I had to restart, thereby loosing over 30 minutes of progress. The Good:+ The music complements the game well+ Local co-op makes the game more enjoyable overall+ Legend of Dungeon has sufficient depth (combat system, magic, etc)+ Developer made an effort, the Steam version has trading cards and Steam AchievementsThe Bad:- Combat feels clunky- There are some really frustrating bugs that should never happen (see above)- Pixel-art characters and levels don't inspire me- bland copy/paste quests- Outdated and lacking the originality to compensate for it, this game could've been released 15 years ago and you probably wouldn't know the difference. In conclusion: I would really like to recommend this game but as I am not motivated to play it myself I cannot really suggest it to others. If you pick it up on sale I'd give it try, maybe you'll like it or have a friend/family member who is interested in playing co-op with you for an afternoon.			"

												If you're looking for a quick and easy pick-up-and-play dungeon crawler, Legend of Dungeon does it in style!Think about it like Diablo, but the loot system isn't as in-depth. Key points I'd say is that it's co-op. The items are funny and imaginative. Spells don't require mana so finding a really good one can be really overpowered (in a good way) and overall I love the art direction :DHere's a First Look I did of LoD. Keep in mind that since this video, the game has included a basic form of saving (when you quit the game, it saves).

												An EXTREMELY fun and addicting game. Can't stop playing it. The amount of replayability that this game offers is just amazing. There's so many items, enemies and secrets to find. Every run is randomly generated, so you'll never get the same dungeon twice. It's controls are simple and easy to use and the combat isnt hard to get used to either. (It's just a hack n' slash kind of game.) Also would like to point out the dynamic lighting that they've added into this game makes it look amazing. Definitley worth my $10 and I highly reccomend getting this game.8/1/2015 EDIT: Game now has save function. So you don't have to sit there and do it all in 1 sitting. Also, now there's daily runs with a seperate scoreboard. Scores on normal runs also decay after a week in order to keep cheaters off the top.			"

												I got this game on a whim back when I was experimenting with rogue-likes.What you see in the videos on the store page is what you get.  You absolutely can judge this game based on those videos.  I wish more Steam games had videos that were actually representative of the games they advertised.I personally found the gameplay to be mediocre.  The game is initially entertaining, but gets old pretty fast.  The combat is unrefined - I didn't feel like there was anything new I would or could have learned to become better at defeating enemies.  The game doesn't change much from one playthrough to the next, which is a real negative for a roguelike.4/10.			"

												A roguelike with relatively simple mechanics, Legend of Dungeon is surprisingly pretty and has some neat audio design, and the amount of items you can discover will keep it interesting for a few runs. However, the game's simplicity means that it'll likely get stale after the first few attempts.The dungeon has 26 floors, each getting progressively more difficult (some levels can REALLY screw you over if you are not careful/have bad luck and don't have good items). Once you get to the bottom, the you're expected to make your way all the way back up to the first floor. Due to this, runs can get VERY long, and the game doesn't seem to have enough complexity to keep such long runs interesting after a while. Not to mention the fact that at the time of writing this, there is only local co-op -- no online play whatsoever, which is baffling.Still, the game can be relatively fun for a few runs, and it's somewhat cheap. Good for a rainy day.			"

												Let me start out by saying *I LOVE THIS GAME*.It's a rogue like in almost every sense of the definition, apart from it not being turn based. The graphics are retro, yet modern with dynamic lighting and such. Every time you play it, it's different .. Potion types are only the same in each game you play, so one time a red potion will be healing, while the next time your character will just fart of puke rainbows.If you die ... you die ! Perma death is what makes the game fun. And hard ... really hard. I have not gotten past level 12 yet, and I *think* there are 25 levels. (The inn keep will tell you a rumour at the start of the game about ... you'll find out). There are a ton of different weapons and hats .. Hats ? I hear you say ... yes ... hats are diverse, surprising and cool. Bee hives and turbans with different features every time. And again, the randomness of it all is what makes this such a good game. Unlimited replayability value imo. I would have paid $10 for it, but unfortunately it was on sale.If you like RPGs, retro style graphics and rogue like elements (random, perma death etc) this is a game for you and at $10 it's a steal (coz you're a rogue, right ?)

												Legend Of Dungeon is most probably the best rouge-like/lite I have ever played.There is so much of these style games but there's something about this game that just hits the nail on the head, I'm not sure what it is but something about it that just stands out from the rest, even with how basic the combat is. (one click button attack, hold to do power attack) There is a fair few weapons to come across from the mighty code hammer to the speedy coffee mug. There's also some pretty cool easter eggs from some of my favorite movies and games that i won't spoil.There is a really decent amount of different monsters to encounter too, from bats, annoying as hell goblins and slimes to minotaurs, cyclopes, Succubs and the crazy OP lich king. The randomization of this game is really well done too, it actually feels like luck based randomization unlike other rouge-likes/lites which you are more or less guaranteed to get better loot straight after spawn. On one playthrough I walked out of the bar/pub onto the first floor and got destroyed straight away by a cyclops, then on another run I found the code hammer on floor 3 and got to level 19.Plus the lighting, colors, interesting pixel art is like the cherry on top for me.

												For a roguelike Legend Of Dungeon is actually disappointing. Yes, the graphics are gorgeous but the gameplay is just too basic. You play it as a sidescroller, killing enemies. You're thrown into the game without any explanation so it's all up to you to discover what to do. Enemies don't have health bars so you have no idea if you're actually hurting them. And there are so many doors that sometimes you have no idea where to go next. Or you might just be walking around in circles looking for a certain specific secret. Items have no description so except for a few basic and obvious things (like apples and swords) you have to figure things out all by yourself. A challenge is cool, but if you're gonna do stuff like that you better first explain the basic rules. This is exactly where Legend Of Dungeon fails. The end result feels like a boring mess.Except for the lovely graphics I wouldn't recommend this game right now. There are so many other, better roguelike games like this. And you should definitely play those first.[Rating: 68/100]			"

												Quite awhile ago me and my friend purchased the game thinking we could play online multiplayer, but sadly there was none. Although everytime either of us would go to eachothers house we would play the game untill we won or lost.. it took nearly a year, everytime we'd run into some kind of new or crazy monster that would one shot us and we wouldnt even be upset because it was expected. well finally we got too the bottom floor gathered all the loot and raced upward ((after finding floor 27, and falling and then breaking my inventory)) when we finally reached the top we were so full of joy that we overcame this game, it was like at the end of jumanji.. like♥♥♥♥♥♥it was so damn good.If you dont believe that we beat this impossible game..  you'll see that the 11th highscore in the world is Swaglord69 thats right, we ♥♥♥♥ing did it.

												Extremetly difficult game with rogue-like elements, and permanent death, so you know you have to play it safe. The game is loads of fun once you get the hang of it and start unlocking characters. Plethera of items which are sporatically disperssed throughout the dungeon so you really never know what you are going to get, but that just adds to the fun imo. only con is multiplayer is LOCAL COOP only. So you want to play with people, i'd strongly recommend it only if you have controllers. Great game though, totally worth your money			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a permadeath roguelike dungeon-crawler game.  Every time you play, it is a different dungeon.  It is never the same dungeon unless  you input the same seed. The objective of this game, you need to navigate your way down to level 26 to grab a treasure and bring it back to level 0 to complete the game.   You will come across a variety of monster mobs and 7 different bosses to kill.  Once you grab a treasure at level 26,  heading back to level 0, you'll find difficult mobs existing at all levels.  This is identical to Impossible mode except it is not that way at start. The difficulty of this game is relatively easy (considering my guide) but there is Impossible mode where you'll deal with potential powerful monster mobs right away starting Level 1 instead of deep in the dungeon.  The drawbacks of this game I have found to be is that there are too many hats that often are useless.  You can find a hat at beginning of the game and still use the same one despite coming across 20 hats before finally finding a better one so late in the game.  I would like to have some kind of consistency that let me see weaker equipments at beginning and gets better every next level.  Another drawback,  the coloring of potions (about 10 different colorings)  are random.  Which means, you have to drink them all first to figure out what each potion do.   a Dark Violet potion might have given you +100 health last game but next game could be anything but that.  That can be annoying for anyone who disagree with that feature.I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in having a casual fun out of a dungeon-crawler game.  You will enjoy a ""different"" game every time you start one.   This meant your experience of this game will be unique every time.   I would rate this  between 6.5 to 7 out of 10.   This would have been higher if it was not for the disappointment of not being able to play multiplayer via internet.   Multiplayer is possible only via local coop.  By local, you have to have 1-3 friends with you playing on the same screen.  (up to 4 players multiplayer)			"

												As a huge fan of rogue-likes, this is one game in the genre I tried hard to like and - ultimately - didn't.  You start off in a tavern, with this odd field of view.  Legend of Dungeon tries to be a 3D game, but when projectiles are coming toward you, it's hard to dodge them due to the fact you can't move the camera angle?  Get ready to be blindsided alot in this game.  Overall, I thought it had a funny, mysterious air - with silly weapons involving cake, cats, and even lasers!  However, with the clunky inventory management, there is yet another problem created by having too much unique content versus needing to improve the presentation of basic functions.  Speaking of content, there is a lot of depth to this game and many ways to challenge yourself.  This game is designed with arcade players in mind.  There are many floors with a wide variety of enemies, secrets, and traps to figure out.  I like how there's not really a designated 'boss room' - an exciting feature that requires you to stay alert while playing.In short, this game broke the mold in many ways, but I felt Legend of Dungeon created more of a cult following than an enjoyable experience.  If you are willing to stare at the Legend of Dungeon wiki[legend-of-dungeon.wikia.com] for awhile, or try the add-on - Legend of Dungeon Masters - you may find this game enjoyable.  There's so many variables, you just can't go in blind on this title.  It's more of a learning experience than a fun game.  I can't recommend it.  Game was gifted from a friend a few years ago.			"

												I honestly don't understand why slightly more than a third of the reviews are negative, the game is great. You can find weapons, potions, armor, and food, which is plenty. The graphics are pixelated, (which suit the sound effects) and the gameplay is worth the price. So if you are looking for a new game, this should be a very considerable option.			"

												Pixel art, procedurally generated, dungeon hack n' slash. Even with the simplified ""how to play"" menu option, there's a bit of a learning curve when you start. That being said, the game is a pick-up-and-play kind of game - it's just that there really isn't much in terms of direction. Go through doors, kill enemies, collect things, try and find the next floor/level, and kill bosses. There always seems to be something new each time you play. Once you get going, you won't want to stop.			"

												Let's begin with the negative. The combat in Legend of Dungeon is fairly poor. It's unrewarding and the controls are somewhat clunky making maneuverability frustrating and difficult. If you're looking for a strong combat system and tight controls, I would reccomend you stay away from this game. I was personally a little dissapointed, however, I soon found Legend of Dungeon has loads to offer. The randomly generated dungeons, countless items, multiplayer compatability, and Virtual Reality option all make for an enjoyable experience. I bought this game on sale for $2.99, and I would reccomend that you wait for a discount as well.			"

												A unique take on randomly generated dungeon exploration game, Legend of Dungeon is like a hybrid of roguelikes and sidescrolling action games.  The music is kind of an electro medieval funk (also randomly generated) and graphics have a retro arcadey feel with a lot of particle effects.Unfortunately, the devs have still not implemented a save feature, which for purists might not matter, but can get pretty fustrating if you are on a great run and real life calls.  I believe there are plans for one to be patched in.Highly reccomended with that one caveat.UPDATE: A save feature has now been implemented; along the lines of a one time save/restore when you have to leave the game, which is pretty much what I was waiting for.

												Similar Games:Rogue Legacy, Fez, and Dungeon SiegeThe Good:The graphics of this game are very similar to Fez, in that the characters and enemies are 2D and the backgrounds are 3D.  It is used to excellent effect, has fantastic lighting and particle effects which fit perfectly with the art direction.Sound and music are atmospheric without being overbearing. In the tradition of procedural generation, the dungeon is never the same, but this does not just extend to the setting.  Potions are labelled with their color (and sometimes random adjectives) and have random effects.  Items are random as well – I once had a coffee mug as a hat, until I switched it out for a deer’s head.Other randomness includes the appearance of random characters, including a Doctor Who (complete with phone booth).  And random weapons – not just swords but spells and guns.  It’s all random, really.Includes both friend and global scoreboards – on the Global, I have yet to crack the top thousand… :(This game is a true labor of love – even the game company name, Robot Loves Kitty, comes from the nicknames these two lovers have for one another.  Joystiq did a fantastic write-up of the money-saving methods this couple went through to pursue their dream of game development (http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/09/legend-of-dungeon-devs-secret-to-saving-money-live-in-a-tree/) and deserves your money on that merit alone.The Bad:One of the issues which plagues almost every game in which combat is engaged on a 2d plane within a 3d environment – hit detection can be problematic because you have to be in line with your target.  This is an issue which harkens back to the great 2D brawlers like Final Fight and Double Dragon.Some of the levels get rather dark, but since item and equipment drops are randomized, you can’t be sure of having a source of light in order to explore them.This game is screaming for an online co-op mode – which for all I know may be forthcoming.  I would love to share this experience with a friend, descending into the darkness.Can you play it while the children are awake?:Sure, it’s pretty harmless stuff.  Nothing more graphically violent than, say, their Saturday morning cartoon.While I’m picking nits…What will they call the company if these two break up?  “Robot despises Kitty”? “Robot is no longer speaking to Kitty”? “Kitty caught Robot with another feline”? Also, how has no one drawn the obvious analogy to Data and Spot?Did I make time to complete it?:I have not yet made it to the 26th floor (which is supposedly the end) but I expect to at some point.Recommended Purchase Price:$9.99.

												This game is hard.  Really hard.  Not like that annoying Spelunky ""screw up for even a fraction of a second and you're dead"" hard, but still quite challenging.  I've yet to complete a single run successfully.  It's maddening.So why do I keep coming back and playing it over and over?Really, I can't figure it out.  You'd think a game where you consistently get your [insert body part here] handed to you by various dungeon monsters would get old and demoralizing, but if anything I find myself even more energized after a particularly (relatively) successful run that ends in failure.  Before I know it I'm pressing start and exploring yet another randomly generated dungeon.It might be the loot. While variety isn't huge, there's enough that you are never quite sure what you're going to pick up, whether you're going to have a highly defensive run, snap up a hugely powerful weapon, or maybe get your hands on some of the more fun utility equipment like bunny ears for high-jump fun.  Every so often you get little to nothing in the way of good loot, but that's quite rare.It could also be the gameplay itself.  Simple controls, sprite-style block renders presented in a fixed perspective, and a randomly generated 26-level dungeon filled with monsters, treasure, switches, secret passages, and all sorts of other fun things.  If you're okay with the graphics style, the inner explorer in you should be quite satisfied.There's also the light tongue-in-cheek campy tone the game sets throughout the dungeon. Yes, there are scary monsters that can kill you in a heartbeat if you aren't careful, but (for example) a Vampire might utter a cliche chiptune-rendered ""blah"" as he reconstitutes after turning into a bat swarm and gibbing you.  There's also the matter of the cats which inexplicably populate the dungeon, and which at times can functions as inventory, armor (hats, specifically), or even weapons.  Cat weapons, you ask?  One (hyphenated) word, my friend: Laser-cats.About the only bad thing I can say about this game is not bad so much as a missed opportunity: the game has co-op play, but it's local co-op only, as in everyone playing on the same computer with different controllers.  The game makes the most of this by allowing you to completely customize controls for each player, up to and including having multiple players use different sections of the keyboard to play for people lacking enough USB controllers.  Still, it's not as convenient as having each person able to play at separate computers - and more importantly, separate monitors.Regardless of why it's fun, the fact remains that this game is fun.  I'm not going to devote a huge amount of my time to it or anything, but It's one of my many go-to games when I have a little time to kill and no particular desire to play something with a complicated plot or with much tactical thinking required.  Go down stairs to dungeon, kill baddies, grab loot, lather, rinse, repeat, wipe hands on pants.  Beautiful simplicity.			"

It is  a lot of fun if you can get 4 people playing on the same PC and harkens back to 4-player arcade games like Guantlet except with way more random events and the quirky sense of humor of the devs to keep you on your toes.  Most of the potions have unknown effects so you have to experiment quite a bit to see what each on does, oftren with harmful and hilarious results.   Did I mention hats?  There are some amazing hats in this game that have all kinds of different stat modifiers for the players.  The monsters are tough, varied and often do things that you are not expecting.  So if you are a fan of classic 4-player beat 'em ups and modern roguelikes you really will love this game.			"

Then walk outside and chug all 6 beers one right after the next. If I survive the first couple of monsters drunk I know that dude is tough enough to keep playing. My second playthrough found me looking like a heroine addict busting out of the girls room with purple hair and a mini skirt. By the end of that run I was wearing a skull mask, balancing a plasma ball on top of my head, and shooting green skulls at a couple of vampires who were shooting spirit bats back at me. This game is fun and addicting.			"

												Legend of Dungeon claims to synthesize beat-em-up action with roguelike elements, but ultimately falls short in entertainment value. While the music, graphics, and overall style are exemplary and delightful, the gameplay style encourages an exceedingly cautious, grindy, and overall slow-paced crawl through repetitious, maze-like dungeon floors. The 'action' elements are often quirky in mechanical terms, and even a skilled player with great items will die on lower floors unless they haltingly work their way past enemies to keep their health from being whittled down. In short, Legend of Dungeon requires a great deal of patience, but players who are willing to sit and watch enemy movements for hours will be rewarded with the hope of survival. That hope, however, is unwarranted: a randomly horrifying layout on the next floor may still cut their adventure short.			"

												I found this game incredibly boring. Some of the items can be fun but I got to level 10 without a challenge at all, then I fell asleep. Honestly you can just bop most enemies if you pay attention to item damage, and if you use a seed you can end up getting some pretty ridiculous health/items going on. I can't even see this game being more fun with friends.Most dungeon-type crawlers have some sort of objective, vague or no. Legend of Dungeon tosses you into a very tiny, repetetive, easy-mode with no semblance of a goal except to tediously attempt to find the staircase to go lower. For what? EDIT: someone commented to let me know of the goal of the game: reach the 26th level. 	Unfortunately I think the game is so dry and boring that I can't even IMAGINE trying to through that much of it. Perhaps the most irritating thing about this game is the way you end up relying on secret doors which makes a tedious boring game even more tedious and boring, somehow.I lied. The most annoying thing is that you'll spend some hours pointlessly going lower with no challenge, only to have an enemy in the dark(that you can still oneshot) be on a slightly different y-axis than you. Then you die.There are much better games in this genre out there. Go check those out.			"

												After reading some of the negative reviews, I was skeptical at first.  But after installing and playing for quite some time, I do not understand some of the criticism this game has received.  There do seem to have been some patches since some of the gameplay I have seen.  Maybe you should update this game and try it out again.The lack of class distinction is easily offset by the wide variety of items you stumble upon.  To those who say there is a lack of variety in LoD and it's just a basic sword slash game, you obviously haven't been deeper than the first couple floors.  By the time I get to the tenth floor on each run, my character is truly unique and I am having a blast playing.  I would recommend this game to any gamers who love surprises and are up to the challenge.  The only thing more I could ask for is a online multiplayer mode.			"

												This is a game full of great humor, beautiful artwork and lighting effects, amazing dynamic music, scary monsters, challenge, and surprises.  The premise is simple; like many roguelikes you need to travel to the bottom of the dungeon, and return with the treasure.  Each level is randomly generated, so the game is never the same twice.  The monsters generally get tougher the lower you get, but they are also mostly random, so keep an eye out for death, even on level 1.  There are only two equipment slots, what's in your hand, and what's on your head.  Since the head is the only dedicated armor slot, this means hats.  Lots and lots of hats.The dungeon wants to kill you, and will almost always succeed.  About half the time it will be monsters you are unequipped to handle showing up unexpectedly. Some of the time it will be mistimed jumps into lava or a trap crushing you to death.  Almost always it will be because of an item you see that you want so badly to get, be it gold coins, a potion, a dragon helm, or a sword of 5k blades.  Overconfidence makes up the rest of dying.  Often the dungeon will spawn a very powerful item early in the game, allowing descent through the upper floors with reckless abandon and prompting the player to rush headlong into monsters they can't handle.While the game is not yet finished, it is ceratinly worth buying.  The upcoming patch (Version,  Tormentor) adds a couple of hotkeys for easier inventory management, dungeon seeds for reproducable dungeons, daily dungeons with a hi-score archive on Tumblr, game saving, and an 'impossible mode' for those of us who think the game is too easy to beat.  The future holds free updaets to add pets and character classes, so there's a lot to look forward to!The only drawback is that there is no online multiplayer, but there is something to be said for actually meeting up with friends to play games.  Be aware however, while it's technically up to four player co-op, projectile weapons can still hurt your friends, and so can pushing them into enemies or lava.Right now I give the game an 8/10, and once all of the updates are out, I'm sure that will be at least a 9/10; with infinite replayability, you can't get much better entertainment value for the dollar than Legend of Dungeon.

												Legend of Dungeon has an appealing graphic style with its pixel art. I found it to be quite cute. Other than that, I found the game itself rather lacking in gameplay. The core game consists of fighting your way through monsters to go further and further down accessed by stairways towards the 26th floor. Reaching your way towards the 26th floor, you take the treasure there and are tasked with bringing it back to the 1st level without dying. As one could assess, this game has perma death. So once you die you start from the 1st floor.As I continued to play, what I found with the game was the combat was simply uninsteresting and not fun. Melee attacks were of one motion, being swung downwards regardless of any type of melee weapon you picked up. Magic items were of a similar type being thrown as a skull with the same animation (nevertheless cute). There are no skills or abilities to be used. The lack of variety of items were also disappointing. After awhile I realized most items I came across seem very similar to another I had just picked up. Simply a variant skin with -/+ attributes. The loot you picked up were either weapons, potions, or hats. Hats and weapons were the only equipable items. Loot itself was in a sense unsatisfying. Though again, the redeeming qualities of the art was something to be reckoned with. All the hats were either ridiculously funny and/or adorable. After ample time of getting used to and understanding what Legend of Dungeon had to offer, it turned into a game without much substance. I was disappointed to see that the game offered much less then I initially thought. Legend of Dungeon is by no means a bad game, but neither is it good. I'd recommend buying the game when on sale as opposed to the asking price of $10. "

												Played Single Player only, via keyboard.I state the two above items because they feature almost entirely in my not recommending the game.What I enjoyed: I enjoyed the lighting and the graphics (to an extent)What I did NOT enjoy: The gameplay.The controls were not friendly, shifting through gear was agonizing, throwing out crap items is a disaster (you just pick them back up), and you have no idea what any of your items do. Drinking mystery potions can be entertaining sometimes, but ALL potions seemed to ALWAYS be mysteries.Descending level by level seemed to change very little, other than some new and fairly unintelligent but spammy monsters (summon infinite slimes!). There might be joy in learning HOW to play the game well, but after several playthroughs I felt that all I had learned was to expect crazy outcomes from potions and scrolls, and to have no idea what any of the ""hats"" and weapons actually do.Maybe multiplayer would have overshadowed these annoyances, but local-co-op is not multiplayer and in my opinion not an option on the PC.In the end, dealing with the terrible inventory management, completely incomprehensible items, and lack-luster changes floor after floor drove me away.  The only real challenge was not killing yourself on stupid items, and trying to survive the climbing slope of difficulty via equiping items that make very little sense.			"

												A simply brilliant rogue-like with beautiful design aspects. Don't let the pixelated look fool you. The way the devs use color and light (especially) makes this game really stand out from an aesthetic stand-point. There is always something flashing or glowing or light coming from something you have equiped and it all adds up to give the game a truly unique look. To top it all off, the sound effects compliment the aesthetics perfectly and you end up with a totally emersive experience.The gameplay is just as pleasing as the design. The controls are tight and responsive and are set by the user before you even attempt your first run. There is a nice variety of weapons and hats (which act as your defensive equips) and it's always  fun finding that new weapon that does massive damage or that new hat that makes your run faster or jump higher or whatever. Being a rogue-like, no 2 runs are ever the same and this random aspect gives the game possible endless replayability.This game is still in beta and the devs are constantly adding new content. There are now different classes (i.e., knights, rogues, mages etc) and a new pet system which I'm just starting to really get to know. I'll update this review once I get a better feel for it all or the game hits it's final release.As it stands now, this game is an easy 9/10 for me and absolutely worth the small price. This is one of the rare games that makes me want to buy copies for my friends just so they can experience it for themselves and to also help the devs and hopefully encourage them to keep up the amazing work. This game is a perfect example of everything that is right about indie gaming.			"

												Is this a game you'll get hours upon hours of single-player time in? Hard to say; I think I'll be pretty much done with it in single-player after I do my first successful completion of the game. So far that's been a real endurance challenge, as resources get scarce and danger escalates the farther down you go, and in proper roguelike faction you never know whether the game will toss you something really useful or totally hold out on you.Is this a game that will be fun to whip out at nerd parties, with you and your friends seeing how far you can get in the space of an evening, getting drunk and laughing at your misfortune and the silliness of some of the items? Heck yeah. Maybe even turn it into a drinking game while you're at it. Something like: ""take a shot when you quaff any potion"" That kind of fun makes the game worth it, especially at sale price.Oh... and the blend of 8-bit graphics and detailed lighting is definitely nice to look at.

												First off, the game is very fun. It handles pretty smoothly, the RNG keeps things fresh, and it's beautiful in both sound and graphics. Secondly, there's a surprising amount of depth in the items and the difficulty of the game. Enough to keep me coming back repeatedly.People keep citing Binding of Isaac as inspiration for/similar to this game, but I see more of Dungeon Stone Crawl Soup than anything else here. The randomized dungeons, the similar amount of floors, the similar goal. The only real Binding of Isaac-esque thing I see in this game is the descrepincy between it being ""Rogue-like"", as Stone Crawl Soup is, and being ""Rogue-lite"" as Binding of Isaac is.The starter class is utterly terrible and it is, from my experience, a decent amount of work to unlock the other classes. Some enemies are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and often I get hit when I can't clearly see why. There's little direction on why you do what you do or even what your overarching goal is(Or, at least I wasn't entirely sure until my third go around.) While I enjoy how obscure the game is on item and equipment effects, I feel it can also work to it's detriment at times, as the menu, to me, seems rather unintuitive and uninformative, which served to make me frustrated at first.Overall, I'd give the game an 8/10 and will definitely keep watching this game as it updates.

Not Quite LegendaryLegend of Dungeon = Roguelite-lite + Commodore 64 + Rainbow VomitThis game reminds me of action games back on the ol' Commodore 64.  I make this reference even though I know it will plainly sail straight over the heads of most of you youngsters, making me feel like the aging and increasingly irrelevant gaming hipster that I am.  *sigh*Uh, anyway.  The premise of this game is very Rogue.  IE - Journey to the bottom of the randomly generated dungeon to collect the frazzledazzled THING and return for ultimate glory.  Unlike Rogue, it is very light on the RPG mechanics.  You collect glowing experience orbs from fallen enemies and gain levels which translates into direct health and damage increases.  There is no stat or skill management whatsoever.The graphics are extremely charming and look like a sweet cocktail of Paper Mario, Realm of the Mad God, and Superbrothers Swords & Sorcery.  The lighting effects in particular are great to behold, lending a bit of rave neon to the otherwise repetitive and uninteresting brick environments.Combat is both terribly simplistic and very tactical.  You only have two mapped buttons to switch gear between and simple one-button attacks.  However combat is very deliberately paced and timing and planning are more important than button mashing.  For the most part the melee itself is mostly uninteresting as you swat at enemies with your pixelated implements of pain.  However, as you progress there are a number of weapons and items that have interesting properties that make them far more interesting to use.  Want to summon a room full of glowing pink succubi to whip your foes into submission?  There's a spellbook for that.Items and gear are likewise extremely simple.  There is no armor other than a hat/mask.  Most of these items are barely more than humorous cosmetics but some have alternative properties other than adding to your defense.  Some might light up a room and free your hand from carrying a lantern, while others may make you jump higher.  Like Rogue, there are the random assortment of potions for each run.  There is no way to identify them other than by drinking one, so take note of their effects. Hint: Vomit = Bad.There are a number of interesting boss battles to contend with, which can be entirely punishing and impossible if you weren't lucky enough to be graced with the right items during your trip down.  Other times you might cut right through them as if they were rice paper because you chanced upon some of the game's more overpowered items.  Difficulty is definitely a bit uneven, which tends to be true of any Roguelike game.Drink the Sickly Green Potion if you... Desire a Roguelite that is a bit off the beaten path.  This game defintely has a unique vibe to it that melds the gameplay and graphics of the 1980s with modern day sensibilities. Enjoy a silly game.  There are deadly Unicorns that fart rainbows to found as well as visors that let you shoot eye beams. Love olde tyme sound effects.  They're straight out of an Atari game.Throw the Kitten into the lava if you... Really aren't sold on ""oldskool"" appeal.  A lot of what is to be enjoyed here relies on that, and you probably won't get this game if that's not your bag. Demand traditional RPG stat crunching.  This game only has the window-dressing of stats and you have little influence over them other than your limited choice of equipment. Are easily bored by repetition.  A lot of dungeon runs quickly feel very ""samey"" due to the scenery bearing little of visual distinction or interest.  There are a few unlocks to find but once you've done a couple runs to the bottom you will have more or less seen most of what the game has to offer.The Bottom LineLegend of Dungeon quickly grew on me with its eclectic mix of visual and gameplay elements.  From womping foes with a giant, glowing hammer to wearing a Shatner mask, to summoning a room full of skeletons.  I'm a huge fan of Adventure Time which brings together so many disparate elements like this and perhaps this is why Legend of Dungeon initially appealed to me.However, after 20 hours or so I soon began to find the experience a bit bleak.  When you trundle through the same environments over and over and see the same enemies throughout it quickly starts to feel like a chore to get to the bottom.  I am not against simple mechanics but feel that this game is too simple.  Part of the fun of a Roguelike is the replayability you get from trying out new classes, spawning with different gear, and discovering new items and enemies fairly regularly.Depsite its shortcomings, Legend of Dungeon has become one of those games I come back to every once in a while.  It's a solid Roguelite experience and I'd love to see this title become the first in a series.  Take the core elements, expand upon them with more interesting character generation and more/more varied environments, enemies, and items and you could easily have a true legend on your hands.			"

												I remember I bought this game years ago through humble bundle. I played it a few times during the beta, beat it once, got bored with it and put it down for a while.A couple years later I decide to see what progress they made and was disappointed in several of the changes.Firstly, a couple of the enemies they added are beyond frustrating. The ghosts in particular do ridiculous damage, move quickly, are virtually invisible, are almost impossible to not trade hits when killing with a melee weapon, and spawn randomly even in rooms you've cleared out. In dark rooms, you simply can't see them. You'll just get hit with 50 damage repeatedly until you're dead. It's stupid. Another enemy that makes no sense is this stupid unicorn that does a rainbow charge attack which hits multiple enemies and lights them on fire. It's just badly designed and needs to be rethought.The are additional classes to unlock, but the way you unlock them is a pointless waste of time. You find them somewhere randomly throughout the 26 floors, then you have to escort them back up to the tavern. Prepare to waste literal hours doing this if they're down on floor 17 like one was for me.There simply aren't enough health items considering the combat in this game is so utterly basic and almost seems designed to trade hits with virtually every enemy. In addition to this, enemies LOVE to crowd the doorway you're trying to exit, so you can't make it through the room without taking damage from several enemies just because they camp your entrance. As for health items, there are apples which heal a whopping 5 health, a 30 hp potion, and a 100 hp potion. Potions in general aren't that plentiful, and even when you find them, there's about a 1 in 12 chance of getting one of the healing potions due to the variety of other effects they could have. Also, toward the endgame, the 30 hp and even the 100 hp potion start becoming obsolete because you have literal hundreds of health.The inventory system is the worst designed inventory system I have ever seen for a game. It's like something that belongs on a D&D game on Intellivision back in 1982. Also, the stat system is confusing and takes several playthroughs to figure out what bonuses are better than others. The items are neat, but the rng system loves to give crappy hats that you'll never wear in a million years all the way down on floor 15. Why?In conclusion, the game has changed a lot from what I originally remember it. It was a cool looking roguelike that was unfinished, and now it's a frustrating experience that hasn't evolved the mechanics over several years of development. Do not buy, especially for $10. Honestly, I wouldn't bother playing this game even if you got it for free. It's not worth your time no irrespective of how much it costs. You'll sink hours into a single play session, constantly frustrated at how much damage you're taking because the combat system is so terrible, then you'll die and have nothing. Sound like fun? No? Thought so.			"

												Do you know what a rogue-like is? THIS.  THIS IS WHAT A ROGUE-LIKE IS.  Not FTL, not Necropolis, THIS.What makes this a Rogue-Like and other games not-item effects are semi-random, meaning you need to make sure to have a note pad or good memory else you may use a bad item by accident-your goal is to get the treasure and get back to the surface-level layouts are random, but that is not what makes this Rogue-like.  what DOES is that there are several secret passages and hidden areas.-enemies sometimes do different things, such as cast spells that don't necessarily help them-some items are useless, some are dangerous, and some are opDo I recommend this game? yes.  Only downside is co-op is local only.			"

												In the spirit of all of those old-school randomly generated RPGS (like Telengard, Hack, and Sword of Fargoal) that were nearly if not truly impossible to win but still fun trying -- this retro-game is a true gem that achieves what it sets out to accomplish. Very humorous and tounge-in-cheek, it's a fun little game that I play casually when I haven't the time or patience for something heavier. You start in a tavern with a dungeon beneath, and weak and poorly geared you descend into a 26-level labyrinth with progressively nastier monsters and cooler loot as you go. YOU WILL DIE. A LOT. I have enjoyed the game a great deal, but doubt I may successfully complete the quest -- though I know it CAN be done! Enemies are varied and there is much to learn about how to handle (or avoid) each of them. Skill, luck, and using what you're given are big factors. Game is cute, but unforgiving, though you can play several lives like munching potato chips. That Devil that summons armies of demons can be shot in the face with a revolver. That cyclops can be lured into a pit of lava. That Party-hat might have better stats, but you still should keep your mining helmet for when it gets dark. That potion may make you barf rainbows, or give you needed healing. The Scythe you got for killing the grim reaper is awesome, but you can't scrape the dozen zombie hands that are tying you down with it. Did I really find a giant fire-sword on level 2? Omg, DROIDS? I am shooting ghosts... with a CAT? (all of these are thoughts I've had while playing this game.) If you love retro-gaming, this game loves you back.			"

												Legend of Dungeon; A roguelike beat 'em up, and quite a fine one too. I know these pixel like graphics don't appeal to everyone but I have a soft spot for them and I enjoy the art style, especially with that awesome lighting system. The game may appear boring at first or after awhile but the real fun kicks in when you start getting good equipment such as giant swords and my personal favorites, magic books. You get an exhilerating feeling seeing a magic book lying on the floor and want to dash as fast as you can to get it, they contain some of the best forms of offense... or the worst, depends on the book.Can I recommend it personally? Yeah, this is quite a fun game to me. Can I recommend it for everyone? ... I don't know. If you don't like beat 'em ups and/or roguelikes, you probably won't like this. If you're willing to expand your horizon, give it a shot. Don't let the slow starts bum you out, keep going, maybe the next room will have that unicorn head hammer you've been dying for.			"

												It's a twist on the permadeath Rogue-like dungeon crawling, and it's really good. As in any Rogue-like, the first few runs death comes quick and easy.The hats. Oh the hats. Play this game for the hats, though, let's be real.			"

												Game is GREAT expecially on VR the only downsides ive noticed, expecially for a game like this im very suprised of NO mod support at all, so if your expecting mods.... they arent there, nor can use any form of editors. REALLY wish there was mods, id be working on em all day! I just hope the team adds more items and hopefully mod support but its been out for nearly 3 years now. So i very much doubt it, maybe make a second game? Even though the team is apparently low on cash, they can make a skyrim out of this, just. Its great, beyond all expectations. Its suprising, rewarding, and very much fulfilling. Just feels like there is so much more potential, they just need to work on it and show it			"

												Amusing tough game. Doesn't have easy/m/hard settings, cause the levels you reach + the crap you pick up change each time you play; the sandboxing makes everything is a little differet each time, so you need to adjust your strategy. Your character can pick up spell books randomly. My complaint is that as you progress... you are pretty much dependent on at least a few spell books. By the time you reach like level 24, often times there will be a room with a really brutal enemy right against the door, or 4-5 of them agains the door.. so you can hardly move. Very tough game. Its got the 8-bit warmth but with new-age style lighting etc. Recommended			"

												The game has gorgeous graphics and the lighting is stunning not just for a game of this style. The gameplay is easy to pick up as well as fun and challenging to master. A 2.5 semi platforming rogue like dungeon crawl to the treasure and then back up again to brag in the tavern. Also the devs of this game are hard working, supportive of the indie community as a whole, and just wonderful people all around. Just give them your money. Stop reading this and buy the game already.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a REAL roguelike. This is by far the truest form of a roguelike game, and it deserves attention from roguelike enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Binding of Isaac has unlocked items and characters, many of which can be too easy. Rogue Legacy has stats and gold carried over between playthroughs.Legend of Dungeon is a REAL. ROGUELIKE. Your goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon, grab the treasure, and get back out. One life, permadeath, start over from the beginning. No stats are conserved, no inventory is conserved, no gold is conserved. If you die, you lose everything. The graphics are a very cool 2.5D pixelart style with a 3D dynamic lighting engine running seamlessly on top of it. (See the trailer, the lights are beautiful). Characters can be enhanced and customized with gear as you progress through the dungeon and uncover items. This is a true work of solid game design, high graphical quality (as far as pixel art games go), and the spirit of roguelike gameplay. Give it a try.Many of the negative reviews this game recieved are undeserved in my opinion, and I want to address a few. Complaints include:Poor combat - Simple, but not really ""poor"". The combat is varied enough in the types of weapons you get and it promotes smart handling of enemies rather than hack-n-slash overkill combos with QTEs.Bland Design - The game is PROCEDURALLY GENERATED. The environments aren't terribly complex, but they look great and the game feels immersive. Apples to apples, it's just as boring as Minecraft world generation, and nobody complains about that.Lack of Online Co-Op - this is a legitimate complaint because sadly this CoD generation of gamers assumes that online play needs to be a feature for every game... BUT, The game does not have it in its current state (maybe after beta?). Nowhere in the description is online play advertised. LEARN TO READ. DO NOT BUY A LOCAL CO-OP GAME AND EXPECT ONLINE PLAY.All in all, this is a great game and deserves attention. If you're unsure, maybe wait for a sale to pop up or go play it with a friend.

												Fantastic game alone- even better with friends! (real, fleshy friends, that is- no online play...) positives: Fairly simple gameplay is made enjoyable and rewarding by the genuinely impressive variety of weapons, hats, and gizmo's available, and the rouge-like elements keep things nice and fresh. One play through you'll be keeping track of the bullets left in your revolver, each one a precious resource- the next you'll be madly summing armies of skeletons, to fight mages madly summining armies of skeletons right back at you! There is an undeniable sense of glee in finding a new weapon, trying it out on a passing snake or bat, and seeing some crazy new mechanic you never new existed oblitorate your unfortunate target- realising I now had the power to shoot lazers from my eyes was a particually enjoabyle moment!The game sports a variety of modes for different moods. As well as a standard dungeon crawl, you have the option for fully randomized dungeons that don't scale in difficulty to your progress, 'nightmare' dungeons for the experienced delver, and of course the rouge-like standard of a 'daily dungeon'. Each mode comes with it's own leaderboards, lending a competative edge to the game- nothing rewards a good run quite like landing a place in the all-time leaderboards!The graphics are suprisingly lovely too- the '3D space, 2D pixel sprites' look is an interesting one, certainly, and the creatures are all represented well in both appearence and sound design. (if you aren't slightly saddened by the 8bit whimper of a long dead ghost as it dies a second death, you might not be human yourself)Downsides: There is the occasional sense of missed oppertunity with some of the mechanics. The puzzle elements (such as fire traps, hidden walls, and moving staircases) are very limited in their functionality due to the procedural level design- you will never find your path blocked by a fire wall, and have to venture deeper into the dungeon to disable it. Instead, firewalls feel as if they are placed a little haphazzardly, and their activators are never located outside of the room they are found in. Also, of course, it's not for everyone- if deep combat mechanics (as apposed to varied), narrative complexity, or cutting edge graphics are important to you, then this obviously isn't going to be your cup of tea. But to be honest, ""does its own thing, really quite well, isn't going to please everyone"" is hardly a downside!Also worth mentioning is the impressive effort put in to the procedural music- each time you enter the dungeon, enemies and objects are assigned a layer of music on some pseudo-random basis, and these layers will then meld together as you play, depending on what's on screen. The fact that such an interesting system even functions is impressive, let alone sounds good- all hail intellegent collaboration between indie devs and indie musicians!!!			"

												I personnally love this game! I love the way it doesn't hold your hand at all and you have to figure things out yourself. Also I love how every dungeon is different and random, this may sem like a no brainer but still it's something that makes your journey more personal and over all enjoyableThe combat is a bit simple at first but after a while you'll be faced with an enemy where you can't just click a bunch or you'll die so you have to come up a stratagie to kill the enemy without losing much life because regaining life can be quite an endevour. I liked the emense amount of stuff you can find especially the hats and all the different kinds of potions and weapons you find through out the game.Somthing that truly sold the game for me was the incredable amount of enemies in the game. when I first bought the game I was thinking it would be like a legend of zelda, Binding of issac kind of thing but what I got was way more different and awesome than I was expecting.Also this game has multiplayer which I personally haven't checked out yet but will do soon.I would definetely recommend this to anyone who is up for a challenge but be warned this game is really hard and not for people who hate losing.

												This is a great game in the new, ever-expanding rogue-lite genre. Don't let the first few levels fool you -- the game is hard! While others might complain that the mechanics are too easy, the reality is that you need to minimize the damage you get from even basic monsters if you'll have any hope of reaching the treasure. The skill in this game is knowing your enemies well: knowing which enemies to avoid, which to run away from, and how to hit the rest of them without getting hit in return. The graphics are a marvelous mix of old and new, with truly beautiful lighting effects, and the music is incredibly good (far better than what I'm used to in this genre).A few downsides: 1. There isn't enough randomness or variety in the dungeon layouts. Compared to Spelunky where levels feel mostly original each time, the dungeon levels here feel repetitive. This is balanced out by the fact that the dungeon levels aren't the main source of randomness here -- the monsters and items are.2. Summoned monsters are too easy to abuse via spamming. I really wish the dev would do something about this. Basically, once you get a summoning spell, you can spam critters in every room, killing the monsters and preventing you from getting hit. Regardless, this is a great game and if you liked Spelunky & FTL, there's a good chance you'll like this one as well.			"

												The game is fun single player, but it really shines if you have a few gamepads and some friends to play local co-op with as it is easy to pick up and play with just about anyone, but is difficult and rewarding enough to keep you interested.The game itself is fairly simplistic in design.  You basically just roam around a random dungeon looking for weapons and hats as you descend deeper, facing more challenging foes as you go down.  You can attack things with your weapon and jump and that's about it.  There is leveling up, but you do not have character points to allocate or anything like that.  Even though this sounds very basic, it does not make for a less enjoyable game.  In fact I'd say this game cuts out a lot of the clutter and time consuming fluff and just delivers an accessible exploration and loot finding experience with an old-school feel.Along the way, you will find randomized potions which can have permanent positive or negative effects on your character.  There are also occasionally hidden passages to find as well as mini-bosses which, when defeated, deliver a very satisfying spray of coins, xp and possibly special items.  I don't want to spoil any of the loot I have seen, but when you find something powerful it is quite enjoyable.The game's graphics are a mix of (extremely) old-school pixel art with a more modern lighting engine.  The lighting in rooms varies from well-lit in many areas, to pitch black in other places.  Fortunately, at the tavern where you start, there is a lantern on one of the tables which can be used to see in dark places until you find a better light source.  The dark areas really help to add some tension, especially as you get deeper and don't know what might be lurking in the shadows.The game certainly isn’t perfect though, and clearly could use some work in some areas.  In particular, the lack of any explanation of what the stats are can make item selection confusing.  Also, you don’t seem to be able to sell things when you find a shop so you wind up just throwing things into a corner or lava pit to dispose of them.  I also found the game’s method of control setup to be a bit cumbersome as you have to reset every control for that player even if you just want to change one button.Overall, I recommend picking this game up if you are searching for a fun local co-op game to play on PC.  There really isn’t a huge selection of games in this category and this game performs really well in this aspect.			"

												Was looking for games to play on local co-op with a friend. Saw this game was on sale for 3.49 and decided what the hell, looks fun and includes VR.When we first started the game we didn't know what the hell we were doing, controls were a bit wacky which is why we decided to change them in the controls menu at ease. We died in the second level and then we started to get how it worked and what to do. You will die many many times, but you need to be patient and serious if you want to get further into the dungeon. Your health is very important in this game.Pros-Random generated dungeons/loot.-Awesome weapons and armor.-Amazing effects.-Beautiful pixelated graphics.-Good soundtrack.-Very challenging-Can be replayed multiple times with each new dungeon feeling different than the last.-Local Co-op and Singleplayer.-Traps and puzzles.-Multiple bosses and enemies.Cons-Controls are a tad bit weird.-Can't think of any other cons.Overall you should buy this if you're looking for a challenging game to play alone or with friends. I bought this at a sale price which was practically a steal. I would've bought it for 9.99 if it wasn't on sale. Amazing. 11/10			"

												Amazing game! I highly recommend it especially that it's only 10 bucks. The audio is fantastic, the visuals are stunning, and the gameplay is great. The game also  has lots of little references that are fun to find. Overall it's a brilliant little rouge like with tons of replay value.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is an appropriate name for this game by Robot Loves Kitty, and like its namesake is bound to leave a long legacy. Roguelike, this is one of those games that has that edge of your seat madness we all crave when it comes to gaming these days. A visual assasin with controller smashing delight, Legend of Dungeon is genius.I often browse through games that are soon to be released so I can see what I might want to add to my wishlist, anything indie or retro always seems to catch my eye, and this was a perfect candidate. Seeing as the game was still in beta, I usually try not to get too involved before the final product is released. This way, it doesn’t taint my vision of what the developers intend the game to be when its complete. So, with that being said, one half drunken night after coming home from the bar I just said “♥♥♥♥ it.”“Legend has it there is a treasure on the 26th floor…” IF you ever get there that is. Your goal in Legend of Dungeon is to make it to the 26th floor where you will battle your way through hordes of zombies, demons, bats, and creatures that you would only see in your wildest nightmares. Multiple weapons, magic, power ups, coins and don’t forget HATS will help you battle your way to the 26th floor, and trust me, you WILL need them. This is definitely not a simple playthrough by any means. The randomized bosses are a challenge and can quickly become a problem, but make sure you defeat each you come across for special item drops.Addicting within the first 2 minutes, I’d say clear the next 2 hours of your schedule, or even better yet the next 2 days. Graphicly, the visual intensity of this game is amazing. Brilliant lighting mixed in with perfect shading makes this game not only fun to play but fun to watch as well. Legend of Dungeons soundtrack has an old school feel with a modern touch and is almost like a electronic opera filled with emotion. These two elements combined with a flawless attention to detail make for an awesome gaming experience.This game is loaded with all types of different weapons, potions and again HATS, lots and lots of HATS. Weapon wise, you begin with a sword, and throughout the game pick up different weapons as you go. With everything from a flare gun, pistol, saber, lasers that shoot out of your eyes, lasers that shoot out of a CATS eyes, magic spells, and even a lantern, you are well suited when it comes to taking on this castle. Hats make up the brunt of your armor and can range from a normal piece of headgear like a turban, to the outrageous, like a beehive or koala bear. Each hat has a different stat booster, and can sometimes help light the path in a dark area. Potions also make up a large part of the game and can do anything from raise your health and stats, to making you act like a drunken single girl at a bachelorette party. Sometimes, more often than not it’s very unclear what the potions do but like most drugs, you always gotta try it once, right?Replay factor isn’t a problem when it comes to Legend of Dungeon. You feel like you have something to accomplish, and you just don’t feel complete until you do. I love games like this that when everytime you die you come back with avengence, setting goals to achieve while trying to surpass your last attempt at glory. Don’t worry about getting bored with the dungeons either. They change with every game and are randomized, and this makes each attempt better than the last.Every element of Legend of Dungeon seems to amaze me, and I can’t get enough. Enough can’t be said about the brilliant lighting and vibrant colors, the intense and emotional music, or the edge of your seat game play that is experienced with each run. Legend of Dungeon is an automatic hit, and can only get better. Well worth it and another essential in any gamers library.Graphics: 9/10Playability: 7/10Story: 1/10Challenge: 8/10Replay Value: 8/10			"

I think this would preserve the games balance well.Secoundly this game would be so much more if it had a online co-op mode, because honsetly who visits someones house to play games anymore?My Wanted game features:-Temp save feature-some sort of small class system (maybe Paladin[tanks], Archer[damage], Mage[does the heals]-online MultiplayerIts otherwise an awesome game well worth the money if you enjoy the genre!

												A very pleasant surprise. Disregard the negative reviews lamenting the lack of a save option. Like Spelunky, the thrill of this game is precisely in the challenge of navigating a randomized world in one shot. The variety of weapons, hats and potions -- and there are a lot of them -- can significantly altar your game experience, and some of the effects are a little zany. I am hoping for a little more environmental interaction (a la Spelunky's idols and boulders) in future builds. Recommended.			"

If you are looking for a game you can pick up for a few minutes or few hours at a time, then the game is great for you.

												My initial reaction, based soley on nothing I mus add, was that this game was kind of lame. I kept collecting coins and random bits of stuff, I ran around beating things with my sword wondering what to do with my loots. Then I died in a firey pool of lava and game over. That is when I realized, this game is awesome! The point wasn't to get things, it was to adventure as far as you could and get as much loot as you could, then die and do it agian, trying to get more and go farther! Its an awesome game! Putting a fish on your head as a protective item was grand sillieness, as is the whole game, its just a fun game when you get the idea of it. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone! It is a good time killer, that doesnt frustrate you when you die. The character selection is pretty sweet too. Walk into the bathrooms in the tavern and walk out a new man, or woman, just great! Play this game, enjoy it for what it is! The graphics are decent, the gameplay is easy to learn, the coins are bountiful, and the experiance is fun!			"

												Not only is this game really unique in many ways it is also really polished and plays excellent. The combination of familiar elements mixed with some new ones creates a very fresh experience without any significant learning curve. This game is very easy to jump into and start playing without having to go through a boring 20 minute tutorial just to grasp the basics. There are many ways to play and the many different strategies for playing keep this interesting every time. This game also keeps getting better as new and intersting things are added. All in all this is a very cool game that is very well done and thoughtout I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh new experience that you can jump right into and start having fun right from the get go.

												GET IT.The main point is to see how far you can get within the dungeon and how high you score, but it gets pretty damn addicting. I think what draws me in most, is the music and the overall build of the game. 2D pixel characters and enemies within a 3D environment. It's very unique and beautifully done. The lighting as well as the shadows are very well done and I love the overall feel of the game. The items are fun to find, enemies fun to kill, rooms fun to explore. And the best part...it gets progressively harder to stay alive as you descend the floors. There is no saving and that's what makes it so challenging. If you die, you'll have to start over and try again. The dungeons are randomly generated mind you, but that's what makes it fun and different each and every time you play it. It's also a great time killer if you have nothing else to do.All in all though, I love love LOVE this game. I give it a 10/10, but that's probably just me. :)			"

												As an older gamer I often find myself wishing for harder and simpler games that give you fun and laughter and 'bang for your buck' like I had in my ZX Spectrum days. Yes its all a little rose tinted, and yes, most of those very same older games back in the 80s were quite terrible but amongst all that bedroom coded dross there were some startling games. This game, reminds me of those.Its fun, difficult, hectic, random and annoying in that ""one more go!"" way, everything a game should be in my eyes. The graphics, whilst obviously pixelated for either style or fitting in with the current spree of retro looking games, are good and work well. The lighting is very good and adds a decent atmosphere to the game.The music, something those afore mentioned 80s games lacked unless you enjoyed the plink, plink of chip tunes is excellent and again adds to the enjoyment and atmosphere of the game.It has simplistic gameplay and the fighting will never really tax anyone but the point is, it isn't meant to. This is dungeon crawling, looting and roguelike. You are supposed to die, you are supposed to hit and run and not use a cover mechanic. Its basic gameplay done right.I have yet to play the local multiplayer but the singleplay experience is as described above. As a fan of local MP I can only look forward to having 2-3 of us battle away instead of my solo fight. Sadly it is lacking online MP, which would have been a bonus for myself and mates but don't let that put you off if you are after experiencing something like Legend of Dungeon.Great game.			"

If you are looking for a game that you can just jump into and go, with no pesky story or tutorials getting in the way, then this game is great.

												The game consists of exploring dungeon rooms with too little variance to stay interesting for longer than a few minutes, and simply whacking enemies.

The game might be briefly fun when playing cooperatively but does not support networked play so I have not tried it.			"

I've logged several hours and have always enjoyed the randomly generated dungeons, rare loop drops, hordes of skeletons behind SECRET DOORS, minotaurs, vampires, levitating lava bridges, and that's just being lucky enough to reach the twelfth of SIXTY FIVE floors. Couch co-op is boatload of fun and increases the hardiness of the enemies even-handedly. Grab a sword, your trusty lantern, delve deep and resist the urge to throw the kittens in to the lava. It doesn't end well.			"

												Fun for awhile but ultimately frustrating, you will die from just plain starvation. After the apples are eaten your health will be whittled away and there is just nothing that can be done. Factor in the 50 things that want to kill you and it just gets annoying, would be funner if you had some chance to keep going but an hour or two of work can be crushed because a switch was actually a trap, start over. If you like you cusss at your screen and wonder how this was programmed with local co-op only then by all means buy it. I stopped having fun after about level 10, it starts to lean towards unfair, everything seems to get a free shot at my 100Hp and level up increases it but DOES NOT refill it so thanks for nothing extra HP.

												I hate not recommending small development team indie games but Legend of Dungeon has left a sour taste in my mouth. The combat is repetitive, shallow, and generic. All melee weapons have a normal hit and a charge attack. Projectiles are rare and have less variety than the melee weapons.  Spells come in about three different varieties summon, debuff, or damage.What really grinds my gears is.  All 26 floors of the dungeon use the same gray blocks with green moss texture. There are only two sprites for the hero, one human male one human female.In conclusion the game is short and feels incomplete with little replay value. Do not recommend.			"

												A rock-solid Roguelike foundation, pretty art and decent music.  That's it.  Not much interesting or unique beyond that, and some of the core features (inventory) are pretty terrible.  If it's on sale, and you've got some time to waste, might be worth a play.Edit - Gave it more of a go over the past week, and I still can't find any substance here.  Feels like a good foundation to what would have been a great game.			"

												Legend of Dungeon doesn't take itself too seriously, and yet it still manages to be an authentic roguelike experience every time. It's amazing to play with friends and every adventure together is unique. The developers are an inspiration for following their dreams and making Legend of Dungeon happen. Keep up the great work!

												TL;DR version: Game is a solid C/C+. Worth getting for 5/10$ or if you like rogue-likes/dungeon crawlers and want something new. Personally I had some fun but am going to wait till it's a bit more polished, and some bugs are fixed to play it again.Game is still in Alpha/Beta as of this review.Also have not tried coop mode. May or may not make the game more fun.Pros:-Game modes. You can choose between having a new dungeon every death, or a static dungeon that changes every day, or even go off a seed. I think this is a good balance that can accomidate most styles of play.-Classes. Though you have to rescue them from the dungeon first, I liked the veriety available. There seemed to be a good balance between melee/ranged combat; offense/defense; as well as some that fit in the middle.-Items. I liked that nearly any item could spawn at any point of the dungeon. You might get a sword on level 1/2 of the dungeon that you'd use all the way down. However, that being said; compared to the stats you naturally picked up on your character; strength/defensive stats on items are extremely underwhelming. I frequently had runs where my character would get up to 500-700 strength. Weapons could give a lot, but helms (the only other equippable item) - I think the most I ever saw on one was 5-10? Basically useless. -Difficulty. With a few exceptions on seeded dungeons that put difficult monsters very early on; as well as the last few hours of my gameplay, I found the difficulty of the game to be challenging but not frustrating. Character Health/Healing items, which are rare/small in a lot of rogue-likes, were abundant but fair, given the damage of some enemies and the difficulty of later levels of the dungeon.Meh:-Art. Pixel art was OK. Not terrible but nothing to write home about. The dynamic lighting was nice sometimes; other times it was annoying.-Dungeon Veriety. The randomness/pathing of the dungeon didn't bother me; but the tilesets did. You'll recognize patterns almost instantly. There's some variation when you get further down in the dungeon, but it's only a change of skin/color of the bricks - nothing else. Not a big enough deal to make me put it in 'cons', but keep this in mind if you're going to buy it - things are going to get repedative, and fast.Cons:NOTE: As this game is still in alpha/beta, take these with a grain of salt.-2d/3d enviornment. This was one of the most annoying aspects of the game. You have a fixed view, and your character/monsters in the game are 2d; but the enviornment is 3d. This makes moving and combat awkward because you have to be on the same 2d 'plane' to hit anything. To be fair the game is somewhat forgiving, both making monsters automatically orient to your plane to attack you; and giving your attacks some 3d depth to them - but FAR too many times i had a good run come to a halt not because I didn't react to an enemy; but because they could hit me from an angle from which I couldn't; or be flailing around all over, hitting me every second, and me, not able to move up/down to the right orientation to attack back. On that same note; the hitboxes on some enemies and attacks are very misleading and will leave you frustrated. Given the damage that some enemies do in later parts of the game, this gets to be more and more of a glaring flaw.-Combat. A little too simple for my tastes; as your attack is simply that. Press a button, or hold it down to do a little more damage. No parries, blocks, dodges (aside from avoiding things manually), etc. No combo's/special attacks. Normally, I'd put this in the 'Meh' category,  except for the reason I finally gave up on this game . Sometimes, for no observable reason, your attacks will be reflected back on you by 'some means'. I say that in quotes because I was left literally baffled at what would happen. There was no warning, no sign of an enemy using a special attack, nothing to learn from or adapt to your next run - id just press attack, as I would have done thousands of times previously, and just die. This happens especially frequently with ranged weapons. Because of the games nature to favor strength/offensive damage; what this means is that EVEN AT FULL HEALTH, WITH PLENTY OF HEALING ITEMS, YOU CAN KILL YOURSELF IN ONE HIT. When (good) runs take over 1, even 2 hours, to die in this way out of the blue was more than frustrating, and a dealbreaker for me.-'Magic system'. Compared to melee/ranged (guns) attacks, magic is laughably underwhelming. The most powerful offensive damaging magics end up doing as much damage as you'll do with the standard sword within a few levels. Your character levels up strength on thier own; increasing melee/ranged (gun) damage; but there is no corrisponding stat for magic; so the damage/skills remain static. There are a few books to summon creatures, but they generally all too weak to be of any use past the first few levels; not to mention that they get in the way as well. All other magic is generally useless effects. Also, the art/sprites of the magic is all the same - firing a colored skull.-Inventory system. There is none. You pick up items which appear on a rotating 'belt'. You can cycle back and forth, but you can't orginize them in any way, other than dropping them and hoping to pick them up in the right order you want. You can assign some things to hotkeys...if you can keep it to 2. I understand that this game was made with gamepads/controllers in mind; where buttons are limited...but to not have the option to set more if you are using a keyboard seems dumb.-Controls. Pretty minor, but if you want to reset a control you have to reset everything. Meaning, the game will cycle through all keys available to that character, and ask for an input for each one. There's no option to choose what single button/command you want to change.RPG elements/Stat system. Also a minor flaw; mostly because I think this game wasn't meant to be any sort of RPG; but a platformer/dungeon crawler/rogue-like; but it's difficult to see the benifit of stats that your character has. I mean, Health is obvious, and strength is fairly easy to understand in time; but I could never get a handle on defense. Meaning, I had some idea of how much damage monsters did - but having more or less defense; I couldn't tell it making that big of a difference. What this meant is that every character seems to become a glass cannon - only concerned with attack.Despite thier being a lot more Con's than Pro's; I don't hate the game. Up until the last 5-10 or so hours, I was hooked. But I don't see myself playing it again until some of these aspects are fixed.			"

												""this game is pretty entertaining, but very random, and can be better with friends.""This is probably one of my more enjoyable games I own and play, This is a rogue-like 2D dungeon crawler, Kind of. The movement works like a street brawler, You can move closer and further to the screen. The thing i do truly love about this game however is when you can gather items and they have stats. These stats can be stacked to an absurd amount however, You can get a coffee cup, wear it as a hat, and suddenly you are running so fast you cant control yourself, or you can improve your jump so that you rocket to the roof every time. It also does have procedurally generated dungeons, randomly generated enemies and randomly generated loot.This game does have some annoyances however, It seems success can be quite random. Getting down to the lower levels is heavily based on the gear you have and sometimes you can find really crappy gear, or really awesome gear. Also the controller configuration is very annoying, But havent seen any noticable bugs, so thats a plus.Another thing this game has going for it, it the local co-op. You can play with up to four friends and can get quite entertaining. However no online co-op is available and when you die, getting back in the game can be very problematic, especially since most of the time when you die, you fall in lava or something, so you lose all the gear you had on you.In conclusion, this game is pretty entertaining, but very random, and can be better with friends.7.5/10 Alone8/10 with friends			"

												This game looks great, but ultimately lacks substance. I gave it three runs, and by the end of the third, I quit rather than dieing. While the game does have exp. and you can level, that really doesn't mean anything more than your max hp and damage go up. There are no classes to this game, and the inventory is simple next/previous item. There is little explaination of what you're doing, and no reasons as to why you're doing it. While it's not necessary for a rouge-like, it is critical that it's fun to play, but Legend of Dungeon isn't. "

I'd say pass on this one unless you have a way to play it co-op locally or they add more content down the road.			"

												As a man who is fully absorbed in the fairly recent trend of ""EVERY GAME MUST BE A ROGUELIKE/LIKE-LIKE/LITE"", I was thrilled to give this game a go based solely on the video footage, screenshots, and game description on the Steam store page.  I don't recall a time in recent memory when I've experienced a bigger dose of buyer's remorse.  This game is terrible.  Whether you try it with keyboard, mouse, or gamepad, the controls are just plain bad.  The combat is not engaging or fun in any way.  Your abilities are based solely on picking up a random weapon/object in the dungeon, and none of them are any good.  The inventory ""system"" is barely functional, every ""randomized"" dungeon looks exactly the same, and the lack of anything resembling a class system gives this game zero replay value.  Forget ""replay"" value, in my opinion this game has no PLAY value.  Only purchase game if you have a habit of liking bad games ironically.			"

You're going to die.I may not have emphasized that statement well enough, let me hit the ol' ALL CAPS KEY, THAT'S BETTER. YOU'RE GOING TO F*CKING DIE! YOU'RE GONNA DIE SO HARD YOU'LL FORGET YOU WERE TRYING TO REACH THE TREASURE ON THE 26TH LEVEL OF THE DUNGEON.  The thing that sucks about real life is that you can only die once and no matter how awesome you go out, that's it - there goes your one shot. Now I know you're thinking, ""better go douse myself in gasoline and fight cops"" but that's not the best way to go. You've experienced so little that life can offer that you can't even fathom the best way to make a best last impression. Let Legend of Dungeon inspire you. Beat a warlock's face in before you go. Smack a cat (seriously, try it once). Run with a cup of coffee screaming in to a pit of lava. Drink questionably yellow fluids you find. Vomit blood. Worship Satan. Watch some *sshole turn in to dozens of bats - swat them all down for those glorious shiny green balls (XP).  Most importantly, don't read a guide. Just go down there, put on a silly hat, murder sh*t and greet Death with a smile he'll never forget.			"

It panders to the most basic parts of a roguelite which I hate saying because it looks gorgeous. But of course, beauty is only skin deep. And this game has no depth. You walk through a dungeon with only one way out, no bosses, no item rooms (items are just scattered around the area), weird and uninteresting items, one attack button, the same art for each floor, and no incentive to actually play. I'm so disappointed. If you want a good, deep rogue-lite that really gives an interesting challenge, stay far away.			"

												A game as fun as it is not fun.Pros: Stellar art style, the 2.5 D looks really suits this game.Atmospheric music and simple sound effects help you to get sucked in at the beginning.Simple combat that takes no time to figure out.Cons:Simple combat often ends in trading blows with your enemy (while your repository of healing items dwindles).Every room of the dungeon is so samey that it leaves you wanting a more varied scape to explore.The game is rendered as monotonous and loses its luster after the first hour or two, you slowly realize over time that there just isn't a lot to this game.Potions are not identified after first use, keep notepad open.In the end, the roguelike elements do a disservice to the game, as the only enjoyment comes from actually making progress, and the randomization does nothing for the player when the only randomized roguleike elements in the game are the items. the room layouts, and the monsters.  The average roguelike has random events, and a wider array of of strange and interesting goings-on, so starting from the beginning isn't nearly as soul-sucking.  In this game, starting from the beginning means you have to do everything all over again, because the randomization offers little variety.Skip this game or wait for some actual updates, it's shallower than it looks, and it doesn't even look remotely complex.

												One of the funnest games i've ever played. the replay value is unbelievable. it's especially fun when you plug your computer into a large tv and play with a bunch of friends. or play on said large tv by yourself ;) me and my gf can't stop playing. the game is very hard to beat. only like 10 people have beaten it according to the leaderboards, but knowing that you can beat it is what keeps you playing. there's so many great weapons to pickup. the loot dropped from enemies is just XP and money, but that money might buy you a good shield if you miraculously find a store. afterall, the money is what puts you on the leaderboards anyways. more money = higher status. once you perfect your playing, try impossible mode. you will die. no exceptions, YOU WILL DIE!

												This game is a charming, perfectly-balanced time-eater.  It plays like The Binding of Isaac - random drops are very important. At a fundamental level, both games are like playing poker.  This game is truly random. Luck rules everything.  And even if you get miserable luck, and terrible random drops... well, there's always time for one more round.The music is incredible, too... very simple, subtle meanderings that gently grow in volume and complexity. It's the sort of music you don't even notice at first, until it has grown to the point you are bobbing your head along with it, unaware.It took me over a hundred hours to complete. Came close a few times, but then I'd do something stupid like fall in the lava, or [SPOILER REDACTED].Stupid kitties. "

												So far the game has been fun but I can see it wearing out very quickly espcially without the ability to save your progress. What the game needs is a better way to manage your invitory, possibly by using hotkeys for quick action and more enjoyment. The level design is well...a dungeon but it's not even a cool dungeon. The levels all look the same and can get boring really quickly. I think with the ability to save progress, a better invitory system+hotkeys, and different looking levels, this game would be well worth the $10. Right now I'd say it's worth about $5 maximum and the only reason I bought it was anticipation/the low price. The fact is that most of the negative reviews are accurate which is sad considering how awesome this game can look before you purchase it. I'm sure since the game barely just released on steam there will be plenty of DLC content to come in the future. I just hope they fix the key areas I mentioned above. I would not recommend this game to anyone who likes to save their progress and expects the gameplay features to mirror it's graphic design. The bottom line is: if you are looking for a dungeon crawler that's balanced between casual and exciting, this game is for you. Otherwise, try something else.			"

												I want to love this game, I've put alot of hours into it, but it's basically an exersize in futility, if you buy it, play impossible mode only, it's a good challenge and being screwed by the RNG is more acceptable in Impossible than in Normal mode. The graphics are what you expect, we've all seen indie pixel games.The multiplayer doesn't work, the seeds are always random. Though, to some extent it has a classic RPG feel to it; it falls down to do any lack of immersion. TL;DR Cats everywhere, indie pixel graphics, overall meh. Good work for 2 people.			"

												I followed the development of LoD closely, and I was really excited about it. It was the last time I remember really looking forward to a game release - excited in some of the way we all got excited about upcoming games in highschool. This and Hammerwatch - both hyped as Zelda/Y's -like hack n slash RPG adventures with roguelike elements. LoD (and Hammerwatch to be thorough) released and I was so let down. Hammerwatch is great but not quite what it was supposed to be. Legend of Dungeon - this game - was an utter disappointment. It was NOTHING like the development hype and blogs. No real RPG elements, no adventure, no quests really - its a Roguelike and pretty much just that. Room to room combat, pick up a few items, try to unlock hidden content that nobody could care about. Nothing in this game is motivating, nothing makes me want to play further. For all intents and purposes, the developers either scrapped everyting good in this game (aside from the artwork) at the last minute, or they intentionally decieved us to sell units by representing it as an adventure or anything with RPG elements - which do not measurably exist in LoD.Legend of Dungeon is a dull, skeleton of a game with no content of interest, nothing remotely fun, and seems to be a Michael Bay-esque experiment in ""lets see how little effort we can exert and still make lots of money"". Either the developers didnt care, had no intention of making the game they promised during development, or are just not very imaginative or creative. The artwork and technology in regards to visuals is/are stunningly beautiful, the lighting alone is amazing. But pretty tech does not a good game make. Is this actually a tech demo they spun as a game to make some bucks? The game just isnt there guys - its more simplistic than 1980's original version of Gauntlet.			"

												Do you wish Dr. Chaos was procedurally generated and ten times as confusing to map? Do you like ""lite"" Roguelikes presented as sidescrolling platformers where the main weapon has about a ten-pixel range? Do you like having to hold the ""down"" key to actually move out of a doorway after going through a door? Boy howdy are you ever in for a treat here. The music is interesting, the graphics are nice in an Out of This World / Flashback kind of way, and I guess the concept of a side-scrolling room-based Roguelike hasn't exactly been done to death, but the mechanics here are pi­ss-poor and render the game un-fun, clunky, and tedious in a way rarely seen since the days of 8-bit ""classics"" like Castlequest and that horrible Rocky and Bullwinkle game (though I guess that's sort of an unfair comparison, as Bullwinkle's headbutt probably had a longer range than the sword in this game).There's lots of better Roguelikes out there, and if you want a side-scroller that requires mapping, just find a Dr. Chaos ROM or something.Special shoutouts to the dweeb who reviewed this for Darkstation - guy talks about the ""standard formula"" of Roguelikes and then turns around and rages about how this game has permadeath and doesn't tell you what the potions do before you drink them.

To be honest its difficult to beat as Ive not done so, but its a solid challenge to those willing to take up the task. The items you randomly get each play through are not over powered in any way but every item puts you in the right direct for the majority.If you enjoy some actual company to play the co op it will be hella fun with friends.

												EDIT: As much as I hated on this game in my review below, Legend of Dungeon is a fine game to waste some of your precious time off. Additionally, I forgot to mention that this game has strong potential to be a great game.Worst 1.50 I ever spent. The sheer lack of diversity in items and combat make this game the epitome of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Furthermore, the lack of a somewhat decent menu, displaying your inventory or character stats, make dungeon dwelling within this game meaningless. Further down the dungeon lies an atrocious pile of crap. The settings in which the developers have created are pure garbage. Rebinding keys is a chore and there isn't even a 'Restore to default' button. But hold on, you are forced to rebind keys since the tutorial is non-existant. There is absolutely no explanantion on the controls whatsoever. Makes me think whether or not the developers are plain idiots or apes. While I have listed all the negatives of the game, it does, however, succeed in specific areas of gaming. I guess this dungeon crawling piece of dung can still be fun when played in the vincinity of friends. Button mashing alongside people you love (not that way ;)) is sure a lovely sight. Nevertheless, the Legend of Dungeon is hardly worth your money or time. It's obvious the developers haven't thought of how to execute their concepts properly, in addition to building an user friendly tutorial and menu. Just like Hammerwatch, this game is a slap in the face to nostalgia.			"

It has a unique art style that makes it stand out from the crowd. It features everything you would expect from the genre, but adds a lot more. I'm not a big fan of rogue-likes but I had a blast with this and it kept things interesting enough to keep me coming back for just 1 more go. As you journey deep into the dungeon, you will find weapons, items, and long forgotten magic.. ..if you're lucky, it might help you to fight off the droves of mysterious creatures you will encounter. - Highly Recommended!

												First of all, I'm a great fan of roguelikes and dungeon crawlers so my preferences in games of said genre will always be the progression and diversity of content that the game might be able to present or generate along with the ability of said content to react with other pieces of content. Even though comparing this little game to great titles such as Rogue, Nethack, Dwarf Fortress is just mean, this game could at least have vaguely followed their footsteps (which - if you catch my drift - it clearly didn't)The game has cosy visuals, easy-to-understand combat mechanics, easy-to-understand inventory system and a basic stat system, but that's about it.Let me put it this way: there are people who play games to experience the story, immersion, challenge, content and may prioritize dozens of other aspects. I'm simply a person who enjoys the intricate (and well implemented) systems that games have to offer as well as the challenge curve which rewards learning and mastering said systems. Let's just say that this game lacks this kind of stuff so much that the content BRogue has to offer is colossal in comparison, and BRogue is free.The only thing in this game that's worth 10€ is the pixel graphics, and even then I'm probably only saying so because I - silly me - got the game first and had a look at the content afterwards.

												This game tries to do alot of things cool, but it ultimately fails on fundemental game design in one apect. The way this games designed, there is absolutely no viable way to not take damage no matter how skilled you are. This game does not have strafing, so you have to run be moving into the enemy to attack, or stay still to attack. If strafing was an option to do, while lets say holding the trigger button like the game Hammer watch, this game would be fun to play, but its not, without this the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ not even worth the dollar it goes on sale for. Can you be so good at dark souls you can never take a hit? yes. can you do that with Rouge legacy or Hammerwatch? yes. Can you in this game? no. Such an obvious way to make the game better yet the devs waste their time doing vr and twitch stream compatibility no one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about instead of giving the game depth and improving it. Shoulda stayed in early access and died, because the devs make no effort to make the game better since it came out. TL'DR devs dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about improving the game, the game still controls like♥♥♥♥♥♥and is extremely shallow especially in the controls and viability.			"

												A must buy for roguelike fans. Extremely fun and extremely hard at the same time! the beginning feels a little easy with 1 hitting and 2 hitting most things, but once you are a few floors down, the monsters get pretty creative! Don't want to spoil too much, but although you can still 1 and 2 hit many things, you probably wont get the chance to do so! Each floor feels like a maze where i can make a lucky turn and end up finishing the floor fast, or end up going through the same corridors over and over looking for a new door. Hidden traps and helpful thingies appear everywhere which makes the game feel like a puzzle at some points. Every item you pick up is interesting on their own, and oh so many hats!!!!The game only has local co-op which will limit the amount of replayability it has and the inventory system is pretty horrible. You have to cycle through everything you pick up to try and find something useful to use.Overall the game is fun but has a lot of room to grow. I do recommend the game, but I do not think it is a 10 dollar game yet. Until it gets refined some more, i would wait till a 50% off sale.			"

												Actually not completely terrible.I'm not a big fan of permadeath in games.  I don't like to feel like I've wasted my time trying progress and then lose it all, so I didn't expect to enjoy this game.It's actually much better than I thought it would be though.  The controls on my gamepad are a little off, and I can set them in the game, but I don't like the way the controller configuration works.  it's passable, though. There's also an option to save the game, if you want to stop playing, which is nice.			"

												While there are many things to like about this, the music, the graphics, the items.  However the gameplay and design decisions just kill the game.  Rougelikes are random each time through but this game is just too highly dependent on having luck with loot at the begining levels.  With the enemies quickly ramping up and pitch black rooms, if you don't have find better weapons and a hat/weapon based light source you're going to be screwed within the first couple of levels.   The decision to randomize potions on each playthrough while initially interesting gets real old, real quick since the effect is never presented after the first drink thus requiring you to write down what does what on each playthrough.  Finally, and the biggest deal breaker, is the inventory management, which is a nightmare.  With a single line of items which requires the user to scroll through every single item one by one in order to use it, the system punishes the user if they want to switch hats and weapons to change tactics based on what enemy they encounter.  When all of these issues are combined it just takes what could have been great game to something that is just mediocre.			"

												This is obviously an instance where you should absolutely ignore the metascore.I think the reviewers must have been expecting something other than the essence of a rougelike with action-based combat.It's pure simplicity. It's also gorgeous.I don't know anyone who's down for local co-op, but judging by what I've seen on youtube, it looks like a blast!The Seed function lets you re-try the same dungeon as many times as you want!!!You can even challenge friends for high scores on a level! Just use the same seed!The way the music is all the same song, but shifts tone from room-to-room is just lovely.I love this game.Buy this game.Buy it multiple times, so your friends can practice before they come over to hang.

												I didn't enjoy playing the game. You explore a bunch of rooms, pull levers, fight some monsters, eat a million apples every other screen and find some weird hats but even after spending 2 hours or so i don't even know what the point of the game is. The time i spent with the game i was bored a lot.The artstyle looks nice but seems to conflict with the actual mechanics of the game. You can't attack up or down, and enemies that are above or below you are sometimes hard to hit. The game lacks an inventory screen or a better way to manage your inventory because with the current system it takes forever to switch items. The combat in general is rather dull, something rushes you down and you just mash your attack button a bunch of times, repeat for most other enemies.			"

												After sinking some hours into this game, I still don't know whether I find myself recommending it at all. It's kind of a bland arcade beat-em-up and it doesn't have much depth as a Roguelike. It's easily broken - finding a good spell tome and spamming rooms of enemies with your own friendly monsters is game-breakingly effective. The game is apparently too good to keep track of the potions I've discovered, leading me to accidentally waste healing potions at full health. I've apparently broken the Gambler special room by merely selecting the left and right crates every time. Carrying more than five Inventory items is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ even with two quick-select buttons. And the way it does randomized dungeons sucks, as it creates levels with inaccessible secrets and sometimes hides dungeon exits behind secret walls, forcing a trek back through the same three bland rooms before finally figuring out which wall to push against. It's not a bad game - but it needs a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ refinement.I slagged this game off because it doesn't have a save system, and I'm glad the developers put one in so I can explore and quit at my leisure. But there's still quite a lot of work to do to bring the game up to snuff.			"

So much fun, and there is loads of loot (ie. hats) and mobs, it will never get old. If you like games with loot, lots of mobs, hacking and slashing and a nice pixel-art style, then this is a game for you! It's a shame there is no online play, but if you can get a few controllers and a few guys sat around one PC (cue ideal situation for a Steam Machine) then the multiplayer is great too!+ Great pixel art aesthetic and lighting effects.+ Random generation means high replayability.+ Great mob variety.- Local co-op only.- Combat is fairly simplistic.

												This game is a LOT of fun. Prepare to die... a lot! While it is possible to complete the game, it should not be your goal, otherwise you will likely get very frustrated very fast. ;)This game is a survive as long as you can type of game, mixing brawler style elements with a roguelike style random dungeon and monsters. Luck will have a huge effect on your success, but there's nothing more rewarding than getting really far in the dungeon with crappy loot, it means you are actually doing very good.Highly recommended if that is your type of game, you can't go wrong. As a plus, the game looks really amazing. The mix of retro-style pixel art with modern 3D effects is stunning, which further helps immersion. The developpers (a husband and wife team!) are very talented, kudos!Well worth your money, get it now!			"

												This game is super rad! Especially with friends! I've mostly played locally with other friends and it's great. I also enjoy playing the game alone, but I really recommend this game to people who like to play with another person or as a group because trading items with each other, using friendly-fire confusion spells, climbing ontop of each other to reach an item on a ledge, and strategizing each person's role are some unique parts of the gameplay you can only get when playing with others. I also just really like a lot of aspects from the game such as smashing apples against your face to heal, summoning an army of skeletons, sometimes vomiting up your potions, accidentally killing cats, and wearing a lot of weird things as hats.

												 Do you love cats? Do you love lasers? Wouldn't you love to have laser shooting cats from hell? Legend of dungeon has many weapons as bizzare as laser shooting cats that can be found or dropped from monsters or bosses. this offers a unique set of playthroughs each time you start the game. Have friends that visit you everyday?!....i don't! but it doesn't stop me from playing an intresting singleplayer.when you start you have literally no options to create a character, but it can be randomized by entering the super space paradox transgender surgeon bathrooms, you'll always get a randomized character by entering and exiting one of these. As much as i love dungeon crawling, The Legend of Dungeon really feels like dungeon crawling.

												I spent quite a bit of time on this, relatively speaking.  And I have to say that despite all the quirky items and pleasant nuances, it wasn't worth it.  The price is fine, but the time it sucks out of you isn't worth the payoff in neither enjoyment playing it or the ending.I'll give a few examples.  To unlock a class, I had to backtrack through more than twenty floors, spray painting what amounted to a bread crumb trail, just because otherwise the NPC you are escorting will die.  I did that for more than a dozen times and less than half of that was successful.  The appeal of managing that minimalistic UI and working through sheer memory wears off quickly.  I don't want to remember what potion does what, grind snakes for apples (HP), circle through the floor for mobs & exp, or hide in a corner and shoot random floating homing skulls for five minutes to beat a boss anymore.  And of course playing with friends is more fun, but isn't everything?I played over 2000 games of free cell, 1000 games of Mahjong Titans, hundreds upon hundreds of games of minesweeper and solitaire, nearly a thousand games of The Binding of Isaac, and so on.  I don't mind repetitive for the most part, but I don't want the game to demand my focus and at the same time make my efforts feel futile.  And that's what this game does.			"

Posted: August 31, 2015
												I am looking for good games for myself. My parameters are: -I'm busy. I don't have a lot of time to sink into games. I just want something that's really fun every now and then, for a few minutes or maybe an hour or two once a week. Because of that, games that are really hard, games that require grind, games that are slow to get into, and games that get confusing if you put it down for a while and then come back, are not good. If it's a story, it's better actually if it's not to long. I'll never finish a 50 hour game, and that will just irritate me, because I hate not finishing a story. Also:-I like good art, good story, good sound, interesting worlds.-I like good puzzles, well done action. Humor.-I like feeling my time playing has been of some real value. I've learned something, been uplifted by great artistry, been inspired, been amused, been challenged, grown. I'm never bored. I don't need a 'Time Sink' I hate 'time sinks.'Games I've loved include Cave Story, Portal, Flow.So, with that background, on to the review. I'll give it to you simple: I only played 30 minutes, because that's all the time the game held me for. And the last ten or fifteen was me being graceful. Sad truth: I've got a lot of games I haven't played. I don't have time to give each game two hours. If it loses me, that's it. deleated. That's what happened.Pros: I loved the art and the sound. There was some good sense of humor. The most fun I had was when my computer was acting up and as I flailed to get focus back on the screen I accidentally drank some beer and was attacked by a bat. That was entertaining.Cons: either not much happens, or it takes more doing to get to things happening. I killed a bunch of bats and snakes with an irritating sword. Flipped some switches, most of which did nothing, and thoroughly explored the first level. Couldn't find my way to the second level. Either there was some puzzle I would have to figure out, or a door I missed. In any case, the game didn't grab me enough to want to try. Wanted More: there was one potion that made me throw up rainbows. that was great. I wanted to have some kind of ranged spell weapon that looked cool. but I didn't find one and I had no idea when I might. The cool or funny things ended up being pretty slow in coming, and the sword was really irritating. combat wasn't fun with it.I'm sorry developer, my heart goes out to you for making a pretty game, but after fiddling around for a half hour I have no desire to play any more. I guess it was too slow? Not that I wanted more combat, the combat needs to be made more satisfying, at least in the beginning bits. If you're waiting till later to make it fun, it's not working.Anyhoo, that about wraps up my thoughts. Maybe this kind of game is your cup of tea and you'll love it. To be fair, most games are not my thing. I'm extremely picky because of my limited time.End verdict: deleted after 30 minutes, never going to look at again. Feel bad for the developers. The video’s look really cool but the actual gameplay is boring, at least in the very early bits, playing by myself. If you have lots of time on your hands, read someone else’s review and get off my lawn you darn kids. "

Posted: July 7, 2015
												As a note before this review, I am biased. I am a huge user interface snob, and as such I found this game nigh unplayable. The only issues I really had concerned the UI, so if you don't think it would bother you too much, you might get a great deal of enjoyment from this game. However, because of the UI issues, I cannot recommend it myself.I loaded up the game and went to change the resolution. Immediately, the first issue arose. There is no drop down menu to select a resolution; instead, I have to cycle through all of them to my desired choice.  ""Oh well"", I thought, and returned to the main menu and clicked on start. The game told me to hold down to enter the tavern. Lacking a controller, I naturally press and hold the 's' key, for a significant amount of time. Nothing happened. I tried the down arrow. Nothing happened. It would seem that the default keys are, most likely, for controllers, even if you don't have one plugged in (except escape, which luckily took me back to the main menu). I set up the controls, unsure how it would play, and continued. After a couple of minutes of playing, it became apparent that I needed to change some of the buttons. So I went back to options to change, and had to re-enter every key again, just to get to the one I wanted to change. I was a little frustrated, but these issues would no longer affect my gameplay.A short while later, I realised just how annoying this game was going to be. I had 10 items to cycle through, with the only way to do this being a next and previous item method. 5 button presses to get from my sword to my apples (which are used for health restoration), and I'd only been playing for 5 minutes on level 1. It was only going to get worse as I got more useful items, too. This is the main reason why I do not recommend this game.I'm sure many people would just tell me to drop the items that I don't need, and keep a small supply. A lot of games have some way of forcing the player to regulate their inventory, normally in the form of limited slots (both inventory and hotbar slots) and/or weight management. This works well, and is used in a great number of titles. It forces the player to make a decision on what items they might need immediately (hotbar), while not allowing an infinite supply of items that can make the game too easy, or make the inventory unnavigable. Awkward or lacking controls are not an effective or enjoyable method of inventory management. It's as simple as that.Ignoring the UI issues, the graphics and visual effects are fantastic. This is the level of graphics detail that all indie games should aspire to have, it really is. The enemies, characters, attacks, particle effects, levels, and especially the tavern, are unrivalled. I quite possibly haven't seen any other game of comparable style come close to how great Legend of Dungeon looks, it is truly impressive.The music and sound effects are also absolutely top notch. Every item you pick up makes a brilliant noise, as do all the enemies. I pay so much attention to my exp bar because the colourful explosion when leveling up is so awesome, I never want to accidentally miss it. Even the sound effects in the menu are really good, too.Gameplay wise, it's not leagues ahead like it's graphics/sound, but it is certainly good (ignoring of course the rather severe inventory issue that I've gone far too in depth about). You hack and slash and jump your way through varying enemies and obstacles. The dungeons seem vast and difficult to navigate, and I've already found myself wondering how to get back to certain areas. The gameplay is nothing special, but it is certainly fun. I imagine that this would be a great multiplayer title, it really would.Unfortunately, the developers have fallen into what I assume must be the deepest trap indie development has; the pile of corpses inside is now so large that the stench is overwhelming. With their limited budget, they have decided to emulate older games, because it is cheaper. This is great in terms of graphics and sound (both of which are excellent in Legend of Dungeon), and even gameplay, for some titles, but should no longer be acceptable in terms of UI design. It does not take oodles of cash to make your UI usable. The inventory system is an absolute mess, and it's for that reason that I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Meh, the art style was quite unique, and it seemed promising, though I found it wasn't very engaging.  The lack of a plot or an explanation on how to play the game didn't help it for me.  The UI navigation and controls was poorly designed. The sound was so-so.

The VR option is still in beta(desptite being adversited and listed as VR capable) and is unplayable on my current setup. The game lags and does not keep up with the head unit, often fading out to the Vive grid room every few seconds. The SteamVR status will quickly flash to the game being unresponsive.

												The game can be fun and its super colorful. Sound is good and cheery. I do have a few issues with the game itself however. The potions are a mess. They randomize them and you have to go thru the process of elemination and thats just not that much fun for a tough game like this. The game is super tough and most I doubt will ever see the ending of this game. I did watch a win on youtube itself and its nothing great. If you never see the end your not missing much.The game play itself can be funny with cat hats and other goodies. No cats were harmed in the making of this game.  Not a bad game but I think the asking price of $10 dollars is a little on the high side. I paid $1 dollar for this and 2 other games. Not much to say because the game is somewhat simplistic overall. Run thru the dungeon killing things and at the end either your killed( more then likely) or you win. This game begs for multiplayer and you think it would be easy peasy to do it but I dont think its in the cards sadly. Co op is possible if you like to watch one screen. I think the meta critic side is a little low I would give it a 7/10I have found a loophole and did make it to the last floor. I got the  treasure and made it back up. I made a backup of the savefile as my brother pointed out ot me I could. I also found out that I could spawn creatures to fight for me. Fun game but really super hard still.			"

												I spent quite a bit of time on this, relatively speaking.  And I have to say that despite all the quirky items and pleasant nuances, it wasn't worth it.  The price is fine, but the time it sucks out of you isn't worth the payoff in neither enjoyment playing it or the ending.I'll give a few examples.  To unlock a class, I had to backtrack through more than twenty floors, spray painting what amounted to a bread crumb trail, just because otherwise the NPC you are escorting will die.  I did that for more than a dozen times and less than half of that was successful.  The appeal of managing that minimalistic UI and working through sheer memory wears off quickly.  I don't want to remember what potion does what, grind snakes for apples (HP), circle through the floor for mobs & exp, or hide in a corner and shoot random floating homing skulls for five minutes to beat a boss anymore.  And of course playing with friends is more fun, but isn't everything?I played over 2000 games of free cell, 1000 games of Mahjong Titans, hundreds upon hundreds of games of minesweeper and solitaire, nearly a thousand games of The Binding of Isaac, and so on.  I don't mind repetitive for the most part, but I don't want the game to demand my focus and at the same time make my efforts feel futile.  And that's what this game does.			"

Posted: August 31, 2015
												I am looking for good games for myself. My parameters are: -I'm busy. I don't have a lot of time to sink into games. I just want something that's really fun every now and then, for a few minutes or maybe an hour or two once a week. Because of that, games that are really hard, games that require grind, games that are slow to get into, and games that get confusing if you put it down for a while and then come back, are not good. If it's a story, it's better actually if it's not to long. I'll never finish a 50 hour game, and that will just irritate me, because I hate not finishing a story. Also:-I like good art, good story, good sound, interesting worlds.-I like good puzzles, well done action. Humor.-I like feeling my time playing has been of some real value. I've learned something, been uplifted by great artistry, been inspired, been amused, been challenged, grown. I'm never bored. I don't need a 'Time Sink' I hate 'time sinks.'Games I've loved include Cave Story, Portal, Flow.So, with that background, on to the review. I'll give it to you simple: I only played 30 minutes, because that's all the time the game held me for. And the last ten or fifteen was me being graceful. Sad truth: I've got a lot of games I haven't played. I don't have time to give each game two hours. If it loses me, that's it. deleated. That's what happened.Pros: I loved the art and the sound. There was some good sense of humor. The most fun I had was when my computer was acting up and as I flailed to get focus back on the screen I accidentally drank some beer and was attacked by a bat. That was entertaining.Cons: either not much happens, or it takes more doing to get to things happening. I killed a bunch of bats and snakes with an irritating sword. Flipped some switches, most of which did nothing, and thoroughly explored the first level. Couldn't find my way to the second level. Either there was some puzzle I would have to figure out, or a door I missed. In any case, the game didn't grab me enough to want to try. Wanted More: there was one potion that made me throw up rainbows. that was great. I wanted to have some kind of ranged spell weapon that looked cool. but I didn't find one and I had no idea when I might. The cool or funny things ended up being pretty slow in coming, and the sword was really irritating. combat wasn't fun with it.I'm sorry developer, my heart goes out to you for making a pretty game, but after fiddling around for a half hour I have no desire to play any more. I guess it was too slow? Not that I wanted more combat, the combat needs to be made more satisfying, at least in the beginning bits. If you're waiting till later to make it fun, it's not working.Anyhoo, that about wraps up my thoughts. Maybe this kind of game is your cup of tea and you'll love it. To be fair, most games are not my thing. I'm extremely picky because of my limited time.End verdict: deleted after 30 minutes, never going to look at again. Feel bad for the developers. The video’s look really cool but the actual gameplay is boring, at least in the very early bits, playing by myself. If you have lots of time on your hands, read someone else’s review and get off my lawn you darn kids. "

Posted: July 7, 2015
												As a note before this review, I am biased. I am a huge user interface snob, and as such I found this game nigh unplayable. The only issues I really had concerned the UI, so if you don't think it would bother you too much, you might get a great deal of enjoyment from this game. However, because of the UI issues, I cannot recommend it myself.I loaded up the game and went to change the resolution. Immediately, the first issue arose. There is no drop down menu to select a resolution; instead, I have to cycle through all of them to my desired choice.  ""Oh well"", I thought, and returned to the main menu and clicked on start. The game told me to hold down to enter the tavern. Lacking a controller, I naturally press and hold the 's' key, for a significant amount of time. Nothing happened. I tried the down arrow. Nothing happened. It would seem that the default keys are, most likely, for controllers, even if you don't have one plugged in (except escape, which luckily took me back to the main menu). I set up the controls, unsure how it would play, and continued. After a couple of minutes of playing, it became apparent that I needed to change some of the buttons. So I went back to options to change, and had to re-enter every key again, just to get to the one I wanted to change. I was a little frustrated, but these issues would no longer affect my gameplay.A short while later, I realised just how annoying this game was going to be. I had 10 items to cycle through, with the only way to do this being a next and previous item method. 5 button presses to get from my sword to my apples (which are used for health restoration), and I'd only been playing for 5 minutes on level 1. It was only going to get worse as I got more useful items, too. This is the main reason why I do not recommend this game.I'm sure many people would just tell me to drop the items that I don't need, and keep a small supply. A lot of games have some way of forcing the player to regulate their inventory, normally in the form of limited slots (both inventory and hotbar slots) and/or weight management. This works well, and is used in a great number of titles. It forces the player to make a decision on what items they might need immediately (hotbar), while not allowing an infinite supply of items that can make the game too easy, or make the inventory unnavigable. Awkward or lacking controls are not an effective or enjoyable method of inventory management. It's as simple as that.Ignoring the UI issues, the graphics and visual effects are fantastic. This is the level of graphics detail that all indie games should aspire to have, it really is. The enemies, characters, attacks, particle effects, levels, and especially the tavern, are unrivalled. I quite possibly haven't seen any other game of comparable style come close to how great Legend of Dungeon looks, it is truly impressive.The music and sound effects are also absolutely top notch. Every item you pick up makes a brilliant noise, as do all the enemies. I pay so much attention to my exp bar because the colourful explosion when leveling up is so awesome, I never want to accidentally miss it. Even the sound effects in the menu are really good, too.Gameplay wise, it's not leagues ahead like it's graphics/sound, but it is certainly good (ignoring of course the rather severe inventory issue that I've gone far too in depth about). You hack and slash and jump your way through varying enemies and obstacles. The dungeons seem vast and difficult to navigate, and I've already found myself wondering how to get back to certain areas. The gameplay is nothing special, but it is certainly fun. I imagine that this would be a great multiplayer title, it really would.Unfortunately, the developers have fallen into what I assume must be the deepest trap indie development has; the pile of corpses inside is now so large that the stench is overwhelming. With their limited budget, they have decided to emulate older games, because it is cheaper. This is great in terms of graphics and sound (both of which are excellent in Legend of Dungeon), and even gameplay, for some titles, but should no longer be acceptable in terms of UI design. It does not take oodles of cash to make your UI usable. The inventory system is an absolute mess, and it's for that reason that I cannot recommend this game.			"

												As you can see by my play time. I Love this game. In all the times I have played this game I have not even got to the back of the Dungeon. I have had some pretty incredible items a few times and I was just sure that I would be able to do it this time. I love how every time you play it is a new map and new random items. I have been playing PC games since they were first invented and I love the old style of art as well. It reminds me of the 1st king's quest and space quest games that you had to roam around until you find your way. Such an amazing game. I like the multiplayer in this game too. I would like to see an online multiplayer add on or something. that is the only suggestion I would make for the developer/creator of this game. I am so glad you have spent all these years making this amazing game. Thanks!			"

												So bad. I can't believe this actually made it past Steam Greenlight. I love pixel art and Legend of Dungeon does not dissappoint in that department. I assume this is why others, along with myself, were drawn in. Although this 'thing' has unique pixel art, it has absolutely no other positive aspect. Legend of Dungeon not only lacks replayability, but lacks playability of any sort. I truly wonder how the developers could feel comfortable selling, let alone releasing, a product as unfinished as this. I say unfinished because I want to believe that this was not the product that the developers originally envisioned. Notice that I did not once refer this as a game, because it is not. It is not even close to being a finished product that can be called a game.TL;DR: Metaphorically, lets refer to the gameplay as the cake, and the art as the icing.

												This game is not for everybody, but if it's for you, you're going to love it!  Bottom Line: It's a brilliantly executed and polished example of a dungeon-crawling rogue-like.This is old-school at it's best--get ready to explore this thing!  There are no enemy health bars, or detailed character skill trees, or magic cool-down timers.  What you get instead is the thrill of picking up an esoterically named tome, and trying to figure out what it does (and if it's going to be good or bad for you!)  Dungeon floors are randomized, as are the items and potion effects, making each delve a unique experience.  Yes, there is permadeath.  No, you don't get to save your game.  You don't keep a leveled up character, instead you need to ""level-up"" your own skills to be able to make it far enough to recover the treasure!  For example, each weapon has a unique attack range and speed, (not shown as a number) which you'll need to get the hang of in order to maximize your ability to crush monsters!  This is the kind of game where the fun comes from the emergent stories that you can tell by experiencing it--not from a pre-scripted narrative.  In other words, it's an old-school role playing game!  Plus it looks and sounds gorgeous!			"

												Preface: Buy it on sale for under $5. I personally don't feel the game is worth $10.The game is pretty fun. The graphics, though pixelated, are quite good--the lighting effects are particularly pleasing. The visual style is great as well and really suits the game. The soundtrack is very nice. The randomized rooms and levels keep things interesting, although they often feel pretty similar. Combat isn't much to talk about--there is one attack key and you just hack and slash. There are some interesting melee and ranged weapons, however, and spells add some extra spice. The variety of enemies and randomized loot is great and definitely makes exploring fun. There is local co-op as well. Overall it's a fun game to get for cheap and play for an hour every now and then.			"

												This game is really neat, with nice graphs and cool soundtrack. But it's a bit of a downer knowing that this game won't have an online support, it would make it really great! Nevertheless, if you wanna an uncompromised fun for a really good price, this is a great game to buy! I am eagerly expecting LoD2. :)			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a really good game. I love the weapons and hats that you find through out the dungeon. The music is also really nice. Legend of Dungeon is all around a good game. If I were to score it I would give it somewhere between a 7.5 to 8.5 out of 10. It is worth the ten dollars and if it is on sale I would jump on it if I were you.			"

												I don't get much out of the multiplayer, as it just feels frustrating dragging your friends around (levels are kinds small for a full field of friends). Single player is entertaining, but where I found this game really shone was with the Vive (beta mode). I've played a LOT of VR titles, but the weird diorama effect of this game was truly unique.It's a must have for early Vive adopters.			"

												The style is reminiscent of Atari, very 8-bit. It's a simple action RPG. You can jump, use the item in hand and move in 4 directions. It's a 2D side view, but imagine a stage, where the hero has a bit of depth to move around. There is a series of bosses and always-better loot. And stats that usually go up, except for health.The game's style initially turned me off, but as I had fun, it grew on me. It's a not a super-deep game, but fun little diversion every now and then.

												Overall view, a great game! The randomly generated dungeons can sometimes be repetative but overall create a new experiance that keeps the player coming back for more. The highlight of this game I find to be the beautiful artwork. From the shadows to the lighting and pixel effects I can't get enough of how good this game looks. From a loot standpoint some runs you find utter crap weapons or amazing unique ones you haven't found before. Funny stats also add to this and can help a player. Local co-op is also a nice feature and this game is fun to play with friends. What would make it even better is online co-op though it may be difficult to add. So for the price I highly urge you to get this game! The combination of loot, the music, and the artstyle all come together to form a fun playing experiance.			"

												This game is pretty bad. You are a slow moving pixel hero. Your look is randomized but that's it. You find weapons, some spells, but they are all devastatingly similar, the combat is also very repetitive and boring, so are the randomly generated levels.The combat is basically charging your sword attack for a billion years, and unleashing a strong attack, or quick attacks who do low damage, no combos or anything.You can only use one item at a time, you have to scroll trough whetever is in your inventory, all spells, weapons and potions are in the same menu, so if you want to heal you cant attack since you have to scroll trough countless items. Spells seem to be randomized, but it only means that the only projectile you throw, always a skull, has different colors, sometimes it deals damage, sometimes it hits a wall and becomes a box, which cannot damage enemies, meaning your spell is useless.This game is what bad indie games are, do not touch it.

												A fairly poor roguelite action game.  Hard to hit enemies due to a short attack arc.  Bad GUI which leads to irritation when you have to cycle through your gear.  And lastly, just bad level design that is bland and boring.  The game is procedural yes, but that doesn't matter really when the only thing different is where the outline of each door is or a slight deviation in a board's pathing.  I got this game for just over 1 buck off steam and that's where I reccomend you buy it if you're REALLY bored.			"

I honestly didn't play Legend of Dungeon much and wasn't impressed with what I did play. It's sterile, boring and lifeless but not in a good atmospheric way. I usually like procedural generation too, but the levels here felt too random and devoid of interetsing things to do. Not one of the better games in the genre.			"

												Consisting of 26 randomly generated levels in each run, Legend of Dungeon offers much in the form of loot to aid you on your quest for the lost treasure. With randomly generated items such as different swords and sorcery pamphlets, to varying forms of hats that modify your attributes, Legend of Dungeon does not lack in variety. Although a pixely platformer, the lighting in this game will amaze, as well as the soundtrack will blow you away. Not for the light of heart, Legend of Dungeon presents quite a challenge and never ceases to provide an interesting experience. I highly recommend this game for any fans of the roguelike genre.			"

												An extremely charming randomized rogue-like that you should really give a go if you're a fan of the genre. Do you find puking rainbows, and cat hats enjoyable? No? well you're wrong anyway. The combat boils down to essentially one button but randomized effects on pickups makes it passable enough to enjoy nonetheless. The art style,  soundscape, and brand of humor really bring it home for me though, and will be the aspects that keep bringing me back even after/if I ever beat it. The inclusion of local co-op is a rarity for pc games and something I deeply respect, it adds a ton of fun to the game and thus should be taken advantage of if possible. Despite it's artsy feel it, like other games in the rogue vain can be rather challenging so beware.			"

												Welcome to Legend of Dungeon. This is the 8bit game that is completely random and that was made possible by gamers thanks to Kickstarter.Legend of Dungeon is a 1 to 4 player local co-op game where you can invite your friends over just like how it used to be during the retro gaming age. With this being said, controllers are supported so everyone can play. I love this idea but in a world of online gaming I would have loved to play this game with friends that do not live nearby. Also each time you play, you have to configure your controller setup. This could be fixed once the game is launched and I hope it will be. It is a slight oversight however. Legend of Dungeon was made to be played with controllers and not the keyboard but you can play with either or.Like any classic RPG game, you start off in the tavern. From there you make your way down different levels of dungeons. Each time you start a new game the layout of the dungeons are different. The same goes for the weapons and items that you pick up, the music and the monsters that you will face. When they say this game is random, it really is. This keeps this not-so-simple dungeon crawler game fresh. Once I started to play this game solo, I didn’t want to stop. There’s a leaderboard that brings the motivation to get the highest score possible. Not only that, the challenge truly comes from how deep can you get into the dungeon before you die. When playing solo once you get killed, that is it, game over and you start from the first level. When playing with more than one player death doesn’t apply, not really. When a member of your party dies they turn into a ghost. The rest of the party members must kill monsters in order for them to drop orbs that the ghost needs to return to the living. If the entire party turns into ghosts, the quest is over.You’ll walk into rooms with traps, pressure plates and various other traps that will try to stop you from reaching the last level. Make sure before you leave the tavern that you take some very important items with you like apples for health and a lantern. Some levels are completely dark and you don’t want to be walking blind right into a lava pit or into the axe of a monster, do you?If you like retro RPG gaming, this game is for you. For those who enjoy arcade beat’em-ups like TMNT, you will enjoy this game as well. For ten dollars, Legend of Dungeon is a good buy. Check it out on Steam! It is a game that you need to take some time aside since you cannot save your progress as you try to reach the bottom levels. Legend of Dungeon is a innovated game thanks to having everything randomize to keep you guessing.			"

That changed when they introduced unlockable classes!Look, this is a brutal roguelike.  There will be runs where nothing goes your way.  And there will be runs where you find a really powerful weapon lying on the ground.  Keep with it, and eventually you'll find the knight and bring her back to the inn to unlock her as a class option.  This will change the entire game!

												Really like this game a bunch! the only problem i have with it is that co-op play can be a hassle if you want to play with more than 2 people and don't have any controllers to play with the reason is because everyone has to split the keyboard up into 4 sections and that becomes a pain because with such limited space on the keyboard you accidently press other people's buttons and throw them off. four player is pretty much impossible without gamepads. and i really feel like this game should have an online option to group up with others. otherwise aside from those small complaints i have about it this game is really fun to play and very hard to beat because of its randomness. great game and would recommend the buy as it is quite fun to play. i wish my fellow adventurers the best of luck and may the potion rng game be on your side!

												Very boring. Love the sountrack but the game lacks many natural aspects a good indie game should. I was lost from the get go. There are no instructions on how to play/what buttons to press. All you do is walk through doors to get to the next level, no challenge. Loved the art, but overall very boring.			"

												Super fun randomized dungeon crawl with beat-em-up style gameplay and permadeath. Unbelievable potential if a few features are added:1. the ability to do nethack-style saves (you quit immediately afterward, and can only restore once)2. online co-op multiplayer3. a streamlined UI for switching between go-to items (do the recently implemented Hotkeys achieve this??)

												Welcome to Legend of Dungeon. This is the 8bit game that is completely random and that was made possible by gamers thanks to Kickstarter.Legend of Dungeon is a 1 to 4 player local co-op game where you can invite your friends over just like how it used to be during the retro gaming age. With this being said, controllers are supported so everyone can play. I love this idea but in a world of online gaming I would have loved to play this game with friends that do not live nearby. Also each time you play, you have to configure your controller setup. This could be fixed once the game is launched and I hope it will be. It is a slight oversight however. Legend of Dungeon was made to be played with controllers and not the keyboard but you can play with either or.Like any classic RPG game, you start off in the tavern. From there you make your way down different levels of dungeons. Each time you start a new game the layout of the dungeons are different. The same goes for the weapons and items that you pick up, the music and the monsters that you will face. When they say this game is random, it really is. This keeps this not-so-simple dungeon crawler game fresh. Once I started to play this game solo, I didn’t want to stop. There’s a leaderboard that brings the motivation to get the highest score possible. Not only that, the challenge truly comes from how deep can you get into the dungeon before you die. When playing solo once you get killed, that is it, game over and you start from the first level. When playing with more than one player death doesn’t apply, not really. When a member of your party dies they turn into a ghost. The rest of the party members must kill monsters in order for them to drop orbs that the ghost needs to return to the living. If the entire party turns into ghosts, the quest is over.You’ll walk into rooms with traps, pressure plates and various other traps that will try to stop you from reaching the last level. Make sure before you leave the tavern that you take some very important items with you like apples for health and a lantern. Some levels are completely dark and you don’t want to be walking blind right into a lava pit or into the axe of a monster, do you?If you like retro RPG gaming, this game is for you. For those who enjoy arcade beat’em-ups like TMNT, you will enjoy this game as well. For ten dollars, Legend of Dungeon is a good buy. Check it out on Steam! It is a game that you need to take some time aside since you cannot save your progress as you try to reach the bottom levels. Legend of Dungeon is a innovated game thanks to having everything randomize to keep you guessing.			"

												When I first bought this game, I thought it was pretty, but I couldn't see how anyone would ever beat the game.  That changed when they introduced unlockable classes!Look, this is a brutal roguelike.  There will be runs where nothing goes your way.  And there will be runs where you find a really powerful weapon lying on the ground.  Keep with it, and eventually you'll find the knight and bring her back to the inn to unlock her as a class option.  This will change the entire game!  There are several classes to unlock, each with their own advantages.I really like this game.  It's hard...but beautiful and fun!			"

You will die, you will get a little lost, and you'll definitely lose control of your character from time to time. If you frequently get a group of friends together to play old arcades purely for the expirence of being in the same room, this game is one to add to your rotation.			"

												Just stay away from this game until the devs decide to fix the one thing that made this game worth purchasing. There used to be a way for people to watch others play and drop and spawn things that'd hinder and/or help the player, but for months now there's been no word from development other than ""It's on our to-do list"". The only thing they've seemed to be working on is VR.TL;DRWait until the Streaming aspect is fixed before getting this if you really feel the need to buy it.ProsIt's a fun little co-op game for the first few minutes then you realize it's stupidly empty, without the stream interference, and the randomized map is more of an annoyance than anything.It has the feel of Castle Crashers meets TMNT for NES.ConsStupidly empty.There doesn't seem to be any way to heal unless you get super lucky with item drops.First 4 floors really determine how long you'll survive.There is very little information about controls, or even instructions on how to play.Enemies start out week and almost immediately become super strong and have abilities that change the game from a 'learn as you go' game to a 'read everything possible about everything because meta huehuehue' game.

												Usually I’m all for indie games. But after some time with it,  Legend of Dungeon leaves me feeling like the developers weren’t all that interested in their own game, or they ran out of their Kickstarter funding too fast. It’s decent, for what it is: a randomized dungeon romp for up to four players on the same PC, with nice real-time lighting and interesting weapons/magic. The music is well done, over 200 tracks that dynamically blend together based on what’s going on. The pixel art pops out nicely due to the depth-mapping system they’ve got going, and each type of monster/boss requires slightly different strategies.But there’s no saving (coming soon says the developer), and if you’re playing alone it’s a little boring. The weirdness of the weapons/items can lead to screen-filling insanity. If you find a sword that summons skeletons each time you hit something, pretty soon you can barely find yourself in the mess. With four players, each with such weaponry, it can lead to issues. There’s only one goal in Legend of Dungeon: go down, get the treasure, come back. No persistence whatsoever, which isn’t really a negative, but it leaves the game very light on content. It feels unfinished, like a beta. It’s also unclear if the developers are going to continue supporting it.			"

												Played for 30m in Vive VR mode, and found it frustrating.Attacking moves the player forward slightly, which is constantly. It's also exceedingly annoying to line up enemies on the correct y-axis, resulting in constant frustration.The ""How to Play"" is a single screen that doesn't actually explain much of anything, so the player is left to parse what's possible and what stats are/mean for themselves. I'm a huge fan of roguelikes that don't explain themselves much, but this is failing to explain basic gameplay - it's frustrating, not a fun avenue of exploration.			"

												A true real time Rogue-style game, with amazing pixel art graphics and some amazingly hilarious items and monsters.Unlike a lot of games that we call Rogue-likes... LoD is the real deal. 100% random level maps, random traps, random puzzles random hidden items, random potions, random equipment, random shops with random items. Respawning critters. Only real difference is that LoD is realtime, and not turn based.You might want to check out a screenshot or two before picking the game up, if you like pixel art style graphics than your in for a huge treat, I personally think its one of the best looking games I've seen in a long time. The graphics are sharp and well defined and its actually 3D to great effect, light and shadow and particle effects... it really is art. The music is equally good while you hack and slash and cast crazy summoning spells to fight the hordes in the dungeon.Unfortunatly there really is no story at all, other than your imagination, but its hard to fault the game as a storyline would probably just get in the way of your exploring and dying and exploring some more.In the end yes, its another in a long line of recent Rogue-like or Rogue-style games. but this one has a stunningly unique art and music and item/monster-comedy (you'll just have to see for yourself) that easily makes it stand out from and above the rest.

												terrible terribel terrible, game is ugly (check my screenshots and library, i have alot of  retro games and lvoe them with hours of gameplay), its hard to see where im attacking and you only attack straight forward, health is much needed in game, weapons are weird and each has its own range of hitting which would be nice except switchign weapons is so weird becuase you ahve to go one by one through EVEYRHITNG youve collected, some of the items you pass by arent even usable, enemies are hard to avoid unless you stun lock them one by one. in one playthrough i wnet up against necromancers and i was jsut wathcign them before even entering the room becuase they looked powerufl adn was wondeirng if i should enter or not and even if id have a chance (i was at half health) when both of them raised an army of skeletons, a big army for each i swear there was 20-25 enemies in that room in less than 10 seconds and they all huddled around the door wating for me to get out and heres another funny part, you have to step out of the door in order to use it again.  i was killed instantly and i stopped playing, that was MONTHS AGO. this game is an insult to everything indie and the devs dont understand game design.

												This is beautiful and has promise but without online multiplayer doesn't really live up to potential. That said, soundtrack is great and the game has a cute sense of humor. But at this point, I'd recommend waiting for LoD2.			"

												I enjoy Legend of Dungeon. The gameplay is challenging, each playthrough is unique, and getting deep in the dungeon feels like an accompishment. The best fun is when you get an overpowered item and tear through everything. Occulus rift compatability is a neat bonus.There are two areas that need improvement. Inventory management and VR stutter.  The inventory is difficult to use and requires tedious scrolling. The oculus rift has a bit of nausiating stutter in this game that isn't in more demanding FPS. The stutter wouldn't be so bad if it was a fixed orientation, but this game has the camera scroll alongside the player.Even with the two minor flaws, this game still shines!			"

												+ beautiful gameplay+ tight controls+ brutal+ randomly generated maps+ plenty of monsters to kill+ lovely soundtrack+ unique art style+ amazing lighting effects- save games sometimes disappear for no reason- no story on the surface of things- items lack discription of function- randomly chosen effects for colors of potion each round can be frustrating but adds to the fun of discovery and gambling with what you unlocked so farOverall, If you are into a rogue like dungeon crawler, this is so much fun.It has a beautiful art style, lovely graphic engine that accomidates a variety of screen resolutions.Crisp gameplay which rewards witty combat. The weapons are unique and varied for the genre.Well Done Robotlovekitty, this is a gem of a game.Highly recommended.			"

												First impressions, thus bound to change. However, I absolutely love this game! It's design is surprisingly good for it being procedural, the visuals and audio are nice to look at, and the only problem I have is with the UI which isn't that good for accessing items midcombat, if the developers only set the timescale to 0 and paused the audiolistener whenever the player accessed the UI the game would be a lot more enjoyable, but that's more of a picky personal opinion thing.

												I really want to love this game. It looks absolutely fantastic, the graphical style and effects are brilliant. But it isn't a great game. Firstly it is not gamepad friendly. Configuring controls is an exercise in frustration and virtually requires the keyboard. The music is OK but gets annoying very quickly and while the 2 1/d are some interesting gameplay flavour, it's just not really that fun. And there just doesnt feel like much co-op in the co-op. The level design is repetitive and bland and personally it just doesn't  live up to its potential. If only Bit Dungeon had a local co-op mode ...			"

												Well I can't claim any lategame win on this one. Maybe I havent tried hard enough to get all the pretty classes & stuff. They are presented as the way to have your character a specific, simple skill - otherwise the default class won't have any.You got some spell books which cast random spells, invoke creatures to your side, or some projectiles. Special invokes aside, I didn't really find a use for most of them books. Lots of colored & unknown potions, Rogue style (cool/bad effect, set for that color). Apart from healing potion, wellArmor hatz, and weponz :l And that's it. Don't let you fool by the pretty lights & shines, after a few hours the depth movement of this... casual crawler is really annoying, it seems hard to position oneself precisely. Maps do not have a lot of space anyway, hot battles hit-run or hit-hit, care for masses, cool pixels, too long levels, oh god this dungeon is really that long ? Oh wait great we are on floor 10, we can save the Knight ! 1st char yay °>_<° maybe he's gonna help me out plz. Okay, must get back at floor 1 actually ? With respawns obviously...fair enough.Back at Tavern : Hello, I'm the locked-unlocked Knight who does nothing as a start bonus :vwell ok, dis game is better in multi, care for lava though plz. spare the heal. :l rly? Okay cast some♥♥♥♥♥♥back asid- fffuuu bro u messed up sh*t - gonna find some revival stone or some sh*t - what can you do as a ghost ? nothg k -No really, it's just some pretty shiny casual dungeon crawler with heavy difficulty (in a too simplistic and looong way)from wat was this hype from plzSome fun can be extracted from this material but careful, rather shallow hence brittle.

												Might of been fun if it had online multiplayer but it gets old fast solo. I'm actually not even sure why I don't like it either. I went into it excited but by the time I died on my first run I just felt nothing. No rage, no frustration, but also no desire to try one more run. Just kinda indifferent. (I only actually played it for about a hour, the rest of my playtime is leaving it running for the trading cards.)Unfortunately I bought 2 keys on chrono.gg because I remembered online multiplayer being mentioned a video and am now stuck with an extra key I don't have a use for and can't refund.

It is also a shame that such good music be wasted on something like this. The most baffling thing is that when I die it shows a top 1000 online leaderboard. It is baffling because I am surprised that even a thousand people play this garbage. On second thought no I am not. You can easily see how most gamers taste in games sucks when the most bought games on steam are DayZ and Rust. Oh and this is the kind of game where it's one life then game over.

												This game is quite easily one of the best games I've played in the under 10$ section. It is very fun and is never the same. The game gets more difficult as you go on at a good pace, so you wont be running into any bosses on floor one. The game has a great layout and a variety of powerup hats, potions, monsters, and weapons. Just a really great game. I was even able to sit through 8 hours of it on a train with no WiFi. Get it. Now.[EDIT] Guys, Don't pay attention to the reviews that only have logged less than 4 hours in this game. The game, being worthwhile, isn't something you toss to the side in an hour or so. These people don't understand half the game with their measley half hour. I can't say much with my 10 but GET THE GAME ITS WORTH YER MUNNEY.			"

												After watching a Twitch stream the day this was released on Steam and talking to 1 of the devs in the stream I grabbed this. It takes the old school RPG and makes it look and feel new. A very challenging game that keeps you coming back because we all wants to see that 26th level. But even after (if) you get there you still have to make it back out. When I 1st logged in I accidentally set myself on fire and then set everyone else on fire before I even got to start my adventure. I knew I was going to have a good time. Really wish the Co-op was online instead of just local but other than that it's a great game. Any RPG fan should play it.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a nice art project, but not much else. The art, lighting and music are all very well done, but the gameplay is boring and repeditive.The dynamically generated rooms are frequently generated in ways that don't make much sense, for example a flame trap stuck against a dead end. You can tell that the rooms are just stiched together from pre-specified sections, and there's not a whole lot of sections to choose from.Combat is kinda boring; just go up to a dude and swing your axe at them. Inventory management is a pain and confusing; the inventory only displays 3 items at a time, and stats for items are displayed without any labels, making comparison a huge pain.I think the worst blow however is lack of online multiplayer. It shouldn't be too hard to implement as the game is relatively simple, and it would add a lot of emergent gameplay between players. Unfortunately, the game is local multiplayer only, which, in my case, is basically equivalent to single player, and from the web site there doesn't seem to be any plans of implementing it.It's nice to watch for the relaxing music and visuals, but I wouldn't call it a game.

												This is one of those games to waste an hour or two or three...Great randomness which would get old if not done so well. For example, the potions are colored so once you find that the red potion makes you puke skittles then you know to avoid it. But if you start a fresh game or die, the red potions may make you faster. I personally think everyone should throw a couple time-wasters in their game library and this is a good'in. Done.			"

												So far I have gotten to level 10 in this game and the challenges have not been that bad.  That all being said, this game plays a lot better with friends (think Magicka in this regard) and is a good game if you are looking for a dungeon crawl.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it is local co-op as opposed to across online since you then need to plug in controllers for your computer which is not easy for the casual player.  Overall I would give it a 5/10 since the single player scratches the dungeon crawl itch but unless you are playing with friends it is not that much more.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a game with a simple goal that is extremely difficult to achieve. It sounds simple: get to the bottom of the dungeon, find the treasure, and bring it back... Just don't die. However, this ""don't die"" part of the game is astoundingly difficult! This is a roguelike game that takes its genre very seriously - you WILL die. A lot. Yet, this difficulty doesn't provide a soul-crushing desire to uninstall the game and then break your computer into a million tiny pieces. Instead, the games charming visuals, soothing music, and enjoyable gameplay just lure you into another round of dungeon-crawling, brawler-style goodness. Legend of Dungeon is not a game without flaws - the inventory management system definitely needs an overhaul. It can be frustratingly difficult to cycle through all of your items just to re-equip your sword or magic spell tome, or whatever it is you want to use. However, I continue to be drawn back to the enchanting gameplay to face the challenge time and time again in what I consider a fantastically well-done indie title.P.S. There are hats. Who doesn't love hats?			"

												Early on in Legend of Dungeon there is a sharp learning curve. The game is a randomized loot-fest that takes you deep into a monster-infested dungeon. Controls are rudimentary and unintuitive. Content is still being added and tweaked. Narrative is completely absent. However, the stylized graphics and dynamic music are excellent and enticing.The main purpose of the game, which is never actually clearly stated, is to delve down twenty-six levels, find a great treasure, and bring it back to the surface. Along the way, you'll find random hats that give you power, defense, and speed... or take it away. There is a huge collection of weapons--some very simple, like a battle axe, and some complex, like a spell tome for summoning monsters. Potions litter the stones, and their effects are randomly determined each time you go in (so try to find that full life potion early).Each level is not very different from the levels above it, sadly, so after a couple of attempts you'll probably be ready for a break. On some runs you may not even find a new weapon, literally taking away a third of the excitement the game offers. The goal of attaining points (via gold) is dull, and complicated by the fact that you can spend your points and earn next to nothing, then die and look like you had a poor score the whole time.Despite these limits, the game is still fun just for the sake of adventuring into the unknown and discovering new hats and weapons, strange and powerful enemies, and painful new ways to die. The developers are still adding new content, and Legend of Dungeon shows a lot of promise in what it can be in its final form. Right now, co-op is local only, but one can dream of a day when online multi-player and some form of narrative help round out this game, even as more enemies and items are added in.This game is not for everyone, and it is far from complete, but it was still a good buy for me and I can recommend it to anyone who is understanding of the description I've outlined above.

												Hard to recommend. Whiile the game has some personality, it is an extremely lacking dungeon crawler. There is no way to save, no classes to pick, and the game has zero story. In this ""game,"" you wander around corridors killing stuff and trying to find your way to the next floor. The levels are set up like a hellish maze, and may make you want to quit in frustration.I feel like I wasted a dollar and a half hour of my time.			"

												When I first saw Legend of Dungeon on Joystiq's website, I immediately fell in love. The art style won me over and I waited impatiently for its release. It's been out now for a few months, and I love this game. Sure, I can't save, and there is no online multiplayer, but handing my girlfriend a controller and trying to get as far as we can is really enjoyable. The best part is this game isn't even done yet! Features are still being added!			"

												Even though this game lacks online co-op play (which would make it great) the actual gameplay and mechanics are fine. I've run it throu at least a half-dozen times, sometimes you'll find an epic weapon, others you'll have a plethora of missle spells and summons. I ran once with a two-goblin summon and two three-skeleton summons (for a total of 8 summons at once). Granted the game is not very diverse, but it's not meant to be forgiving. I got my copy on sale for $1.49, and to ask the $3-4 now, is stll reasonable. Fun game, for being exactly what it is.			"

												I think legend of dungeon is a great game, it's like an addictive atari game that you keep playing. Getting loot and moving to the next level is always cool and the sound effects are addictive too. Alot of the sounds I have heard from other games I have played from the past. I can only thank the creators of this game because I did play it several times, but like most of the world ...I work for a living and I don't have time for a game that will Not let you save your current position. I think the developers need to get off there butt and add this because as of today I have uninstalled it from my computer. Even my son who loves the game says that it should have an option to save where you are at. I know the people who made this game put alot of themselfs into it, but I don't have time to keep starting over and I bet they don't either. Im asking that the programmers add this feature because for now it's not on my playlist and I know that alot of gamers are doing the same thing. How hard is it to add a save feature?? Someone will have to email me if they ever add it because this game is uninstalled on my computer and in the game graveyard....enough said!			"

												Fun little game.  It feels like a different way to do Dungeons of Dredmore - another terrific game.  You start at what I would assume is ground level, and work your way ""down"".  Opening secret areas trying to obtain ""gold"" or pixels.  You consume bottles of colored liquid that may give you a perk or make you throw up fireworks.  There are a few item pickups here and there and the world is somewhat ""random"" but after playing for a few hours you will figure out it isn't all that random.  A lot of areas are recreated and the secrets are easy to figure out.  Hats are in the game, but act as armour.  Only a few though.....I know this game was kickstarted, but it is missing A LOT of what was promised.  It is ""Greenlit"" but it does not say that it is early access....so the missing content is pretty frustrating.There isn't much to the game - so hopefully updates will come fast and furious, but it doesn't look like that is the case.  Classes are limited to none, there are maybe 10 weapons, and 10 hats.  Not a big deal, but the game is full price and not early access.  So it appears they have shipped a very incomplete game....had it not been in the Steam sale I would have skipped it.  Hopefully with the increased revenue from the sale they will work on the game.

												I read some of the reviews of this game, and I'm surprised to find myself agreeing with most of them.The main problem of this game is the same one that Wanderlust: Rebirth had, it's more fun with friends then without. This is mainly due to the fact that it's combat is very wonky and knockback acts very odd. I was able to get through the first 5 floors using a giant sword which helped me a lot because of it's range but after that... I just lost interest.It's not a bad game, it's just not a great game.6/10			"

The gameplay is not groundbreaking, but it works and it feels great. Multiplayer is utter chaos and is hilarious.Don't get decieved by its simplicity. The later levels are insanely unfair and challenging.The randomness of the game is very well-done and makes discovering new items and rooms a blast.If there ever was an arcade version of a Rogue-like, this would be it.Get this... seriously.

												Bought this game about 6 months ago and gave it a try. It was ok. I would much prefer it had a story and more of a sense that I'm getting something done. Then just found out today that they did an update to implement this for the Oculus Rift. Threw on my DK2 and fired this up. WOW. Really, really cool. One of the better Rift experiences I've had. 2D sidescroller games like this built with 3D backgrounds work really well on the rift. There aren't many games for the rift out that aren't First Person. Really nice change to see something like this. BlazeRush is also another non-first person game that has VR support, and that has been one of my favorite games this year. This game is fun on a computer monitor, but you really get immersed when you use the Rift.			"

												I like the game and its art, but until the stretch gaols that were listed on the kickstarter are met, Im wary of reccomending the game to anyone. Lack of online play also made me really sad as this looks like the perfect type of game for it (And I expected it wen I was looking at the video, but I cant even do LAN with another computer :( )A year later and goals promised havnt really updated much. The thing that really killed this for me was Local Co-Op. If it was LAN based I could have accepted it, but instead, its Controllers or multiple people on one keyboard. As a Steam game, I find this greatly dissapointing. I bought it hoping to have another goofy and fun multiplayer game, but I got a mediocre effort at best.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a side-scrolling rogue-like beat-em-up. Start at a tavern, go into a randomly generated dungeon, find the treasure on the 26th floor, and then make the trek back up through even harder enemies. It's definitely difficult, and the only two things I dislike about it is the generic title and the rare event that you have a difficult time finding the stairs. Four player co-op is supported, but only locally. The combat is dull in the beginning, but once you start getting into guns and spells it gets hectic and exciting.			"

												Fun roguelike.Great pixel art aesthetic with gorgeous lighting effects and memorable and easily recognisable monsters. The game would benefit from better-balance in item drops (90% of items are useless/less powerful than what you find in the first couple of levels). Also, the controller support could be better -  the game failed to recognize the triggers on my shield controller. Also, mapping controls is tedious (one button at a time).Still, the game has great session length and is addictive and challenging. Recommended.UPDATE: Found the laser cat. Mew mew!			"

												Legend of Dungeon is an Indie-roguelike-Dungeon runner. You start with your character at the  dungeon entrance and make your way far down into the lower levels... or will you? Only equipped with a sword, some apples a lantern and your courage you dare to enter the dungeon, just for the sake of retrieving the gold that (legend has it) can somewhere be found at the lowest floor. But beware, many have also warned you of the dangers lurking on the lower levels of the burried fortress...You have to make your way through each random generate level filled with various types of monsters. The further you proceed down, the harder the monsters get. You got a basic interface showing your attack power, speed, experience points, defense level and your gold. The overall aim is to collect as much gold as possible on your journey, which will in most cases end up in your death fighting a horde of skeletons or worse. For your assistance you can collect items you can find lying on the dungeon floor (... maybe remains of previous unlucky adventurers...) or retrieve them from killed enemies. But beware... not all items you collect will grant you assistance... if you're unlucky you end up finding a potion draining your strenght or even worse... a cursed book... summoning in the devil himself if you read out the occult lines...Of course you can also start your journey with up to four friends... however you have to invite them to your place, as online coop isn't supported. Furthermore the game is more luck, than skillbased, as you rely on the dropped items to be able to continue your journey. Nevertheless the game kept me motivated to sink several hours into it.			"

												It's a great game, similar to ""Rogue Legacy"", There is no upgrades or anything, but you can find better loot through out the dungeon! One time I got a fire sword and an overpowered scythe. Each dungeon is randomly generated so there is some luck in this game. Overall fun and cool, but I believe its overpriced for what the game actually is. (Should be at most $7)			"

												Legend of Dungeon is an Indie-roguelike-Dungeon runner. You start with your character at the  dungeon entrance and make your way far down into the lower levels... or will you? Only equipped with a sword, some apples a lantern and your courage you dare to enter the dungeon, just for the sake of retrieving the gold that (legend has it) can somewhere be found at the lowest floor. But beware, many have also warned you of the dangers lurking on the lower levels of the burried fortress...You have to make your way through each random generate level filled with various types of monsters. The further you proceed down, the harder the monsters get. You got a basic interface showing your attack power, speed, experience points, defense level and your gold. The overall aim is to collect as much gold as possible on your journey, which will in most cases end up in your death fighting a horde of skeletons or worse. For your assistance you can collect items you can find lying on the dungeon floor (... maybe remains of previous unlucky adventurers...) or retrieve them from killed enemies. But beware... not all items you collect will grant you assistance... if you're unlucky you end up finding a potion draining your strenght or even worse... a cursed book... summoning in the devil himself if you read out the occult lines...Of course you can also start your journey with up to four friends... however you have to invite them to your place, as online coop isn't supported. Furthermore the game is more luck, than skillbased, as you rely on the dropped items to be able to continue your journey. Nevertheless the game kept me motivated to sink several hours into it.			"

												So far I have gotten to level 10 in this game and the challenges have not been that bad.  That all being said, this game plays a lot better with friends (think Magicka in this regard) and is a good game if you are looking for a dungeon crawl.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it is local co-op as opposed to across online since you then need to plug in controllers for your computer which is not easy for the casual player.  Overall I would give it a 5/10 since the single player scratches the dungeon crawl itch but unless you are playing with friends it is not that much more.			"

												I purchased this game during the Steam Winter Sale, and even though I only have a little bit of time into this game, I wanted to post a review to inform others about it.Pros:*Randomized fun.  I love random stuff.  Random levels, random items, random randomness.  This game is extremely random, and it makes for a ton of playability.  I've yet to play through a life and go ""oh, this again, ugh"".  It's fresh each time.*Intuitive play.  There aren't a lot of keys, and most things really play in a way that makes sense.*Hats! As an avid Team Fortress 2 fan, there's hats, and where there's hats, I'm in.*Cats! There's cats in this game too, and some of them can be worn as hats.  No cats in hats though.  I think that's coming in a later patch.Cons:*Key binding is odd.  The default key bindings were a little weird, and I ended up changing them right away.  Changing them was also odd, and I accidentally rebinded some keys I didn't mean to right out of the gate.  It was easy enough to fix, but it needs work.*Item woes.  The inventory consists of a few previews in the bottom right.  The item you are on, and one to the left or right.  You slide items left and right (like a carousel) to pick the one you want to use.  This mechanic is kind of clunky to use.  My first few play throughs I ended up with tons of hats, and trying to cycle back to my weapon was a huge pain.  I started dropping hats I wasn't going to wear, but comparing the one I have one to the one I'm looking out isn't easy either.  I wish the inventory was a bit easier to use and had some comparison abilities in it.*No multiplayer.  There's same system multiplayer (though key bindings or a controller), but internet/LAN multiplayer doesn't exist, which is a real shame because this game is perfect for it.Summary:The cons in this game are fairly minor and don't detract from the game significantly.  Overall, this game is a great dungeon crawler, and I'm sure it will provide hours of enjoyment, especially when the price point is so inexpensive right now.			"

												“It's challenging to play, pretty to watch and heaps of fun...” - Joystiq“Legend of Dungeon looks scrumptious” - Rock, Paper, Shotgun“If nothing else, Legend of Dungeon is a master class in how to make the tried and true feel fresh again.” - GamezeboI would like to know what ""Legend of Dungeon"" they played because the one I played sure did not ""feel fresh"" or ""challenging to play,"" and it sure as heck is not ""heaps of fun"". Other than the bar you start in, every room looks almost the same. The enemies and combat are very generic and gets old very quick. The only character customization is you can choose if you are male or female. Oh, and you can put on a hat. The only redeeming quality I can think of is that it does ""look scrumptious,"" but the only thing graphics do is make the game look pretty, it doesn't help one bit in the fun department.As you can see from my history, this is my first review. I normally don't write reviews, but the boringness of this game compelled me to write one in hopes that others will read it and not make the same mistake I did.

It's a simple arcade stlye rougelite game meant to be picked up and played on a whim when you have nothing else to do.Maybe not worth $9.99, but getting it for around a couple bucks on sale, it's worth a look if you're one to enjoy simplistic straightforward dungeon crawling.

												There aren't many games that I'll play simply to hear the variations on the dynamic music. The game itself is a ton of fun to play  -- you can get a better description of the gameplay elsewhere. But for me, the style and composition of the music is what makes this game stand out. Just awesome.			"

												Love this game like robot loves kitty. It's a good implementation of a graphical rouge like game with pretty graphics and nice sound track. The dungeon is randomly generated however there are fairly repetitive layouts, the game could use with more verity. The game is challenging enough to be very repayable and the online score board gives it a nice competitive aspect.Also the name 'Robot loves kitty' is so awesome it makes me jealous I didn't think of it.

												When I first saw Legend of Dungeon on Joystiq's website, I immediately fell in love. The art style won me over and I waited impatiently for its release. It's been out now for a few months, and I love this game. Sure, I can't save, and there is no online multiplayer, but handing my girlfriend a controller and trying to get as far as we can is really enjoyable. The best part is this game isn't even done yet! Features are still being added!			"

												Even though this game lacks online co-op play (which would make it great) the actual gameplay and mechanics are fine. I've run it throu at least a half-dozen times, sometimes you'll find an epic weapon, others you'll have a plethora of missle spells and summons. I ran once with a two-goblin summon and two three-skeleton summons (for a total of 8 summons at once). Granted the game is not very diverse, but it's not meant to be forgiving. I got my copy on sale for $1.49, and to ask the $3-4 now, is stll reasonable. Fun game, for being exactly what it is.			"

												This is an amazing game, granted I expected it to be a little bit more fast paced. At first you are kinda thrown into a dungeon with no knowlage of the game. But as most people soon find out moving is the arrow keys and attacking is x. There are some mechanics that are a little fuzzy, such as cycling through your inventory with a and d, it gets a little confusing. If you like randomized dungeons, rpgs, and rouge-like games it would be a perfect buy. Although your inventory is confusing and the overall game is slower than i expected, i grew to like it. 7.5/10			"

I really enjoyed it! The dynamic lighting throughout the dungeons is very well done, and the graphics are quite appealing too! There is plenty of pop culture refrences in the game, some of which gave me a chuckle here and there however the only downside to this title is that you can only play local multiplayer, as online isn't supported.

												Legend of Dungeon is a nice looking game. It combines pixel art with advanced lightening in a very effective way. The aesthetic appeal is pretty high but as you might have read already, this is the only aspect where this game excells at.Gameplay is pretty boring after several tries, there isn't any variety to it at all. RPG elements are basic and you can't customize your character, it's all done automatically. Weapons and armor all feel more or less the same because there are basically only two attack types without any depth whatsoever. You can hit enemies and charge up an attack and that is all you have. Furthermore the hit detection can feel quite wonky and sometimes you get without knowing why.The nature of the game is random, so you always get a new dungeon with different items. But each playthrough doesn't feel distinctive enough. Basically you have the same boring dungeons and you see the same loot over again. Potions have unique effects but overall there isn't much depth here.I don't recommend this game, not even as a timewaster. It's shallow and doesn't offer anything good.			"

												I am a big fan of roguelikes. Something about a quick pickup and play game with infinite replay-ability really interests me. Especially with the short spurts of time that I have as a Father in between family and work responsibilities. Legend of Dungeon by developer Robot Loves Kitty scratches that itch just enough in possibly the shortest amount of time that I can imagine. I harkens back to a time where playing a game meant sitting down for 20 minutes or less and being able to walk away refreshed and fulfilled. No massive story lines, or extensive in depth gameplay. Sometimes all you need is some mindless and entertaining particles in front of you to pass a bit of time and cleanse the palette.Legend of Dungeon is a sorbet in between courses. Just when you finish your first session of gaming and you need to wipe the need to continue away; Legend of Dungeon allows you a transition that is just fun and fast enough to entertain but not establish a baseline genre.To be honest it is a side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like construction, but it could easily be much more. It has some very light RPG elements and some other thematic enemies and a dark setting that could make for some very interesting story; but the game itself doesn't bank on any of these as strong attractors for itself. Not it's much more simple than that.In essence the game relies on a single button combat system and a series of hats and randomly generated consumables to entertain. Every run has it's own quirks, like coming across a space-traveler in a phone booth. Or wearing a cat on your head while attacking angels. There are nods to popular media and internet culture all over the game. Most of the items and enemies are seemingly derived from nerd culture actually. This faceless derivation however serves the larger purpose of the game. This is refreshing as often features no longer serve the purpose of the game and instead act as a standalone neon sign saying ""LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO!"".I may be allowing it to survive a critical eye but I believe that in short bursts Legend of Dungeon  has it's own merits. It isn't a great game, but it isn't a bad game either. It reminds me of a modern day iteration of an endless slalom flash game when you have nothing to do to kill time. Unfortunately I don't have time to kill as most of my time is more valuable when I have to split it between so many responsibilities. Still though, it is a simpler game that reminded me of a simpler time in my youth. And I can appreciate that.You'll like this game if: You just need a nameless, faceless, game to entertain you for a few empty minutes. That might not sound appealing but everyone needs some mindless entertainment now and again!From my blog at: bigdadgamer.blogspot.com "

												One of the best co-op games I own. I've played over 100 hours side-by-side with friends at times I couldn't afford my internet bill (meaning no game tracking ), and before it was even released on steam. Best used with a gamepad (I use logitech F310's)Unique weapons and items get you thinking, ""what else can I find?"". Interesting and surprising enemies are around every corner and behind every door.  Monsters, items, the dungeon itself, along with the potion color and effects are all random. We played this game so much that a stack of sticky notes with potion names were filling up the empty space on my desk and started collecting on the floor beneath( you never know what a potion does until you try it ! ) They are always releasing plenty of updates ( which you can actually watch them develop on twitch) - and I believe classes and pets should be coming soon.If you have ever played Brogue, Pixel Dungeon, or are a roguelike - hardcore game fanatic like I am, you'll love it.

												You can play a randomly generated dungeon by default, or you can play one that remains the same for one day. The items you can acquire may have both benefits and hiderances, allowing you to determine whther or not the benefit is worth it. Favor melee or spells, or switch between.The effect of different colors of postions changes with every game as well. Better get a notepad!The dungeon design is pleasantly deceptive in that while it displays as a sort of retro game, playing reveals that some really great work has been put into lighting effects from a variety of types of light source-- candles, lamps, plasma balls, uni or omnidirectional in nature.  The chracter design is charming in a way that suits the 8-bit stlye.Since its original release, LoD has had additional releases and support. The music is terrific.			"

												This game is so damn cool with the Oculus Rift DK2... it's a must-buy if you've got one. When most people think of virtual reality gaming, they generally think of first-person games (typically simulators or shooters) where you 'become' the player within the game. ""2.5d"" side-scrolling action RPGs probably don't come to mind very often, but hopefully, this game will change that. Playing it is an absolute pleasure; it's almost as if you're looking down at and controlling your character in a living, breathing game of Hero's Quest (that old board game from the early 90) on crazy steriods. Even without the Rift, I'm sure you'd enjoy it and that you'd end up getting a lot of replay value out of (if you like rougue-likes).... but there's no way that I'd play it without the rift now.Oh, and I know that Steam says that I've only played 11 minutes or so, but you currently have to launch it outside of Steam to make it work with the Rift, so the time I've spent in the game (several hours now) doesn't show up in Steam.

Unlike most traditional rougue-likes and rogue-lites you won't constantly feel like you're struggling to survive. If you're lucky, you may even find some good items early on and feel like nothing could possibly kill you. Then something does, all at once and without warning. Maybe you found yourself trapped in a dead end with a wraith hot on your♥♥♥♥♥and only 50 HP left, or maybe you got overconfident and fell into lava while trying to jump to a potion which was likely a debuff anyway. Maybe you just forgot (or were unable) to heal after fighting that minotaur and got bitten by a snake in an otherwise empty room. Point is, you'll die when you least expect it.If you enjoy deadly randomized dungeons and beat-'em-ups with light RPG elements, and you can resist the urge to murder defenseless kittens in a video game then this is the game for you.Seriously, though, don't don't kill the kittens you psycho. Bad things will happen.			"

												This is one of those games to waste an hour or two or three...Great randomness which would get old if not done so well. For example, the potions are colored so once you find that the red potion makes you puke skittles then you know to avoid it. But if you start a fresh game or die, the red potions may make you faster. I personally think everyone should throw a couple time-wasters in their game library and this is a good'in. Done.			"

												Everything about this game is simple, which is perfect. It's a great hangout game. The controls are few but equally accommodating to keyboard or gamepad. You could easily catch uip with friends while running a campaign without too much difficulty. It's visually attractive without being overly flashy and the ingame props (hats, weapons and potions) could lead to some interesting dialog. It still requires some game competence though. I tried playing with my wife but it was a no go.EDIT 2014Still loving this game. Play every so often. Anyone try double handing it by partnering with yourself? I'm lonely lol.			"

												The lack of in-game explanation and instructions left an initial, lacking feel to the game.  But once you get the swing of things the game opens up to a very fun multiplayer experience.  You can play up to four players, and that is not limited to online friends or four buds huddled around the same monitor.  The game seems to be made with emphasis of using a controller, so heads up.  Overall it's worth trying out at the not-too-over-top ten dollar price tag.			"

 Overall Review A friend reccomended this game to me and at first I really didn't know what to expect. I ended up playing a good few hours with him sharing a keyboard between us and well.. I really enjoyed it! The dynamic lighting throughout the dungeons is very well done, and the graphics are quite appealing too! There is plenty of pop culture refrences in the game, some of which gave me a chuckle here and there however the only downside to this title is that you can only play local multiplayer, as online isn't supported. Overall; A brillient little indie game when having a couple of friends over!  Feature Rating (/100)   Gameplay 70   Graphics 80   Replayability 70   Story/Lore 60   Average 70/100  "

												Legend of Dungeon is a nice looking game. It combines pixel art with advanced lightening in a very effective way. The aesthetic appeal is pretty high but as you might have read already, this is the only aspect where this game excells at.Gameplay is pretty boring after several tries, there isn't any variety to it at all. RPG elements are basic and you can't customize your character, it's all done automatically. Weapons and armor all feel more or less the same because there are basically only two attack types without any depth whatsoever. You can hit enemies and charge up an attack and that is all you have. Furthermore the hit detection can feel quite wonky and sometimes you get without knowing why.The nature of the game is random, so you always get a new dungeon with different items. But each playthrough doesn't feel distinctive enough. Basically you have the same boring dungeons and you see the same loot over again. Potions have unique effects but overall there isn't much depth here.I don't recommend this game, not even as a timewaster. It's shallow and doesn't offer anything good.			"

												One of the best co-op games I own. I've played over 100 hours side-by-side with friends at times I couldn't afford my internet bill (meaning no game tracking ), and before it was even released on steam. Best used with a gamepad (I use logitech F310's)Unique weapons and items get you thinking, ""what else can I find?"". Interesting and surprising enemies are around every corner and behind every door.  Monsters, items, the dungeon itself, along with the potion color and effects are all random. We played this game so much that a stack of sticky notes with potion names were filling up the empty space on my desk and started collecting on the floor beneath( you never know what a potion does until you try it ! ) They are always releasing plenty of updates ( which you can actually watch them develop on twitch) - and I believe classes and pets should be coming soon.If you have ever played Brogue, Pixel Dungeon, or are a roguelike - hardcore game fanatic like I am, you'll love it.

And it does with its neat lighting. and it was fun with its roguelike style but personally did nothing that stood out to me. I picked it up a couple times but never again because i knew what would happen when i did. I would play for a little while then go through the beginning couple floors and be bored then get to the one difficult floor and get blown to bits by some wierd wizard guy. That or go to sleep and forget about it. The game has a nice graphics style but not much originality too offer for my taste in rogue likes. If your looking for a good rogue like try rogue legacy.

												THiss game has a randomization element that works against it. Its possible to go several floors without finding a single new weapon, but you will find stacks upon stacks of hats (some are admitedly very awesome). On my last play through I found a sword in the very first room that destroyed every enemy in one hit. I even killed one of the bosses with it after just a few swings. But then I couldn't beat the game because the random layout of the dungeon forgot to give it an exit to the 8th floor.In its current state I cannot reccoment this game, it desperately needs a patch tofix its balancing issues and dungeon layout.

												THE GOOD- Lots of play value. SInce the game is quite difficult and relies on some randomness it's highly unlikely anyone will be able to beat this on their first play through.- Nice variety of items and monsters- Great pacing. New monsters, items and random NPC events are revealed in such a way that keeps the game interesting.THE BAD- Some people would complain that there isn't much difference in the look of the dungeon as your progress other than lighting. All rooms feel fairly simmilar.- Currently there is no save feature... Which wouldn't be a problem other than a good run can last upwards of 4 hours. But apparently a save feature is something in the works though.- Only local co-op.CONCLUSION- Worth picking up. I certainly feel like I got my money's worth. "

												My hours do not reflect this, but I play this a lot with my son on his account. I used to have this on my wishlist but took it off after reading a lot of the reviews. This was foolish. This game is great. It has a great sense of humor and sense of style. The pixel art and the lighting are some of the best I've seen out of this genre. The enemies are exciting to encounter. The drops are absurd (in a good way) There are a ton of secrets to discover. With the flood of the perma-death, rogue-like dungeon games rushing through, This one is worth buying ***IF*** you have some to play with local co-op. If not it is nowhere near as fun solo. So if you have 1,2 or 3 people to run this, buy this game.			"

												Even though this game lacks online co-op play (which would make it great) the actual gameplay and mechanics are fine. I've run it throu at least a half-dozen times, sometimes you'll find an epic weapon, others you'll have a plethora of missle spells and summons. I ran once with a two-goblin summon and two three-skeleton summons (for a total of 8 summons at once). Granted the game is not very diverse, but it's not meant to be forgiving. I got my copy on sale for $1.49, and to ask the $3-4 now, is stll reasonable. Fun game, for being exactly what it is.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a wicked fun little title. LoD is a Rogue game, so you only get one life and no saves. The object is to attempt to get to the bottom of a 26-level dungeon. The game has randomly generated dungeons which appear 8-bit in nature. The lighting effects are next level though, so the game plays quite beautifully with a distinct nod to games of old. I really dug the style. Your character may wield a weapon, use items/potions, and wear different hats. Hats include things like a traditional plate and mail to pirate hats, turbans, light bulbs, and even cats.. yes, cats.The developers really like cats, btw. Don't throw them in the lava.The monsters in the game are humorous in their non-detailed 8-bit ways and range from bats and snakes, to skeletons, medusas, mummies, and leprechauns. There are many ways to die also. Many. It's quite fun to just see all the different ways. And the game encourages trying things out with no real direction. Pick up a potion? Might as well drink it. Oh, it turned me into goo. Nice. Have to remember that one on the next playthrough.Pick up LoD. It's fun. And cheap.			"

												Got my money's worth when me and two others played this for an afternoon.  We went in blind, not knowing a thing about the game.   It recognizes and uses xbox 360 controllers natively, but unintuitively requires you to setup the controls before playing (there is no 'default' configuration).It's a hack n slash dungeon game with up to 4 people at once.  You run around swinging your sword (or other weapons you might find) killing monsters, solving puzzles usually consisting of a series of switches you have to flip up or down to get stairs to appears or torches to light or (??? never did figure some of them out).You kill stuff and loot/exp drops.  Whoever picks up the loot or exp gets it so you can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to your friends or hate them or whatever, but it can get chaotic so it's hard to really work out a system to share the exp.  It's also got random/roguelike qualities to it so there can be a hard mob in the second room or you might find great weapons/items right away.  Best weapon we found that afternoon was a really large 2 handed hammer that shook the entire screen when swung, and did roughly 25x more damage than the other weapons we were using.   Then we all died when we lost our lantern somehow and had to go into a dark room.  We never did see what killed us.Haven't played it since then, but that one afternoon was already worth a couple bucks.  Not the best game, it was kinda rough to get used to playing, dying kinda sucked (your ghost could collect 'souls' from things your alive friends would kill to get back to life and rejoin them, no other ressurection feature), and it was a bit unfair sometimes when your friends would push your guy around (but also hilarious sometimes so it evened out).Recommended when it's cheap or when a game that plays sorta like Deadly Towers from the NES days, but not as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and co-op sounds fun!

												Early on in Legend of Dungeon there is a sharp learning curve. The game is a randomized loot-fest that takes you deep into a monster-infested dungeon. Controls are rudimentary and unintuitive. Content is still being added and tweaked. Narrative is completely absent. However, the stylized graphics and dynamic music are excellent and enticing.The main purpose of the game, which is never actually clearly stated, is to delve down twenty-six levels, find a great treasure, and bring it back to the surface. Along the way, you'll find random hats that give you power, defense, and speed... or take it away. There is a huge collection of weapons--some very simple, like a battle axe, and some complex, like a spell tome for summoning monsters. Potions litter the stones, and their effects are randomly determined each time you go in (so try to find that full life potion early).Each level is not very different from the levels above it, sadly, so after a couple of attempts you'll probably be ready for a break. On some runs you may not even find a new weapon, literally taking away a third of the excitement the game offers. The goal of attaining points (via gold) is dull, and complicated by the fact that you can spend your points and earn next to nothing, then die and look like you had a poor score the whole time.Despite these limits, the game is still fun just for the sake of adventuring into the unknown and discovering new hats and weapons, strange and powerful enemies, and painful new ways to die. The developers are still adding new content, and Legend of Dungeon shows a lot of promise in what it can be in its final form. Right now, co-op is local only, but one can dream of a day when online multi-player and some form of narrative help round out this game, even as more enemies and items are added in.This game is not for everyone, and it is far from complete, but it was still a good buy for me and I can recommend it to anyone who is understanding of the description I've outlined above.

												I cannot even begin to describe just how addicting this game is. The fact that everything is random makes for an amazing experience each time I play. I always find myself getting so hype over each new thing I come across. All of the new hats, weapons and enemies are so much fun to see. It's weird but I actually find myself enjoying dying in this game because of the description of the way you die or how some enemies kill you.Definite buy.Especially when I got this for only a buck. It was a steal.			"

												Feels like I am playing stone soup dungeon crawl. There are many fun items in this game however. The only problem I had with this game is if you burn one of the humans wandering the dungeon by accident they will chain-sleep you and keep coming back because they are burning, can easilly kill you with the damage earlier on.

												Short answer:Buy this game if you want a simple game to play with other people in the same room.Long version:The aesthetics are this game's strongest features, and can compare favorably to Fez or Spelunky. The lighting effects alone are almost enough to sell this game, as it features dynamic shadows, light and dark areas, and simply makes the game feel alive. The sound effects seem like something out of a game from the 70s or 80s, with the simplified sounds reinforcing the pixellated aesthetic of the game.The gameplay is simple enough, that it would be a good game to play with other people in your living room. It is easy to imagine a fun-filled evening, consuming beverages and salted snacks of choice, killing zombies and skeletons for fun and profit.Playing alone or for extended periods, however, is where the game is weakest. Since the game is 2.5D, you'll often find yourself falling into lava pits, or failing to connect attacks with monsters. After thirty-odd years of platform games being made, sold, and having time to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, I can only imagine the reasons that they chose to make this game 2.5D. I cannot think of a game where this set of mechanics works. Even playing with friends locally, the fun of laughing at your pals falling into a lava pit for the Nth time, would probably wear off quickly. They could fix this by having a graphical indication of the depth-level of your character, or making the hit-boxes more forgiving to the player.Other mechanics are equally poor. Combat is a simplistic button-mashing affair, with no chance of using anything other than your single weapon. There are health recover mechanics, armors, and other items, but since the inventory system is so cripplingly simplistic, the only thing you'll have time to do in combat, is to mash the attack button. Outside of combat, the inventory system will also annoy or aggravate. The game has loot-dropping mechanics similar to any Diablo or Torchlight game, where you will find a reasonably large amount of items over the course of your journey. However, your inventory is managed by scrolling left and right through the list of your items, and either equipping, using, or dropping that item. So, it's a game where the loot-dropping encourages picking up every item on the floor, and the inventory-management system forces you to spend most of your time throwing away useless items, so that you can more easily find your health-restoration items after combat, either apples or potions.The potions in this game are where its roguelike influences are felt most strongly. They're un-identified, labelled only with a color. After using one of them, however, they remain labelled with their color, meaning you'll have to stop your fast-paced hack-and-slash game, to jot down notes about which potions to keep and which to throw away. Weirdly enough, armor and weapons will enter your inventory identified, although with slightly vague names, which sometimes leave you guessing to their function. A heavy top hat of power, for example, would decrease your jump height due to its weight, and probably increase your combat effectiveness. Expect frequent visits to the internet, to look up what each enchantment does, before you decide on your hat, and continue in the dungeon.The levels themselves, are reasonably varied, with randomized layouts, doorways, and monsters. The level generator, however, needs some re-working. About one time in ten, you'll find yourself literally unable to proceed, because the game spawned a dungeon, with no path to get to the next dungeon level. Other times, there will be secret floor-buttons or wall-switches, with no apparent function in the dungeon. One time, I had an unreachable switch spawn at the top of the level with, presumably, a secret staircase to be activated by that same switch. Finally, the dungeons will randomly be filled with dark rooms, where you'll either have to fight with your lantern, or hope you found a hat which gives off some light. Flaming hats and the electro-sphere are good options. The current mechanics and items of the game, make the darkness feel like a feature which was not fully thought out, with frustration being the most likely option, and no productive things the player can reasonably do, to puzzle or fight past the dark rooms.Overall, this game feels like an unfinished product, which needs many of its existing mechanics fixed, reworked, or removed. It is an OK game for a short evening with friends on the couch, but not something you'd be playing after an hour or two.			"

The game is challenging enough to be very repayable and the online score board gives it a nice competitive aspect.Also the name 'Robot loves kitty' is so awesome it makes me jealous I didn't think of it.

												legend of dungeon has a simple enough story get to the 26'th floor grab the treasure and get back to the tavern you start in.  Getting down to floor 26 is hard getting back up is harder. Floors seem to be randomly generated so there seems to be no remember the learn between deaths to get things and avoud traps. Equipment is simple you have Hats, Weapons, and Potions. Weapons and Hats come in different adjectives only giving you a benifit when equiped and Potions come in different colors and give a perminint change when consumed. You are started out with a sword and whatever you swipe in the tavern (so a lantern, some apples, and some beer)A good game. difficult sometimes due to the randomness of items and potions you can usually make it pretty far with some good early finds (like a nimble sultans coffeecup +19 or a tome of some sort)			"

												For all the crawlers: I you are waiting a pretty looking dungeon crawl game - it is not an option. I'm not saying it is bad, it just lacks the ""heavy Rogue-like elements"". If you played some rogue like game you will notice.The elements that i really liked is the graphics - extreamly pleasant to watch, the music - on a great level. Dungeon generation is decent. Something i dont really find convenient is the inventory system. If you get much stuff, it's not easy to find what you want (especially in a tough fight).After all it is definitely a worthy game, just don't play it alone and don't expect the roguelike experience.

												Review: Legend of Dungeon for the PC.Legend of Dungeon is a brand new IP in a world full of established ideas, and it's a fresh new take on the Adventure genre with fresh 3D visuals and Multiplayer. The Indie team have have made it work.The setting of the game doesn't really matter, I guess. You're in an environment and you have to do things to progress. It's a video game! but it is fun and the progress is rewarding.Legend of Dungeon tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting features. Asynchronous play takes a while to set up, and it's sometimes annoying that you have to wait for other peple to do things befoe you get to have fun. It's not as immediately rewarding as a fully online system but there's some interesting experiences on offer.The graphics are pretty good, if you're into the cartoony art style, It's not a game you will be writing home about. Character animation is acceptable, but given the obvious attention to detail in the world it seems a shame that all the good looking (and, it has to be said, larger than their competition)  spritescharacters move about in a relatively sloppy way. Backgrounds however are a delight, with wonderfully moody landscapes that have been positively showered with all the colours of rock. At least you can max out all the FSAA settings and run at maximum resolution without too much worry!!Highly recommended for Adventure fans and anyone who's after a good time.Overall Score: 8 / 10 "

												CAUTION:This Game can become very addicting. Endless replay value as Dungeon changes with each playthrough.The simplistic dungeon design makes for some challenging game play as you (or with friends) traverse through the dark dungeon, reveiling hidden chambers, killing rooms full of monsters, collecting gold, upgrading your weapons and armor.Become even stronger as you smite your foes to gain experience or choose to potion sample your way to increasing player stats.What is the goal. You ask?A quest for Fortune and Glory! However. This is easier said than done.For the challenges that lay within this legendary Dungeon are for no mere mortal Man or Woman.To aid you in your quest for Fortune and Glory you may take upon the role of the Dead-raising Necromancer, Spell-casting Wizard or the Gun-slinging Cowboy (only to name a few).But first you will need to find and aid these (playable) companions back from the deep dark catacombes.Or.Take it upon yourself to find the Treasure and cut down hordes of monsters as they attempt to thwart your return.Do you have what it takes to become a Legendary Hero?Find out within Legend of Dungeon: Legend Heroes.Happy Crawling. Muahahahahahaaaa!P.S.Please Note that is a Rogue-like Dungeon crawling RPG style game.			"

												Bought this game about 6 months ago and gave it a try. It was ok. I would much prefer it had a story and more of a sense that I'm getting something done. Then just found out today that they did an update to implement this for the Oculus Rift. Threw on my DK2 and fired this up. WOW. Really, really cool. One of the better Rift experiences I've had. 2D sidescroller games like this built with 3D backgrounds work really well on the rift. There aren't many games for the rift out that aren't First Person. Really nice change to see something like this. BlazeRush is also another non-first person game that has VR support, and that has been one of my favorite games this year. This game is fun on a computer monitor, but you really get immersed when you use the Rift.			"

												One of the best games I own on steam. I read some of the downvotes and I think those children don't know what a roguelike is. You WANT TO SAVE? WHAT ARE YOU? NOT A MASOCHIST? Nonetheless this game is creative, addicting, and refreshing. The only problem is that a run can last up to 6 hours. I have a busy life so that's a hard investment. Maybe if there was a short dungeon option that would fix this. This should be the roguelike for the new age. Great work Robot Loves Kitty.

												First off what can be said about this game. Even though I have had it for a while, I haven't played it that much. When I first became aware of this game I thought that the graphics were very cute. Also the lighting looked gorgeous. At the time Northernlion said that the game was in Alpha and playable, unfortunately after that there was a Kickstarter Campaign and then the Alpha was removed. I figured out why when the game was released.First off it handles poorly. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but there is also extremely poor hit detection. I must say the game looked more fun when someone else played it. I wanted to really like this game. I even did something rare and bought it when it was released! It doesn't seem like anything has changed since the alpha, so why did it take them so long to release it? It feels like an unfinished tech demo. I wish I had more positive things to say about this.It is a Roguelike-like, but not really. The dynamic music system I found to be annoying at best, maybe it was just what was generated in my playthrough. Also the levels all appeared to be the same and actually poorly layed out. It seems that they used set pieces instead of a truely procedurally generated dungeon. Also while the lighting is really nice, it is too gray and dull.Item management is a nightmare. I don't see how this wasn't changed somehow or complained about. I don't see how a better sorting system couldn't have been created. Oh, thats the challenge of the game you might say. Roguelikes are meant to be difficult. I enjoy them. For some reason, I was expecting something better than the initial alpha that I saw.Also a cardinal sin in 2014. No Online Multiplayer. What?! Only Local Co-op. I don't know ANYONE who invites 3 other people to cram themselves in front of a screen to play. What could have been an excellent LAN Party game just doesn't get any play at all. Why bother playing at all? There is no story, there is no depth. There is no point to this game. You're doing this just for the sake of doing it. While most roguelike stories are a bit ramshackle at best, at least there is some kind of Lore or atmosphere. I expected more depth from the combat. Combat has a disconnected unfinished feeling. There is no sense of progression or accomplishment beyond ""I made it to level X with Y gold"". Also, no ability to save the game. This is almost unforgiveable. Not even a quick save option. Even most hardcore roguelikes don't force you to quit your game without saving your progress. Have a sweet character and weapon set? Oh thats too bad, you just have to quit the game and try all over again. This is broken and frustrating.I wanted to like this game, I gave it about an hour of play before it was really boring and frustrating. I didn't pay much for the game, so I don't want my money back, but I wouldn't buy another game from Kitty Loves Robot again. The only positive thing really is hopefully other devs will see what is wrong with this game and not make similar mistakes.			"

												This is a disappointing one. And it’s pretty obvious why I got attracted to it: it has an oldschool look and feel and definitely plays very oldschool. However, it’s permadeath, just like Hack Slash Loot, another roguelike that I’m not very fond of. Maybe it’ll just be a matter of playing this one a little more to warm up to it, I don’t know.It kinda reminds me of the old Temple of Doom game for the NES, but it’s a roguelike. The way it works is it’s an action/RPG, but very easy to die, kinda like Dark Souls. That sounds like it should be right up my alley, right? And then suddenly, permadeath. It’d be one thing if it robbed you of a level and put you back a stage or something, but no, game over.I’ve never been a big fan of permadeath especially considering the way you often learn from games is by making mistakes. Sure, permadeath makes it harder and forces you to be more careful, but it also makes the game more frustrating to the point that it will only appeal to a select few people…and I’m not one of them. Still, it has an interesting visual look and is fairly fun until you die, so if you like the price, go for it.  Personally, I didn't like it much.			"

												Really interesting game here, and runs decently on my new MBP with discreet graphics. In all my travels through the game I never found myself stuck where I could not proceed somehow; just often times took me going up quick a few levels to do it. The rooms that are lit are done so from the front, giving the game an almost stage-like appeal; like you are performing or something. The graphics are charming, and the gameplay is intense but manageable. 8/10.			"

												A game that i have put a large portion of two hours into. I found this game from some youtubers and thought it looked cool. And it does with its neat lighting. and it was fun with its roguelike style but personally did nothing that stood out to me. I picked it up a couple times but never again because i knew what would happen when i did. I would play for a little while then go through the beginning couple floors and be bored then get to the one difficult floor and get blown to bits by some wierd wizard guy. That or go to sleep and forget about it. The game has a nice graphics style but not much originality too offer for my taste in rogue likes. If your looking for a good rogue like try rogue legacy.

												Everything about this game is simple, which is perfect. It's a great hangout game. The controls are few but equally accommodating to keyboard or gamepad. You could easily catch uip with friends while running a campaign without too much difficulty. It's visually attractive without being overly flashy and the ingame props (hats, weapons and potions) could lead to some interesting dialog. It still requires some game competence though. I tried playing with my wife but it was a no go.EDIT 2014Still loving this game. Play every so often. Anyone try double handing it by partnering with yourself? I'm lonely lol.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is a pretty straightforward action roguelike game. It has typical random generation, 26 floors, and the token to win on the final floor. The game is fun, with a narrow playfield and 2.5d combat and gameplay, but for serious fans of roguelikes or anything similar, it may get a bit old quickly. The item design and graphics of the game are beautiful, and by far it's most attractive quality. It takes a common theme of pixel graphics and chiptuney sounds to make a pretty nice modern spin on the typical ""retro"" style. Overall, I'd say it's a game worth trying.			"

												Legend of Dungeon is the unholy love child of rogue-likes and beat-'em-ups, and it is glorious. Unlike most traditional rougue-likes and rogue-lites you won't constantly feel like you're struggling to survive. If you're lucky, you may even find some good items early on and feel like nothing could possibly kill you. Then something does, all at once and without warning. Maybe you found yourself trapped in a dead end with a wraith hot on your♥♥♥♥♥and only 50 HP left, or maybe you got overconfident and fell into lava while trying to jump to a potion which was likely a debuff anyway. Maybe you just forgot (or were unable) to heal after fighting that minotaur and got bitten by a snake in an otherwise empty room. Point is, you'll die when you least expect it.If you enjoy deadly randomized dungeons and beat-'em-ups with light RPG elements, and you can resist the urge to murder defenseless kittens in a video game then this is the game for you.Seriously, though, don't don't kill the kittens you psycho. Bad things will happen.			"

												I can get past the ultra-pixelated graphics; the abfxr-generated sounds; the boring, repetitive level tile sets; the clunky inventory management; having to pick up your own score points and the nonsensical randomized level design (find a secret room with some random enemy inside and nothing else); but the combat falling flat on its face just throws it all down the drain.There’s no strategy, skill or tactics involved in fighting enemies, a decent beat-em-up will have wind ups, cool downs and stuns for both the player and enemies. Knowing when to attack, move out of the way and pulling off a nice combo as a reward is what it’s all about.Instead we have a mish-mash of half-baked ideas and genres that simply don’t mix (at least the way it’s been implemented): the player melee attack does have a small windup and cool down but most enemies damage you by simply touching you, the strategy is to simply wail on the mob of npcs, hoping your hp outlasts that of the enemies’ and that you’ll find enough apples to heal up for the next encounter. And of course there’s plenty of items, potions and helmets that the game does a pretty poor job at explaining what they do exactly.I also heavily despised the player’s walking animation, the workaround for such a low-res sprite is having both legs never cross each other when moving, and making a very short but irritating stop after the character takes a step.At least the lighting effects are pretty.

												I am a big fan of roguelikes. Something about a quick pickup and play game with infinite replay-ability really interests me. Especially with the short spurts of time that I have as a Father in between family and work responsibilities. Legend of Dungeon by developer Robot Loves Kitty scratches that itch just enough in possibly the shortest amount of time that I can imagine. I harkens back to a time where playing a game meant sitting down for 20 minutes or less and being able to walk away refreshed and fulfilled. No massive story lines, or extensive in depth gameplay. Sometimes all you need is some mindless and entertaining particles in front of you to pass a bit of time and cleanse the palette.Legend of Dungeon is a sorbet in between courses. Just when you finish your first session of gaming and you need to wipe the need to continue away; Legend of Dungeon allows you a transition that is just fun and fast enough to entertain but not establish a baseline genre.To be honest it is a side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like construction, but it could easily be much more. It has some very light RPG elements and some other thematic enemies and a dark setting that could make for some very interesting story; but the game itself doesn't bank on any of these as strong attractors for itself. Not it's much more simple than that.In essence the game relies on a single button combat system and a series of hats and randomly generated consumables to entertain. Every run has it's own quirks, like coming across a space-traveler in a phone booth. Or wearing a cat on your head while attacking angels. There are nods to popular media and internet culture all over the game. Most of the items and enemies are seemingly derived from nerd culture actually. This faceless derivation however serves the larger purpose of the game. This is refreshing as often features no longer serve the purpose of the game and instead act as a standalone neon sign saying ""LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO!"".I may be allowing it to survive a critical eye but I believe that in short bursts Legend of Dungeon  has it's own merits. It isn't a great game, but it isn't a bad game either. It reminds me of a modern day iteration of an endless slalom flash game when you have nothing to do to kill time. Unfortunately I don't have time to kill as most of my time is more valuable when I have to split it between so many responsibilities. Still though, it is a simpler game that reminded me of a simpler time in my youth. And I can appreciate that.You'll like this game if: You just need a nameless, faceless, game to entertain you for a few empty minutes. That might not sound appealing but everyone needs some mindless entertainment now and again!From my blog at: bigdadgamer.blogspot.com "

 Overall Review A friend reccomended this game to me and at first I really didn't know what to expect. I ended up playing a good few hours with him sharing a keyboard between us and well.. I really enjoyed it! The dynamic lighting throughout the dungeons is very well done, and the graphics are quite appealing too! There is plenty of pop culture refrences in the game, some of which gave me a chuckle here and there however the only downside to this title is that you can only play local multiplayer, as online isn't supported. Overall; A brillient little indie game when having a couple of friends over!  Feature Rating (/100)   Gameplay 70   Graphics 80   Replayability 70   Story/Lore 60   Average 70/100  "

												 Legend of Dungeon is a rogue-like dungeon-crawler where you start with nothing but a sword, some apples, and a lantern, and descend through levels and levels of a procedurally generated dungeon. Along the way you collect hats to wear, new weapons to wield, spellbooks and potions and all sorts of other loot, making each playthrough a unique experience.The game is really quick, simple, and addictive. It reminds me a lot of FTL in its pick-up-and-play gameplay. A cool feature is the ability to play local co-op with friends, but the game really does stand up on its own as well. The graphics are unique, but they grew on me. There's something about the lighting mixed with the music mixed with the simple sprites that gives everything a very awesome aesthetic.			"

												Buy only on sale. I'm not much of a dungeon crawler, but if I enjoy the game with that sort of playstyle I usually put in the extra effort to see where it goes. It has a very simple combat system which can get pretty aggrivating sometimes because unless you are patient and have extrememly good timing, you're gonna get hit and depending on who hit you will determine how mad you get. That's the skill part of the game, and you could make it pretty far if you're determined, the rest is all luck. Personally, I just want to see all the monsters and weird dungeons. I usually pick it up for one play through, then move on to the next coop game.Also, I only play with me and a friend. I'd imagine the more players you have, the more fun.			"

												You can play a randomly generated dungeon by default, or you can play one that remains the same for one day. The items you can acquire may have both benefits and hiderances, allowing you to determine whther or not the benefit is worth it. Favor melee or spells, or switch between.The effect of different colors of postions changes with every game as well. Better get a notepad!The dungeon design is pleasantly deceptive in that while it displays as a sort of retro game, playing reveals that some really great work has been put into lighting effects from a variety of types of light source-- candles, lamps, plasma balls, uni or omnidirectional in nature.  The chracter design is charming in a way that suits the 8-bit stlye.Since its original release, LoD has had additional releases and support. The music is terrific.			"

												Legend of Dungeon has many different modes of playstyle, depending on the choices you make. Entertainingly, some of these abilities stack, sometimes to very different outcomes. I've been getting progressively better at getting further in (ie, to level 13), but you need to start switching gears quite a bit and the learning curve at this level means you're not likely to be bored playing the same way. Bring your lateral thinking hats to the party.			"

												This is one of those games that needs a maybe option instead of yes or no for recommending.It has this amazing style, but it just isn't the roguelike I wanted at all. Melee combat is terrible, too short of a range, too stiff, and too difficult to win with unless you get very lucky and find an epic weapon. My only success has been by spamming summons over and over, waiting a million hours to get through the game *yawn*. The potions do not get named after drinking, so you have to write down what each color potion does, and the game doesn't even tell you exactly what the potion did very clearly. If I wanted to write stuff down, I could just play a real DnD board game instead.Every level is too much the same exact thing over and over, so little variety here.No special dungeon branches, it's all the same thing- and it's pretty slow going until late game if you happen to find some speed items. Takes me hours each playthrough due to the slow nature of this game- and it is too repetitive so gets monatenous.Neat music but not much music.Local multiplayer only!Gameplay is too much the same thing every playthrough, not much going on here for a roguelike, not even the classes change much of the gameplay so far- well at least not the few I unlocked I suppose.I like the game but don't love it, and the developement has been frozen for years basically, with only tiny improvements made. Make sure you really like what you see in the promo video before buying!			"

I wouldn't recommend it for a single player, but as a party game it's a blast.The frantic scrambling to collect coins, gear, and potions, while trying to avoid your horrible, inevitable death makes sure that you stay on your toes the whole time.

												Legend of Dungeon has many different modes of playstyle, depending on the choices you make. Entertainingly, some of these abilities stack, sometimes to very different outcomes. I've been getting progressively better at getting further in (ie, to level 13), but you need to start switching gears quite a bit and the learning curve at this level means you're not likely to be bored playing the same way. Bring your lateral thinking hats to the party.			"

												This is one of those games that needs a maybe option instead of yes or no for recommending.It has this amazing style, but it just isn't the roguelike I wanted at all. Melee combat is terrible, too short of a range, too stiff, and too difficult to win with unless you get very lucky and find an epic weapon. My only success has been by spamming summons over and over, waiting a million hours to get through the game *yawn*. The potions do not get named after drinking, so you have to write down what each color potion does, and the game doesn't even tell you exactly what the potion did very clearly. If I wanted to write stuff down, I could just play a real DnD board game instead.Every level is too much the same exact thing over and over, so little variety here.No special dungeon branches, it's all the same thing- and it's pretty slow going until late game if you happen to find some speed items. Takes me hours each playthrough due to the slow nature of this game- and it is too repetitive so gets monatenous.Neat music but not much music.Local multiplayer only!Gameplay is too much the same thing every playthrough, not much going on here for a roguelike, not even the classes change much of the gameplay so far- well at least not the few I unlocked I suppose.I like the game but don't love it, and the developement has been frozen for years basically, with only tiny improvements made. Make sure you really like what you see in the promo video before buying!			"

												Too random for my tastes, and not much going on in the level design.One moment you can be in a decent run with good health and items, and the next you see a fast moving Grim Reaper in the next room, instant death on touch. Not really fun for a rouge-like to die to something so unfair.I probably didn't give this game too much of a chance, but I didn't really have fun on my time playing it.			"

												Summary: A fantastic co-op experience that, while it can be quite difficult, always seems pretty fair. It's part Beat'Em'Up, part Rogue-Like, and feels a lot like a good meat-grinder dungeon crawl like you'd get in old-school hack-and-slash action games. Pros:+ Up to 4 player local co-op+ Works great with steam link+ Excellent controller support+ Dungeon layout and encounters change up with every play+ You'll die a lot, but it won't be surprising and the game's fun enough to encourage multiple tries+ Great replay value+ Some excellent UI choices make the fast-paced and unpredictable always make immediate sense (ex. your stats, and how items affect them, are always onscreen as you play)Cons:- It's difficult; skill comes with repeated (and numerous) deaths - I know not everyone will find it difficult, but my judgements on this are tied to a mix of different levels of players showing up to play some random games- Healing items are insanely rare, so the game can feel unforgiving- Success or failure can sometimes feel to be at the whim of random chance (of treasure pick-ups and enemies encountered)			"
