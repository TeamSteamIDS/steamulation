												Well what can i say. I got 1200h+ Hours played. Yes i bought the completely Overkill Pack the DLC's and supported the game. But after microtransactions and more and more DLC's i had to give it a bad review. They were promising free content and instead we got paid DLC's and microtransactions. So Overkill will most likly go on with this trend of money making.Don't get me wrong its one of my favorite games. But if you are new do not buy it unless you are willing to spend more money on DLC's that will come out over time. Because even with a -75% sale on everything the game with everything costs ~33€. And after some time you maybe dont want to wait for a sale to get the newest DLC.So what i want to tell you is that you will invest more money into the game. The content is good overall but you will have to pay more than you think. Also playing with ""publics"" (people you don't know) can be pretty annoying. It's ok for a while but sometimes you just want a break from them. So if you want to play it be ready to spend some money on DLC and maybe microtransactions (for Weapon Skins which are cosmetic) and get yourself into a group to play Payday with.			"

												I used to like you, OVERKILL. Your game was great, but after the recent activities, you seem to be missing the actual point of the game by miles. Skins, crates, medieval weapons, a ton of story-unfriendly heisters, trading, and microtransactions? Really?I bought all your DLC, followed your every post, your every update, your every move with this game. But lately, you turned PAYDAY 2 into another mainstream cashgrab. My friends and I had a lot of fun, but this stops because of you and your greed. You ♥♥♥♥ed up, simple as that.Edit1: OVERKILL's community mods also began deleting negative feedback in the forums. Censorship is the last water drop in an already flooded garage. I'm just so done with this.Edit2: They finally removed microtransactions! Reason enough for me to play the game again. However, their mistakes are too many for me to have a positive attitude towards them. For now.Edit3: If you are a new player, I advise you to not look at Edit1, as it was created the same week as this review. Though it is still worth a look, depending on your opinion on such matters. Also, fixed formulations to clarify.			"

												The public play is a toxic and unpleasant to play with People you dont know as kicking without reason is very Common especialy if you are in the first 100 lvls.Its a Great coop game if you have up to 3 friends that play with you its a real blast but just to buy it to play public is really not an option.The new Skilltrees are more clear and they took out many of Filler skills that wer completely useless and most skills got combined or mixed in some way.You have a great choice of mods that make the game more clear to play(didnt play a long time dont know what mods are Fresh and aktiv in Development).Verdict:I would say if you have atleast 2 friends that would play with you go for it otherwise get another game playing public with the broadside of this community is pointless. My review is going to stay negativ even if its not a bad game got some worse in my library.			"

												Update: It appears that Starbreeze has purchased all the rights to their game and they are doing away with paid drills. This is a step in the right direction, but in my opinion there are still a lot of wrongs that need to be righted before I can recommend the game.Original Review:My friend, Doctor Insano, said it better than I could...So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.That time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release ""We will not ever have microtransactions."" And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.Last year, there were a series of ""what's next"" audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.Last year, we had ""Crimefest,"" where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.Last year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were ""FBI Files"" (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.This year, Overkill did a ""Hype Train"" event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get ""hype-fuel"" points. With enough ""hype-fuel,"" rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this ""Mask Pack 2.0."" It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.Overkill, shame on you. I truly do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats. I truly hope your company goes out of business.			"

												Another game that goes sour because of a cashgrab from the publishers/developers.UPDATE: Overkill has slightly backpeddled on the microtransactions by making them a rare drop and reducing the price, but this is still unnacceptable when the initial promise was no microtransactions ever. Their reputation has been tarnished and I am still going to be wary of spending any more money on this company.			"

												Payday 1 was a great game. It was a simple, fun game about robbing banks and making dosh. Payday 2 started off as an improvement. Then DLC kept happening. Balancing never occurred. Bugs were ignored in favor of more PAYED content.Now, after stating they'd never have microtransactions, have begun the exact same thing as csgo....except it's actually pay-to-win. Weapon skins give you stats. Please do not play this game. The devs have become greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and do not deserve any more money.			"

												A money-obsessed pale imitation of the first game.Payday 1 was essentially ""Left 4 Dead, except bank robbers."" It's a simple formula that worked really well. The long, objective-rich campaigns had enough variety between them that the game never felt stale. Gunplay was satisfying, enemies were challenging, and the DLC added a new class to screw around with. A few maps and secrets got updated as free updates.Payday 2 is nothing like the first game.The sequel is essentially a disgrace to the first game. In lieu of lengthy, interesting campaigns, each assignment has been broken up into a bunch of smaller maps with straightforward objectives. Prepare to see the same areas, again and again. Stealth has been overemphasized across the board--killing yourself to restart is a common occurrence. The difficulty just isn't there compared to the first game, either. The matchmaking is also random gen and a complete mess--gone are the easy lobbies of the first game.It gets worse! The unlock system is heavily dependent on RNG. Customization is RNG. Everything in this game is RNG except leveling.The game has had DLC after DLC heaped on it. During a sale, it becomes a reasonable price.. when it's off sale expect to pay $50+ just to unlock a decent amount of content.The game has blatant product placement. John Wick is shoved in your face as a free character. Why this doesn't get more negative feedback, I'll never know.The new DLC came free of charge.. with a caveat. Now you can enjoy CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 crates, and pay $2.50 to unlock them. As if the game couldn't become more money-grubbing and obsessed with profit. Did I mention the crates are factored into the RNG loot, meaning if you have no intent to pay to unlock them, you can still lose out by getting them when you don't want them?Game use to have a modding community, too. Overkill has deliberately broken mods with their latest patch. Maybe they'll fix this, I don't know.Am I against all DLC? Not at all. Plenty of games make great use of DLC. But herein lies my point. This is not a free-to-play game. This isn't a game in which the DLC is cosmetic. You have to pay for the game. Then the DLC, which encompasses characters, weapons, and campaigns, is also paid for. The game has product placement blatantly inserted into it. It then on top of that wants to insert microtranscations. This game has done everything it can to insert pay wall after pay wall. For what should be a simple, Left 4 Dead style cooperative game, the amount of grind and pay-for-content in tis game is absolutely absurd.All in all a disaster, right from the start. It just took some people longer to see that.			"

												Please purchase the Gage Positive Review DLC Pack for only $5.99.Most of the core game features are DLC. Don't expect to use grenades, sniper rifles, light machine guns, or explosives, don't expect to host any of the new heists, and don't expect to have good weapon modifications without paying again. It was an honestly fun horde shooter before the DLC power creep took hold.Also, the requirements call for multiple CPU cores when the game can only run on one. Overkill™ quality and all that.			"

												This game was fun prior to the October 15th, 2015 addition of random drop-based microtransactions.  Remember keys and crates from TF2 and CS:GO?  The same approach is being used here, but in adding this system, Overkill harshly nerfed all existing weapons - including those which players paid for as part of DLC packages.In order to give players an incentive to pay for skins via microtransactions, existing equipment has been made insufficient to achieve the challenges that already existed in the game prior to the launch of this system.  We aren't being urged to buy microtransactions in order to take on more difficult challenges added alongside these new skins - we're being robbed of our existing tools, tools we earned through hours of gameplay or purchased for real money, and then sold a -chance- of regaining the same level of power we enjoyed previously.There were plenty of good ways to add a skin system to a game like Payday 2.  Overkill found a truly terrible way and implemented it.  I can't recommend supporting this game or this company.			"

												I played this game for a very long time. I was willing to put up with the terrible desynch and the gradual powercreep because it was fun, and as a cooperative game, it wasn't a huge problem.However, recently they added CS:GO-style ""weapon crates"" that you get randomly for completing heists. Opening them requires you spend real money. Inside, you get weapon skins, which give stat bonuses to your weapons.They added this feature as the first ""free"" reward the community got for completing a bunch of milestones during the run-up to the yearly Crimefest. Literally, ""Well done on the challenges, your free reward is an opportunity to give us more money and make the game pay-to-win.""Basically, ♥♥♥♥ Overkill. I used to think they were just incompetent at managing their messaging toward their community. Now it's clear that they literally don't give a ♥♥♥♥ beyond hoovering money up.			"

												I can't help but feel betrayed by this game. After spending many hours, and putting in plenty of money for DLC's, to be rewarded by having to pay more money is beyond ridiculous! A week ago the whole PD2 community came together to show these dev's that we appreciated what they did for us, despite the already extortionately priced and unnecessary amount of DLC (around 25, lost count). Then our reward for our efforts and loyalty was another way for them to squeeze money from us. I'm sorry, but this is just not right. All this aside from the written word from said devs stating that microtransactions would NEVER be introduced into the game. So, with lies about in game content and more lies about DLC which has been purchased and never released (the Completely Overkill Pack, FYI) it's hard to trust Overkill anymore. I for one will not spend another penny on this game. It's a shame, as the game is pretty good. It's just not ""pay to win"" good.			"

												Hey so this is a game that I really liked at first. I played a bit of the first game and thought it was an interesting new concept done well by an up-and-coming indie team. I was right. It was fun. PAYDAY was an enticing, original game that knew not to take itself too seriously. I very much liked the idea. The sequel did a great job of refining and expanding on the gameplay concepts that were introduced in the original; as well as elaborating on the purposely far-fetched story. I thought PAYDAY 2 was an amazing game. That all changed when PAY2WIN arrived...They started with a few cheap DLCs. What's the harm, right? Pretty much all mainstream games release one or two payed downloadable content packs at some point, these days. It's a way of keeping the community interested by freshening up the game a little. I honestly prefer a few DLCs or expansions as opposed to releasing a new sequel every year just to make sure that society doesn't forget you exist (COD). However, I soon found out that what PAYDAY 2 had planned was far worse than anything Call of Duty has EVER done. Overkill released DLC after DLC after DLC after DLC. They just kept coming. Each one more ""elaborate"" than the last. If you call paying $5 for a stupid new overpowered weapon elaborate. They incessantly released plethoras of ridiculous content that had little to add to the game but give the purchaser a purpose-defeating advantage. They're essentially payed cheat codes, in the sense that a lot of these DLCs pretty much make the game EZ mode. I honestly think that Overkill does not give a ♥♥♥♥ about their ""community"" anymore. All they seem to know or care about these days is that DLC=$$$. What really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off is this new ""Black Market Update"" or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they called it. It's literally a copy-paste of the Arms Deal Update from CS:GO. LITERALLY THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING. I mean I understand that they're purposely making this update resemble Counter-Strike, but I don't get why. Obviously it's because CS:GO keys and crates have made Valve a fortune, but what's with the unapologetic rip-off of Valve's style? Are they trying to be ironic? Because it's not ironic. It's not funny, or witty, or clever, or even mildly amusing. The whole update was completely unnecessary and just makes Overkill look like the money-grubbing sleazeballs that they obviously are. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE. A couple of years ago, I would have told all of my friends about how fun and original PAYDAY 2 was, and I did; but this game and its devs are garbage now. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT GIVE THESE IDIOTS YOUR MONEY!			"

												Come ON Overkill.I love this game, seriously, I really do. I haven't wracked up thousands of hours, no, because I don't game much, but this was the first game in my Steam library to break a hundred hours, and then 200 not long after. I was addicted, I was hooked, I joined Facebook Groups dedicated to organizing all-nighter crime sprees on Skype and TeamSpeak.It was phenomenal. The gameplay was amazing. The game was based almost entirely on skill and persistence, teamwork.Now?Come on guys.I could forgive the DLC stream, I was working full hours back when it started so I could keep up.I could forgive the letdown of Crimefest, I didn't pay that much attention anyway.You guys went from consistently updating the game with ACTUAL improvements, focused on bug fixes, detailed missions and new weapons that created whole new playstyles, to microtransactions, nerfing weapons to practically make the skins mandatory, and not even nerfing them well, resulting in the entire balance between weapon types being thrown off, breaking the game.We get it, you want our money.You're a game developer who, only a couple of years ago, was fresh on the block.Then you managed to crank out an absolute masterpiece, you couldn't handle the boom in media attention and community growth, and you got carried away.You know what? I can forgive that. I can forgive you for trying microtransactions, and skins, and drops.I can forgive you, for trying new things.You are now a new BIG game developer on the block, instead of a new SMALL one. You'll make mistakes.I can forgive that.But I cannot forgive the lying and manipulation you've done to the community. One of the best gaming communities outside the professional gaming circuit.A false apology, refusals to remove the failed tests despite the damage they've done, news blackouts...We trusted you guys.You gave us an INCREDIBLE game, you were doing SO WELL.We would have handed our wallets to you if you asked.But that's the thing, you didn't ask.We'd like our wallets back.This hurt to write.

												I put a lot of time into this game (relatively to how much I play).Then Microtrasatctions, like CS:GO but much worse. (Skins affect stats). Even after this: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/Which yes, is from awhile ago, but this isn't something to go back on.I like this game, but I'm joining in the boycott until this gets changed.Overkill pls.Edit: Now they Made it worse with update 90.I can't make my review more negative.

												Payday 2 is a fantasticly fun game, which gets even more enjoyable with friends. The gunplay is nice, the skills give tons of different playstyles, the heists are enjoyable, and the music is amazing. I would completely recommend this game to anyone if it was made by a different developer. Sadly, it's made by Overkill.See, Overkill is known for keeping in touch with their community. And that's not a bad thing; it's great, actually. If they actually ♥♥♥♥ing listened to their community, that is, instead of just pretending to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the people that play it. Overkill loves money, never forget it. They release tons of DLC, did a whole ""completely free event"" back in the Spring where you had to buy DLC to unlock more rewards, and now did another ""completely free event"" where on the first day microtransactions are added that give stat boosts.Now, whether or not you consider this Pay 2 Win or not is your opinion, as it is a coop game. But it's still ♥♥♥♥ing slimy to promise your community a completely free event, have them work hard to get all the rewards, then day ♥♥♥♥ing one release a macrotransaction system which gives stat boosts.This is a great game. It was made by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer. If you want to still spend your money on it, go ahead, but be ready to feel like ♥♥♥♥ when Overkill once again manages to ♥♥♥♥ over their community for that cash.

Although my review shows not recommended, I do recommend this game, specially if you have friends to play with, it's way more enjoyable. I got a bit salty after some of Overkill's actions and they have redeemed themselves for the most part.Updated: November 23rd, 2016They introduced some changes, like two new difficulties, and other free content to the community. Looks like after the turmoil last year they are back on track trying to improve the game. The new difficulties seem rushed, there aren't a lot of viable builds. Questionable DLC business model is still up. Actually it's more challenging and fun to play with the vanilla and free community weapons. The problem with DLCs are the paid heists, you need them if you want to host those heists, but you can still join lobbies if you don't own these. The problem will be finding those lobbies.Updated: June 6th, 2016Some things have changed, and others did not. OVERKILL removed the paid safes/drills from drop rotation, although you can still open them if you buy a drill, so they kept the microtransactions. They are changing it in the near future though, so new safes will drop and users will be free to open them, or sell them on Steam Market. I have no problem with that, as long as it keeps accessible for everyone without a pay wall.They also changed/updated the game with some free content since my last review update, and few other paid DLCs.It seems they are launching less DLC but the paid DLC model has not changed though, they still keep releasing themed DLC split in two packs, like the Biker Heist and Biker Character Pack, those could easily be a single pack. At least they will keep supporting the game until 2017, which is definitely a good thing. Users decide if they want to buy DLC or not, but lets hope the quality is good. Buy it on sale, on the cheap :)Update: After Black Market Update 79 / October 15th, 2015OVERKILL introduced new microtransactions with random safe card drops and drills and weapon skins, equivalent to CS:GO weapon cases and keys and skins with steam market support, also similar to a model of free-to-play games. The difference is that PD2 is a paid game and those skins actually boost some stats.Adding microtransactions was something they said they never would do.Developer can't keep their word:...We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!) and... > http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521They launched a ""weapon rebalance"" patch with the excuse to increase diversity and versatily of other weapons. The thing is, with some stats being nerfed and stats boost added to skins, seems like a clear move from them to incite people buying those skins.Pistols making more damage than heavy shotguns and assault rifles. What is this nonsense? To bring some shotguns back to their level before the ""rebalance patch"" you have to use special ammo, that is a feature of Gage Shotgun Pack, a DLC that wasn't required now is.In the process of updating their game, popular mods were killed because OVERKILL made changes on how the game worked with LUA modification scripts. OVERKILL claims that breaking mods was not intentional. But how can you trust someone's word if they went back on it already? Call it conspiracy theory but maybe they just wanted to protect their new investment (microtransactions) to prevent malicious scripts from tampering with the game and finding a way to get easy safe card drops. Now it's gonna take a lot of unpaid effort from modders to get things working again, or maybe those mods will be just dead.Mods are in the process of being fixed. Several of them are working again. Unfortunately some good modders got disgusted by recent OVERKILL choices and abandoned their mods :(Old/first reviewVery good game to play Co-Op with friends. Even playing with random people can be fun. Playing solo is usually not fun (I think solo play is suitable for stealth), but it's not the idea of the game. Some heists you can go loud or stealth, which renders a unique course as the heist takes place, or you can even do some of the heist in stealth and the rest loud. Could have more missions although they have some variation from time to time, It's a good thing that the developer is always launching new patches with improvements and bug fixes.Since the Death Wish patch, despite adding a new difficulty and some particular changes to the heists some aspects of the game were changed. Some of those changes modified the way certain skills worked and how they were implemented, and the most dramatic change was to the Stealth mechanics. I think those changes balanced the game better, in some ways it made the game more challenging, The new stealth mechanics requires more situational awareness and avoiding detection, it's not ""bad"", it works well for some heists but it makes luck to play a bigger part in other heists. I enjoy both Stealth and the Full assault gameplay but I enjoyed the ""old stealth"" because it was more simple and less time consuming, waiting and luck played lesser parts.Since my initial review there was a good amount of new heists added, some in free updates, most in paid updates (DLC). Despite heist DLCs most DLC packs are for weapons, masks, materials and characters. Missing some optional content isn't game breaking, but the DLC are too many and there are small things that could certainly be already in the game like a sniper rifle, light machine gun, grenades, more good weapon mods: all this was included behind a paywall (DLC), which is not nice. Also some DLC make the game somewhat easier, which feels that it's a bit of a ""pay to make it easier"" DLC.After so many hours playing I still enjoy playing with friends, so I still enjoy the game, although it's a bit tiresome to play the same heists over and over, so I tend to play only the Death Wish difficulty which still puts some challenge. The Infamy system is useful until Level 5 because it discounts the number of points you have to spend to unlock higher skills in the skills tree, so you can make better builds spending less points. Beyond that it's just more grinding for a few masks, materials and patterns.I don't like the random card/loot system that awards you items or masks, even useless money or little EXP boosts, I think it should be reworked. The rewards should be more balanced so everyone feels rewarded playing every single heist.Pros:+ Great Co-Op fun with friends!+ There is some variety of heists, but it becomes tiresome after many hours playing over and over the same maps+ Stealth or Full assault option on most situations+ The developer is present and tries to update the game with good frequency+ The new stealth adds a new challenge and situational awareness+ Good range of skills. You can specialize or make good builds depending on your role in the heists+ Many weapons are available and can be modified, although some are DLC exclusive, but I have to say that most weapons I use are those included in the game and community updates.Cons:- ""New stealth"" is more waiting game in certain situations than really a matter of being skilled.- The Infamy system is too much grinding for little reward- The rewards (loot system) should be rebalanced and reward the player more with more rare items- DLCs are too many, some things could be already in the full game or included for everybody. At this point all the DLC together cost way more more than the original game.- Some weapon and character perk deck DLC make the game easier in certain ways, which unbalanced compared to the original free loadout of the game.

												So from this point forward the drills are no more, and they've finally started listening to their community after half a year. Personally I think it's about eight months too late, but it's nice to see them axing the thing that split the community apart.Does this excuse their past flaws though? No, it really doesn't. They've pulled some scummy moves in the past year, with DLC that's literally useless to their infamous lies to past promises.Payday 2 is a very fun game, if you can catch it on a sale and get the boatload of DLC for dirt cheap, you have a good amount of gameplay there. However, take caution when buying future products from this developer. They've claimed to start listening to the community, but I still have my doubts.			"

												Well, I see Overkill f*%ked everyone over, yet again.  I don't play this game anymore, I haven't for around 3-4+ months now (From when this review was made), and I don't plan on coming back to it again, especially at the rate that it's going.Can I just point out before I state the obvious that this p*ss poor compnay, has screwed everyone over multiple times and apparently me and a very few ammount of people, are actually tired of their s*%t?They promised things like safe house customization, a new enemy, and a few other things here and there.  Any of that happen in the past 2 years? No.  Have they STATED anything about any of those? Nope.Not to mention the APPAULING DLC that they keep putting out and saying it's ""New content"" when all they put out is weapons and anything that is a actual level is boring as heII.  It's basically saying ""We're too lazy to make anything new so have more weapons.""Now then, onto the MAIN issue that they just put out, but lets start by going over why OTHER games do this (TF2, CSGO.) and do it the right way, Overkill completely misses it.Talk about a copy paste job, it's just basically this for those of you wanting to know the jist http://i.imgur.com/6tXBcEf.gifv Oh, should I add that they litterally did the same thing with a CSGO map? Yeah, lazyness to a whole new level. Want something better that fits them to a T? This

""The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT PAYDAY 2 WILL HAVE NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER"" Please tell me you f*%sticks over at Overkill are joking with this? Talk about hypocrits.1) The way CSGO and TF2 do it = These games do it right, you are not required to buy any skins at all, they prove no stat boost, no promises on getting more kills, ammo, anything, it's purely cosmetic, you aren't even forced to get any at all, and they don't shove it in your face.  The way Overkill does it, you can only get a 'safe' from a card drop, and the only way to open that safe is if you pay money for a drill, and you're set on a RNG based kind of system.  ""Oh that's just like CSGO though!"" Not really, in CSGO you can get drops for FFFFFF*%KING FREEEEEEE, and they don't change anything, just make it look better, unless it's a StatTrak I suppose.  Plus any skin you get you can sell for Steam Currency to buy better skins, or save them up and trade them all in for a random skin that is one rank higher than the colors you gave the Trade.  ""Oh you don't want the crate?"" CSGO would say, ""Well just go sell it on the market and get something that you'd like instead!"" Payday = ""Oh you don't want the safe? Don't have any money for the drill? Tough s*%t, bltch.""2) The skins in Payday 2 ruin the stats = They've made it to where skins give weapons boosts, my question is, why? That kind of ruins the entire point of all of that stats, you may as well just get a certain gun that kills people the most out of all the guns you've ever used in the game, get a particular skin, and that's it, why bother using anything else? I think they should scrap this entirely, make the skins be drops, or better yet, why not just GET RID OF THEM, and oh, I don't know, MAKE SOME ACTUALY LEVELS?! INSTEAD OF CASH GRABBING FROM YOUR FANS?!3) *off topic kind of* All of the Moderators are now SJW = Apparently since practically THE WHOLE S%DDING COMMUNITY HATES THIS, the moderators have now flat out gotten rid of everyones posts that seemed negative in any way, instead of, oh, I don't know, TAKING IT AS F*#KING CRITICISM?! That's reaching a whole new low people, don't get rid of it, LEARN FROM IT.  I'm actually WITH the community on this, they hate it, I hate it and I don't even PLAY THE DAMN GAME ANYMORE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, and I'm with the community on this.Ending = Why people actually defend this game anymore is seriously beyond me, I haven't touched it in months, will I come back to it?  F*%k if I know, at the rate they're going probably not, especially since it gets incredibly boring after a while, I might come back here and there, but not like I used to.  It's ridden with bugs, pointless DLC padding, and now this boIIocks, stay far away, maybe if they get their head out of their a$$ and bring out more free stuff instead of this garbage then maybe you should get it, but untill then, me, and even my friends that play it, advise you to stay away from this garbage.Fight for your games and how they should be made, why is this such a bad thing?  Quit letting developers run you, instead MAKE THEM do the game correctly, don't make people like Overkill turn into EA, push them back, demand MORE from them, not less, this is the reason this s*%t happens, fight against it!  Make this turn out like Deus Ex Mankind Divided, make them regret this stupid decision that they did, make them admit that they f*%ked this up.  Even though I don't enjoy the game anymore at all, I at least want the people that DO to have some respect from Overkill. Here Overkill, this is for you http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/635/465/29b.gifEdit: Their final day, and guess what they added, a jump animation.  Really? That's, it? It's not even client sided it's based off of other players, there is litterally, no difference.  That's your guys' BIG ending to this? A jumping animation? That does absolutely nothing? You people are a f**king disgrace.  So, I found this http://i.imgur.com/XtYVomn.png Let that just sink in a bit to show what little tw@'s they truly are.			"

												Payday 2 would be a much better game if its developers respected its audience. The game makes constant demands on its players for more money in the form of DLC which brings a noticeable power creep in, despite the fact that the game had made its money back in just pre-orders.It is a four-player co-op shooter that pits a team of four players against a swarm of AI-controlled police. If you're familiar with Left 4 Dead's model of swarms of weak enemies with a scattering of stronger enemies with special abilities, that's the model Payday 2 went with. As you level your character up though, you get new abilities, and you acquire new weapons to fight with.Mask customization is probably the highlight of the game, with there being an enormous collection of masks, materials for them to be ""made"" out of, patterns to put on them, and colors for those patterns to be. You can make some really fun stuff, play a lot, and never see anyone wearing not just the same mask you're wearing but any mask in your collection.That said, while anyone who finds fun in doing the same reasonable enjoyable missions over and over again will find some fun here, I cannot recommend the game.First off, for gameplay reasons: in Overkill, probably the most popular difficulty because lower difficulties are insultingly easy and the higher difficulty is really quite hard without good teamwork, the most common grunt enemy can only be hurt with headshots. If you're the kind of player who likes to optimize his gear, and the game gives you the tools to do that, there are only a few break points for damage against this enemy. What you'll end up doing is designing a weapon that can kill this enemy in two headshots while still being as accurate and stable in rapid-fire as possible (unless you go with a marksman rifle or a shotgun, in which case killing with a single headshot is easily attainable).This means that despite there being dozens of weapons in each category, you can easily narrow each category down to one or two ""best"" guns, and the others are only there if you're comfortable with using a weapon you know is weaker than what you can be using.Then, of course, there are the business practices of Overkill. The game was profitable based on pre-orders alone, and while free content and map packs are added, so is a lot of cheap cash-in DLC that often includes pay-to-win mechanics: at first you needed DLC to have grenades, now you need DLC to have the powerful molotov cocktails, and a separate DLC for the useful ninja stars. Do you want the best gun possible? Then you need to buy the mod pack DLC.Even content that was supposed to be free and given as a reward to the fans has seen money coming in for the game: John Wick was added to the game as a playable heister, supposedly as an announced reward for getting enough members into the community group but actually because he was being used as a paid advertisement for the movie he was in. Another heist features and is named after a real life musical performer.Most recently as a ""reward"" for completing challenges ahead of Crimefest, Payday 2 was given a crate/key system just like in CS:GO, where as a ""thanks"" to the community now a portion of your post-heist loot drops will only be usable if you spend real money on a ""drill"" to open it, where it will then give you a random weapon skin that, just like with the DLC, makes your weapon stronger.Is there fun to be had? Sure. But there are other games out there that are just as fun, but have developers who think of their players as more than just wallets. Go play one of them instead.			"

												MEGA EDIT a year later edition:So They set the Drills for free,now all the ""new"" safes are free to open,all the old ""one's"" still require to buy a drill to open.Today 30/05/16 Overkill pre-announced the update #100 for the game,basically they bought the game rights back from the publisher(505Games)and announced that the priced drills will be REMOVED for ALL the upcoming safes,this basically mean that the safes will keep dropping but that they will automatically be open for FREE,no more drills,you can still trade the skins but NO NEED to use drills to open the safes(all the ""old"" safes will still require a drill to be opened but they will remove the drop for them).Now this means they actually better now no more Overkill liars? kind of,they decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the PayDay 2 franchise,still tho as stated by Producer at overkill Here[www.twitch.tv] they said that ALL the MT's idea was an Overkill idea not a publisher one so yeah,nice commercial practices right there...Now that they said that they are gone(MT's),i still want to wait and see what times have to give us,they still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the game,still have to fix ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs here since the game beta,discutable DLC's quality to a too high price(for the content/quality)So as last statement i would say well done OVERKILL,for the roll back(still tho strange,first they say it's profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the Skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymore)keep doing this,but really now focus on providing some high quality content.My review will still remain negative until i don't see a even more step in the right direction,this is a start A GREAT START but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again.EDIT:couple days later edition:Just to be more clear,i think that is NOT all forgiven AT ALL,as i said up there's still ♥♥♥♥ ton of stuff to fix,feature promised since the release of the game still not released,discutable quality of the DLC's and lots of other stuff,oh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that ""force"" them to develop MT's well,maybe it's true,my opinion? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or max 50% true,what is sure is that Overkill agreed with the introduction of MT's,maybe they just did a nice marketing move now who knows,people think that after several months after the Black market update aka skins and MT's introduction the selling of them was dropping quite a few and they probably want to save the more they can and set them for free,so basically there's still a lot of stuff from Overkill to really prove that they sincerilly doing this because they want to get better.[""OLD"" review will remain here as reminder of what happened]As you can see from my hours on record,i'm a PayDay 2 veteran playing it since the beginning i loved this game/devs since the start lovelly idea's and a Developer different from the other one's,i saw a lot of things change,some were cool and fantastic,some less but Overkill software was always ready to listen to the player opinion and tweak the things they don't like and as always i was there enjoying the game,a Developer that actually listen to the user request/feedback is hard to find this days,that's one of the reason why Overkill WAS my favorite game Dev,some months ago they started releasing REALLY low quality and Buggy DLC at full price every month,the last one was the worst of all time(chyvarly DLC)and now at the time of this review,they introduced micro-transaction in the game,just to let you know they always said that they will NEVER introduce Micro-transaction in the game because they said they absolutly don't like that kind of things,and today they've done the exact opposite.EDIT:21/10/2015 In the day 6 of the crimefest they added a clearly rushed/last moment card drop called the Wolf Card that give's you a drill for free,nice move Overkill nice move,but it's not what we asked,the Micro-transaction have to leave FOREVER,they never was something to add to this game as Almir said at the game launch ""We’ve made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)"" this is someting that have to be removed,you lied to us Overkill,and that's what you got Tons of negative reviews and all this on the most big internet press around the world.EDIT:25/10/15 Worst crimefest ever,a fixfest i would call it for features that should be in the game since the beginning and bugfix as ""rewards"".The next time try harder and remove the micro-transaction.EDIT:07/11/15 ""Player seem to be loving it"" almir listo I'm not so sure about that Almir(currently at 76% on Steam,3.3 on Metacritic)The absolute disaster of the Almir AMA on redditAlmir dodging the question LIVE on Twitch[www.twitch.tv]EDIT:13/11/15 They ♥♥♥♥ed up the game even more now glad they(not) heard our feedback,introducing even more Pay2Win microtransaction(Random crew bonus at a price of half a dlc)and the not so surprising after all this mess COP reward a 1/25 Random skin with random specs after 6+ months of waiting G♥♥♥♥ingG overkill,even the moderators here on steam and on Reddit refuses to moderate the forum's again and support this madness.

												I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'd rather have Goldfarb as lead designer for Payday 2 again.I paid over 100 dollars for your DLC. I bought the pre-order pack, I played the beta. I bought all of your DLC, including several gift copies of PD:TH for friends. I bought both ♥♥♥♥ing hypetrain packs. All to support your little ""indie"" company. And now, you give us this...This. I can't stand by this Overkill. Crimefest was supposed to be about the community. And yet, you've given us a big middle finger and thrown pay 2 win features in our faces, showing us how little you care about the community, what with your ""EEH, THESE SUCKERS WILL BUY ANYTHING"" attitude. ♥♥♥♥ you, Overkill. ♥♥♥♥ you.

												Great game ruined because the devs are money ♥♥♥♥♥s. Weapon skins that give you better stats? CS:GO Syle crates? Overall its a decent game, but the devs have decided to screw over the community. They could have at LEAST not added stats to the skins. But nope, gotta get that money while ruining the game for the playerbase. GG guys, uninstalling.			"

EDIT: While the game has been reclaimed by the original developers without extra additions, it currently feels as if it's a dead horse, being beaten with the skin and DLC stick. This game is generally good, and has a plethora of user-created mods available to tint and color your experience in slaughtering endless hordes of cops.  But enough of the rose colored filter and let's get down and dirty with the biggest negatives of the game.1. The community is quite terrible for both online play and the fanboys supporting the developers for their shady business practices. You'll often find yourself being kicked from games for seemingly no apparent reason other than you're new and/or learning the game, or haven't tailored your character or put on the right mask for the host, who is apparently some incarnation of a god. Joining a friend usually solves this problem.2. Peer to Peer game hosting - You'll always be at the mercy of someone else if you don't host yourself, the game is liable to crashes, freezing, frequent desync issues, and random disconnects.3. The game has an infurating amount of DLC, and your performance compared to the players who do have the DLC is almost insulting. An example of this being the Gage Sniper Pack. Make no mistake, with this game you will have to PAY.4. A worrying trend with Overkill as of late is that they are pumping out a lot of content which generally has little to no effect on gameplay as a way of keeping the community temporarily satisfied, and occasionally bundling it up as DLC.  What was a boatload of hype with ""The Dentist"" and his final contract ended up in massive amounts of disappointment, with little more than a rushed environment and tons of video game references in ""The Golden Grin Casino Heist"".5. When Overkill does make content that affects gameplay, it is usually overkill (No pun intended) on how it's balanced- creating a scenario where you become the weak link in the chain if you don't use said items or skill builds.6. The nature of some of the DLC content has become Pay2Win, for instance - The Buzzer, a melee weapon from the latest Golden Grin Heist.  Using this melee weapon on any enemy character will stun them for a few moments including Special Police Units. This trivializes the danger of the units and undermines the actual teamwork needed to control the threats in harder difficulties.7. The game fosters an environment where you can tailor skill points to your play style, however you'll find yourself having to pick and take skills from every tree to manage both stealth and loud combat missions effectively.8. Stealth mechanics are acceptable in singleplayer, where a mis-step on your part can mean having to fight hordes of cops with little to no armor and silenced weapons.  However, multiply the risk of getting detected by 3 and then times that to a random number generator and you have multiplayer. The desync in this game creates a near impossible setup for players to effectively stealth together as AI detection and line of sight is managed by the host and not the client (who is usually just moments behind the host).What usually happens to be a fun and simple game to understand with friends becomes a mess of complexity when you throw in a toxic online community and hordes of DLC that will end up sucking both your wallet and satisfaction away.

												This was the best game i've ever played. But why it's now garbage.The amount of DLC'S that have been produced, 26! What the f***, it costs more then the game itself! Even when it was $50and the worst part is. $5 for a few masks, and some mostly terrible weapons that are just for looking cool. Sure, some are good, but still $5.00. I've had this game from the start, it was amazing despite all the bugs. But now it's basically become Clash Of Clans. I preordered this game, the least they could do is give us the seasons pass or a few free DLC'S for trusting their game. Also, $5.00 for a character. Seriously, now it's just $5.00 for a character soundtrack and skin. ALSO, the amount of hackers on this game is pathetic, seriously they need to stop it. Also, look at Payday: The Heist. It has 1 DLC.This has 26. Don't even get me started on $7.00 on a map, seriously it should be free, we paid for the game we should own the whole thing. The worst part is that there is other games (like Terraria) that have released sooooo many free updates without any dlc. And we get ""Old Hoxton"" and ""John Wick"" and we get 5 dissapointing maps.Do not buy this game, i'd urge you to download Clash Of Clans instead of this.			"

TLDR: With 505 Games gone and Overkill redeeming themselves wonderfully, it's time to put down the pitchfork and see where they take this game.  I'm hopeful for the future.--Payday 2 added microtransactions!Yeah!Overkill said they would never do it!Yeah!We should forgive them since Starbreeze/OVK pulled it out the moment they were allowed to!Yea-- Wait, what the f...Just hear me out for a moment, will ya?Payday 2 is a game you all have certainly heard of before, for better or for worse.  Years ago, at launch, it was ""barebones but fun with a lot of potential.""  Later, it was ""a friggin' masterpiece every PC gamer should own.""  Later-er, it was ""a good game but with questionable DLC policies.""  Finally, the later-est, it was ""A &#%^ing disgrace with developers breaking promises that nobody should buy.""  So, let's look at what exactly happened, shall we?Yesterday, Payday 2 celebrated its 100th update.  Starbreeze completely bought out the rights to Payday from 505, a company known for being a bit dodgy at times with its business practices, under the deal that they would receive 33% of the profits from Payday 3 (which was confirmed yesterday, get hyped) but no more than $40M.So what does this mean?  Well, it means Starbreeze and Overkill can do whatever they want with the game.THEY STARTED BY REMOVING MICROTRANSACTIONS ALTOGETHER AND MAKING THE BLACK MARKET FREE FOR EVERYONE. http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-05-31-payday-3-confirmed-payday-2-ditches-microtransactionsI can't stress how important this is.  NOBODY has done this in the past, EVER.  Payday is the very first example of a step back on microtransactions, and they deserve much more than forgiveness for 505's mistake; they deserve your RESPECT.From death threats to insults to slander, Almir was the beaten-down figurehead of a company taking the fall for a publisher's decision.  Did he take it personally?  Who knows?  If he did, I can't blame him, because we learned that fateful day in November that the Payday 'community' certainly had the potential to be completely vile.  Yet, Almir and the rest of Overkill's 75 developers, who have supported the game for four years of free and paid content under 505, have been apologizing to US and have finally given the means to reverse their mistake.  Let me just recount some instances of microtransactions for you: Killing Floor 2 has a trading market with microtransactions.  This game hasn't even left Early Accessthis review is outdated AF lol, and is already charging for weapon skins and character items with plenty of ""precious"" skins for <$200 on the market.Rise of the Tomb Raider, a $60 game, has over $300 in purchaseable content.Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 introduced microtransactions and loot to the CoD series for the first time. EDIT: Apparently AW had them as well, it was just wasn't ported over to PC.Overwatch, while launching at a reduced price of $40, has a loot-box system that offers lootboxes of cosmetics (normally obtained by one per level up) for $2 per 2 boxes or higher.  Items are non-tradeable, permanent, and non-purchaseable gold for items can be obtained from lootboxes, so this is one of the more fair systems.Most despicably, Valve themselves have THREE virtual markets; they have what is essentially gambling (but without excluding minors) for Team Fortress 2, CS:GO, and Dota 2.  Team Fortress has no rating on the store page and no age-gate, and Dota 2 is rated T.  No action is taken to stop a minor from wasting even hundreds on ""unboxing"" virtual crates for $2.50 per key.While Payday 2 had this gambling system I despise, it wasn't entirely of the developers' free will SPECULATION, and they have made a completely unprecedented move by pulling them.  In a way, I kind of view Overkill and Starbreeze above many other developers now.  It's really great to see something like this in the day and age where microtransactions are starting to just be tolerated.As for whether you should buy the game or not?  Well, it's Payday 2.  If you like smashing and grabbing things, like taking down lots of zombies with guns cop uniforms, like the feeling of crap in your pants when you hear a Cloaker flying across the room, and don't mind a bit of grinding as you schedule weekly appointments to smash down a mall's windows, then yes, Payday is a great game.  Friends not included, sadly.  This isn't even mentioning the various overhauls since the incidents above, such as the new Safe House with daily raids, and revamped mod support with auto-update capabilities.  PAYDAY is back!			"

												I've been playing this game since its beta, back then, the game used to have a lot of potential, It was a game I was excited for back in 2013.When Payday 2 was finally released, it was a broken, unpolished piece of software, the base content was alarmingly low and some of features announced before its release were nowhere to be found. However, the gunplay was a blast and the addition of skilltrees, mask/weapon customization and the card drop system kept the game interesting despite its lack of levels.At this date, the base game offers an acceptable amount of content for its price but still remain broken and unpolished.I would actually recommend the game if it wasn't for Overkill's behavior these past years.Of course there are the sheer amount overpriced DLCs and the microtransactions but that's only the tip of the iceberg.Back in 2014, Overkill hosted the first community event known as the Crimefest, where the community could be awarded free stuff by joining the community group. Reaching 3 millions members would unlock a the last reward which was a secret at the time. Unsurprisingly, the community thought that this last secret reward was going to be something awesome, so they started to gather everyone they could in order to reach that 3 Millions member mark.And then Overkill ruined everything when they revealed that the secret reward was the fact that they were going to use those 3 Millions of people to advertise a movie and later on the AlienWare Alpha and their own VR Googles and if you leave the group to avoid that kind of advertisement, you can kiss all the the free content released after the event goodbye.Not to mention some of the rewards unlocked were post-poned and released roughly one year later during the second Crimefest.A couple of month after that event, Overkill released 2 DLCs on the same day which started the trend of putting 2 DLCs on the storefront instead of regrouping all the extra content they made for Payday 2 into one single DLC in an attempt to squeeze as much money as they can from their playerbase.Then we got the second community event : The Hypetrain which is a Crimefest where the ""free"" rewards are unlocked with a set amount of hypefuel that can only be obtained by buying DLCs on the store. Two DLCs were introduced : The Overkill Pack and the Completely Overkill pack which were not related in any way as their name would suggest (The first being a simple weapon pack and the later being a 25$ ""support"" with 4 masks and a weapon skin ""crafted with love and care [...] A true Payday collectible"").I suppose Overkill thought it would be hilarious to confuse everyone.But this wasn't enough for Overkill, all the money they were already making wasn't even close to enough.Fast foward to the Road to Crimefest ; the third community event, Overkill came up with the neat idea of giving the community actual in-game challenges that would unlock the rewards upon completion. Once again, the community worked hard to overcome all the challenges and managed to unlock the final reward.And then Overkill once again ruined everything when they revealed that the final reward was in fact a microtransactions system à la CS:GO.""But it is not that bad because CS:GO and TF2 does the same thing and get away with it... Right?""Well, not really, TF2 is a Free-to-play where that kind of business model is expected while CS:GO may be a pay-to-play game but is updated on a regular basis and all the content added to the game beside weapon skins is free of charge.Meanwhile Payday 2 is not free-to-play, has those kind of microtransactions, is updated on a regular basis but the content added to the game may be paid DLCs. The microtransactions are there just to, again, squeeze as much money from the playerbase rather than support the developement of the game itself.I cannot think about this game without having a bitter taste in my mouth, Payday 2 could have been something much greater than a money extracting billboard meme-shooter if it wasn't for Overkill greed.The game is still great but Overkill is ruining it. Since all the money they are already making through microtransactions and DLC sales will never be enough, they will probably come up with something even more disgusting than the introduction of microtransactions in the future.

TLDR: The game is full of advertisements and unkept promises.The game was good, but not anymore. Overkill have shown great innovation in how to mess up a great game. I've played the game for nearly 1,000 hours, so I'm not someone just blindly hating, nor do I take any pleasure in giving, what used to be, my favourite game a negative review.-They fill it with advertisements, essentially turning it into a massive billboard and showing they have no care for the game itself, just the money it generates.A John Wick playable characterTwo Hotline Miami cross-promotionsA illogical heist based around a no name DJ with his face plastered throughout it and you are forced to listen to his music. The worst part? This advertisement costs $7USDAn Alienware promotion that was 2 masks and 1 melee which was built up for 3 days and the masks are only for people that own an Alienware Alpha, a $500 consoleA Speedrunners crosspromotion requiring you to own Speedrunners which took up a day during an event which was supposed to be full of free contentA mask to advertise a VR which Starbreeze had invested money intoA 30 day countdown which ended on Payday 2's 1 year anniversary, which was filled with references to characters and locations in the game's universe, to advertise a new game they would be developingA melee weapon from The Walking Dead-They promise a lot of content, some which was paid for, some which was earned through community accomplishments and some which was supposed to be free, yet they don't release any of it and constantly delay it whilst they release a large amount of DLC in between.Safehouse customisation was supposed to be a feature since the start of the game and was used as part of the game's advertisement, has still not been released almost 2 years later and shows no sign of it being released, they recently claimed they don't even know what it will beAn event which required the community to reach certain amount of members before October 2014 in order to unlock content has had much of it's content delayed including; FBI files, which have been delayed until at least 2016 and they have claimed to not know what it will be and a new enemy type, which is in the same situation as FBI files.The Completely Overkill pack was a $20 pack which was available for only a month and limited to 50,000 copies. It contained 4 masks, a secret item to be released at a later date and was supposed to be for Overkill's biggest supporters and they claimed it was not supposed to be a donation at all, they even passive-aggressively commented upon those who didn't buy it. After the pack was no longer refundable, they then announced that the secret item would actually be 25, but purchasers would only be able to obtain 1 out of those 25 items. It's now 4 months later and Overkill have insisted on keeping their biggest supporters in the dark, the only information they have given about these 25 items is that it is a part of a larger project and has no ETA at allThe infamy update, which was released in January 2014, was released unfinished. They delayed the remainder of it for over a year, despite it being the most requested update by the community, while releasing SIXTEEN paid DLCs in between. The reason for it being delayed for so long is because they wanted to make it as awesome as possible, but evidently that was not what happened. The update consisted of 8 masks and that's all.The Golden Grin Casino heist was promised to be released by the end of 2014, but they delayed it. It's now being released nearly 7 months later after being palmed off to another company, though at least since they sent it off to another company, it will have less of a chance of being a bad heist. Since the Casino was announced, they have released a large amount of other updates.There were supposed to be balancing for the new Swat Van Enemy, this was promised 3 months ago and there has been absolutely no indication of there being any changes.Check the comments to this review for more.

The response was always: ""but the models are too low res"" (Which is now invalid since it's clear they could've fixed that at any time.) or ""You can already do that in goon mod"" (But only you see it, so also invalid)The other problem is the stats tagged onto them when they just nerfed a bunch of guns. They gimped weapons and are now selling them back to us.We worked to unlock this for free with the understanding that anything we didn't unlock would be paid. If we didn't get that goal would it have been dlc? No. All the goals were guaranteed to be unlocked from the start. Just like last crimefest with wick. A guise to build hype for the playbase. (I didn't mind wick but the means by which he was given to us was crap).The game has a ton of DLC already. I've spent like 200$ on this game.Skins can be for DLC weapons that you don't own.This game isn't in the proper genre nor do it's mechanics support this system. You're not expressing your style with these skins like you do with your gun mods or mask or build. This one element contradicts the rest of the game's design fundamentals.I've bought every dlc up to this point and always looked forward to more but now I regret all of that. I don't even want to play anymore, I'm just disgusted by this whole thing.The player count was dead today. Nobody wanted to play this. They need to revert this. I don't even think it should have crates at all. I wish we could just get the gun customization we've always wanted. They just proved it's possible and now it's even more aggravating.			"

												Once upon a time I heartily recommended this game to all my friends, and anyone else who would listen.Overkill have now implemented microtransactions into retail game. Regardless of how 'cheap' the game gets, unless it is free to play, this is not okay.Don't touch this game with a stick until the issue is rectified.			"

												Solid game, but why they put microtransactions in such a moddable game when they specifically said they wouldn't is beyond me. I can mod my gun anyway. all they are for is to show off how much better you are than everyone else and pay for stats (AKA ""Pay to Win"") a poor choice.			"

												After 24 installments of DLC, Overkill has finally gotten tired of waiting for their monthly cash installments, and has decided to reach for the brass ring. Taking a page out of Valves book, users are now free to shell out $2.50 a pop for brand new Drills to open the shiny new skin safes! Just what Payday 2 needed on top of it's $100+ worth of DLC, Skin Gambling! Did I forget to mention they actually improve the stats on the weapon? Hell yeah, ♥♥♥♥♥es.			"

												Crimefest is close. Free rewards for the community since they finished challenges given by overkill during the last few weeks.Now Crimefest is here. The first reward is revealed and it is....a treasure/chest/crate system with Skins ala Team Fortress 2 and Counterstrike: Global Offensive.I liked Payday 1, i liked Payday 2. I might not have alot of hours put into the games, but it was a nice game to get back on once in a while and Crimefest was the perfect opportunity to get back in now.After seeing the First Day Update of skins that BOOST stats of the weapons and the gambling mechanic, which costs as much as a key in TF2 or CS:GO, i deinstalled and im never going to look back.Overkill lied to us when they promised ""free"" rewards and they lied to us when they said a few years ago: ""PD2 will never have micro-transactions"". It's a damn shame what is happening right now			"

												Game used to be fun. Not anymore. Pointless grinding and the money-making policies of Overkill ruined it.Aside from 200$ and more in DLC with overpowered weapons and weapon classes people with the vanilla version have no access to (e.g. RPG, any sniper rifle, any LMG, grenades), Overkill introduced a crate system similar to CS:GO, Dota 2 oder TF2.This was ""rewarded"" to the community for completing challenges set by Overkill for the annual Crimefest.Payday 2 is nothing but a money grab for the developers. They don't care about their players at all unless they critisize Overkill in which case they will be banned from the forums and their posts deleted.This game is a rip-off similar to ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" and the like.

												The game was great, but instead of fixing important bugs and fulfilling their promises they decide to pump out more and more DLC for ridiculous prices. With two more years of DLC cash grab coming up I no longer have faith in this game. Yes, DLC is optional but the game without DLC is rather limited and not worth it's money. The insane amount of DLC also creates a large disparity between players where you have people who have to play with a pistol and a rifle and those who run around with rockets launchers and miniguns. You get kicked from games because you don't have the right DLC related mask or weapon and hosting your own missions is out of the question unless you're willing to spend huge amounts of money on buying the required DLC. This sort of DLC policies ruin the gaming industry and based on all this I simply can't recommend the game.And now they added microtransactions in what was supposed to be a period of free updates (crimefest). This only adds to my earlier frustration and only confirms my earlier message.			"

												So this is my review after 1856 hours of Payday 2; been a fan of the franchise since PDTH.Please keep in mind that i'm german and english is not my native language.We've been let down and were lied to quite a lot by Overkill Software for the past few years, since the release of Payday 2.Some of the bugs which have existed since release and the absolutely horrible netcode with all the desync have never been looked into despite the fact that they were mentioned and complained about quite a lot within the community forums. Yes, i'm aware of the fact that desync is basically the way the engine handles lag but it's not normal to lag behind for 10 seconds or so while in any regular game you're probably having a ping of 300-400 ms connecting to anyone across the world. Not to mention the issues it will get you into. Things like getting tazed by Tazers which you can't even see on your screen or cloakers running and pouncing through walls / being stuck in the same spot for a while instead of actually moving and chasing the player actively when they are meant to.Another example would be the Hotline Miami heist which causes framedrops for quite a few players. Almir briefly mentioned that they were going to look into it but nothing ever happened.Guess what? Same thing with the Infamy 2.0 update which was promised to be more than just cosmetics. It contains nothing but masks and EXP boosts which makes it look like it was rushed after the community complained a lot about the non existent release of Infamy 2.0 on the forums. Almir said they were going to look into it ""once the dust settled"" and we haven't heard anything about it ever since.The release of DLCs just kept getting worse. We're getting new bugs with every DLC which are partially claimed to be features instead of fixing them like the Molotovs which used to take down the armor of Swat Turrets instantly if you were the host of the game and only then. It has been (ab)used for cross promotion (e.g. John Wick, Hotline Miami, Speedrunners, Humble Bundle, Chivalry Medieval Warfare etc.), becoming more expensive and frequent while having less content which also got worse in terms of quality and balancing with each DLC . The optimization of the latest DLC map releases have been an issue as well causing many players to have stutters and framedrops even with relatively high end rigs like mine.We also had a DLC called ""The completely Overkill pack"" which was a time limited offer and thought of as a donation: it included 4 masks as well as a secret ingame item which has yet to be released.The Game of the Year edition contains 16 of 27 paid DLCs for Payday 2 right now. Do not get fooled by the fact that they added free DLC releases to the cart.They used the Payday 2 forums to tease us for 35 days straight with content which does not even belong to the game itself, as it was revealed afterwards. All of the content is tied to another game which was not going to be released for at least another 2 years (Overkills The Walking Dead).There was a Hype Train event which basically forced us to buy DLCs for fuel to complete all of the goals which turned out to be just another cross promotion. One of the goals was a tournament which was supposed to have a price of $250000. It is still unknown what the tournament is or was, who participated and who actually won these $250000.Safehouse customization -a feature which has been promised to be included for the release of the game- still hasn't made it into the game 2 years after the release of Payday 2.For the first Crimefest we were promised a new enemy and FBI Files which took them an entire year to develope. They were released shortly before the second Crimefest was announced. The new enemy is underwhelming even though he comes with interesting and unique mechanics. The FBI Files are basically the same thing that PD2Stats used to be; the website of PD2Stats was shut down thanks to that. I'd like you to take a look at the PD2Stats[www.pd2stats.com] site to read the story about all of this yourself now.The latest addition of Overkill Software at day 1 of the second Crimefest -which is celebrating the fourth birthday of the Payday franchise- are microtransactions. Almir himself as well as David Goldfarb said that there would NEVER be any microtransactions in Payday 2 in the past.Proof:Proof #1Proof #2Proof #3[www.gamespot.com]The community has been working hard for 16 days to finish challenges and unlock content which was promised to be free for everyone during the Crimefest itself.They basically added the exact same system that can be found in Counter-Strike:Global Offensive from the colour of the quality of the weapons to the weapon inspection animation itself. Some of these skins will even change the stats of the weapons. Apparently they are coming together with a pre defined set of weapon mods which can not be changed or replaced.The Safe drops will replace your regular card drops which are supposed to get you weapon mods, masks, materials, colours and patterns. These Safes might even contain skins for DLC weapons you do NOT own.A single drill costs 2,49€ right now which is about half of the cash you would spend on most DLCs if they are not on sale (4,99€) and twice as much as they cost right now with a discount of 75% (1,24€).All of this led most of the veteran players to quit playing or even delete the entire game, as well as forum Mods censoring / deleting entire threads which were written and discussed in a civilized manner just as the mods asked for.They even openly admit that they're actively censoring the forums. ProofPersonally I don't feel like a game which costs about 20€ and comes with additional DLC worth about 110€ should be using any microtransaction system at all; the DLCs are more than enough as it is. Yes i've bought almost all of the DLCs for the full price including the Completely Overkill Pack except for the last 2 or so.They disabled the LUA hook which is required to run certain mods at day 1 of the second Crimefest too. Whether or not it's related to some mods crashing the game once it gets updated or the fact that some mods are skins / give us an ability to ""create"" skins like GoonMod is up to you and your conspiracy theories. My very own mod_override skins for the Black and Skull Dozer are still working however.			"

												Time for a serious review after all the 3k playtime hours jokes*Last updated 17/11/15*CONS:-After crimefest 2015 Overkill has added microtransactions into the game and completely ruined the playerbase with Crates, Skins and a bunch of other crap. The game is now completely Pay2Win and none of the 'Free' fun is in it.And paid skins actually give you an advantage. yay.Not to mention 2 years ago they promised to never ever add microtransactions and then hoped people would forget a few years later and back stab them. shame on you overkill!-Short repetitive maps with small objectives, most maps are just drilling, getting cash and going to the escape zone.Only a few maps are low with lots of objectives and loud action such as Hotline Miami, but those aren't a lot of maps.Most maps are just small with not many verities, most missions require you to camp at a small place and fight through waves of cops. compared to PAYDAY: The Heist where everything is open with lots of objectives and places to look through.-A 2 years old game that hasn't been optimized since the release, the players have to trust and struggle with mods in order to get a playable FPS in game. And of course the latest maps they released, received a crap ton of complains about low FPS because the maps are so huge and their game is so poorly optimized.-The textures are so rubbish that modders have to make HD mods so you could enjoy something rather than 1024 textures of your character model or NPC's dropped weapons (etc)Sometimes i stand in a corner and see pixels on the floor trying to look like a pepsi can and other trash.-AI is literally useless in this game, all they do is follow you and help you up.Nothing else, absolutely nothing. so Multiplayer co-op is the main focus of this game, offline isn't as enjoyable as online.-Apparently DLC releases are more important than bug fixesThe game has a shit ton of bugs that haven't been fixed since the release.-If you want to actually enjoy the game and advance most your weapons to be Death Wish compatible you will need to purchase a few of the DLCs, or else its nearly impossible for a beginner.If you don't pay, you are simply underpowered. Thank god there's no PvP.Although its nice that paying for DLC isnt a must to play a certain map.(Seriously RPG, Nade launchers and Flame throwers are great)-A community based off most players farming their infamy ranks on SR or HB and considering themselves pros and kicking everyone under the level Infamy 5 from their lobbies and considering themselves as Godlike heisters.No one actually cares about the heist plan, your role or the in game objectives.All they care is that medic or ammo bag you bring to the heist to supply them.-Over 2 years old free promised content hasn't been released until this very day.-Most lobbies are too mainstream that its simply hard to find something different these days, like a loud Bank Heist or a Heli escape on Big Bank (you get the point).-Developers listen to the community yet they are too bitchy to invest in a Workshop or a proper freaking in game AntiCheat.-Infamy ranks are not as satisfying as you might think, they're actually easy to grind and a shit that isn't rewarding.PROS:+Cheap DLCs (recently also got a price drop)+Monthly updates (DLC fun)+Not a lot but enough free content from time to time to keep the Helmets Flying+Mod support but they won't bother investing a workshop so we stop paying for sites to save mods+4 and maybe more years of in game content support (2 more years of dlc and free content)+A somewhat ""Okay"" plot in the background of the PAYDAY gang and Hoxton's betrayal.+Wide variety of weapons, masks, modifications and so on.+A somewhat balanced skills and perks system yet still buggy at some points.I wrote a lot larger review than this but steam didn't let me post this because i wrote too much.Anyways, i will clearly keep playing this game. i don't dislike it but i experienced and saw way too much in game to know that this game isn't something a new player would enjoy.I would personally uninstall and ask for a refund if i tried to join lobbies 10 times in a row and some infamy trashy decides to kick me instead of giving me tips or helping me out.Also, this is not a DLC complain post, i own them all and will probably own future ones as well.No flame no hate, i love Almir and the other developers but you can't force the whole community to behave and stop being as cocky as Hoxton is to Houston.edit: Yes, know my English is absolute MINT.

												I used to love this game and I would play it almost every day.  However, with the recent update adding skins with stat boosts that can only be obtained through microtransactions, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  The game was already leaning towards Pay2Win with all the DLC that added weapons that were superior to the vanilla weapons, but the game was still amazing and fun without any DLC.  Sadly Overkill has given up and they aren't even trying to hide the fact that the game is Pay2Win anymore.  So it's up to you of you want to buy this game, but I would not recommend it.  What used to be fun has now become a mess of microtransactions.			"

Rating: 5/10Do I recommend it?: Sadly, no. Pick it up on a sale if you love the PAYDAY franchise.This game is pretty much a prime example how a good game can turn bad by poor decisions done from the developers.My Personal Thoughts:I loved this game, played for 2189 hours. I even played after the Microtransactions disaster, even though it was a ""♥♥♥♥ you"" from OVERKILL themselves.It's tough for all of you PAYDAY fans out there to admit it, but this game has changed. Whether the changes you feel are good or not, the game has deviated WAY TOO MUCH from the base game at release. Sure, more content is good, but this game isn't a serious heisting game that it's advertised as by OVERKILL. I would go as far as to say that it's false advertising at this point, far fetched, yes; however, I'm exaggerating to state my point here.Lack of Vital Updates, DLCs Added That Should Have Been in the Base Game:OVERKILL's still making updates that should have never been waiting for this long to implement, like graphics changes. Seriously, OVERKILL hasn't even added half the advanced graphics options until late 2015, and throughout 2016. Or how about making flashbangs less cheap until they made them more bareable as of December of 2016 when people complained about this 2 YEARS BEFORE ON THE FORUMS?On top of that, Goat Simulator, makes this game feel like more of a joke rather than a serious game. The amount of DLC for this game makes this game really show that the base game itself is lacking content at release and that OVERKILL could have put more time into this game to make it feel more polished. Another good example is the Gage Courier Mod DLC, it adds attachments that should have been added into the game, you're pretty much needing this DLC to make base weapons perform on par to the higher difficulties, like Mayhem or higher. OVERKILL is still making DLCs for mods that should have already been in the game. There's no excuse to not include this stuff, especially since this is considered a Triple A title. This is just OVERKILL being lazy on their part to deliver content that was needed at release in the base game, and them deciding to have us to wait for a free update/pay money in this game is not a good business decision, AT ALL.Poor Balancing:This how a powercreep happens, and this has existed since 2014. This powercreep of buffing and buffing made difficulties more artificial than actual difficulties. We wouldn't need One Down to exist if OVERKILL decided to lay off the buff button. Difficulties, like One Down, are not enjoyable because of the stupidly high HP and damage. This is what makes this game's difficulty bland and not stand out. OVERKILL, you need to go back and take a look towards PAYDAY: The Heist. PD:TH is arguably MUCH, MUCH more fun, and the difficulties are hard; but, they're not unfair and broken.Difficulties have Bullet Spongy Enemies:I feel I have to dive into this as well because these difficulties depend on how well the game is balanced, and it dictates whether the game is enjoyable or not.Bullet spongy enemies, oh yes. This game used to have reasonable HP levels. Now enemies got their HP buffed on all difficulties, and they're too high. Although they're not noticable on OVERKILL and lower, Mayhem and above start to show that it takes quite a bit of rounds to kill off even basic enemies. This is not fun, nor is it balanced. I played exclusively One Down until I wrote this review, and the low end weapons do not work alone unless you spend every skill point into improving your weapon damage. Bullet spongy cops aren't what this game once was, neither is it remotely fun.Sloppy, Dumb AI:This is one of the core reasons that makes OVERKILL make enemies have high HP on higher difficulties and stupid high damage on One Down. The AI is really slow at targeting you, even on a good PC. This is worsened if your PC is slow, or you have very high ping. The AI in PD:TH is much better, and OVERKILL needs to focus more on making the AI smarter, and have the police work together. Specials should be working with normal units, enemies need to flank better, and they should work in bigger groups. Not just sending in 1 or 2 cops into a room.Poor Optimization:I run an AMD FX-6100, with an NVidia EVGA GeForce GTX 750 Ti FTW.This has plagued a ton of players in the last couple years, poor performance across most PCs. I struggle to run The Diamond at 60 FPS without using mods to improve FPS. This is in no way my fault, according to what PAYDAY 2 requires, I'm well above what OVERKILL recommends. Yet, I still get bad FPS, and there's people out there with much better hardware than mine reporting bad FPS on the forums. If there's anything OVERKILL needs to focus on heavily for 2017, it's optimization.Desync, Crashing, and Bugs:Needs to be fixed, all of this is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and I don't see why OVERKILL even tries to make excuses anymore. They pretty much focus on new DLC over the real issues, no one should be supporting this. Desync allows downed players to appear somewhere they're not. Crashing just happens at random, even without mods. Bugs, like enemies sticking into walls and sometimes the AI even just breaking and causing crashing is not acceptable. This game is very broken for it being advertised as finished, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S A ♥♥♥♥ING TRIPLE A TITLE. REALLY, OVERKILL?Conclusion:That's my critical review of PAYDAY 2. I can only recommend this game to those who like PAYDAY 2. If you're thinking that this game is what the store page is, you're very mistaken. I recommend you stay away until changes are made.As someone who loved and played this game for years, it's rather disappointing to see the changes OVERKILL's done to the difficulty. It's pretty much a slap in the face for everyone to have OVERKILL make such bad changes.Just buy PD:TH if you want a heisting game that focuses on gameplay. This game is more focused on giving out more content either through paid DLC, or free DLC.			"

												Yeah, Payday is fun.Although, here are some things about it which I think deserve criticism.1) The game has TOO MUCH Paid DLC.Say to own the game, and to buy every piece of dlc you can it will cost around; $182.61 USD. ($239.52 AUD)2) The game doesn't recieve many bug fixes or patches, they usually just come around in huge updates. As an example, say there was a bug to walk out of the Harvest and Trustee maps, report it to the devs and the update won't come out until a huge patch with some other things like DLC, Other bug fixes/patches, or just general big updates.3) No facial animations for characters. Yes I know, the game is from 2013, But it deserves facial animations. It's really boring to say, goto the safe house and talk to someone like Bonnie and watch her have no facial animations.I've played this game for over 160 hours, do I enjoy it? Yeah. Would I recommend it? Maybe. It depends if you want to spend your life savings on DLC (or Game of the year), Otherwise I'd wait for PAYDAY 3 (Which will hopefully be coming soon.) Thanks for reading my review.edit: holy s h i t 28 people have read this review thank you for taking the time to actually read this!Edit 2: Someone said some stuff, so I'll add it.4) There's massive grinds for achievement masks, guns, slots for weapons, infamy, etc.5) The game needs more free DLC updates.6)  The facial animations are just a preference. I understand it would be a bit hard to lip sync and the only time you hear them speak is usually in the middle of a heist, wearing a mask, or at the safe house.7) The Safe and Drills. Yes, drills were removed in update 100, but some safes still require a drill such as; The Sydney Safe, Community Safe 1 & 2, Houston Hoxton Dallas Wolf and Chains, and some others I don't remember.Edit 3 (I don't remember anymore how many times I've gone to edit this):Free DLC: Yes, OVERKILL and Starbreeze need the money but seriously, Atleast have some more events like Spring break and Hostons house warming party.Safes: My mistake, I didn't know that the safes that would've required a drill didn't if obtained after update 100, as I never found any of them.And to all those giving me criticism, thank you. I appreciate it.Edit 4 or 5: Characters aren't that important, while they add the perk decks (that are usually useful) they arent needed.DLC Goes on sale every month or so, And the high price all you need to do is pick and choose.You can join other peoples DLC heists, yes I know.From now on, I'm going to stop editing this. thanks for the criticismSydney best character			"

												I can't recommend this game. Despite the amount of hours I've put into it, I simply can't recommend a game that's slowly deteriorated to the point that it's more of a chore than a joy to play.When I first got my paws on this game, it was back when there were only a couple of DLC packs, where 'infamy' wasn't a thing to prove your worth, and where players were actually more creative and dared to try new ways of completing heists rather than just repeating the structured meta that they believe they must abide by at all costs. Now Overkill promise us 2 more years of ""supporting"" the game, which in their language means to churn out more DLC weapon packs instead of new and inventive missions. Not that it makes the slightest of difference in the rare times that they do add extra content, as lobbies only ever consist of the same mission repeated over and over that gains them high exp (case/s in point; Hoxton Breakout and Shadow Raid). So I start with my first major issue; the community is mostly full of pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. With a minor amount of exceptions, high infamy players think they're the ♥♥♥♥. If they're not trying to order around the lower/none infamy players, they're kicking them from matches instantly, practically defeating the whole objective of helping them to learn how to play. Bare in mind, 'infamy' means nothing in this game, at least not how it used to (when infamy only hit 5). It doesn't prove how much experience you have at the game, it doesn't make you any stronger or makes you any wiser. It's just simply for those who are bored of sticking to level 100, and want to repeat it all over again to collect infamous masks and recieve exp faster. What's more ironic is that most of these high and mighty players have only gained their ranks through repeating the same mission over and over until they're given exp penalties and/or their brains turn to mush, which would explain a lot about their attitude. Either way, they have no room to mock others for learning missions when they're only accustomed to one or two missions themselves.And I wouldn't make an issue out of this and call it a con to the game if it didn't happen as often as it does, but you will experience this... a lot. If you're new, just try to stick to players around your level if you want to avoid being patronised.So unless you've got a handful of friends to play this with, most of your playtime here will be spent browsing for servers via 'Crime.net' trying to find something other than the tedious Hoxton Breakout mission, only to join a server and either get kicked for some bizarre reason or lose connection to the host.Furthermore, the game just seems to have lost of lot of its initial sense of cooperating as a team. If only for helping to take down enemies in the waves of loud missions, nobody really needs to work together with players anymore. Nobody is really assigned to a specific role, nobody really cares what your priorities ingame are, just so long as you bring them some extra ammo and health kits. It can literally be a one man job if the player has a good idea on what he's doing, especially when it comes to completing missions in stealth, which are usually better off alone due to desync issues and ridiculous random glitches that often occur.In the times that you do actually get into a full party match with random players, nobody ever wants to think outside of the box. Everybody has a strict and structured way of playing each and every map, despite the fact that the game implements a 'random number generator' system to change your experience each time you play a heist. Heck, if you dare to open the door to stairs in Hoxton Breakout, prepare to be called a noob for not using it on a shutter door or the damn armory. Or if you want to just play 'Bank Heist' in loud for once, the public won't be happy and normally quit immediately.This is down to the community and the game itself. Heists aren't as free and open as they'd fool you into believing. Sure, you can choose to play most missions loud or stealth, but once you make the decision between the two, then you stick to the same objectives. Nothing ever truly random happens, such as random last minute objectives or a change in plan. The closest thing you get to that is the pre-planning stage before a heist, in which you choose your escape plan and place a few packs of ammo to make your life easier. If you're lucky, your pickup helicopter might land on the other side of the map. Whoopie. They even allow you to draw in the pre-planning stage, which is just completely pointless, as nobody ever really plans their heists out. Most stealth heists just end up in a game of trial and error.So the remaining issues I have with the game. - It's been out long enough, yet the devs just haven't really given players enough options to optimise their game to their liking. Not a major issue, but still a pain that players have to use user made mods if they want to improve their performance.- None of the missions are long enough, and/or are just repetitive and tedious. Most loud missions are just placing a drill and surviving waves of enemies until the drill is complete, and then throwing bags of money around. Stealth missions are pretty much the same, minus waiting around for drill but instead having to avoid the line of sight of guards that somehow have the ability to walk through walls when the game decides to have a glitchy moment.- The card drop feature in order to gain masks and weapon attachments is just another reason the game is more of a chore. It's also the perfect excuse for Overkill to sell you their 'mod pack' DLC or other weapon DLC to speed up the process of finding those much needed attachments for your weapon/s.- You're literally paying for achievements with some of the DLC. Yes, despite the fact that you've paid £3.99 for a pack, you will be unable to use all of its content until you've completed the required achievements.- Unless you're buying DLC, most of the free weapons are underpowered in comparison, further forcing you to buy the DLC if you want the most from this game and to be on par with the other DLC paying players. Hell, anything that Overkill do give you for free is still underpowered or weak in content compared to the DLC.- It would seem DLC is a priority over fixing game issues and errors. I mean sure they eventually get around to fixing those issues, along with the release of another DLC pack.So in conclusion, I guess you might consider it unfair to judge a game mainly by its community. But it's thanks to the game itself that the community is set out how it is. The game relies on a good community, but fails to support it. The game is currently in a state leaving the players with nothing more to do than grind for exp or test out new DLC weapon packs. And it's the repetitive and tedious missions that leave you with these only options. And I mean 'repetitive'. There's literally 4 missions of the same 'Bank Heist' which is just the same mission with different items to throw in bags, yet these are considered ""unique"" from each other.In the beginning, the game really felt like something new and different. New ideas promised, (which have since been ""put on hold"") and the players actually seemed to play for the fun rather than the rank beside their username. Now it just feels like the developers don't know where else to take the game. They won't give us a Steam workshop, yet will release new weapon packs often. They leave it to modders to create unstable LUA mod to help improve their game experience and fix issues the devs are fully aware of, rather than fix these issues themselves.So up to this point, until they decide to actually improve the game, quit with the DLC priority and help the players have a better experience, I simply can't recommend it.So here's to 2 more years of nothing but weapon pack DLC, and a whole lotta unfixed bugs.

												A review in the form of a heartfelt open letter to Overkill.Dear Overkill Software,You don't know me, nor do you care to know me. But you know my money, and you took quite a lot of it without returning anything of reasonable value. I bought your game back when it was in beta testing. You know, when you promised us alpha and beta players we where only playing 1/3rd of the game? And that pre-orders would get all future content for free?I cringed when you lied about us only playing 1/3rd of the game in beta. All you did was unlock our levels to level past 30. And gave us 1 tiny heist that was identical to the smallest map you had already. Only this one was so quickly done that it literally could be run in just 43 seconds or less.I moaned when you started releasing DLC heists rather than adding to the free ones you had promised us. I even b*tched when you only gave us pre-order alpha and beta players a single $5 DLC for our investment into the game's future.But the thing that made me stop playing was not any one thing, It was everything. Your total disregard for your consumers has lead me and all of my friends, of which there where a sizable few, to not touch your game in years. The last heist I did willingly for fun was Shadow Raid for point of fact. Back when it was freshly released not even a week old.A friend who was new to the game was given a free copy of all of your DLCs and in turn bought me the few i needed to be current. We did the Hoxton break out as it was new, and again, I noticed you where pushing buttons and calling shots that made no sense except to force players to play your game more, and pay you more money. As it was, i had to do asanine and repetitive things like get 20 zipline head shots with a bolt action sniper that had no scope to get said scope. None of which was fun and only served to force me to play in a way that was both counter productive to the team, and left me without a usable weapon as this was the new meta sniper at the time.That is only one example of how you'd turned this game into DLC Quest. And what of your lies that pile upon this? We where promised things to do with our off shore money, and even before release we where told the main game had safe house customization.Nothing ever came in the time I played. Nothing of reason or value. And as to my knowing safe house customization is still not in the game, but I could be wrong. The point of fact here is that both of these things where promised within the first 2 months of release or even -AT- release in the case of safe house customization. But they where blatant lies designed to get our money.I may well be crucified by your blinded masses of hysterical followers for posting this, but the message will be clear regardless. After spending nearly 100$ in this game, I still don't have all of the DLCs, nor do I want them at the rate you're going.You're not getting a penny more from me, nor my friends who use to enjoy this game. And that pains me as it was one of the most fun games of recent memory, even competing with Skyrim, and trumping Overwatch for the shear fun. But if I have to keep paying for your DLCs to stay in current content. If I have to do asinine, borderline moronic, achievements for critical items. If I have to be force fed lie after lie, I do not want to play your game. Nor will I play the next. When Payday 3 comes out. There had best not be any DLC for the first 6 months. You owe us that much. The first 6 months should be free content as you'd promised us we'd get this time but lied to us about. I and those i played with will not be buying 3 if there is any DLC in the first 6 months.Money talks. You built a game a bout stealing it, and in the process stole mine. It's time to put your theft where it should be, in the game not in reality.Yours truly,A very disappointed, and spurned fan.PS: Even having spent at or arround $120 on this game, and owning over half the DLCs it would still take another $90 to buy all the current DLC I dont own. Buyer beware, they will nickle and dime you to death.PPS: I'd like to iterate that payed DLC is not a bad thing. It’s the content and quality Vs price margien i'm upset with, a well as frequency of paid Vs free DLC. The main issue is in fact the lying about what preorders and the like would be getting. Had guns and missions been packed together more frequently resulting in about half as many DLC, I'd likely have bought more DLC and played longer as a genuine truth. Had all Missions been Free and guins been the only DLC, i'd likely have been able to pick and choose what i want, or need in the case of meta weapons, easier. Or had all guns been free and missions been the only payed DLC i'd likely have been less happy with that than any other option but it’s still preferred to what you’re doing now.(Edit/Update: After reviewing my account histroy I have revised the numbers on costs. All financial cost is now factual, and nolonger rough approximations based on memory.)			"

												When PayDay 2 was released it was so much fun to play, there was no other game like it and had a really good developement team who would update it a lot and for free and this now annoys me to rate it negative because I used to play this game a lot and enjoy every second of it.but after about 6 months the game just kept getting worse and worse as the developers started trying to milk money from this game by adding tons of pointless DLC which barely contain anything and are priced at £3.99 each which is a lot considering that you basically get 4 masks, 4 new melee weapons (which are basically pointless), a few paintjobs and a new gun, the game is also extremely repetitive after a while, most of the maps are pretty small if they are Non-DLC and have a boring set up as they basically just move a keycard or close a door whenever you play it again, there are a lot of weapons in this game which is really good as there is a huge variety and a good weapon modding system but this gets quite annoying as the mod you want for a gun is so hard to get as you can only get one drop from a heist and most of the time it's just an annoying paint for a mask which you don't want. the last time I played this game a lot of hackers were in it and they just ruined the game because they were either there to troll you and ruin your stealth or spam the map with loads of money bags which just crash your game, another annoying thing is when your trying to stealth and some troll joins your game throws a grenade or shoots and alerts you and leaves straight away, I know you can avoid this by having private heists but most of the time your going to want to play with other people as it's easier and more fun.So I would have recommended this game at the release but because of the devs being greedy and the community being annoying I cant recommend it.

												Overkill are untrustworthy. Several representatives of Overkill claimed that Payday 2 would not include micro-transactions. One such represenative said that it would ""never"" happen. And yet, they implemented micro-transactions as part of the ""free"" Crimefest II update. Moral of story: Never buy Overkill products and never trust their word for it is worthless.Furthermore, independent sources claim that Overkill have taken an axe to the modding community in the same update, even mods ""approved"" by Overkill such as HoxHud, by supposedly removing the LUA Hook required to make mods work. If true, such is certainly not the way to thank a community for their dedication to improving a game over a prolonged period of time.Finally, that Overkill would have the effrontery to do both of the above things as a ""reward"" for completing community challenges in the Road To Crime Fest Event shows complete and utter contempt for the Payday 2 community. Keeping in mind that the Road to Crime Fest Event is all about celebrating the anniversary of Payday: The Heist - which is ironically micro-transaction free. Clearly Overkill have grown fat on the profits of their hit DLC train known as Payday 2, I say that because every employee at Overkill must be on acid for them to collectively conclude that this was the right way and right time to implement something that they'd previously stated they'd never do.Yes, micro-transactions and the removal of modding capability is exactly what this game needed - Clearly...Sources: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=34451580&postcount=1http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/ "

												I've put in well over a thousand hours into this game at this point but a lot of those hours were ruined by hackers that Overkill has still done nothing about. The DLC power creep is enormous at this point and now they've introduced microtransactions despite promising they would never do it. I'm sick of putting up with so much lazy garbage for a game that should be way more enjoyable.			"

												I tried, Overkill, I really did. You didn't fix known bugs because you were too busy adding new DLC, and new enemies that were unfair WITHOUT DLC, and I tried to ignore it. I loved this game, I really did, and I played it to virtually no end, even at one point abandoning Team Fortress 2 for it. ""Weapon packs"" that contribute nothing just kept pouring in and in and in, with nothing useful to add, just one gimmick weapon to grab people's attention in the hopes that they'd buy the ""Wacky"" item, and I tried to ignore it. I got over the fact you never bothered programming Cloakers properly, and that they're happy to kick you from the ground floor on Rats whilst you're on the roof if they can't think of a way to path to you. Desync was never so much as acknowledged after an initial ""Patch"" that vaguely improved it whilst drop-in joining, even though a community mod (PocoHUD) addresses the issue perfectly well, and I got over it. Refusal to add limb hitboxes because they'd be ""Too much unnecessary work"" when one man took one afternoon off and implemented them himself was pushing it, but I STILL got over it. Your treatment of loyal fans on Twitter, e.g. the fan who called you out for not caring about the console version and got the response of ""IF I LOVED A GAME ID BUY IT ON PC"" (As though anyone would care enough to buy this mess after that sort of treatment) I resented, but I played on regardless. The Hype Train, a pay-to-enter version of a previous free event, that provided us with an advertisement for a future pay-for DLC and an enemy that's virtually immortal without DLC, that makes it near impossible for armour players to play the game their way I tried and tried to ignore, but the fact that people paid millions collectively to see an ad got under my skin. When you failed to deliver on an enemy you presented TWO YEARS AGO and didn't start development for until the beginning of 2015, and instead just made it a hyper-powerful version of an already existing enemy (That of course is weak as a kitten if you use DLC-only explosives), that deploys with what is essentially a small troop of copies of itself I was disgusted. The FBI files, a long-awaited addition to the game, turned out to be a link to Overkill's own website that plays a cute little ""Virtual machine"" that shows you gun statistics, something there's already a Wiki for, as well as the character's profiles and backgrounds, something you could already see on crimenet in game. And I took a break, and figured I'd get over it eventually. I'd come back, I'd play again. I played this game to the point where I could beat Death Wish solo on loud heists, so surely I'd pull through thick and thin and return to the game with open arms. Right?And then Overkill lost it.The game now has CS:GO's uncrating system. They clearly noticed Gun Mettle was a huge success in Team Fortress 2 and decided their community would love the same thing. Small problem with this theory, however: Team Fortress 2 already had an item system, and hundreds upon thousands of cosmetics that could customise your characters to however you wanted them to be. Payday had nothing of this sort, so this comes across as a blatant cash-in on an idea that worked for another game. But that's fine. Even if they stole the idea right down to the dot on the I (Or the inspect animations in this instance), it worked for CS:GO, it wasn't as bad as anyone with over 15 hours thought it was going to be in TF2, maybe it'll work for Overkill, despite their weapons being awarded via a level system and changing appearances based on what attachments and customisations you apply to the weapons. And if that were it, I'd say ""I really hate this company but whatever"" and resign myself to just playing.But no, that's not all. The weapon skins give statistical advantages. These give upgrades in stats compared to the base skins. And there's NO other way to get them, save for opening them with a keydrill, straight from the community marketplace. You HAVE to spend money, REAL money, not the two billion you have sitting in your offshore account with no purpose since they lied about safehouse customisation, but actual currency on your Steam account, to get these weapons, and by not shelling out extra money that already costs (Or so I've been informed, not a US resident) around 25$, you are at a disadvantage to other players who WILL do so, because Overkill wanted to profit that much more off an update TF2 did for free, which was successful because of the rebalancings. Congrats, Overkill. I know I'm not the only person you'll have heard this from, but you're true filth, and I took great pleasure in uninstalling. DON'T buy this game. All you'll do is have your arm twisted until you relent and buy an ever-expanding list of DLC, and now apparently some pretty gun skins, or else the game is insultingly difficult (On Death Wish, all other difficulties are easy regardless, because why would ""Overkill"", the fourth difficulty setting with only one above it, pose a challenge, and stealth is always easy just for what it is). The game is disgusting, and never content with the amount of cash it's sucked in, and broken beyond repair. But don't expect it to be fixed. That'll cost you extra.Brief update, significantly late: The microtransactions have been (Mostly) retracted. Whether that's enough to make amends isn't for me to decide, feel free to decide for yourself			"

												We've come a long way with this game. We had some ups and downs but, overall, it's undeniable that Payday2 Is a great game and that, for the most part, Overkill behaved well towards their gaming community. Unfortunately, that ends today. There's no more trust to be had towards Overkill and their Microtransactions update for an event where everything was promised free.This is a payed game, with lots of payed DLC (LOTS) and despite their promises two years ago:""We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)""Overkill has broken their word.Until this changes, stay away from Payday 2, as much as it saddens me to say so...

												Over $100 worth of DLC + microtransactions, bugs galore, little to no performance optimization, heists continually recycled, lackluster, or unbalanced, and enemies (Winters, turrets, abundant shields, etc) that largely make playing without DLC unbearable. As of now, there is little to nothing of value in Payday 2.			"

												Bought this game when it was first released and LOVED the game from the start. I have purchased all the DLC (most of which have been for full price may I add?!) and have invested a fair amount of time in levelling up etc.So...Why has it taken this long to write a review you wonder? Let me make this clear to you guys considering even paying a penny for this ""game"" So back when the game was first released this message popped up from Almir, The producer:""The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!"" Source: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521And what did the community discover today with the new update? MICRO-TRANSACTIONS!Bascially, the team at Overkill thought it would be a hell of a great idea to try and turn this game into a rip off of CS:GO and quite frankly, LIED to the community!I for one, do not trust companies who find it plausible to lie to their consumers (us: the players) and refuse to invest any more of my hard earned cash into a corrupt and untrustable production team! Dont get me wrong, when I first played the game - it was hella fun and the community was great and helpful but as time went on things got worse and worse and worse and today - Marks the end of this for me and maybe a lot of other players too. So all in all, if you like being lied to by a company who takes your hard earned cash and runs with it and doesnt deliver their promise - then by all means, buy the game because as i said it WAS fun. But if not - save your money and your dignity and give it to a more trusted and reliable company who value their community!			"

												UPDATED REVIEW:A game that went a big metamorphosis... like 2 times already. 3300 hours in and after a big change in company & developers approach, with a lot better content being put out.I recommend the game though I won't change my thumbs down, matter of principle.Lying and showing no respect to customer won't ever be respected and \ or forgotten.Pros:+ more stuff to play in the game than ever+ gameplay is still rather good+ modding scene saves the game+ free content updates+ runs good on old PC's+ good graphics+ good sound design+ great soundtrack+ free community LMG, sniper rifle and grenade added+ devs patched in a lot of good fixes in the last year+ way quicker development than before+ still supported and developed, with free content & DLC'sCons:- noticably different gameplay than before- company that created the game is simply and delicately put: real bad. Manipulative and deceitful marketing, lying officials, no respect for customers (who made'em exist in the AAA league in the first place), kindergarden level public relations, console version scam- cancerous CSGO crate system overpriced microtransactions ON TOP of a lot of DLC's- devs can't balance for shiz, OVK_Jules is awful at his job- devs often create bugs and destroy game stability- unclear visuals, need 3rd party image sharpening for real sharp image- optimization still could be better- most skins look like pooOld review left just so you know how bad things were.=== OLD REVIEW ===2300 hours into the game, it turns out I never posted a review of the game.Now it's better time than ever.It's a game that USED to be great, despite being full of bugs, shortcomings, bad design decisions and so on. But lately? Most veterans and many casual players are turning their backs on PD2 after being backstabbed by the developers (Crimefest community challenges outcome).- CS:GO kind of microtransactions ON TOP of the normal price AND ~130 $ worth of DLC;- by default, you have more than half of the game behind the paywall;- untrustworthy, unreliable, unproffesional, flat-out lying developers and producers;- the original team that made the game great fell apart (Viklund, Goldfarb, Petrusic);- steam workshop used to squeeze even more money out of the player base, no communication with the community, terrible PR, every ""special"" kind of weapon restricted to DLC (snipers, machine-guns, explosives, special ammunition), manipulative marketing.Remember, all that ON TOP of the usual bugs, slow development (too few maps, too repetitive), bad gameplay design choices, degrading quality of next DLC's and a pay-to-win design.Do NOT buy this game, do NOT support the devs. "

												I've put a moderate amount of hours into this game, which I feel is enough to fully judge, understand and get everything out of the game.. of course excluding the constant wave(s) of DLC that came every ♥♥♥♥ing week, or not even.I even played the Beta, I was overall impressed and excited that this game happened because at the time I felt it was one of the best ""co-op"" and ""wave-based"" games I've played; it was a definite upgrade to the previous game and completely stomped a certain ""zombie"" game, don't even need to say the name.What could possibly happen to make this experience flip upside down? The developers wouldn't do anything stupid like.. introduce microtransactions.. would they? Surely they learned from playing games like TF2 and CS:GO that such concepts are bad. They even told us specifically they wouldn't do such things, so I think we're fine. Let's keep going guys, success all the way! Right? No, good job introducing the same crap that plagues other games into this gem. You made it worse, worse than it ALREADY WAS. I forgot to mention.. while the game was a blast, there were flaws, however.. no matter how big or small a flaw was, the random programmers and even cheaters of this community made it better, made it work and made it enjoyable.The only damn reason this game was still alive for so long was because WE were the ones constantly fixing and making new code regarding mechanics YOU couldn't code right or do right. When we were the ones working on your game, you guys were the ones working on producing new content for the sake of getting some dosh.A small company cannot be cut slack when they have the nerve to put microtransactions into their game.Thanks for ruining a game, talk about overkill - accurate name.

												Today January 14 2016, overkill realeased a DLC wich is a crossover with one of the most stupid game ever GOAT SIMULATOR!!! ( Here is an idea for OVK Next you should realease a cross-over with shower with your dad simulator ;) I'm sur people at OVK will think it's a good idea). For me it is too much, I never thinked of Payday 2 as a realistic game, but there is a differencce between unrealistic and completely dumb ! If you want to release more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cross-over in the future at least dont ask 7.79 $ for it !!!I wont pay for that DLC, and I uninstalled Payday 2, and wont re-install it unless OVK change their way! Payday 2 is a great game but, greedy developement have destroyed it ! Overkill is laughing at it's player base trying to milk all the money they can from it ! IF you dont have time to patch bugs, how can you have time to realease that BS ???2 of the special enemy in the game are broken ! Tazer can taze you without line of sight ! Cloaker can cloak tought wall ! But, no time to fix special enemy !The so called Re-balance, Overkill tried to balance weapon during crimefest, now we have handgun hitting harder than shotgun and assault rifle! Its been more than 2 months and nothing has been made about this! The perk deck are currently un-balanced, some are not even usable on Deathwish! Overkill said they were balancing the game around the base content ! Armorer is one of the base perk deck and it's worthless! Infiltrator and Grinder are great for DW but guess what, they both come with DLC !After one year working on a new enemy! They released Captain winters ! The captain arrive on the map, stop moving, and lock the wave!( you have to defeat him for the police assault to stop) He is surrounded by other shield! And guess what ? The best way to defeat him is Molotov Cocktail(BBQ pack DLC). But they are balancing the game around base content....Overkill said that after crimefest they would be more transparent...But ..... They said they would listen to the community too! Oh yeah Almir now create thread in the forum ! Then drop a couple of ;) in the comment, that's listeneing to the community !! I used to buy every DLC at he moment they were relased, I would have buyed any full priced game from overkill, Would have pre-ordered it! But with the way they are taking now I wont buy anything from them at full price !!GG overkill !!! You can now rename your game for: PAY-2-WIN-DAY !Posted: 15 Oct, 2015 @ 7:38pm	Updated: 21 Oct, 2015 @ 1:04pmOverkill are still liar they lied about MC and a lot of other thiings! They took the first step in the right direction at day 6 of crimefest by making drill dropable by card drop!This is not enough yet ! Now safe and drill can be dropped in-game, but we have no idea of the drop rate of the drill. Overkill still have a lot to do, and to learn!I dont think they will continue in the right direction...

												Here we are, Day 1 of crimefest 2015, and I've been convienced by Overkill themselves to write this review. (Sorry if it sounds ranty, but it kind've is.) It's been a while since we've gotten any REAL updates. Everything for the past months has been DLC. We rarely actually get anything for free. We finally get the FBI files? It's just a link to a website off site from the game. I've been told that this makes it BETTER but it still comes off as lazy, I don't know. Our new Gensec enemy? Captain Winters? A bunch of shields crammed into eachother. I ran into that everytime I played Hotline Miami day 2. The Chivalry pack was personally my last straw, as it introduced items FROM ANOTHER GAME... FOR MONEY. Meanwhile, Chivalry gets Payday items for free. Crazy right? But now THIS. We were promised free updates for crimefest. Emphasis on ""FREE""? And what was the first thing we get? First of all, we got a weapon rebalance, which was threatened to never occur unless we did the rediculous road to crimefest challenges. But now? F**KING. CRATES. That's right, CRATES. Like TF2, and CS:GO. Overkill's greed has no bounds, their supposed 'free' update, is nothing but a gimmick laced with micro-transactions. Now, I loved Payday, as you could discern by my playtime. But this? This is just the mark of a bad company trying its most to squeeze every little cent out of its player base. They do so little to ever improve the actual game. There are game-breaking bugs still present that have been in since day 1. And insted of fixing them, they push more content, begging for money. ""Well it's just a change, you'll get over it."" No, not this time. This is where I draw the line. This is where I say, no more. I'm never spending another cent on this game. This single update has literally sapped all the fun I could have out of it. Good job Overkill. You've killed your franchise for one more player. Maybe when you're sinking, you can look back and atleast realize how and where you f**ked up. I may reconcider were they to withdraw the fact you have to PAY for the 'special drills' (keys) to open their 'safes' (crates). And guess what? They won't ever do that. Overkill never backs out of ANYthing. And no matter how much the player-base hates it, there'll be enough people who'll eat it up to keep Overkill afloat, and that's all that matters to them. Screw 80% of the community when we only need 20% to survive, right? During crimefest, they were hardpressed to actually get 30,000 people online at once. They had to make an announcement for it. The game is dying, and they're doing nothing to help it other than trying to make that last few cents before it does. >Edit< And here we had day 2... Nothing short of a JOKE. We get some crappy masks? ONLY masks? And not just that, FIVE WHOLE CHALLENGES. WERE DEDICATED. TO. MASKS?? It should tell you something that this game's reviews SWEPT red over night. It dropped a whole 10% in approval ratings within 24 hours of announcing the blackmarket, and another 4% before writing this review (It has over 140,000 reviews. That's a lot of people changing their minds.)  And WOW. Nobody's screwed up this bad in a single update since Valve and Bethesda tried to charge cash for mods, and guess what? They LEARNED from that mistake. This was a great chance for Overkill to save SOME face but instead they spit in ours. I hold my breath on what kind've disappointment Day 3 holds. >Edit edit< And here we are, Day 6. Overkill finally buckled and added in drills as card drops. Or so they say, I've yet to see a single, even MISSED card, as this fabled 'Wolf Card'. Good job setting the drop-rate lower than an infamous mask. Nothing else has been changed, and this is hardly a comprimise.>Edit edit edit< So Crimefest has come and went, and while it COULD have been good. The fact it was poisoned by the blackmarket update remains. The additions of old heists is pretty cool. But really? What did we get other than that? A lot of masks nobody could care for? An update to the AI and Crime.net that SHOULD have already been in the game? ONE new gun and a really buggy new tripod mechanic, that shows little to no actual value of use on anything over normal difficulty due to specials and their incap abilities. A jump animation update that doesn't even look good? We got new masks, new achievements, and a new TRAILER, all revolving around jump animations, are you serious? What else did we get? Oh yes, let me write it out. I'd hate to touch on things I already have, but it's been nearly a week since I touched this review. Microtransactions - We already had to pay 20-30 dollars for the game. Then they ask for 100+ dollars for DLC. Now this, a mechanic literally ripped out of CS:GO. Do you know what skins are? They're a mod. You know how before, we'd get around 4 weapons, maybe 4 masks, and some assorted mods for a 5 dollar pack? Now they're asking for 2.50 for ONE weapon mod. Oh it's not the one you want? TOO BAD! Go gamble some more. Broken Promises - Former head of Overkill said there wouldn't be any. Current head of Overkill said there wouldn't be any. And what did we get? We got them anyway... Where's the safe house customization that was promised BEFORE release? Where's the COMPLETELY OVERKILL SPECIAL ITEM, for those of us who baught that pack? Who supported you when you asked for it, and then you sh*t on us? It took over a year to develop the FBI files, and what was it? A WEBSITE. ONE LITERALLY STOLLEN FROM THE PAYDAY STATS GUY. It took over a year to develop the new Gensec enemy, and it was the laziest f**king thing, literally just shields mushed together. The driving mechanics were promised to be fixed, and they're still wonky as hell. We still have major desync issues. But those can wait when you have a new 5-7 dollar DLC pack to push out right? One p**sed off community - The game's Steam approval rating has dropped about 23% since the update was introduced, and it's only on a steady decline from here. Do I need to say more? That's around 35,000+ people of the current 160,000+ reviewers, or have either made a new review like me or changed their old ones. Overkill claims to always have open ears to the community but it's clear they don't give a crap what we think.>Edit x4< So I got word the COP item was released. But before we get to that, I'd like to point out Overkill announcing the Charity thing just after crimefest ended. I don't know of this was just really well timed, or they're attempting to cover their as*es, with the 'it's for the Children!' routine, but from how Overkill treated us so far, I'm guessing the latter.ANYway, the COP item finally came out and /WOW/. It's nothing but another. F**king. Crate. A 20 dollar crate. Really guys? Took you the better part of a year to come up with that one, did it? We get a random weapon skin from it as usual. It's completely random with no say over what it is. It's not even gurenteed a good quality. Needless to say, the community is back up in arms over this, as they should be. It's apparently gotten so bad, the forum moderators have quit since Overkill is physically incapable of learning a simple lesson. The item in the COP safe was promised to be cosmetic only, yet apparently comes with more stat boosts than any other skin thus far. (If I've read this right, forgive any misinformation as I've stopped caring about this flustercluck of a game since October.) They've claimed the sales are doing what they want, so I assume their whole goal was to get 50,000 people hating them. Oh sorry, we're the 'vocal minority' so we don't matter. (The game at any given time has about 20k people playing it at most. I'm pretty sure doubling that takes us out of the 'minority' range.)			"

												Welcome, first i want to tell ya, this is more of a story, than a review...It's how it all started. Every year in the summer a friend from Germany visits me and my family. We had pretty much nothing to play, so eh, watcha think we did? bought some random games...I can't remember the other ones, but it all happened just then...We opened PAYDAY 2, and started shooting police men...The next day i already had around 10/22 DLC's for it. It was somehting that good i couldn't describe...it was the last thing i was thinking at before sleeping and the first up in the morning. I was playing it for at least 5 hours a day...Just robing banks for hours a day...Then one day, i met my first cheater...He was spawning money bags in the van...i tought, meh, OVERKILL will just ban him and everything will be just fine...no. OVERKILL did nothing about the cheaters...but well, at least no microtrans...oh, yea. Well, at least the weapon balance is doing just fine...oh, wait...well, at least it's just 19,99, it's not like there are 100 DLC's costing 5$ each...oh...wait...That's how the game just feels now. It was so good in the begin and it fall off so badly...EDIT 1: Oh my...The microtransactions are done, and the game seems enough interesting again, many more maps and everythin'...This review might change to positive soon, if OVERKILL continues like this.

												They've recently added in a feature of microtransactions which I disagree with completely. It doesn't fit in here and while I've supported everything Overkill has done in the past, all DLCs and even the Mega Pack, I can't support this. I was fine with how it was, the occasional DLC, but this? No.I wouldn't get this game currently, should the Safe/Drill Microtransaction debacle end, then I would definitely get this game. but not right now. The fact that they are on damage control deleting posts that say the same message on the forums isn't a good sign either.			"

//EDIT: After the latest (large) patch, the game got a lot better. Microtransactions were removed and the skill tree got improved tremendously, overall it went from being like a 5/10 to an 8/10 game, I'm not editing the entire review (nor am I changing the recommendation) since the damage is already done and the patch is the developers trying really hard to ""damage control"" the community's outrage about all the crap that went on with the game for the last year or so. The game got a lot better, but we don't forget. Also some of my points (actual gameplay) still stand, so I'm just gonna leave it as it is, but take it with a grain of salt.-------I've played the game for almost 100 hours, which isn't nearly as much as some other people did, but I reached the max level (and bought ""infamy""), so I feel like writing a quick review to sum up the flaws and pros of the game.Read summary for a tl;dr.Let's talk general gameplay first. Stealth missions are nearly impossible to complete with random people, especially if they're new / inexperienced players. The entire game is balanced around playing with 3 other people, yet playing with randoms is usually super frustrating, which makes you want to do stealth missions alone instead. Doing them alone is not impossible, but it takes much more time and they're generally more difficult to complete on your own. Now that's a problem with most co-op games, but Payday relies on strategy a lot more than most of them, especially since a tiny mistake can ruin the entire mission, sometimes half an hour of time goes in vain, when someone screws up. Solution? Right, play with friends. However, if they start playing the game later than you, you're gonna have to explain a lot of stuff before you can play for real, since the learning curve of each mission is pretty steep.Regarding non-stealth missions - ""loud"" missions, higher difficulties can't be completed with any less than 4 people, since like I said, the game is balanced around playing as 4. Oh, there're bots, but sadly Payday has one of the dumbest AI there ever was, so in stealth, they just stand around doing nothing and in loud mode, they usually get stuck and die within seconds. Quite often they just chill around while you are dying on the ground, instead of helping you up.So yeah, if you wanna buy the game, I recommend playing with 3 dedicated friends that are willing to spend as much time playing as you do.The second issue is the endless and very unrewarding grind. Let's say you're building your talent tree and decide, that the talent you chose isn't that good. What to do? Reset the entire tree, get some (ingame) money back and build the tree from the beginning. Each talent costs money. Each weapon costs money. Masks cost money. Everything costs money and you have to grind A LOT, to unlock at least a portion of content. You buy that one weapon for a million that you always wanted, just to find out that it sucks ingame and the grind was pointless. Rinse and repeat. Now that's not a problem for me, as an MMO player, I'm used to grinding stuff, but if you go into the game expecting co-op fps, prepare for a single-player stealth mission grind-fest instead.Third issue is max level, endgame gameplay - there's none. At max level, you're allowed to reset using the infamy system and start all over, with no talents, retaining only your items. I'm sure you can imagine my excitement after 80 hours of grinding experience to level 100 just to start all over.That's gameplay, it's often fun - especially with friends, it's often frustrating - especially with randoms. Let's talk other stuff. A couple months back, Overkill (developer) added ""drills"" and ""safes"", apparently both can drop ingame, but the chance of a drill dropping is probably around 0. Safes contain items that may have (depending on the item quality, which is random) improved statistics making the game seem pay to win to majority of the community. As shady as it is, I honestly don't think it matters, since there's no PvP. You can complete all the content without the items from safes, so it's pretty whatever.The thing I hate more than the microtransactions are the DLCs. There's a ♥♥♥♥ ton of them and each one adds one - often ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission, or multiple - always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions. Plus a couple useless masks and sometimes weapons. What sucks the most is that even though the weapons are usually useless, there's always that one useful item that you really want. Example - grenades, very useful in Mallcrashers mission, etc. So you endup buying that pack for 5€ just for that one thing, making the other content of that DLC meaningless and the item overpriced. ""Oh, Deffy, but you don't need to buy the DLC if you don't want to"". Yeah, but other people will have the item, since it's super helpful and I won't have it and that sucks - everybody knows the feeling. Being forced into buying a 5€ DLC just for one item sucks.That being said, most of the DLCs absolutely suck. It's obvious their sole purpose is to make quick cash, not to entertain or improve gaming experience. Same goes for the real cash items. Everything Overkill has done since the game release, is milking cash, none of the patches made the game more fun or rewarding.Whether you want to buy the game after all I've said is up to you. I'm on the verge myself, unsure if I still like the game or not. Overall my feelings are more on the negative side, yet I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game at all as the first 20-ish hours were very entertaining. It gets more and more boring as you realize all there is to do is grind more cash / experience.Summary: 
It's fun to play with friends once in a while, but not on daily basis.Ignore the safes and cash items, they're worthless gimmicks.Expect a long grind and don't expect it to be rewarding.Random people in lobbies are often dumb, what's new.If you don't have friends to play with, it's quite possible that you're gonna stick with solo stealth missions, unless you can handle the frustration of playing with randoms.Have a second monitor and prepare something to watch while you spend half an hour lockpicking.

To those of you like me, jilted ex-lovers of this once great game: It's back. It's better than ever. It's been working out, and it knows you know it looks good. And you owe it to yourself to see how hard that body really is. I think you'll find that the time apart has led to a lot of self-reflection and Payday 2 nows knows how to be a more complete experience.I, like many others, quit when I got slapped in the face with my Crimefest 2015 reward: Microtransactions. Despite the promises made to the contrary, they added the ultimate evil to a game already bloated with DLC and struggling with middling patches and balancing. I was furious. The DLC already felt a little exploitative, now OVERKILL wants me to buy keys to hope I get the skins that have the stat buffs I needed to un-nerf my primary weapon? Yeah, thanks. I will pass.However, like many of those that quit, upon finding that they had completely removed the microtransactions, left the cool skins, undone the nerf damages, patched the hell out of the game to polish the skill tress and make the game more accessible and expanded player freedom with respect to builds and weapons... I returned wary and cautiously excited. I am glad I did.For people who haven't played this, if you have a friend who has a good amount of the DLC and you can play with them to try it out before really commiting it's worth it. It is also worth noting that without a sale, this game and all of it's DLC (purchased separately) will cost you a whopping $168.46. That is insane for a game that is 3 years oldand I wouldn't pay that ever - so in conclusion to this less-than-stellar grouping of words, if you can catch a sale, say 50-66% off, I highly recommend this game in its entirety. With a friend it is better. More friends, even better. Nothing can touch this kind of cooperative gameplay. It is in a league alone.Solo this game doesn't feel like it offers much. Sure there are AI partners but they aren't very well developed - so the player ends up doing the brunt of the work. Carrying bags, moving hostages, managing drills and security systems - all reliant on player interaction. The AI simply will not do these things. They will only shoot back if fired upon, and attempt to revive the player should they be downed. This will prevent most solo players from being able to accomplish the harder, more complex heists. Some players like that kind of challenge (and to each their own) but I do not and I suspect most people drawn to this game aren't looking for a solo game anyways.For $20 and with a crew you cannot go wrong. Otherwise, I would really consider what you're buying.			"

												To put it lightly, Payday 2 has had a rough history with updates, events, and hype letdowns. 2015 was a rough year for Overkill, with the Spring Break issues and microtransactions controversy. However, in 2016, they've knocked it out of the park consistently. At this point in time, Payday 2 is a solid co-op shooter that I would recommend to any fan of Left 4 Dead or Borderlands.The premise is simple: you and three other people bring two ridiculously-customizable weapons (stocks, sights, compensators, paint jobs, weapon bodies, and more!) along with some other goodies and commit organized crimes. Missions are diverse, from robbing banks to ambushing convoys of armored cars. The jobs vary by mission, but you usually fight waves of cops until you complete enough objectives to escape. You can also silently complete most missions in stealth, but that can get tedious with repeated failures. When you're not stealing priceless goods and fighting the law, you can purchase and customize masks with in-game money, gamble on free item drops, and pay visits to your safehouse.It's simple, addicting, and overall a good time, especially with friends and voice chat. For the most part, the game is balanced and accessible. It does have loads and loads of DLC, but they are cheap and usually bundled together these days, so you can get almost every weapon for under 10 dollars on sale. Occasionally, Overkill releases free content to the game in patches, meaning you can still look forward to new additions to the game without using your Steam Wallet.What else can I say? Overkill has redeemed itself. I would recommend buying Payday 2, though I would hold off until it goes on sale so you can grab a lot of the DLC alongside of it.			"

												Final Verdict/Edit:If you hold developers to any standardIf content is more important than quotasIf you don't believe in the ""paid DLC that gives other players advantages"" business modelIf you think drastically altering stats for the sake of making DLC items fit in is poor planningIf you dislike feeling poweless while watching a game you like slowly deteriorate due to incessant fanboyism/blind consumerismDon'tBuyThisGame.(old) Edit: Since the announcement of their re-aquisition to the rights of Payday 2 and removal of future microtransactions, I'm cautiously optimistic about the game's new direction. I still believe they have old promises to make up for, but I'm giving the game a chance again. My review will remain negative until I see more.Old Review:Good sneaking fun, but it's been almost 2 years since they've promised old content, and continue to release paid DLC in place of it. As a consumer, I feel abused and unrespected for the support I've given the company. I think I need to see more progress in old promises before they start charging me for new ones.I plan to change my review if they decide to take the community's advice and make right the wrongs they've done to it as a whole.A ""We salute you!"" won't cover it this time.

												Awful developers, who promote and promise and yet never deliver. Just more DLC, and now Microtransactions. As someone who pre-purchased and has played the hell out of the game, I stopped playing a long time ago. But the game is clearly going free to play, several developers have left the company in this time seeing the track the company has gone down.I'd recommend an immediate refund if you've bought the game, since I can't get my money back due to having played the ♥♥♥♥ out of payday2 when it was entertaining and had a good business model.Unfortunately, after two years it remains buggy as hell and the skills in the game remain ill-balanced making only certain build's viable.If you do play this game, I'd wait until it becomes free to play, and then hacking for whatever you want.

												Sorry but I have to write a negative review here.Payday 2 used to be my absolutely favorite game but in it's current state I can only dislike. In my opinion there was a point a few months ago when it became worse and worse each update. We got buffed and OP which made the game incredibly easier. I liked the game for it's insane difficulty. But the worst thing that ever got introduced into the game were the skins. Payday 2 copies exactly the system CS:GO uses. It's only sad enough to see a 1 to 1 copy but the worst thing is still that those have stats and improve your effectiveness. It's really sad to see that Overkill did this step and you have to pay an incredible amount of money just to have better stats.I will leave this game for now, farewell guys!			"

												Welp, 2000+ hours played. It's time to make my steam review.Let's be honest here, I am biased. Completly. Payday 2 has been and still is a huge part of my life. I met peoples in game that are now, for some, my closest friends. I even started a tutor group to help out new players, said group taking half my day everyday.So this review is more of a tribute than anything else.But let's talk about the game itself, shall we ?Payday 2 is a crime simulator. You'll see yourself robbing banks, crashing malls or even boosting nukes alongside 3 of your friends.Lots (and I mean LOTS) of different weapons and skills are at you disposal to do so; including (but not limited to) the classic assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, SMGs and sniper rifles but also more exotic toys like the flamethrower, minigun, RPG-7 or even bows and crossbows.The game is big and it will require a lot of your time to finish every contract there is. After that, well, it begins to be a little repetitive.The community though... Well, let's say that your shotgun will not longer be the only one needing a shell. *wink wink*Seriously though. The PD2 community is often seen as VERY toxic: hosts kicking for no reason, rudeness, ect. And I can't really comment on that, as I didn't really noticed anything myself, only the posts on the forums.Anyway, score time:Gameplay: 9/10Way too much to do!User Interface: 4/10I had to download several mods for the in-game UI and the out-game one is... Well, you really have to look for certain things.Map design: 6/10Really good map design but not used wisely.Music: 12/10All praise Lord Viklund for his divine music!Replayability: 9/10Almost perfect, some contracts are a bit boring when done multiple times thoughTotal: 40/50 or 8/10Very good game, Recommending it!

												I've been trying to think of the words to convey my complete disappointment with overkill and almir. I've loved the hell out of this game ever since I heard about it back in 2013, and I've been playing it ever since. However, this first day for Crimefest 2015 has caused me to lose a lot of respect I had for the developers. We were promised FREE DLC for all the grinding we did to unlock all of those challenges (Don't even get me started on farming jewelry store normal for those card drops... ugh). Then, when Crimefest comes around, we see the result of all our hard work which is the OPPORTUNITY TO BUY SKINS as our first major dlc update. Now... I don't know about you, but THAT'S NOT FREE CONTENT OVERKILL. NOT TO MENTION THAT THOSE SKINS ACTUALLY GIVE STAT BUFFS TO THE WEAPONS. So now if you want to optimize your weapons to their fullest potential you have to shell out more money on the steam marketplace in order to get that extra 4 stability instead of spending in game money on a weapon mod you earned while having a fun time in a heist. Yes, people have spam linked that gamespot article about the previous lead game designer David Goldfarb saying ""No. No. God, I hope not"" about having microtransactions in payday 2, and the spamming is justified. In fact, I'm going to do it right now http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/If I was David and I saw what they did to my game with this crap, then I'd be completely disgustedTo start off Crimefest with the opportunity to buy weapon skins that are needed to fully optimize your weapons with buffs is the worst joke I've heard in a long time. I would've been happy with this day just being the weapon rebalancing and the new screen to alter your guns with mods. Instead they just copy the hell out of valve in an attempt to earn even more money since almir apparently saw a case unboxing video with over 1,000,000 views and thought $$$. Look, I'm sorry if I'm rambling, but I'm severely disappointed with the developers of this game, and I hope that at least the whole ""BUFFS ON WEAPON SKINS"" is ♥♥♥♥ing removed. Skins are a choice, but they shouldn't be mandatory in order to improve your gameplay. The game is still fun, but the first day of crimefest was ♥♥♥♥ing laughably insulting.Thanks for reading my frustrations			"

												Payday 2 goes back to one of the oldest conflicts in the entertainment industry, cops versus robbers. Four hardened criminals go on their newest crime spree across Washington DC. From drug trafficking to political framing, to the Payday gang, it's just another payday.Payday 2 is a co-op first person shooter with RPG and stealth elements. Missions have a heavy focus on a risk to reward design, often providing optional objectives within missions. Teams will frequently have to weigh their ability and the situation to get the best payout available.Combat takes a chaotic shoot em up feel as police show little intelligence, instead opting to overwhelm players by sheer numbers and firepower. Most teams will have little trouble on normal or hard difficulties, however higher difficulties will pose a challenge even to experienced players. The large range in difficulty allows the game to appeal both to casual and hardcore gamers. Weapon recoil and animations make guns feel unwieldy and hefty, creating a very powerful hit between each shot often missing in many FPS shooters.  As players level up they will gain access to skill points, allowing them to gain new abilities and passive buffs.Payday 2 also offers players the option of using stealth to complete levels without being detected at all. While this can be enjoyable for some, players who are not skilled in the stealth approach will often find themselves waiting around for the 'all clear' back at the spawn zone. Combat can keep players engaged during timed objectives; stealth leaves you just standing around twiddling your thumbs.While missions are short (mostly lasting 10-20 minutes average), repetition of levels quickly becomes frequent. Replaying the same mission, objectives will remain the same yet many aspects of the level design can change. Levels have many random factors which will force players to alter their approach to a mission. These random factors can range from an escape door no longer existing to the location of the primary objective. Random elements add a lot of replay value to missions as well as stopping players from acting out the same plan repeatedly.Strong dependency on working as a team can cause public games to be frustrating at times, however they still remain functional and entertaining. Playing with a group of friends is where Payday 2 shows its strengths: a team works tightly together within the chaotic action. Single player, with or without bots, is poor making its simple AI and repetition more apparent, and should be completely avoided. Downloadable content seems reasonably priced, offering new weapons and levels to play. Those who own DLC missions are able to host them, while friends and other players can join without having to own the same DLC. The price tag comes just short of most AAA titles and the same could be said about the gameplay. Missing animations and high repetition make Payday fall just short of what we expect from top budget titles. Although Payday 2 plays rough around the edges at times, its solid and heavy hitting shooting mechanics along with its RPG and stealth elements allow it to appeal to anyone interested in the action genre.Pros:+A role available to all who enjoy the FPS genre+Randomized maps add replay value to missions+Weapons feel powerful and weighty+Dependency on teamwork without feeling too weak alone+Free content updates+DLC does not separate the community+Great soundtrackCons:-Stealth can fail because of synchronization issues and bugs-High repetition of missions-Absent animations for actions such as jumping -Hackers can be prominent in public games-Bugs after updates are commonLike the review?

												-----Updated review:With the broken promise of introducing microtransactions, I can no longer recommend Payday 2, nor will I support or laud Overkill as I have done in the past.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard (curator link)-----Previous (positive) review:One of the best FPS experiences available. Fun solo; even better in co-op with friends.Payday 2 picks up where Payday 1 left off - improving on almost every facet of the first game.Several heists have been designed specifically with the option to use stealth tactics as opposed to going loud (aka ""Plan B""), with a revamped skill system to help facilitate the players' preferences.With a tonne of post-release content, both free and paid (but none of it essential), the developers continue to foster a healthy relationship with the community, listening to and working with the playerbase to improve an already superb game.

												Well, after nearly 700 hours sunk into Payday, I finally felt the need to review it. Timing and objective-focused horde shooter with a lot of variation in missions.Game is absolutely full of DLC, some of it blatantly pay-to-win: Gage mod courier DLC mods are inexcusably essential for 'meta' weapon builds on the highest difficulties, access to thrown explosives is stuck behind dollar signs.Lots and lots of useless items too: many of the vanilla guns were not correctly balanced on release, and are utter trash following several iterations of DLC. There's basically a melee weapon for every level, and there is hardly any differentiation between them - except for the fact that they're all inferior to the default 'weapon butt' attack, and melee combat is horribly skewed against the player.Long delays in promised content while developers pursue their own 'wacky' alternatives - some well-received, like the Hotline Miami 2 content, others just stupid: Chivalry, John Wick.Large lack of maps compared to other forms of content. Playing the same maps with new gear and cosmetics is not as fun as playing new maps with trusty gear.I will probably keep playing Payday, but I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a serious, challenging, or fun experience.

												I rather liked Payday: The Heist. I rather enjoyed Payday 2 when it came out also. Sure there were some problems with the map chooser (cant pick any heist without paying, ect.) But Overkill promised support, and 3 DLC's.They lied. I am not a big fan of lots of DLC, and Overkill decided to put out a bunch of DLC.  Still not a problem, but when the DLC is $6-$8 a pop, and gives us either one new heist or 2 - 3 guns, I am disappointed. Making the bread and butter of the DLC's different masks I still was fine with, even though there is absolutely no way to check out my face in game. If there was some sort of taunt like in TF2 that would put me in the 3rd person view, I would enjoy that more, but as it is there is no way to even enjoy what I am wearing. (Yeah blah blah blah, you can go to your safehouse. Dont even get me started on the lies and deception surrounding that. Almost 2 years and no safehouse upgrades, unlike what Overkill said during pre-production. ""It takes time to do good work"". smh)EVEN WITH ALL OF THIS I was not upset. I bought all the DLC up to the Diamond Heist because I found value in it. But when the diamond heist and Clover came out, I did not feel that they were worth it. I was gonna wait for a sale. Then they started doing the butcher stuff, and I still did not buy any DLC because it was still not worth it. Crimefest stuff not completed (""it takes time to do good work"") and then the hype train hit and it was $5 for 2 guns (one secondary that does 10000 dmg, gg) and $20 for 4 ""unusual"" masks (Still cant see my face) and one ""Secret"" item out of 25 possible secret items. On a RNG. For $20. But hey, whatever, they are going to do a new infamy update anyways and free mod packs. But the free mod pack got turned into a pay mod pack ($5 of course) and when called on it, Overkill said, this is not the mod pack you think it is, this is a different one. Even though it has the same promo image, and it was dropping glitched items from the other mod pack (free one) also. Seems legit. But, hey this is all free, you will get (more) free enemies (when they are done) like the last one (""it takes time to do good work"") and the magical Infamy 2.0 is coming out.Infamy 2.0 came out and it was terrible. 2000 more levels, with the only rewards being masks and XP boosts. (Yo dawg, I put an XP boost into your leveling up, so that you can level while you level) I never felt happier about not buying things. A lot of people felt that this was not good. As a matter of fact, lots of people didn't like it. I read a lot about people cancelling their pre-order of the $5 and $20 overkill packs. There must have been a lot, because they fired out the overkill pack DLC early, IMHO because too many people were cancelling their purchaces. They never did anything like this before (""it takes time to do good work"") so I have to assume that they felt the pinch. But the straw that broke the camels back was the 10 acheivements tied to the Overkill pack.I am a completionist. I love doing acheivements. As a matter of fact, Acheivements are what I do. Now I can not 100% your game without purchacing a limited-time DLC. No. Never. If the game was something that I felt good playing anymore I would in a heartbeat. But no. You sell DLC that is nothing but mods, and then require people to complete acheivements just to get the items you paid for. No. Never again. I enjoyed Payday.This is not Payday.			"

												So, I feel like this is a good time for a review.Short:This is a joke of a game. Do not waste your money.Short but longer:This game was good up until about early 2015, then it just became silly, miniguns/rpgs, bows, dynamite etc along with ugly skins, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlcs (COVK pack)m as well as dumb crossovers such as chivalry pack and, of course, goat simulator (a long dead meme). I strongly advise you not to bother with this game if you haven't already, it was amazing up until early 2015, nowadays the game consists of 10 year olds who bought the game in October and decide that they want to play Deathwish with 16 hours on record.I have 1300+ hours, because this game used to be good, now it is a mess run by money hungry devs who pretend they care when all they did was ruin the game I loved. Do not buy a single piece of software from Overkill and do not buy into any of their lies they tell. Don't get into this game, because one way or another they'll ♥♥♥♥ something up purely because it can make them money.♥♥♥♥ Off Overkill.EDIT: 19th May - Been playing it on an off but theyre still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out dumb skins and making stupid changes so I've finally uninstalled.

												Well if you're at least somewhat reasonable you'll at least hear me out for what I have to say and not rage out on me for having an oppossing opinion about a game you happen to enjoy and some of its design choices. My opinion should not stop or hinder you from playing a game you enjoy. For a time I genuinely enjoyed this game but decisions among the team about which direction the game should go and certain design choices has slowly made me shy away from the game gradually. Problem #1 The Update FormatFor starters the way the game updates is viciously frustrating on a number of levels for many people. Everytime the game needs to update itself, it needs an extra 30 GB of harddrive space temporarily to copy all files and make a replica of your entire game. The update is then installed on the replica game file. If the update installs properly and successfully, the old game files are removed and replaced by the new patched version giving you back the 30 GB of harddrive space it used up for the update process. It has been said they use this method to protect your games files so you don't have to redownload the entire game again which I guess makes sense but comes at too high a price with a really big unforseen flaw. The giant flaw being every single time the game needs to updates itself you must always, always, always have an extra 30 GB of space available for the game to update itself without incident. For some gamers this update process is neither feasible or practical. Just because this has been the way the game updates itself since day one of its release doesn't mean this update design choice shouldn't change. It was a poor design choice then and poor design choice now. Shouting, harassing and insulting people to get bigger harddrives or just don't play the game at all if they don't like the way the game updates itself, does not in anyway shape or form fix that particular problem. At best that's just a way to bypass the problem rather than fix it.Problem #2Weekly updates. So the question people are thinking now is ""So you like playing broken games huh?"" No. No I do not enjoy playing broken games. I have no problems with frequent updates to a game 90% of the time BUT issues with problem #1 makes updates for this particular game both stressful and annoying. On top of that this game in particular is known for its ridiculous update sizes ranging from 500MB up to 5GB. PayDay 2 acts like it's the only game that matters on your harddrive and doesn't care that you might have to erase and redownload multiple game titles just to update it.Problem #3The nearly infinite ""DLC Problem"" Yeah, yeah I know people who defend this practice chant the mantra of ""You don't need it to play the game!"" ""You don't need it to play the game!"" ""You don't need it to play the game!"". Yeah I get it we heard you the first time. PayDay 2 and its DLC could be compared to a brand new car that literally has one seat in it. Yes it's true the car works completely fine without the 2 back seats and the passenger seat but it is still a waste of space and looks hideous without them in that regard. Then there's that one person screaming YOU'RE NOT ENTITLED TO FREE STUFF!!!. Never said I was entitled to free stuff nor was I asking for it. What I'm saying is there is very little weapon variety in the base game. And veterans of the game can easily tell you out of the small weapon pool of the base game there is only a handfull of weapons worth using. It's rather depressing trying to choose a proper weapon only to be bombarded by 2-3 pages of locked DLC weapon content glowing in your face. At the very least give me the option of being able to hide DLC weapons in my inventory for gosh sakes!Problem #4A.I Behavior and DesignCombat with the A.I in the game has always felt a little bit on the sloppy side but more and more as the months have gone on it seems to have gotten much more messy. I was hoping the two new difficulty settings they implemented a little while back would allieviate the problem. Sadly it didn't. Difficulty in PayDay 2 doesn't come from intelligent A.I tactics and manuvering. Difficulty in this game comes from the A.I overwhelming you with their numbers and the fact that on higher difficulty settings they are massive bullet sponges. Never once have I thought ""Wow this is difficult because they are so tactical!"" No it's difficult because there are 80 cops onscreen shooting in the same direction! Someone is bound to hit you in that scenario. Personally I would like to see smarter A.I with better damage and accuracy and drastically lower health. Enemy A.I being able shrug off a single 50 caliber shot at pointblank range on the highest difficulties is just ridiculous.Problem #5 The All Encompassing RNG FactorPayDay 2 is legendary in its irritating manner in which players aquire weapon parts and mask materials through the use of RNG. This is a rather poorly thoughtout way to attempt to artificially extend gameplay well past the point of enjoyment and fun sometimes. Some people (Not all people) on PayDay 2 have a crazy amount of hours spent on the game specifically grinding for very specific weapon parts and mask materials they need or want. Plenty of PayDay 2 players know exactly how they wish to build their weapons for specific situations and heist and also for their specific style of gameplay. Overkill should just make an in-game store for Gage A.K.A (""The Weapons Dealer"") for players so they can simply purchase the weapon parts (Grips, Muzzles, Weapon sights, Weapon stocks...etc) they need with in-game cash for a specific scenario or heist without the hassle of praying to the stars above that the RNG gods gives them something useful after a mission. Some people might be quick to point out that there is something similar to what I just mentioned already in-game BUT the way PayDay 2 does this revolves around gambling & RNG chance rendering it yet again useless. You're gambling away massive amounts of money on the POSSIBILITY you MIGHT get something you really need. And you don't even get to pick what specifically you need but rather you choose the category from which it randomly drops. Gambling away massive amounts of your money at the very low possibility you'll get what you actually need does not seem very tempting ultimately and therefore I've only used this feature 3 times and never again after that.*Update* (Jan 23, 2017)And yes I'm well aware the many people pointing out the fact you can buy weapon mods with continental coins but that too just brings up a big question. WTH was wrong with simply using in-game cash for weapon mod purchases rather than having to kick out continental coins??? Why make purchasing weapon mods a task in itself? Why further undermine the value and usefulness of in-game cash by tossing an optional arbitrary currency into the mix? Continental are also used to upgrade the new hideout so if I have to choose between upgrading the hideout vs buying weapon mods, more times that not I'm gonna upgrade the hideout. Because to be honest the hideout without any upgrades in it is rather underwhelming to say the least. Some say upgrading the new hideout is optional and to a degree that's true. But at the same time SOME of the hideout upgrades have a function and purpose which renders upgrading your hideout rather necessary at times depending on your play style. I mean come on there are people out there with mountains of cash in their offshore accounts and nothing to really spend it on. The money in most people's off shore accounts could easily upgrade the hideout for gosh sakes if they were given the option.			"

												This game had me hooked up from the get go. A coop shooter in which you're the bad guy and rob everything in your way. The game definetly has a lot of good things going for it in its current state, a huge weapon and skill system that lets you customize your heister to your very own liking with masks that are purely cosmetical, but a nice addition nonetheless.The point of this review isn't the great and fun dynamic gameplay I believe this game has, its about overkills marketing decision.I always accepted the bunch of dlcs as a way to support a small developer that doesnt work on a lot of projects, however it was always a bit shady. Now with the introduction of the free crimefest event that was about reaching community set in-game goals they took the cake though.Overkill introduced a skin system similar to what csgo has, not only are the key prices too high, but the skins will actually affect your gameplay now giving you statistic boosts to your weapons. e.g making them more accurate/powerful.I simply cant by any means support this business decision and will leave this game a negative review until we get an official statement by overkill adressing this issue.I am aware of the hours I put into this game and as I said i had a lot of fun with it and I will most likely continue playing, but cant with a good heart continue supporting this company if this is the direction they're going.I would advise new players to stick to the vanilla game which offers enough great and fun hours with friends, but dont support this decisionmaking by overkill.Cheers.Edit: After a long time I've decided to check up on payday again and see where it stands now and what happened since the crimefest fiasco.To my surprise it seems like overkill caved under the pressure the community put on them and revamped the system properly. While I appreciate the move I will leave this review as it is as a reminder. ♥♥♥♥ micro transactions 😀🖕As I stated already the game has a lot of content to discover and the rpg like system allows for a lot of unique setups and techniques in your heists.cheers once again.

The payday 2 community have supported Overkill and keeping it alive, but now i fear payday 2 will die. To all people that are thinking about trying this game, keep away!

												New review-----------------Hello! I thought I would write up a new updated review for PAYDAY 2. As you can see, I have spent quite some time in the game doing all kind of challenges and livestreams with it. Sadly, I wanted to change my review from good to bad.The universe surrouding the game is quite interesting and they manage to keep it that way. I think the voice actors and some of the devs are trying to add a few interesting things here and there, I was in particular very surprised with the trophy system and found it to be an enjoyable experience, as well as completing the safehouse itself. The game is complete and is constantly being worked on all the time. Yes there are a lot of DLC, but if there weren't, the game would simply be dead as of now.Now for the reasons I find the game has evolved in a very negative way: Whilst PAYDAY 2 is trying to keep its atmosphere (although we have a lot of collab nowadays), the gameplay has suffered a big deal these past few months and the total inability of the gameplay devs to renew interest in PAYDAY 2 has made crystal clear they aren't willing to work on their game as much as they are used to. We entered some kind of ""exaggeration era"", such as having 8 possible hostage cops, 24 turrets altogether, being able to go down forever with the Revenant skilltree, the bad HP/damage scaling of One Down, etc.The game barely makes sense when it comes to gameplay, poisoned arrows will kill a strong one down unit in a single blow and yet T1 weapons will underperform even on lower difficulties. A lot of people have suggested ideas during the beta feedback periods but it never got anywhere, and I just feel like they did betas just because their employers asked them to and not because they would truly admit some mistakes were made in terms of general gameplay. Skills, decks, weapons and difficulties all need to be reworked on, and during the previous beta I participated in Overkill went ahead and changed a subpar difficulty, where end-game needed a lot of changes instead. 7 difficulties is way too much, 4 would have been enough and simplified their work by a long shot. After submitting ideas after ideas I kind of gave up and would not recommend the game in its current state. It will be fun for a while but the loads of DLC is not worth the investment anymore.(these are my own ideas and opinions, not facts, you may enjoy playing it yourself)			"

												Bugs, glitches, crashes, abysmal update system, rampant cheaters, abusive community moderators, developers lying about microtransactions, ridiculous DLCs - this game has it all. I sure had fun times playing PAYDAY 2, but negativity outweigh positivity by a large margin.The core gameplay and music are quite good I'll admit that. However I promise that there will be a moment when there's nothing left in this game but annoyance.The graphics were simplistic to begin with but now it's laughable. The gore is non-existent and the way rag-dolls work makes kills unsatisfactory. The game is a time sink and a cash grab. Do you want that nice flashlight attachment? How about you waste a couple hundred hours grinding only to get a pile of masks and stupid patterns? And next thing you know, you're buying badly painted but expensive skins with pre-installed attachments. The difficulty is very inconsistent. You can spend half an hour playing normal when all of a sudden a dozen of special enemies charge and immobilize your whole crew. But it's more likely that you won't play the game that long 'cause it will crash.The way developers update the game and the frequency of those updates is nonsensical. Each update makes even top PC struggle, making it straight unusable for an hour or more which forced me to delete the game and redownload the whole thing every time update occurs. And with 100+ major updates and hundreds of ""hotfixes"" (and most updates turn the game into bug infested mess) it became the most annoying thing I've experienced in videogames. Also they constantly change the stats and perks forcing you to waste hours adjusting your build for no good reason. The company is run by greedy bullies who attack paying customers if they feel that certain achievement was unlocked too quick. They want you to grind same boring heists all day long for months until you buy all $140+ DLCs and boosted skins to win and even then they'll find the way to screw you over. Joined a lobby with a DW heist that is about to end? Too bad, you're a cheater now.Shame on you, Overkill.			"

												This was off of many people's radar but generated a ton of buzz around launch time, rightfully so. The character classes offer different play styles and the skills can be mixed and matched to the players desire. There's no campaign mode or true storyline, missions are layed out and you can play through them however you choose, unlocking more as you level up and build a stronger character. Missions often get replayed several times, especially as you decide what your favorite type of job is but it hasn't become boring in the slightest because every job has played out differently with changes in the difficulty, people you play with and randomized layouts. Don't waste your time on the offline mode, it'd be worthwhile but the part that kills it is the AI won't carry items for you, leaving you to move the mission along if that's the type involved. Other than that they're smart and can handle themselves in a firefight.Overall, Payday 2 is one of my favorite co-op games. If you like shooters and can suspend the lawful good part of your brain for a bit, and have friends to play with, you can't go wrong with this game.

												When I wrote this review, the game was good. But since then the game turned into a mess. Ignore everything below - UpdateIf you're not the type of gamer that play games in multiplayer, you will not enjoy Payday 2. However when playing with three other people is when the game really shines.Payday 2 offers heists that can be completed without being spotted. You can tie down people as well as security cops, making them your hostage so they won't set of the alarm as you sneak around inside the building, and get away with your loots. However, if you mess up the stealthy part and the alarm goes off, the gameplay changes. Wave after wave, what feels like an entire army of cops will sacrifice themselves trying to prevent you from escaping with the loot. The cops very often behave like they don't really know what they're doing, and can easily be taken down one by one. But the amount of cops can overwhelm you if they catch you off guard.Payday 2 have a skill system that is split into four categories, focusing on each their thing. One of them is the Mastermind tree that focuses on making you the 'Healer' of the group, while the Enforce tree makes you a freaking Tank. As you level up (Current level cap is 100), you have far enough points to fill up the tree that fits your playstyle, or combine different skills from every tree to really customize your character. The same goes for weapons. You can have two weapons on you, a main and second one, that can all be very well modified as you like. The same goes for Masks.The way you receive weapon mods, masks and things to customize your masks, is based on luck. At the end of each heist you complete, you get to choose one of three cards laying next to each other with heads down. The card you choose will decide what sort of item you receive, and it is chosen randomly. I think there should be a better way to obtain weapon mods that isn't based entirely on luck.Overall I really enjoy Payday 2 and my complains with the game are minimal. I wish it offered more options regarding the stealth part of the game, and I hope the cops will become smarter over time and really fight you back. It is good as it is now however, and I will recommend it!			"

												Used to be a good game until free weekends and 75% off sales obliterated the community; now it's nothing more than morons who actually need to ask if a lobby is doing stealth on a stealth only mission (Shadow Raid - the clue is in the damn name).Aside from those idiots you also have the idiots who feel the need to join what is blatantly a stealth lobby (suits, silenced weapons, ECMs/body bags etc) in armour, with loud weapons and don't even ask if it's safe to spawn into the game, often ruining what at times can be a decent stealth run.I now sincerely regret sinking so much money into this game, as through it's life the game has seen more bugs added than have been fixed, and what started off as a relatively decent community now seems inundated with - and now for the stereotyping - morons who play CoD.

												Crimefest introduced crates and keys. The skins aren't that good looking and can add bonus stats to weapons. If I were to post this review earlier I would've given it a postitive score but I can no longer do that.EDIT: More safes were added. This time they add skins that boost your stats AND rewards for finishing a heist. This is also considered part of the ""completely cosmetic"" Completely Overkill Pack for some reason.

												A ""free"" reward isn't adding microtransactions to your game. A lot of people who play this game have bought over $100 worth of DLC, and yet you guys at OVERKILL STILL want more money? When will you stop trying to squeeze every last dollar out of what were once your most adamant fans?			"

												What can I say. I was hoping this would be a fun coop game that eventually led to moments of regret and moments of stupidity among the community. Payday 2 is the action and coop game that involves you and fellow heisters in commiting crimes around Washington DC in order to make the big bucks to acquire different masks, weapons and perks. As someone who very much dislikes the act of robbing banks just for fun or any kind of heist I was reluctant to buy it until I was encouraged by friends to play it.Let me list the pros and cons of the game:Pros:- Coop gameplay- Good replayability (once to get past level 1 infamy)- Playable characters (Jacket is my favourite)Cons:- Microtransactions- Crap ton of DLC- Repetitive- Worst of all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.As much as I would have loved this game I simply can't because the community is the worst I've seen, the DLCs just keep coming along with the frequent updates (some as big as 2-3 GB), microtransactions as if the DLC wasn't enough, and the repetitiveness of the heists.Was nice knowing you but I'd say spend your money somewhere else and not here.

												I used to love this game.The DLCs were relatively substantial and provided good content, and I enjoyed playing heists with friends and public groups alike. It was fun.At first, the DLCs started to go downhill. They'd skimp on content, maybe only offering a couple guns, some masks and melee weapons, for £5 - I wasn't too comfortable with that pricing. Occasionally a heist would be included, but it was rare and in those cases the price would be higher.Then Crimefest 2015 happened, and Payday 2 caught a bad case of microtransactions that ♥♥♥♥ed over the already poor looting system. The community tried to let the devs know that microtransactions were downright cancerous, but they flipped us all the bird from their giant pile of money and continued to pump out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLCs.They don't see a community, just wallets to be emptied.♥♥♥♥ Overkill.

												Alright. After nearly 300 hours put into it, I´m gonna throw my opinion into here as well. For the first hundred, it was a fun and challenging game. I really enjoyed it, I´m not gonna lie. I bought nearly every DLC out there and Hotline Miami was the best thing they ever did (in my eyes. Jacket is life!)Now, it´s obvious that they run out of ideas and that they don´t give a ♥♥♥♥ about the community or the rage that happened on Greedfest 2015. They just stayed quiet, hoping that it will pass eventually. Do you really think that the people will forget it when you bring out a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid safe after safe? I won´t. And I won´t spend my money on ONE single drill because there is no ♥♥♥♥ing reason. And don´t start with ""But the stat boosts! Boooohoooo"", alright? There is a thing called ""GoonMod"" that makes it completely obsolete.Then: The repetitive heists. You can play nearly every heist and you find yourself in the same situation over and over again. Standing somewhere, press and hold the interaction button for a few seconds, run around, shoot cops which got ♥♥♥♥ing boring as well, only to run back and press the button again.So all in all: If you want a DLC overflown game, bundled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Microtransactions and where the Devs don´t listen to the community? This is the perfect game for you.♥♥♥♥ you Overkill. ♥♥♥♥ you.*EDIT!* Well great, the safes are gone and replaced with a free one. Well that´s just greaaat isn´t it? The game is SO much bette- actually no. The game is still a pile of broken down trash. To those people who wanted me to updated this cause this stupid update: Did you really think that would change my opinion? Really? The game is way too ♥♥♥♥ing easy, it´s buggy as hell and you could finish every heist in a few minutes but no. They throw a walls into your way to slow every heist down to a boring, annoying thing I grew to hate.Oh and before I forget it: Good ♥♥♥♥ing job Overkill. They promised two things before Payday 2 was released, remember? No Microtransactions and safehouse customisation. I´m just going to remind you that they still don´t have that out. HOW HARD CAN THAT BE YOU LAZY F-...nah I´m not even going to insult them. Why? Because it´s just like insulting a pile of sh!t and what purpose does that have?			"

												I used to be a very rabid Overkill fan, and sang their praises whenever possible for making fun games and having a solid relationship with the playerbase. I don't know what changed, but starting at release, the game was pretty good. In need of some bugfixes and  had some promises that weren't delivered on (Like safehouse customization, which at the time of this review, to my knowledge is STILL absent.), but the game was good. Slowly free content expansions were released, along with the occasional paid DLC that was usually a weapon pack. However, around the release of the sniper pack, power creep started getting out of control. From the .50 cal being able to one shot Bulldozers on high difficulty (An impossible feat with any weapon prior to it's release), leading up to later DLC's just giving you an RPG launcher. Someone who buys none of the DLC won't have access to things like: Grenades, RPG's, Sniper Rifles, some of the best shotguns in the game, the best ARs in the game. That's not even counting the now rather high number of paid heists (Which in the interest of being fair, can still be played by anyone as long as the host owns the DLC). DLC still, however, started getting out of control.Payday is a very grind heavy game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, it is almost offensive to low level players how poor the payouts for low difficulty missions are, and considering you need large amounts of in game money to add stat altering modifications to your guns or to buy the guns in the first place (And even more money to expand how many slots of inventory you have) a new player almost has to be carried through much less forgiving trials while learning the ropes to start being useful. The skill system also has it's flaws. While they are minor gripes, as the system does keep things interesting with varying builds. Some skills felt like mandatory point sinks, like having to put points into one skill tree for more than 2 cable ties (Which are extremely important for controlling hostages and freeing jailed heisters).But even all of that could be overlooked and the game enjoyed. However, like many ex-heisters, the promise Overkill broke that removed any good will I had for the dev and game was the one of not having microtransactions. It was stated by Almir over a year ago that Payday 2 would never have microtransactions. As of a few months ago, that is untrue. A recent update added a crate/key system much like CS:GO for weapons skins. Big deal right? They're just random drops that are only cosmetic, who cares? Don't be so entitled. Except, they grant stats. That's right, an RNG based microtransaction laden system grants stats to weapons. Even more insulting, a team using multiple boost granting skins receive more payouts than those without, it's about as P2W as you get in a purely PvE game.I liked the game way back, but it has honestly become a DLC bloated, microtransaction filled husk of what I enjoyed, with developers that forgot why they even had a good reputation and sales in the first place. The fans they spat on and told to give them more money. If the game is on sale, as it does so very often, you can get some decent play time out of it. However, buyer beware that your experience without DLC and microtransactions is vastly different from someone with all the DLC.			"

												I honestly can't reccomend this game any more.In the past I was able to overlook the constant DLC practices and horrible mismanagement in favor of the fantastic music, cool (if somewhat mediocre) gameplay, and likeable characters and world. Not any more. The newest ""balance"" update and blatant cash-grab that is the Blackmarket system is absolutely disgusted. I feel personally insulted by Overkill, and I don't know how I've tolerated them for so long.Back to The Heist we go.			"

												I've played my fair share of this game and i can say that i thoroughly regret actually buying this game.Now the game itself had some pretty great potential and i definetly had a lot of fun playing, but it had some pretty big problems since the beginning.In the beginning there were extremely few heists, most of which were just copies of the same bank robbery.I could have lived with that however. I had hoped for more but i would have accepted the little content there was and i would have appreciated for what it is. What i cant accept however is Overkills DLC policy.Sadly DLC has become a huge part of modern games, but Overkill truly takes it to the next level.At the moment there is DLC worth somewhere around 110€ in the game, most of it being guns or gun attachements, but there are also quite a lot of heists hidden behind a paywall. Now i'm sure a lot of people are screaming at the screen right now trying to convince themselves that the DLC is completely optional, that however is only half true.Because what is a heisting game without the heists?You're not going to enjoy this game too much with only the basegame heists and the free updates that come along every year or so dont really add that much gameplay either.Now aside from the DLC, they added another feature to the game, which basically gives you gun skins which gives you a bonus to your stats. These gun skins can only be optained from saves which can only be opened with drills that you have to buy with real money. This cs:go esqué pay2win update has been the last straw for me.Overkill tries to squeeze the most they can out of the customer with the least amount of work possible.A big amount of content they have added to the game over time, actually came from the modders in the payday community. Overkill literally copies their code and charges you for it.And if you ever try to criticise them on the steam forum you can expect your posts to be removed instantly and you may even be banned.So, should you give your money to Overkill?No.Not even if the game is on a 90% sale.Dont support these terrible devs and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

I didn't touch GO because of the same reasons.I loved Payday 2, even though it was a tad pricey with all the DLCs, waiting for the sales seemed worth it.

												I hate to do this, I really do. I'm not good with long reviews but let's see how this goes.I've played PAYDAY 2 since May 30th, 2014EDIT: This review isnt complaining about the ♥♥♥♥ing DLC, I bought it all full price, even COP. Read the entire thing before commenting. I will be deleting comments that are attacking me for talking about DLC.Even though I love the PAYDAY franchise I'm beginning to dislike the game, but I'll still play it. I know I will. I can't put my finger on why I do even when I've heard, seen, and witnessed so many bad things happen to this game, from microtransactions to 3 years until we got a feature that was promised on release (and technically isn't even the feature they promised), to so many DLCs that the total price of them (without a sale) totals to around $150 and sometimes DLCs cost more than the ♥♥♥♥ing game itself! They even wanted to sell us advertisements for other movies and games! Now you can say Overkill did remove the microtransactions and have been trying to shape things up from the constant screw ups but whenever they seem to fix something they start a whole other problem, and that problem (to me at least) is how they're handling the game update/community wise.The game has lately been starting to run like total garbage since the Housewarming Party event, even though someone's PC could be way over the requirements the game lists on the store page, even my friend with a GTX 1080 was telling me about how his FPS would drop to the 40s and stay around there during assault waves. Now the only theory I can come up with is that when they overhauled the difficulty, they increased the spawn rate of cops to a very very high amount and the games engine can't handle the cops on the map so everyone's frames just drop like crazy, I've never been able to do a safehouse raid with over 60 fps even though I'm positive my PC can hit that FPS because the game runs fine with almost every other OLD heist, any new heists just run like garbage too. Now I'm expecting someone to leave a comment like ""WELL UR PC IS JUST CRAP NOOB"" but you gotta remember, not everyone has $1000+ to spend on a gaming PC to run this game. Overkill also tend to ignore the topic about this and whenever someone comments about low FPS the forum moderators give simple directions about changing control panel settings but what they don't realize that it's not the PCs fault, it's the game itself (not trying to be mean to the forum mods ur all great <3). I really hope the next big update focuses on the stuff that REALLY needs to be fixed like optimization and desync.My next topic is about the community, lately I've been seeing a lot of new people (and welcome, I hope you are enjoying the game, I'm sure you don't find a lot of nice people to help you out, that's because most of the actual payday community that was here mostly left during 2015 crimefest). This is due to Overkills constant 75% off sales and F2P weekends because they're well, trying to make more and more money to finish that walking dead game that everyone forgot about. But back to the community, the forums these days are mostly just new players asking for help and people begging for DLCs or event masks and people arguing. It really is a shame to see the old community we had just disappear like that. I don't know if its just me but whenever I see a topic on the forums derailed or just becoming a giant argument over something completely off-topic, I get mad. Like I can't stand the constant ♥♥♥♥-fest posts about ""Add this! Give me this! ♥♥♥♥ u ovkl u suk!"" I just wish the community was how it used to be where everyone was nice and helpful to each other.I decided to edit a thrid reason in because its just getting on my nerve, the safes. Yes Overkill made them free, but they drop once a week and only after 10hr playtime in the past 2 weeks (according to most of the community), but if you don't want to wait you can BUY them and give us more money, its ""free"" though isn't it? If Overkill would make the safes 100% free they would've made them drop as common as normal items in the game and everyone can enjoy skins, instead of that they made the safes only weekly drops and most people hate the wait and head to the market to buy safes/skins, ovkl has advertised it as fully free when it really isn't. The weapon customization screen taunts you with the skins you don't have (hell even marking them as ♥♥♥♥ing DLC) and giving you an option to buy them from the market. Skins shouldn't cost a single penny and should be able to be easily obtained at anytime and become as common as masks, and weapon mods so all payday players can enjoy the skins. Overkill has also made the unboxing screen verrrry taunting, mostly to make you think that higher quality skins are common, but they're really not. It makes you want to buy more safes because you think that you'll get a good skin since so many good ones show up so often, but you usually end up with a blue or purple. I know you won't change anything because its making you easy ♥♥♥♥ing money but please, make the safes fully free and drop whenever instead of a set timer.(1/31/2017 Gonna add something else since todays update was meh other than the bug fixes thx for that)Overkill ignores alot of said topics such as, no mercy, the optimization patch, and the desync fixes, and they decide to take some mods, code them to work in the game officially, and call them new features. Work on something we actually want in the game and not usless colabs or mods that already exsist.This game really has taken a bad turn, but I'll still play it because honestly I can't find an experience like PAYDAY, it's just a shame to see how the game is and how its community is.TLDR:  I don't like the way the game is being handled update and community wise, but will continue to play it because of how great of an experience it is with friends.

												Let me start off by recommending a couple of better co-op games: Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead 2, and Team Fortress 2. All of those games have never tried to ♥♥♥♥ their community quite like OVERKILL has.I think Payday 2 is a good game. I would probably call it a great game. However, OVERKILL is just one, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing company with absolutely horrible business practices and service to fans. The game is nearly impossible to play without DLC. You have to buy DLC to have access to almost anything. On top of that, OVERKILL still seems to release bi-monthly DLC and charge for it.Then comes crimefest. The game's community grinded for weeks and got hyped up for a [free, wow] update to the game. What do we get? Microtransactions. Almir gave us microtransactions. Now, this wouldn't be much of a problem. However the gun skins that you buy with these microtransactions gives your guns an actual in game advantage. That's pay2win. Didn't the developers of this game once say that they were never going to have microtransactions in game? Well, they completely went back on it and betrayed their entire fanbase.Crimefest brings free updates? Yeah, You're free to give overkill more money.The day is now October 25, 2015. Overkill made the statement that they would discuss microtransactions with the players after crimefest. If you look here:https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q53ms/crimefest_is_over_ama_discussion_with_almir_on/It's very clear that Almir and overkill had no intention to ever remove microtransactions, and no intention to take a discussion with the fanbase seriously. This game was my favorite co-op shooter, and now it has a place in my ""pile of dogshit"" folder along with Bad Rats. I've uninstalled the game, and have no intention of reinstalling unless microtransactions are removed and Almir gives a proper apology and a proper crimefest to the players.♥♥♥♥ you Overkill.♥♥♥♥ you Almir.I hope your ♥♥♥♥ing studio burns down.

												The first installment of this franchise was outstanding. In the beginning, this sequel was even better. Then they started churning out one or two five-dollar DLC every month with a few weapons or a new map. I was okay with that for a while. It was optional and half of them were free.But they really started to pile up. Where other game studios would have been working on their next game, Overkill decided they would just work on one game forever, apparently. To fund this obsession/laziness/whatever it is, they decided to ♥♥♥♥ their customers out of as much money as they would allow. Sadly, many customers allow them to bend them over and have their way with them and then ask for more.They introduced CS: GO style skins that are acquired from paid unboxing, except unlike those kinds of systems, the skins rarely have an additional stat boost. This would already be unbalanced and an unacceptable pay-to-win mechanic that shouldn't exist at all, let alone in a paid game. But to make matters worse, they nerfed many of the weapons already in the game so that people would have to get these skins just to have weapons that work at all.This ridiculous skin fiasco was the immediate predecessor to their still ongoing attempt to make this game a viable 'e-sports' title, because they've ramped their greed all the way up and have decided they need some of that pie in addition to the princely sum they've already milked from their dwindling playerbase.The outcry over their actions was such that even their forum moderators went on strike over it. In their arrogance, they announced a hollow apology while steadfastly refusing to back down from their exploitative practices.Following this game's current trajectory, I expect them to announce a monthly subscription fee some time in the near future. I could say more, but I better hurry up and get this review posted before they start charging $2.99 for it.			"

												Not only is the game littered with DLC, now Overkill has decided to make it into CSGO by adding ""safes"" (crates) that can only be opened with ""drills"" (keys). These safes drop weapon skins that actually effect the stats of the weapons. Their so-called ""free"" Crimefest update added nothing but more ways to give them money.			"

												Almost 1,000 hours into the game and this happened:Microtransaction system added during four year birthday of Payday; with some of the items (i.e. weapon skins) giving better stats.Very disappointing move from Overkill, especially because they make tons of profit from the DLCs.			"

												Enjoyed it occasionally with friends.Friends convinced me to buy DLC since they absolutely love the game and the company.Was always kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that we all paid full AAA game price + expensive AF DLC but my friends liked it so I rolled with it.Because of this I went out of my way to try not to get too involved into the game as I didn't like all the money and time that seemed needed to get the most out of this game.Microtransactions made it one giant middle finger towards my friends.A game that was great to play with your squad does a complete 180 in terms of quality standards.I would not recommend it in this state especially.If it had minimal paid DLC, and no microtransaction BS then it would be much better.This goes to show though that these companies do not care about us.Let this be a lesson to all.

												Im upset to give this game a negative review, but I just cant reccomend it at this point in timeI havent ever played PAYDAY: The Heist before. I dont have strong feelings towards 'the older days"" of PD2 either. I started playing this game after update 100 actually, so take this review with a grain of salt if youre someone with like 1000k hours in both PDTH and PD2This game is still fun. I mean that. Grab some friends, or try your luck with randos but the game is damn fun to play. It's unfortunatly plagued by desync, bugs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players. Despite that, you can have a good laugh with this game. The game also has a LOT of hackers, be it just using DLC unlockers (which honestly doesnt bother me one bit, because DLC is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but thats for later) to full on spawning 255 bags on Cook Off One Down and crashing your game, or boosting you to instant Level 100.So, why is the review negative? DLC and (altough theyre now not a thing anymore) Microtransactions. There is TOO. MUCH. DLC for this damn game, AND IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR DLC. Seriously $5.99 for like 4 weapons, some masks I probably hate, and other ♥♥♥♥ I dont care about. The biggest issue is this game is borderline Pay2Win because the BEST STUFF is LOCKED behind DLC. Maybe if the DLC was like .99 like when it's on sale it'd be ok, but it's not. Thankfully it goes on sale all the time. I've unfortunatly bought about half the DLC (all on sale mind you) and probably will buy more.The microtransactions. Why are they so bad? Well besides the fact that MTs are cancerous anyways, NEED I LINK THE INFMOUS (ha!) ARTICLE? ""PAYDAY2 promises no microtransactions."" It's pretty scummy. I WILL however give credit to OVK and Starbreeze because they did FULLY remove MTs after update 100 I believe. Thats pretty admirable. But the damage is still done.TLDR: Game is fun, but has numerous problems with preformance and optimization, and too much stuff is locked behind overpriced DLCIm sorry PAYDAY2, I love you, but I hate you too			"

												Payday 2 was an immensely entertaining game that did a great job of making you really feel as though you're robbing a bank, jewelery store, whatever. Lots of fun, great multiplayer coop play. Now, though, despite assurances from the publisher that this would never happen, it's gone pay-to-win. You can now buy skins that increase player stats through microtransactions. They've also removed the LUA hook, so there's no modding. I would not recommend this game in its current state. Nobody likes pay-to-win and everybody likes modding. A pity. "

												A quite unique co-op fps/stealth game.I bought Payday 2 on release, played for about a month and uninstalled it. It was ok back then but lacked content (very few levels, no end game content) and was buggy (guards could see through walls which ruined stealth for me).Now I'm getting back to the game and I'm surprised how much it improved. There's a lot more missions, equipment, the Death Wish difficulty for real challenges and a very nice Infamy system too keep you playing after level 100 .What's better is that the devs keep adding things and have more updates scheduled. That's a very good way to keep the game alive.I could complain that half of the DLCs cost money, but then again another half is free and at least the cash flow is used too keep improving the game.The mechanics are solid, both shooting and sneaking feels nice. The graphics are good for today's standards. The voice acting is superb – so are the 'miniseries' intros filmed with real actors.The game still has some bugs, the worst being connection issues, but nothing I can't live with.The community is pretty ok. I see almost no trolls and griefers. Most pub players don't communicate though, so it's best to play with friends or meet some people on the official forums.But let me warn you – the game is extremely grindy. But then it gives you enough challenges and rewards too keep the grind interested.All in all Payday 2 is one of the best co-op games on Steam and a very good choice for both fps and stealth game enthusiasts.

												Is it worth it? Is it worth it to lose almost every single one of your loyal fans, many of us who had been playing since the first game? Is it worth it to lose all of our cash when we reluctantly kept buying your DLC ♥♥♥♥♥torms? Rant ahead. This game used to be pretty amazing when it first came out. Sure, it didn't had much content, but it was still fun. Updates were frequent and most of them were free, with new heists and stuff like that. Then, the DLC ♥♥♥♥ storm came. A gun pack here. Another gun pack over there, a new paid heist here. That was decent. I mean, the first KF had gun packs. If you don't count re-skins...Just 3 of them. This one? A ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ TON. Most of them include gimmicky weapons that aren't really that useful in game, like fire weapons, and guns that you'll never use, just for the sake of curiosity. Tons of lore unfriendly characters, that felt like somebody keeps adding their Original characters (Do not steal), messing up with the lore and history of the characters by forcefully inserting new acquaintances that were never before seen. And what's worse, this game is pretty much a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ now. It ♥♥♥♥♥s itself for cash and keeps doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crossovers that are lackluster at best, atrocious at worst. I mean, I was okay with having ♥♥♥♥ing Keanu Reeves in game, but then after a while, came the whole ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID Goat Sim crossover that makes me want to kill myself. The problem is, lots of these DLCs come out once or twice per month, and they are obviously rushed. In true Overkill fashion, these DLC packs, heists, and weapons often come INFESTED with bugs, sometimes even game breaking. Well, we still had plenty of DLC shoved up our asses and stuff, it's...Okay...And then...The major ♥♥♥♥♥torm came.....Overkill decided to add microtransactions in game. After they said years ago that they wouldn't, ""Shame on us"" if we thought otherwise. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon skins (Because now what CSGO did is going to haunt us all, right? Because it makes more dosh?). The worst part is, they actually changed stats on the weapons. They had stat boosts. That's right, the game became pay to win for a bit. Overkill tried to save their asses from the ♥♥♥♥♥torm of biblical proprtions that almost ravaged them, and they can't get rid of the hatred they earned even to this day. First, ""Oh wait guys! We'll actually give each of you a free skin! Heh, that's what you want, right?"" Then, they got rid of the stats (I think)TL;DRThis game is still the cheap ♥♥♥♥♥ that does crossovers with everybody, the skins are still there, and you'll get ♥♥♥♥ tons of overpriced, buggy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC on a monthly basis. Do not bother with this game. It used to be pretty cool, but those days are long gone. I enjoyed this game. It's a shame that it had to die in such a long, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. Do not support these scummy developers, get another game.			"

Overall, this game is about heisting or robbery. Maybe you have an alter ego to have a criminal life? No? Well, i can say this game is about Bag thrower/Drilling/Picklocking/""F"" and ""G"" Simulator.- Slapped the guard with money, and he's dead.- Shouting ""Get the fu*k up!"" will save your partner from dying by a magic skill. Bullets in his body just gone.- You'll learn how to cook meth from a guy who just search it on internet. Heisenberg made a blog!- Giancarlo Esposito played as The Dentist in The Big Bank DLC. Breaking bad?- Keanu Reeves, umm i mean John Wick as new PAYDAY member with dual gun skill.- Old Hoxton is back!Review for pay to win the dlcs:So many dlcs. Probably, i won't update the review anymore.- If you want to buy dlcs, Gage Mod Pack and Sniper Pack are recommended for better mod and sniper to take care the law enforcers especially dozer's family.- Light Machine Gun from Gage Weapon Pack 2? Nah! Hard to aim because you can't aim through scope unless you got laser equipped. High spread and recoil. Not really recommended unless you want to be Rambo.- Gage shotgun pack is mediocre dlc. You'll get some new shotguns and bullets but non-dlc shotguns already good. But HE round, a new bullet type for shotgun is awesome. Like grenade but smaller explosion. It can stun dozer for a while by one shot. Good for crowd control. If you are surrounded by law enforcers, this will make them fly. Keep those helm...bodies flying!- Assault Rifles from Gage Assault Pack are good for you who like variety or probably if you are bored using a heavy modded CAR-4 which is ""best AR"" (i think) can switch to ARs from this dlc with acceptable stats compared that CAR-4 and high rates of fire. But you have to do the achievements first to unlock the new AR's mods. Gage Mod Pack is still enough if you don't want to spent money to this dlc. TL;DR FAMAS guys?- Hotline Miami DLC has good secondary weapons like UZI and Skorpio. Also, the heist isn't stealthable. So, loud and proud?			"

												""We will be giving out free content on crimefest""        - Overkill ,the day before they introduced microtransactionsEDIT: I have just nominated payday 2 for the new Steam Game Awards under my proposed category : ""worst dlc policy""More thorough review:I´ve been playing this game for quite a while now ( with 400+ hours)and I enjoy it a lot!It has a good core concept and is fun when enjoyed with friends.I used to think of Overkill as a great developer who cares about it`s community more than it cares about the shekels.HOWEVER my opinion of Overkill has severely changed in recent months and thus my opinion of this game. I can no longer support the developers and how they are treading the game and the community.The game is getting arguibly worse with every new dlc introduced ( and there are a countless number of dlcs already) so that a new player can not possibly enjoy the game without the dlcs, ergo without putting A TON of money into it.Over the years they have made a lot of promises to improve the game but have hardly kept any.They introduced micro transactions which are not just cosmetic but can enhance your skills and thus in a minor way introduced a pay to win system.They hardly listen to the community anymore and thus i dont want to support this game any longer.

												Can't recommend this game for the life of me, Its one of the most repetitive games that I have ever played, Ton's of DLC (Some of the DLC should be free.), Tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Lots more than most games), and now Microtransactions! This game really has it all doesn't it? The devs lied about bringing free new content multiple times over the past years that still haven't been released. Maps are small and the game has terrible Optimization, Pass.If you thought the DLC was bad before, the Microtransactions are the final nail in the coffin.EDIT: Whelp, In an AMA today, It was confirmed that Overkill has no plans to remove Microtransactions from the game. The game's average review score is dropping every day, and if it keeps up it'll probably be to 50 by November.			"

												Let me just quickly list off the things that ruined this game for me personally, and that anyone who might be interested in purchasing this game should know before buying. I do not make this review lightly, and I myself have played the game thoroughly. I however cannot forgive some of this game's faults. They are the following:-Terrible money-grab DLC's. The gage shotgun pack is perhaps the worst here, and in my opinion the courier pack is perhaps the best (simply due to the fact that you now have some slight control over what gun attachments you are getting). But to pay $5+ to recieve a few specific guns only to have all of the modifications locked behind impossible to get achievements is ridiculous. For example, ""Unusual Suspects"" in the Watchdogs job, you have to complete the mission with four different friends all wearing different DLC masks. This is an obvious ploy to convince your friends to waste their money on the DLC as well so you can get the mods the achievement unlocks. While you are not necessarily forced to buy the dlc content, the game does get dull after a while, and the presence of all the DLC makes it all the more obvious that if you want a few more hours of gameplay out of this game the devs are going to milk you for all it's worth and then some.-Mob spam. What's that? You crave more difficulty? Instead of perhaps, improving the AI, allow us to instead drown you in a sea of tasers and shields to create the illusion of difficulty!-Specials are ridiculous. Shields are perhaps the most annoying considering they trace your exact movement to the point that they will clip the shield through their body to block you. Don't expect to be able to shoot their hands or feet either. Tasers have a tendency to hit you through cars, and they have almost no cooldown from what I can tell. Cloakers, clearly equiped in light armor, can take up to 3 shotgun shells to the face before finally dying. I'd say the only thing done right are the bulldozers.-There are no real tactics once you've gone loud. Expect to everyone to just run around the map. You honestly can't completely hold a position or a room due to the AI's instict of simply walking right up to you (or THROUGH you). Your team full of random people will most likely just be wandering the map doing their own thing unless it's strictly stealth. AI can hardly use cover. The game will basically zerg you to death.-This game uses card draw at the end of every heist to determine if you get a mask, a mod, a pattern (for mask), instant cash, or a colorscheme (for pattern). Cards tend to get very repetitive very fast. This alone would be fine, but the game has a way of punishing you for trying to farm these cards by debuffing your experience points (The largest exp reduction I have recieved was -15%, which is quite significant on Overkill). You will undoubtedly reach a point in the game where you have more money than actual stuff to buy.-AI teammates are the definition of useless. They cannot grab bags, they will not restart drills, and hell-- they can't even shoot straight. Basically the only thing you'll be doing by having AI teammates is giving yourself a couple of bullet sponges while you do all the actual work. They also have really bad judgement over weather to shoot the enemy or revive you, so expect the AI to do neither effectively.-No system for migrating hosts. Doesn't matter how long you've spent on a heist, if the player who started the lobby disconnects, all of your time has essentially just been wasted. This is a giant problem.-Game will randomly go out of sync. AI can be random places compared to other people's game. It gets especially confusing when AI flip a switch when in your view they are on the other side of a wall.- Finally, pay and experience don't really seem to correlate with mission difficulty. Some missions just aren't worth doing unless you're going for either variety or a skull mask.All-in-all, the game is definitely bearable, but having steam friends who play the game aswell was pretty much the only reason for the amount of hours I've poured into this game. These things I have listed are simply what finally drove me away from the game. (Also, anyone who feels so inclined as to try to give me tips on how to play the game, don't bother. I've logged over 200 hours into this game. I've figured everything out, there is really nothing you could possibly inform me of that I don't already know. If you have any objections as to the things I have stated I will revise this review accordingly.)			"

												This is one of my favourite games. I really enjoy it and always come back to it. It's a great game. There's just one problem. Overkill do not deserve your money. They somehow lucked out in making a really fun, really popular game and then ruined it with crap updates and awful money grabbing business practices. It's a shame Overkill are such a horrible company, because I still really like Payday 2.UPDATE: Overkill believe money is more important than their community. ""By introducing the Black Market update, we have already been seeing numbers that justify the existence of the system."" https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q53ms/crimefest_is_over_ama_discussion_with_almir_on/cwc4u1mI have no interest in returning to this game at all unless there is a serious shift in Overkill's attitude.

												Payday 2 is 20 gigs of broken, ugly looking, glitchy disappointment. On top of the repetitive gameplay, bugs, terrible matchmaking, outdated graphics, etc. there's over 100$ of DLCs + microtransactions (keys and cases like in cs:go or tf2) that offer you stat boosted weapons (they're also skins, WOW!) you can only get using real money. Even though the CEO of Overkill himself said ""We've made it clear that Payday 2 will have no microtransactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!),"".The fact that some months ago user reviews were over 95% positive and now they're below 76% gives you a good idea of how the devs treat the community. If you still decide to try this game despite this review and many others keep in mind that more than 50% of content you can only get if you buy the DLCs. If I had to say something nice about the game I guess it would be the soundtrack and the concept of the game.			"

Please note that this review is a year old now, and I haven't kept track of changes to the game since then, I just keep seeing more DLC flood in so I have no intention to return.Put those torches and pitchforks away, and hear me out.I liked Payday 2, or rather Payday 2.0.I played this game quite a bit in the period it was released in, it was fun, challeging if you played on higher difficulties, enemies were fun to fight and skills were worth getting.But since then Overkill has been throwing DLC at the community which it never asked for, or in a different way.In it's current state, the only way to play is going rambo, as stealth is impossible now, there are TONS of tedious achievements like ""Wear this DLC mask and use this DLC gun to kill 69 enemies which only spawn so often"", it seems like every time the community figures out a good strategy to beat a heist Overkill is there to nerf it into oblivion, making the game less and less fun.There are also quite some bugs that have been there since the launch which have never been adressed, like teleporting enemies and so on..Payday 2 had, and still has a lot of potentional, but Overkill needs to stop making it too hard and too unrewarding to play, and instead listen to the community.Edit as of the 31st of may:Stealthing has been tweaked, it's not as easy and viable as it was before, but I'll let you decide if that's good or bad.Since I wrote this review there has been more DLC, now you need to pay to play with Machine Guns or Snipers, which are in my opinion standard pieces in your arsenal in a FPS, it's a shame to see you need to pay for them.Overkill has been releasing new free heists though, but I'm still put off with the growing collection of DLC locked guns/missions.

												The game isn't terrible, but it doesn't seem to be 'complete'. Although it far exceeds Payday: The Heist (More realistic gun mechanics, unlocks, customizable weapons, masks, customizable masks, quite a lot of new stuff in general), they failed to release things that they (1) Promised to release and were (2) In the original Payday.The game itself gets very repetitive, very fast. At first, it'll be fun. You get to choose how you want to handle the robbery. However, there aren't exactly a lot of ways to handle said robbery. Soon after completing one a few times, you'll come to realize this.Anyway, enough explaining, I'll get right to the pros/cons.Pros----------------- Partially Realistic Weaponry- More ways to complete a robbery- More weaponry- Customizable weapons- A few classic units from Payday: The Heist still exist here- Planning Phase in lobbies, blueprints and optional upgrades in said phase.- For those that hate the game, it's a piece of cake to cheat on. Literally no punishment is handed out.--------------------Cons------------------ Frequent payed DLC's are released, mostly stuff that was promised to be added to the main game.- Forum threads deleted to silence people who accused the Payday 2 developers of lying (which they certianly did)- Past level 40, you'll realize that there's hardly anything 'new' to do in the game other than grind- Very limited amount of robberies, although there are more than there are in The Heist- Card System: You get a random 'bonus' after completing a robbery. Sometimes it's cash, others experience, sometimes it's a modification, a mask, a mask modification, etc. You may ask why this is bad - it's the ONLY way to get these things. It's literally 100% luck.- One less AI on your side in Singeplayer, as if it wasn't already hard enough to solo.- 30% of the game is pretty much just a bag throwing simulator.- Repetitive heists; you've seen one of them, you've seen all of them.- Usual heist: (1) Infiltrate the place. (2) Get into the vault. (3) Grab the loot. (4) Take the loot and attempt to dodge bullets (and fail) while heading to the escape van. (5) Escape. Every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, it's the same thing, just a different map.- ""Five dollars to buy grenades? Seriously?"" - I see a lot of people comment on the weapon packs. Honestly, you can live without them if you're willing to give up a few achievements and slightly more firepower.- Takes a relatively high-end computer to run decently on low settings.- Annoying as hell AI; I've once had a Bulldozer spawn right in front of me. Guess what happened next.- Cheaters. Recently, their populations has slowly been dropping, but they still exist. The game has no anti-cheat whatsoever, so they're free to come back and destroy the game once more, and other people have nothing stopping them from cheating. Yet.- I could go on for hours about this, but that's the summary.----------------------Overall, this game isn't worth the money. Take it from someone who's tried Payday: The Heist, Payday 2 Beta, someone who has the DLC's for the games, and has given each a lengthly amount of time in-game.I'd give this game a 4/10, taking into consideration the developers will silence any criticism that they can possibly find. Maybe when they start giving us free DLC's that should have been in the damn game in the first place I'll change my rating of this game. Only reason I still bother to hop onto it is for it's achievements. (Yes, I'm insane.)If you want something that's more of a rage-game than a robbery game, Payday 2 is the game for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and forget this game. If I could get a refund, I sure as hell would.EDIT - 5/28/2014 - Overkill has been releasing a lot of (terrible) DLC for the game recently, as well as paying very little attention to the bugs in the game, plus the ridiculous amount of cheaters. (They fix a good amount of bugs, but there's a helluvalot more that they fail to fix.) - They reduced the size of the game, yes, but it's still a massive wait for an update/reinstall. Alongside that, their idea of an anti-cheat is to label someone as a cheater in-game. THAT'S IT. Surely by now, they'd have a better idea as to how to track down modified .lua files. Anyway, the rest of the review still stands as it is, just with a lot of terrible weaponry added and a whopping 2 new heists after many, many months of waiting.Another EDIT - 6/17/2014 - They're starting to add heists to the game that were originally promised to be thrown into the game. Now you get to pay an extra $7 for ONE EXTRA HEIST that is a tiny bit larger than a normal one.Edit 2.5 - 6/17/2014 -  It turns out they also have a minus-boost system in place; if you play the same heist more than once in a row, you get a decrease in the amount of exp you get. So, getting to level 100 5 times to finally get all 5 Infamous ranks will take what was originally weeks to what is now months. Hope you enjoy.If you play one heist over too many times, you get a 100% minus-boost permanently. Likely a bug, but that's Overkill for you.EDIT - 2/27/2014 -  Alright, they're starting to actually fix things in the game - of course, with every new DLC they throw at us, the developers break more things than they've ever fixed. Alongside that, cheaters are still not being punished. Ever since Payday: The Heist (Payday 1), nothing at all has been done about cheaters. Not a single ban, not a single temporary ban, not a single ♥♥♥♥ has been given. If you do grab this game, make sure you check everyone's profile that you've got in your lobby to ensure they do not have a large amount of achievements unlocked within a very short timespan in Payday 2 to ensure they do not cheat.EDIT: 7/3/2014 - Removed the con 'uninstalling and reinstalling the game'. What I meant by that is the game automatically unzips an entirely new download of itself, then just overwrites the updated files, rather than downloading only the updated files. They seem to have fixed this issue.EDIT: 8/3/2014 - Apparently people insist that are very few cheaters in the game. Personally, I come across an absurd amount of them, but most other people seem to never come across any. I'm likely just unlucky. Rather or not you want to pay attention to the (possible) cheater population is up to you. Personally, I've come across a lot less cheaters in the past week or so, so perhaps they are correct. Also modified the 'Cheaters' con.			"

												Payday 2 is a great game ruined by the developer's greed. Most of the content within Payday 2 is locked behind a paywall, all the good weapons are locked behind a paywall, all the weapon attachments are locked behind a paywall, and all the good maps are locked behind a paywall. The game has over $100 dollars of microtransactions in it, even though previously the developers stated that it would not (Source: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/). The recent update was supposed to add content ""for free"", another lie since we got CSGO/TF2-esque crates that unlock skins that not only make your gun look awful, but makes them better. Not only that, but the update breaks any mod support that was currently active for the game, including the hud mod that the developers themselves approved of.Would I have recommended this game prior to all the DLC nonesense? Absolutely. However, I would strongly suggest against buying this game now. Unless you are ready to shell out an extra $130 dollars for DLCs, I would recommend spending your money elsewhere. Even then, OVERKILL has lied to their customers multiple times since it's release, so their money shouldn't be going to them anyways.			"

It was generally well-made and I didn't mind supporting a (seemingly) cool company.Microtransactions that are a stepping stone to, if not borderline Pay 2 Win, I am not okay with.Microtransactions as an update that was supposed to be ""Free to the entire community"" is not okay.Poor ""balancing"" changes, that have broken a large number of weapons? That's really bad.Ignoring a Community in uproar about the Update? That's really, really bad.Following up an obviously controversial update with 5 masks, some of which were difficult challenges?

												I've spent more money on the DLC than I have stolen in game. (Satire)My nearly three year experience with Payday 2:So Payday 2 was my first real gaming experience on Steam, so I was completely blind when it came to standards. I loved the game from the moment I played it. It was my favourite game ever, probably because I hadn't really played anything else before, but regardless, it was great. I bought all the DLCs which resulted in more than a hundred bucks down the drain and as you can see, spent well over a thousand hours, which is far more than anything I have in my library.Soon, I came across new games on Steam; Garry's Mod, Left 4 Dead 2, GTA: San Andreas, and playing those games progressively expanded my opinion of a ""good game"". I even played Payday: The Heist, which now I believe is a far superior game than Payday 2, but previously, I constantly neglected these facts and loyally stood by Payday 2 for years. DLC rolled in, and my wallet emptied, and I kept playing, and looking back at it, I feel like a lot of my hours are forced. Don't get me wrong, playing with friends can be a blast, but only until you end up playing every heist at least a few times before they get stale and repetitive.Then, I got Borderlands 2.This was the game that opened my eyes completely. The game that ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped the sense back into me and told me to tell Payday 2 to ♥♥♥♥ off. Payday 2 was the only game with a large number of DLC that I played, therefore my opinion of a ""good DLC"" was low. Very low. Borderlands 2 holds a large amount of DLC as well, but unlike Payday 2, they are actually good. Let me elaborate:In Payday 2, for five dollars, which is around a quarter of the game's full price, you get three reskinned guns, a useless melee,  masks you will probably never wear, and patterns and materials which are just renamed versions of other ones.In Borderlands 2, for 10 dollars, which is around half the game's price, you get a vast expansion for the original game with new quests, features, enemies, and fantastic dialogue and story.You get what I'm going at?Payday 2's DLC model is horrendous. DLC should be an expansion to further increase the enjoyment of the game, not be a necessary purchase to do well. That is the case for Gage's Courier Mod Pack. Without it, guns are stale and not as effective as they would be with the DLC mods. The entire feature of burning enemies is locked behind a paywall. Grenade launchers, which are non-arguably within the game's meta, must be paid for. Most of the time when buying DLC, you'll only be buying it for one or two items in the content, while everything else is just filler garbage. For example, The GL40 grenade launcher is probably the only reason why you need to buy the Gage Assault Pack, since the rest of the guns in the pack can be replaced by vanilla alternatives.The game suffers from other catastrophic issues; desync, crashes, optimization, the list goes on.The community is more toxic than the pizza I try cooking myself.Also, the game has evolved from a game about robbing banks with your friends to a game about stealing goats and nukes. In Payday: The Heist, you actually feel like a proffesional bank robber; limited in supplies but devoted to stealing fortunes in cash and gold bullion, and always struggling to stay alive, but in a good way. In Payday 2, you just feel like a terrorist gunning down hordes of cops with no clear motive, and completing heists without a fret. Half the difficulties are irrelevant.I'm sick of this game, and my biggest regret in life is wasting 50 days as well as hundreds of dollars because of my false loyalty to Overkill. Sure, I'll come back to this game every once in a while, see how it has changed, but in terms of spending more money, I'm done.Don't buy this game. Not even when it's on sale because you'll have to spend more on the DLC. Not even with friends because you'll grow tired and frustrate when you crash on the third day of your perfect run of Rats on One Down. Payday 2's idea was great, but the execution and business model was poor, and I hope that Payday 3 fixes these issues.I've given up. Overkill, you win. You've robbed me of a lot of money and time that I'll never get back. Fix your problems, make a better sequel, I hope you can.			"

												I love these heist scenes from movies, but I've never thought that a heist can be so much fun, until I bought ""Payday 2"". It's an awesome co-op experience which I never had in this way, it's a revolutionary game concept and very interesting. The level- and skills system is amazing and excites you to earn more money with heists. It contains a lot of action, they're four classes for every game style, so everyone should find a suitable character for himself. The way how the same map changes every round is nice, so it's not everytime the same thing, the cameras are changing the postion, the bank manager is leaving the bank from another side, it's not easy to learn the map by heart, so it's always challenging.Graphics: 9/10Sound: 10/10Soundtrack: 11/10 (It's Simon Viklund and his work is amazing so as in true Spinal Tap tradition but this one goes to 11) it's the first soundtrack from a game that I have actually really wanted.Game Mechanics: 9/10 (very solid FPS platform with RPG elements and the heist factor just so addictive; my only issue is how they count what is a ""heist"" which got over stated but still, having 12 heists at launch is fantastic. Stealth is also hard as hell but so much fun.)Replay value: 10/10 (You constantly replay heists but the dynamic layouts and the variability in difficulty, etc. make this game so very much worth replaying)I would recommend this game to everyone who likes heists and intensive, team-based co-op action.

												This is the latest example of a great and fun game that was butchered and ruined by greedy devs.And they're not just greedy. They are two-faced liars. They play the role of ""oh, we're doing something special to you"" while they screw you bad.I'm not talking just about micro-transactions, no. Remember the new infamy update? The one that was in development for 1 year ""because they were working on something truly amazing""? In the end it turned out to be half a dozen masks. All the while they worked and churned out half-arsed DLC that sell for 1/3 of the price of the main game. And all the stupid DLCs are necessary if you want achievements, for example.If you like supporting two-faced lying greedy developers who screw their communities in order to milk and nickel and dime it, buy this game and buy it now.

												for 140 hours of time I gave to play this game. I cannot say that i regret it nor do i hate it. But because of those 140 hours I played, i can say a few things this game has done well and a lot of things it falls short on. pros+Wide variety of guns+Nice boosts for gun skins+Good looking masks+Great ost+Fun with friends+Its interesting at times+guns/masks have great detailThis is okay for a game made in 2011now here's where it breaks down  cons-Too many guns, some are the same provide no other benifit-Microtransactions are a b**tch and you definetly need to buy keys and safes for skins, and hoping for a skin that would give a team buff. Pay to win.-Too many levels that become tiresome and repetitive-Not so fun with randoms -Constant updates that change nothing-Poor backstory for some characters-Poor A.I if playing alone-The horrible community forces you to die. Friendly fire is always on with explosives.( if thats the case then turn it on with the other weapons)-No plot whatsoever-DLC comes out everymonth with the same price tag. half of them are repetitive and also provide no plot-There are only 15 good weapons out of the other bad 43 guns.-Reaching past infamy 5 starts to become pointless when it comes down to the exp bonuses. -Overkill just wants your money. They don't want you to have fun-They brought back four maps from the original. For what reason? Nostalgia? How does that make a game better? It doesn't, it just makes it more bland and tells you ""hey we ran out of ideas, here you go, enjoy four new maps that you already played in PayDay"". What a joke-The Npc look HORRIBLE. Absoultely the most terrifying facial models I've ever seen. They have only one emotion in those faces. ITS JUST A BLANK STARE. The mouths dont even move when they scream or talk or just use the mouth at all. -Why do you think they call it PayDay2? Overall the game falls far to short to be considered an ""okay game"". At most it's mediocre, if not then boring.3.5/10If you want to buy it. dont.If you really want to buy it. dontIf you see it on sale, dont waste your moneyIf you really need to try it. Play it on your friends account.Save your money for a better game.			"

												In this sequel to Payday: The Heist, things have changed. After an IRS audit stemming from failure to report their gains from stealing mayan gold underneath the First World Bank, the Payday gang has been reduced to knocking down jewelry stores and running petty protection rackets in the DC/Metro area. However, the Unitesd States has passed a PATRIOT-like act that gives the FBI ability to respond to any crime, including armed robbery, extortion, jaywalking, and speeding. As such, the DC police force is completely willing to send dozens of officers to their death for $25,000. In addition, special ops units have been mobilized to be part of these FBI detachments, including units with titanium-laden riot shields that can take an inumerable amount of shots from the front, armed units with tazers providing incapacitating amounts of electricity, martial arts experts who are also part-time olympic runners who are put into tacticool suits, and a man in an EOD suit borrowed from the army. The FBI has also taken help from the 'Private Security Firm' Gensec, who is given a cut of the national budget, allowing them to field mercenaries in military gear and armor. Thankfully for the Payday gang, the position of 'bank guard' at GenSec does not require a high school degree, and as such pager operators do not realize that somebody completely different is talking on the other side of the line, at least until he's fallen for it four times. Now you must fight the man by stealing jewelry, breaking stuff, and stealing more stuff all across DC, all the while helping the gym bag industry. Now go forward, and use your cheap drill to break open the vault of a small branch bank in the suburbs.			"

												So these overkill fellows made a fairly nice game. Then they started making money. They started piling it in the safehouse. They realized they could make more, and released a lot of low effort dlc that didn't really hurt you if you didn't get it. That was fine, it was a fairly responsible model and you got decent stuff for getting it and didn't get screwed over for not. Then they made microtransactions, which they had promised they would not do. The community was rightly angry at this, and even the forum moderators protested. Overkill, realizing that what they presumed was a personal atm was now provoked against them, released an apology. But this apology ignored the true problem, and did not retract the microtransactions. Overkill continued breaking its word, and demonstrated that they should not be trusted as a developer. Do not buy this game. The developers care only for your potential as profit, not your enjoyment of the game, and not their own word. Do not buy this game.			"

												Payday 2 used to be one of my favorite games, but that was over a year ago. I stopped playing multiple times, because it was just ruined for me. The problem is that Overkill just stopped taking Payday seriously. Everything is a joke to them. They can't think up any good ideas for game content, so they just make heists based around movies and take mods, that people work very hard on, and shove them into the game not giving credit to the original creator. Most of the community is terrible, you can find some nice people, but most of the community is filled with cheaters and try hard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The normal pricetag is $20, but that won't even get you the full game. The rest of the content is locked behind the $153 paywall of DLC. Some of which you almost have to have if you want to have any chance on higher difficulties. The engine is so old but Overkill keep trying to push it beyond its limit, so there are very frequent crashes. If they stopped making content for this game before crimefest II, then maybe this game could have died a good game. If you want a good 4 player co-op game, I would recommend Payday: The Heist (the first game), but just don't buy Payday 2.			"

												I have 300 hours in this game, I've done every mission. I've completed almost every mission on the hardest difficulty, the only ones remaining being the most recent paid-DLC missions that they added when I stopped playing this game. I've got to V-100 (Max level, max prestige) legitimately. This game is decent but it has far too many problems. Firstly, playing with friends is a blast. Get together with 3 other people and rob a bank, diamond store, etc. Go in stealthily, silently take out guards in an empty corridor or just swagger in while putting a mask over your face and holding a shotgun. That stuff is great at first. If you're an experienced player and friends are new to the game -- Let them host the game and pick the missions. I see too many people catapulting their friends through the levels by doing max difficulty multi-day heists. A natural progression is much more enjoyable for everyone.On to the problems:1) Stealth is broken. A core gameplay mechanic outright doesn't work. In order to stealth consistently you need to use light armour (or a suit) and low profile weapons. If the alarm gets raised, stealth is gone and you need to complete the mission ""loud"". Good luck taking out juggernauts in bomb disposal suits, and 100 assorted law enforcement personnel with your silenced handgun and a suit. It's not realisitically going to happen unless you're already ready to escape.Secondly, stealth is actually broken. Without talking about desync issues in MP (yet): guards will walk through walls, spot you through walls, spot a broken window through 4 walls whilst being at the other side of a building, etc. This breaks stealth and you need to complete the mission loud (as described above). There is no reason for it, it just happens. There is no counterplay or skill-based way of avoiding it, the game will decide at random intervals whether you fail the mission right then for no reason whatsoever.Thirdly, for balance reasons you get a limited number of cable ties to take hostages. This stops them calling the cops, running away (alerting other civilians, etc).  You can also use an ECM jammer, a temporary device that stops people calling police and/or jams cameras. It gives you time to destroy cameras, take hostages, etc. It would be great if it worked consistently: Civilians are randomly able to trigger the alarm while it's up (it's not intended). Yet another feature of the game that will instantly fail a mission because of a bug.Lastly, certain stealthable missions ('Big oil' being the main example) have broken hivemind AI. If one NPC sees you, every NPC in the map immediately becomes alerted and knows your exact position, will raise the alarm, etc. Stealth is a puzzle game with a little bit of RNG. Once you figure out how to stealth a mission, it's solved.2) MP is brokenMultiplayer is broken in many, many ways. It's P2P (which I'm fine with for this format of game). There are random connection problems, sometimes a certain friend can't join you but you can join them; then another friend is able to join you but not them. Other times it will work just fine.Privacy settings are broken. If you make a public lobby it's usually public, but not always. If you make a private lobby, it's sometimes public. ""Friend-only"" is Friends and friends-of-friends to the infinite degree (but only one at once). A friend can join you and while they are in the game, their friend ""X"" can join your games; the original friend is free to leave then. Then any friend of ""X"" can also join, and so on. Bottom line:  They are visibility settings, not restrictions. There are big problems with doing it that way.Hackers are abundant. There are some very basic anti-cheat methods in the game. They don't actually stop people cheating, instead it marks that player as a cheater for everyone in the game. The cheating isn't so much of an issue -- you can host your own lobby if your connection is stable enough or you can just leave an find another lobby (or play with friends!). The bigger issue is 3rd party services (pd2stats) that will check your profile to see if you're cheating. No problem, apart from if you have a private profile on steam you'll be kicked from every public lobby. This is indirectly the fault of the game, the community has been driven to inaccurate methods of detecting people cheating because the game offers basically nothing. Not to mention that those sites will randomly mark you as a hacker for a variety of reasons. If you're max level, prepare to be kicked from every game too: people would rather just kick you than risk playing with a hacker.Sync is broken. Physicals aren't synced, they're all client-side. This is espeically a problem with ragdolls. So enemy positions aren't synced but detection is done on the host. It leads to many things like getting spotted through a wall (NB: This can happen in SP because of a bug anyway). If you shoot a guard, he'll die where he actually is -- not for you though. So that guard who's in a corridor, but actually in the middle of room: Don't shoot him. He'll die in a room full of people and you'll fail. Of course you'll see the corpse in the corridor with no way for anyone to see them, but 3 other people in the game will shout at you for it. So you decide to wait an extra second or two to counteract it (taking into account you may got spotted too!) and you may think you've worked around the issue (nope!). Ragdolls are client-side: The body can ragdoll anywhere on the host and get the alarm triggered. Sometimes the physics can break and you can't answer the guard's pager (required!) and so you fail. That's a fourth distinct way of just failing a mission that's completely out of your control.3) Items are RNG, missions are a grind, difficulty increasesSo you can buy guns, great! Oh, you need an RNG drop to unlock the silencer. When it comes to stealth or max difficulty missions, you need the right loadout from RNG drops. By max level (without prestige) you'll have almost everything you'll need for a lot of missions (But not the perfect gear).Unlocking skills costs money. You get money by doing missions (hurrah!) but you'll quickly find at lower levels that you level up faster than accumulating the required money to actually utilize your level. Don't think about unlocking guns at the same time either.There aren't many different missions. There's quite a few at first, but many of them are pointless after a while. The ""lower level"" missions give very little EXP or money regardless of difficulty. They aren't much easier on the hardest difficulties compared to other missions and in some cases can take longer. It forces you into grinding the same missions over and over. The devs have done a decent job recently in balancing the amounts of EXP and cash earned but it's just not enough.Newer (DLC, free or paid) missions are more difficult than the previous missions. That's cool since it gives a new challenge. Oh? They improved the AI too! Cool. Wow, this is hard and I'm going to enjoy it when I finall-- wait, why is that guy mowing through everything it takes a whole clip to the face for me to kill it. ""lol these new weapons are great"" -- Weapons from paid DLC.4) Free content is ""community DLC""It's not ""free DLC"", it's ""community DLC"" which is free. All you need to do is to join the steam group for the game and you unlock it. New weapons, missions. It's cool until you disagree with a dev and they can decide to ban you from the group. GUIZE WE BAN HACKERZ ND DEY CNT GET FREE STUFFZ! (except of course, they can).Closing: I'm out of characters (there's a limit!). There are so many things broken about this game and I can't list them all. It's fun with friends but it's buggy in many ways. Devs blaming crashes on ""mods"" or hardware or software issues on your end doesn't help either.			"

												A once great game spoiled by Overkill's attempts to make money performed in the wrong way.I used to love this game, as my 1700+ hours will prove, but Overkill has really lost their way here, which is so unfortunate. There is no denying the game is fun but it has so many problems that i can no longer just ignore and hide under the carpet.I'd be willing to pay for more of their DLCs, honestly, but the quality of the content is falling.Their first DLC, the wolfpack for PDTH, was excellent. 2 whole new heists that were different to everything else, a new skill tree and some shiny new weapons.nowadays you get 1 heist. 1 gun. 4 generic melees and 4 masks.Sometimes with a separate heister pack, adding two masks, a heister and a gun.Thing is, their prices haven't changed, but the content they put out has gotten worse in quality. If they made fewer DLCs, but made the actual content in them truly amazing, I'd be willing to buy them again. Things began to change about when they released big bank. they only gave us one gun and one heist, but the heist was very big and was worth the pennies, and then so was Golden Grin more recently.However, the other smaller packs, like say the character packs, are not worth the same amount as a pack of good weapons, yet overkill are flogging them for the same amount.Overkill, if you get your ♥♥♥♥ together I will change this review. but... I think its too late for that now, sadly.On another note, game performance is... poor. Most heists are poorly optimized and recently they have made changes to fix it. Unfortunately i cant claim to see any improvements, but then again my PC isn't capable of hitting 30 in this game normally. (funny. i can play project cars with 40 fps...)EDIT 13/2/16 - Overkill released the wolfpack dlc. a start, but still lacking content. Come on guys! you can do better than this! we know you can! you did it before!			"

On top of that, the weapon skins give stat boosts, so this update isn't even purely cosmetic.At this point, if you want to keep up in the game, you need buy several of the DCLs.Abandon hope, all wallets that enter here.

												-Start game-Join an heist-2Hours of dying, killing cops and yelling ""Tazer""-End of the heist got a SAFE, that can only be opened by a 2.50$ drill (2.5euro for some countries...) what the hell is this? Team Fortress? No its WORSE in TF2 you could play and during that you would get weapons or crates, here you either SCREWD with a vault AKA Crate, or get something random.1Card per Heist (Any hesit, but still, it can be really really dissapointing to get a safe from an hour Heist...Stay away from this game, follow it, and hopefully they would revert the patch.

												Well, it WAS a great game.  With the scores of DLC it's accrued over the years however, alongside the recently integrated microtransactions, the game has fallen far from grace.  I hope Overkill can learn from the sudden, wholly negative coverage of their mistake and prove they're still a company worth siding with in an otherwise largely corrupt market.I'm still rooting for you, Overkill, and many are.  Don't let down all the fans who helped you get to where you are today.			"

												Now before I go on to why I dislike Payday 2 overall is because of some serious and bad business choices this company has done as a whole. However I will say without a doubt you will get your joy, fill and entertainment out of this game and what it has to offer. I am not here to talk about some of the issues already spoken about the game by others of the community, which goes a long way. And what I mean is the ridiculous amount of DLC or the Keys'n'Crates knickel and dime gimmicks this game has done that they talk about. So no, I will not be talking about that stuff because that already adds to the fire of why it gets a downvote.Aside from a great format and style gameplay unlike other games this one can be quite fun with friends and playing it on the fly to enjoy doing some bank heists with a good inventory and skill system. Along with a lineup of some good maps and content all over it which keeps that grinding replay value going. Of course I enjoy the game and many of its aspects overall but the undelying things i'm about to explain is why this game does not deserve it's perfect ""Very Positive"" rating that it appears to be receiving. And that is...1. The AI and Mechanics are broken - Yes the A.I is absolutely dumb. As for your CPU allies and NPC type allies they are a chore. They are all garbage. Everyone from your computer heist allies to Bain and others who pick you up that always push you through an endless wait time or grind in order to escape or get away. The game forces human players and not to mention that they are just bullet sponges and no real help. Also some actual game mechanics are way too sensitive, like by accident pressing the pager twice that triggers an alarm, or trying to slide in a keycard when a jammer or lockpick happens instead, Drills, Loadings and Uploads that for some strange reason break down or crashes every 2 minutes when these things in real life would never happen.2. The Enemy A.I is literally ""Overkill"" - I can't stress enough how ludacris the enemy forces are no matter the map you are in. Whether it is stealth or loud. First with Stealth, it is literally trial and error. Basically every patrol and every civilian is always a link to another problem no matter how or where you are regardless of how much it is randomized. Which this always sets an alert. Try paging more than four times you're screwed, a civilian sees you or another guard you're screwed,  do anything within a inch of a camera you are screwed. Doing this over and over again when trying to sleuth your way past. Now as for the loud or when alarm goes off you will get bombarded by endless waves of cops, I mean non-stop. The assaults go on way too long in between sessions and you'll find yourself cornered or out of ammo within 10 minutes of it all, and i'm talking difficulties above Overkill. The enemy are bullet sponges, they are everywhere, they don't ever give breathing moments. The A.I in this overall game is just a hassle and that is the best word I can describe it. Way too overpowering, and your advantages are way too little. 3. Poor Business Practice & Community - This is without a doubt a major point why this gets a negative, and that is the choices made by these developers and moderators. First off the Discussions page and Moderators are a rough bunch. Very freugal or punishing. They will lock discussions, ban people for mods or cheats, and lastly always being sarcastic or quick to close discussions. For the business practice...(sigh) the worse I have ever seen. Aside from DLC packs and Microtransactions - stuff I am not getting into. No, the real issue is locked or hidden content. That's right, With cross promotion and event content being blocked or missed out to the general population is just terrible. That means if you want to get the ""special masks and content"" you have to check up on websites and the actual inventories to when they schedule or release special items you only get if you are quick and on time when they come out. Or find yourself having to buy other game titles to get the content. If you want exclusive masks you have to be lucky and catch sweepstakes, or meet the yearly events, or when it comes to just getting a Mega Clover Mask that you have to snatch from key codes thrown out randomly by creators. The infamous Completely Overkill Pack argument which obviously is completely removed and unable to obtain because they are like ""♥♥♥♥ you we just don't want to put them out again or into a DLC."" Basically If you were not there for the events you miss out on supporting that and will never get it. Want special masks? Have to wait or catch moderators or the developers throwing out key codes. Want these special masks? You have to compete and join in our moderators competitions to get them, or come to the events halfway across the world. All of it is a turkey shoot. And when you can't get all the content or unable to obtain the stuff that you want from the actual game and put it behind events, restrictions, special celebration packs or secretive competitions than all I see is red flags because to many that alienates a lot of people from ever getting them.  Puts too much overload on gamers to try and finding and obtaining everything in the game. What if you planned on getting into Payday 2 now? You will be screwed! You won't be able to get all that content. And when those special events pass you will never get a chance in your lifetime to ever get them again, aside from Halloween or Xmas event. But to this day not being able to get the Completely Overkill DLC you missed a year ago is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, whether it is worth it or not we want to be able to get everything out of the game we paid big money for to have it all in the game. Along with all the new hidden loot, bundles, promotions and tournaments blocking out hidden content and downright missing out on all of it is just saddening.4. The Updates & In-Game Issues - This one could be endless with the random crashes to desktop when playing with the community or when hosting a map. Failed to join games. Random loading loops. Or they always leave, kick, disconnect or just being plain stupid when you play in random games or with others and all you do is try to help and play professionally. Terrible lag issues at times. The heavy slow inducing 30 GB updates everytime something comes out, The HUD, Toxic Community, the Beggers, The Infamy XXV-100 cheaters and so on. But if can look past all of this like I try and still enjoy this game a lot and for what it's worth this is still a fun game and has a lot of content and stuff to do in it that will definitely eat time in playing. But I strongly recommend you buy it on sale and with friends otherwise you will be overpaying what they do to it's source material. Just sayin'And when you play a game you still love to this day has all of this behind it. =>DLC / Bad Business Practices / Microtransactions / Rough Moderators / An Exclusive or Alienated Fanbase / Hidden-Cross Promotional Content. It is more than enough to shadow a huge positive sign to the game, the game is great but the many choices to it are pretty rough to say the least. and just like the moral of the game itself Overkill only thinks about one thing. Money. "

												I guess it's time to recreate my review, seeing as the new review system lets newer reviews take precedent over popular reviews.To clarify, I thoroughly enjoyed this game back in the day. But my issues come about with Overkill's marketing strategy. The majority of content is locked away behind a paywall that used to clock up to nearly 5 times the game's price. I mean seriously, there are 37 instances of DLC for this game alone! Not to mention that several times the developers have outright lied to the community and attempted to silence backlash. About a year or two ago, there was a great big event on where the more we played, the more we would earn towards a great new update. It was hyped up a lot, with rumors going around that it was going to be massive. In the end we worked our way to the top tier reward, and guess what that was? A jump animation, complete with 2001 space odessy intro and all.Don't believe me? They were in full PR disaster mode. Reddit documented this pretty well: https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3p0vll/ethicsoverkill_studios_in_full_pr_disaster_mode/TL;DR they implemented microtransactions, something that was never going to happen (""No. No. God, I hope not. Never. No."" - Goldfarb), and these microtransactions provided stat boosts to your weapons, thus diving into the pay-2-win scene. The community exploded in anger, and in response Overkill Software chose to delete posts and ban users from their community hub and forums for speaking ill of their update.Their business model is sleezy, their wallets are greedy, and with ♥♥♥♥ing nearly 40 DLC packages available you have to honestly ask yourself...... is it worth touching?The answer, of course, is no. I still enjoy the game's format, but I hate the fact that its geared towards making money and not about making an enjoyable game, and it's something I don't want to support.			"

Well I gotta tell you, it has nothing to do with your gameplay.It's a totally extra part of the game, If you don't like it, then don't use it, simple as that.Maybe it make some changes to your gameplay if you are a kinda player that plays with random people, but for someone like me who always plays with his one partner, it has not affected my game at all!So if you want to buy this game, don't let this microtransaction stop you, go on and buy it cause it's one of the coolest games in the world.

												As of the time of this writing, the game has recently implemented a pay-to-win microtransaction scheme, on par with the worst, most exploitative F2P games. It also removed support for custom interfaces. Both of these things are ones that the developers had previously promised never to do.			"

												Game was fun for a period, and then all this microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happened. It ruined the flow of the game completely by making you feel inferior to people who've got DLC guns and are capable of taking out Bulldozers with 2 shots to the face. That in my opinion does make this game pay to win. ""A game you buy being pay to win? HOW ABSURD"" you might think. However it's the sad truth. A game where it's focused on PVE entirely is pay to win. The second you can have an advantage in a game with weapons that are stronger than the ones you currently have in-game? Sure it's not TOO bad but this makes harder heists easier to escape if you, and all your friends are running around with purchased weapon packs, that are modded to hell. You can make the basic guns just as good, sure that's arguable. However doesn't change the fact these guns are better in almost every way. Please, if you're thinking of buying this game you're better off buying Payday 1.			"

												This game was great when it was first released, but over time the developers got full of themselves and made it terrible. Here's why:1. Nerfing exp gain from missions that players found to be more efficient to ""farm"" for experience points2. The constant ""push"" towards a more action-packed game instead of a stealth adventure*This game has stealth as an option, but stealth as a whole is being constantly nerfed3. The combination of both free DLC AND paid DLC*Why can't it all be free?4. Making the game last longer by adding in artificial grind instead of more new heists*A couple patches ago the devs introduced a new mechanic called ""Infamy"", which essentially raises the level cap (yes, this game has levels like an RPG) from 100 to 500. Best of all, they even said they haven't finished the system yet, because they're still deciding on what benefits to give levels past 501 before they put it in!5. Adding in respawning guards just to mess with stealth players moreDevs need to understand that this is the ONLY co-op heist FPS on the market with stealth elements and play it to its strengths. Stop nerfing things, make both stealth and action equally viable, and stop adding in artificial grind. Until then, I cannot recommend this game at all and ashamed at what it has become. Utterly ashamed.			"

												I want to keep this review short and to the point. Payday 2 fails in being a better game than Payday 1. Ultimately the quality of the heists is what really kills this game for me. *see edits at the bottom as I wanted to keep the review in it's original form*Positives: + Better Gunplay, the guns feel like real guns in this game. I much prefer Payday 2's gunplay over 1.+ Weapon customization, definitely a great addition. + Stealth improvement, definitely better stealth elements when compared to the first game.**Negatives: - Completely uninspired heists that mostly rely on bag handling. This in turn reduces the usefulness of the vast majority of the skills in the game.- Unfinished game. No cloakers*, no safe house customization, and re-used maps that are considered separate heists by the dev team.- RPG system, while a slight improvement over the first game, the amount of grinding one has to do to level up here is worse than the first game. Most heists are useless after reaching around level 40. The first game had a similar amount of grinding, but each heist felt more balanced in experience. - Card drops, this has to be one of the worst additions to the game. Frustrating to all hell. Make the attachments just cost money directly and don't have the need to get the card first then pay to put it on the gun. - NO ORIGINAL HOXTON VOICE ACTOR ****-*** The asinine amount of money that almost everything costs. Want to put on an attachment on a gun? Well that'll be 300K, effectively several heists. Oh do you want to take it off and put it on another gun? 300K more please.To sum it up succinctly, Payday 2 had the potential to be vastly superior to the first game in nearly every way, the devs however I think rushed to ""complete"" the game and really didn't test things out properly. The plethora of smash and grab heists only adds to my disappointment. Truthfully, I would like to see a Payday game that had the length and detail of the first game in terms of heists and the gunplay, weapon customization and stealth aspects of the second game. *Edit 2/12/2014: It's nice that they finally added cloakers after many months. The rest of the problems still stand.**Edit 2/28/2014: Goodness me, I didn't think it could get worse, but with the latest patch, they seemed to have nerfed stealth tremendously. They also punish people from playing the same heist over again, as if the grind isn't already awful with the Call of Duty style prestige system (I know it's technically infamous, but lets call it what it is.) I think ultimately, the developers really have stopped paying attention to the community and regreatably have ruined this game completely.***Edit 6/22/2014: After taking a long break from playing this game, I returned to it and played all the missing DLC missions up to and including the new 7$ DLC. Suffice to say many of the things I gripe about in the above review still hold true. While the heist for the new 7$ DLC is something I would categorize as ""good,"" the vast majority of the missions are still very mediocre, stealth mechanics still suck, the grind is god awful, and not having the ability to play whatever mission you want is highly annoying. After being out for 10 months, I would still not recommend this game to anyone, even on sale. The plethora of paid DLC that basically amount to micro-transactions coupled with the broken game economy really tells the whole tale of the game, one that was crafted to make people buy DLC to get more of the full game and for them to spend hours grinding. I also find it rather pitiful that one has to pay 7$ to get the quality of 1 heist that was essentially what Payday 2 should have been full of. If you want to play a heist game, Payday 1 is something that I would recommend, a game that has character, great missions, and a grind system that doesn't suck.**** Final Edit 11/14/2014: I've played this game since my last edit, where several additional DLC packs were released and a new heist, and the John Whick character. The Hoxton Breakout Heist is probably one of the worst heists in this game. I didn't feel like it was a breakout at all, and the polish on this heist felt very poor. Yes it was a free heist, but I find little point as it was such a terrible attempt at what could have been the best heist of the game. Honestly this point after a year+ of this game, the asinine amounts of DLC and no great heists besides the 8$ Bank Heist, I cannot recommend this game in any sense. I had pre-ordered Payday 2, the career criminal edition and ultimately I find much regret in that decision. Overkill has dissapointed me with their design decisions and never really reaching the quality of the first game. I will be very cautious of buying any Overkill game in the future, and certainly will not pre-order anything from them until they turn around their game design decisions.			"

This post was made from /u/TokamakuYokuu, but it's relevant to what is about to be pasted belowTL;DR - Microtransactions with skins with stat boosts, unethical devs, insane amount of DLC with a lack of quality... don't buy this game, even if it's on sale.Many summarize the issue as ""it went pay to win"", but that's missing all of the important background. P2w was a problem, but it wasn't THE problem. PAYDAY 2 had already begun introducing p2w in its very first DLC. The real problem was that Overkill Software built itself a powder keg, sat on it, lit the fuse, and then tried to put out the fuse with gasoline.Don't think that this was an isolated failure. Overkill dragged their feet on fixing simple issues that the scripting community had fixed for months. They did more blatant cashgrabbing over time with promotional content and gimmick DLCs sold at $5 or $7 each. They ran an event that explicitly tied purchases of PAYDAY 2 DLC to later rewards. They paid practically no attention to weapon balance (and considering what they did later, it was better off without their attention at all). They ignored fair play between DLC/non-DLC users for the longest time. They hyped up new a enemy twice, and gave us something stationary and tedious to fight both times.This pileup of cash-grabbing, misplaced priorities, and general incompetence had become too big for them to simply placate the fans with more free content. That's our keg.Flash to mid-October 2015. The second annual Crimefest event. PAYDAY fanatics had been grinding out in-game milestones for the past half-month to unlock rewards for Crimefest. The reward descriptions were cryptic to the point of irrelevance, so speculation had been running wild for weeks. You know what Overkill gave us for the first day of Crimefest?Ugly skins with stat bonuses and a comical failure of a weapon ""rebalance"". The subreddit lit up like a Christmas tree, but the disaster didn't stop there. The ""damage control"" over the fan outrage made it very obvious that the leadership at Overkill was completely out of tune with the fans, like an old man trying to do gangsta rap to fit in with a tournament of nerds. This is where the constant mockery over broken promises and ""the numbers show that players are loving it"" came from.The later Crimefest and post-Crimefest content patched over some of the issues or were good in their own right, but the damage had already been done. The subreddit's top posts are filled with backlash, game went from 90% to 75% in Steam reviews out of 180k reviews, and a lot of the old guard left for greener pastures.You probably didn't need a post half as long as this, but I felt I had to say something because I'm one of those butthurt PAYDAY veterans (2348 hours) and I can't stop picking at the incredible stupidity like it's an itchy scab. ♥♥♥♥ like this deserves to be told and mocked for all of eternity.My personal response to this:As much as I loved the game, I simply can not recommend this to anyone anymore.

												This WHOLE game is built on the word ""GREED"".The gameplay is based on GREED, as players POINTLESSLY rob money and things for their own personal pleasure, and watch it DISAPPEAR when reaching a Infamy rank (Up to Infamy rank 5). And later question why I am robbing money? As we can do so much with it (Buy Weapons, Modify Weapons, Craft Masks and Skills).The game developer (OVERKILL) develop content based on GREED, as they RANDOMLY produce LOTS OF DLCs content for NO REASON and EXPECT players to buy them with REAL MONEY. THEY FORCE PLAYERS TO BUY ESSENTIAL WEAPON MODIFICATIONS, for example,Gage Weapon Pack #01Gage Weapon Pack #02Gage Mod CourierYou have to ""Pay 2 Win"" or you are DOOMED to succeed in the game.They introduced MICROTRANSACTIONS in Crimefest 2015, which they promise they will not ever have (Link). These are SKINS from safe drops and can be open with a drill that can be purchase with REAL MONEY, and some have STAT BOOSTS which gives some advantages over others, but it DOESN'T EVEN MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE GAME PLAY.Please Don't Feed The Greed Machine, As It Only Encourage Them To Make More DLCs.

												10/10 Game, haven't played a game I like this much since Doom 2. Feels like Left 4 Dead with a terrific leveling system awarding skills to assist you in your heisting.  Highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good shooter.			"

												Two years after it's release game is still full of bugs, inconsistent design and doesn't represent quality of a finished product. During the course of two years game was treated with updates that changed it's mechanics, something one would expect from beta stage of development. Product I bought is not same product I own anymore. Clearly developers have no idea what their game is supposed to be like. During the course of two years there was 27 paid DLC releases. More to come. There are items locked behind achievements and there are achievement locked behind paywall. If it wasn't enough game was recently treated with microtransactions business system. Core mechanic of the game is grind, something one would associate with MMO cRPG. Unlike MMO games Payday 2, as horde mode FPS, doesn't have enough content to keep player entertained and interested in completing grinding process.During the course of two years game was abandoning it's roots and inspiration more and more. From Michael Mann's Heat like experience to general retardness of bringing medieval swords to a gunfight while escorting drunkards.Also game became advertisement platform, which resulted in questionable collaborations.Last time I invested time and money in game where players are referred to as clowns.

												Starbreeze will go down in the history of gaming lore as one if not the best company to ever support their products.If you've ever had a meal in a restaurant that is so good that you'd wanna kiss the cook, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.This crew is revolutionizing the diesel game engine and pushing it to the max! Oh sure, the game is not modable but why would you ruin a perfect dish?I love Bain's quirky attempt at American idioms and clichés... No, not really, they make me roll my eyes LOL! but I can forgive him for that coz at least he is trying.So I will keep buying their DLC's the same way I tip my favorite waiter and the pizza guy.

												Being a person who enjoys casual games, I found Payday 2 to be a little challenging and sometimes, dry even. Despite this, I poured countless hours into it, doing heists with my friends and other players both locally and worldwide, as I enjoy the co-operative system of the game, as well as the coordination and interaction with other players. With the Death Wish (27 Feb 2014) and infamy (22nd Jan 2014) update, I found the game to be more enjoyable, relishing in the four skulls heists and overcoming extremely challenging hurdles with my pals. The infamy update also gives me more incentives to continue playing the rather stale and limited number of heists. I must say the update was rather pivotal in me spending even more time in the game. With the free addition of Election Day (20 Mar 2014) and Shadow Raid (29 May 2014), once again, being a big fan of stealth, I loved this addition, allowing me to enjoy the stealthy approach this game has to offer. I have to point out here that Shadow Raid is one of my favourite heist, being highly challenging as it requires full stealth as a timer will trigger when you alert the guards. Big Bank (17 June 2014) was a paid update that I had enjoyed and bought, as it was the first contract given by a new contact, The Dentist. It was a really engaging update and fun heist, Once again, the developers have proven themselves to be skillful enough to come up with an update that breathe fresh air into a game that was starting to get a little monotonous. I appreciated the intricate and elaborate setup of this heist, which introduced preplanning, a new feature which greatly impacted most of the heists today and changed the way heisters approached certain heists. An example would be the normal Bank Heists, where now we could place keycards and other items (body bags) to aid us in our taking of the Harvest and Trustee financial institution.Hotline Miami Heist (30 Sep 2014) is once again, a job well done (might be due to it being a paid DLC), as it introduced the first VIP (The Commissar) whom we had to kill in the midst of the heist. The tasks within the heists were engaging and the soundtrack was definitely one of my favourite. Both challenging and engaging, this heist once again gave the game, at that point of time, a little push to keep it competitive in terms of its sales.First Crimefest (16 - 27 Aug 2014) was a great moment for us Heisters, as it showed how popular and great the payday community was, in terms of the developers' support for the game as well as the passion we heisters have for the game. It was sort of a celebratory victory for us making it so far as a community.  John Wick (22 Oct 2014) the free character pack was released in promotion of the movie John Wick, which was released in theatres. From this update, I sensed a forboding of Payday 2 possibly being a tool of adverting, and man was I right. Subsequently, Hotline Miami 2 - Jacket (10 Mar 2015) and The Alesso Heists (21 May). both were blatant advertising tools mean to be targeted towards us in hopes of us buying the HM and HM2 game as well as supporting Alesso and his album on iTunes or something. There were also other collaborations with other game studios, resulting in tons of items like the Lucille Baseball Bat, various DLCs in collab with other games like Battlefield and Chivalry, and masks requiring the purchase of the Hotline Miami franchise, Speedrunners, various Humble Bundles. The most insane ""collaboration"", in my opinion, was the Alienware Alpha mask, requiring the purchase of the Alienware Alpha console. For the record, the console costs close to S$1,000 (USD$ 721) in my country.The Old Hoxton and Hoxton Breakout (27 Oct) was another free community update that continues the story of the imprisoned Hoxton. It gives us the backstory of the Payday Crew, which I felt was very interesting. it had once again given us an engaging heist and a new character WITH A NEW SKILL TREE. This update changed the way some players played the game with the addition of the Fugitive skill tree. The Fugitive skill tree in conjuction with the Akimbo perk deck, makes for a rather gimmicky (in my opinion) playstyle, befitting that of a player who is tired of the conventional playstyle and wants to try a new way of clearing cop waves and especially cloakers (because HEADSHOT BONUS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥!) with dual-wield pistols.White Xmas (4 Dec 2014) was a rather plain update to celebrate Christmas. Monotonous and a neverending heist, this was a rather dry period for the Payday community. The next big change that brought the game back from its half-dead state was the Diamond Heist, Clover character pack (16 Dec 2014) and the Bomb Heists + Dragan Character update (22 Jan 2015). It gave the game two new paid heists which can be completed in both stealth and with guns blazing, and also two new characters (which I feel did not impact the game as much). I like the bomb heists as it reminded me of the Election Day heist, and also the open nature of the map. It gives players more freedom to tackle the heist in whichever way they feel comfortable with. That is a plus point. The Clover and Dragan character were rather refreshing and useful, with Clover being the first female heister and a rather competitive accompanying rifle and Dragan possessing a useful perk deck that isn't half bad in game.Infamy 2.0 (5 Mar 2015) was (in my opinion, again) the start of the decline of the game's popularity. It gave me the impression that the game had run out of juice and in order to keep a community of players intact, the developers decided to implement a short term ""grind and grind"" strategy to keep players around for a little longer. With the addition of infamy levels all the way up to Level XXV (25), and a ton of new infamy masks, which I felt looked pretty amazing. However, like I mentioned, this was a short term strategy to ""keep players around before 'I' attempt to come up with more idead to spice up the game and hopefully make some profit!"". Spring Break 2015 (Cook Off, Train Heist, Side Jobs feature, Bonnie Character, SWAT Turret, Hoxton Revenge and Car Shop) (13 - 21 Mar 2015) In all honesty, I felt that this update was pretty good. It gave us 3 new heists (Cook Off, Hoxton's Revenge, Car Shop) and a new 2nd female character (Bonnie), plus improvements to the game in terms of mechanics (SWAT Turret), as well as additional features to make the game more appealing, with incentives to make you replay the game (Side Jobs and individual Train Heist option). These were all done and released for free from Overkill.With the new XP system and free Meltdown Heist (7 May 2015), it made significant changes to the heists' XP system, which allows you to level rush to infamy 25 real quick. It beefed up the XP gains for many heists and the payouts were also more generous. As a sweetener, the Meltdown Heist was also added to sweeten the long grind towards infamy. Well, by this point, anyone with a clear mind would be quitting the game by now. Me and my friends did during this period too. We did not feel like grinding all the way up. I am sure most of the community would agree with us. The Golden Grin Casino Heist and Sokol Character (25 June) paid update introduced a new heist and a character called Sokol, which I felt was rather useful in terms of gameplay. His skill set complimented the other 4 skill trees and provided a good boost in terms of team work cop clearing potential. The Golden Grin Casino was at best, mediocre. A washed up and overused comcept in an attempt to bring back a game from the clutches of the deceased. This period was where I decided to check out the new stuff released and well, was I disappointed.Yakuza - Jiro Character (27 Aug) was, what I felt, a buffer between the Golden Grin and the upcoming FBI files update. It did not seem very engaging or refreshing. Another overused concept of releasing a character with no great advantages.			"

(shame on you if you thought otherwise!)To Start off, they have said they would not add microtransactions, and they've even said this personally:http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521http://steamcommunity.com/app/24240/discussions/0/810924774517838925/#c810925398555174856Now, why else is this a bad thing?Honestly, it's childish for Overkill to look at other games and say ""I wunt dat in mai gayme!""Then thrust it upon the community that doesn't want it, and in a game where that's absolutely unnecessary, Where's the artistry for this ♥♥♥♥? How the hell do you justify this in any way? These don't fit the game at all. Might I add that having to pay money for another drill to open a safe, of which if you go to the still non-customizable safehouse, is in the garage? Oh wait, this one isn't painted somewhat. Can't be used! Isn't this fun!?Overkill, nobody, literally, nobody, thought ""I wish Payday 2 had an economy!"" The most we EVER wanted to the ability to trade masks and weapons to other people, especially if we could sell it for in-game money. Instead you took the more Corporation approach, removed the fun aspect of this, then had real money involved, and from there, it was all downhill.Wait, how is this free, and how is this obtainable to everyone?Now, the next problem, is that this is supposed to be a free update. As in, everyone will be getting this and have a chance to get it, for free. As in, no DLC, nor Microtransactions.Right out of the gate, they add TF:GO, something no one liked, nor wanted in TF2.Even better, the other part of this update introduced weapon rebalancing, which they did poorly, but it's worse when you realize that this was the only other part of this update. So, you mean to tell me you had more interest in making money than our interests!? What are you, a modern day gaming company!? What do you mean you only see me as a friend!?May I remind you that Crimefest is a Community Driven series of free Updates? As in, we worked for this? This was supposed to be stuff the community wanted? And immedietly, right out of the gate, they want to shove more ways to milk this game, and tell us ""You wanted this! You worked for this!"" with no explaination as to why you decided to use this update for more ways to milk me dry of money? What a way to start, hey, wanna start the next crimefest by canceling Firefly Season 2? Because now I'm disinterested in your games/Crimefest. You figuratively took a ♥♥♥♥ inside my computer to start this crimefest, you burned down my childhood home with my childhood dog in front of me to start this crimefest. You ran over my grandma with reindeer to start this Crimefest. And you KNEW, this was going to happen. Isn't that like going to a person who just won the lottery then kicking them in the ♥♥♥♥, them falling over, then proceeding to kick them in the ♥♥♥♥ some more? Then stealing that ticket.What I'm saying is, we're all pretty much not in the mood for Crimefest anymore, and honestly, would prefer if it was cancelled, this update to be modified/removed, then you never touch the game again. If this is the direction of not only the game, but the Community Driven Free Update ""Crimefest"", where they really aren't free, and our efforts were for not, and they're only there to benefit you, then I'd prefer if you never touched the game again.The game is fine on it's own, just let it live on it's own now without ripping it's utters off. You don't need to work on it for another 2 years either.Oh and if you're a completionist, now you're going to have to pay out of pocket, for a game that doesn't need this cashgrab that no one wanted, in order to 100% it.Let's be honest here...Overkill, we sat through your artificially raised pricing for your buggy/lackluster DLC because we trusted you, and we wanted to ignore that blatant fact and enjoy the game.In order to get the full experience, you need to pay over 120$ mind you there is no Season Pass of any kind. Of which is sort've a thing for people like Overkill who can't help but premature eject 5$-7$ DLC every month.What I'm saying is, we were willing to look past the bugs, look past the milking, look past the artificially high pricing, and trust you had our interests in mind.Now though, we don't need to look past it, and we have no reason to keep lying to ourselves and others. We don't see you as ""buddy-buddy"" anymore. Payday 2 is mediocre. The Free updates you release, are mediocre, the DLC you release, is pretty much the same situation. Except with artifically high pricing.And let's be honest, that's the truth. We denied it for you Overkill. But once again, you show your abusive Spouse side and make us lose that trust. Once again.Is there something more to this?Think about it, PD2 is going to be F2P for 10 days, but first they added Microtransactions like in TF:GO? Is this supposed to be manipulation? No doubt, people are going to either assume they own the game now, and think ""I should buy some skins, they're only 2-3$"" Then come to realize that they don't own the game. Even if that's not the case, it's a completely real fact that this is manipulation of the uninformed.Since it's ""normal"" for F2P games to have microtransactions, they're going to blindly accept this ♥♥♥♥, without realizing they're going to need to pay for it later. And if they don't, it's even worse since that's even harsher manipulation.One side note, Goonmod was already capable of making skins for your gun, just like you would for your masks. And you could make some pretty good ♥♥♥♥ with this. Now, BLT and Lua don't work. Hmm? That's annoying. The only way to get my skins now is to go get Overkill's mostly 2 Tone skin with a single logo slapped everywhere. Or even better, a skin that's literally 1 texture. Yeah that's totally worth my time and money.Compared to what I've made, these skins are like a kid used the gradient tool in Paint.net

Unoriginality makes the bandwagon go round.I'd also like to point out, that these Microtransactions are legit, becoming a thing now. As in, they are going to be apart of this dying gaming industry. The newest Tomb Raider game will have over 300 Micros, and there's a few more that will as well.Once again, Overkill, decided to childishly, with no regard for anyone else but themselves, add this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because they didn't want to be original. They want to jump on a bandwagon because it makes everyone money. What they didn't calculate, is that they don't have the rep Valve undeservingly does, they can't get away with this. Because now, we're not accepting mediocrity. You haven't done ♥♥♥♥ to deserve anyone's trust, nor did you in the first place, here's looking at you Safehouse customization.You think your game is worth 120$ + Micros? Well then, prepare for it to be ♥♥♥♥ on, since no one agrees with you. Your game is still buggy and unoptimized, mostly due to the terrible choice of an Engine. You pull the same tactic as every other company, where you basically sell ""The other half of the game"" DLC. Then you spit on the face of everyone who worked for this free series update, that we seldom get, let alone, seldom get anything higher than 5/10 quality. And you thought this was a good idea to start with? It wasn't. I'm not buying, nor play any of your games anymore. Even if this update is removed, I honestly, don't care. You offered me nothing for years, then proceed to offer me even less.			"

												Oh Payday 2, how much I loved you. You are the perfect example of the quote: “You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” I rarely pre-purchase any games, but I gladly pre-purchased Career Criminal Edition and to be clear - I don't regret it at all. It was great game at the beginning. True to its core, it had better game mechanics than the first game, absolutely amazing soundtrack, and very fun gameplay. Sure, it had problems and it was far from perfect, but it was highly playable and so much fun.Then it started with Armored Transport DLC. I got it for free, because I had Career Criminal Edition, so it seemed alright. Then it was followed by Gage Weapon Pack #01. Paying 5€ for few guns and grenades that should probably be available for everybody? I waited for sale because it didn’t seem worth it to me even back in 2013. Then we got Merry Payday Christmas Soundtrack DLC which was absolutely fantastic. Extremely cheap Payday 2 Christmas carols sang by old Hoxton. And then the hell began with insane flood of 5€ DLC weapon packs, 5€ character packs and 7€ heists. I’m warning you, the huge rant incoming!I have to say that I surely don't have any problem with more content; I understand that it’s keeping the game alive and I don't have the problem with paying for it. However, DLCs are rarely worth the full price. Look, it's nice you're supporting developers, but we are not charity, we are customers and I'm not paying 5€ for few weapons and masks when I can get the whole games in sale for the same price. Actually, I bought Vanishing of Ethan Carter for less than 5€ the day when Gage Chivalry Pack was released. Can you seriously tell me with straight face that Gage Chivalry Pack is offering me the same level of quality like Vanishing of Ethan Carter? Anyway, I said few weapons - weapon packs also usually include materials and patterns, but let’s be honest here – nobody cares about them and it’s there just to make it look like you’re getting more stuff.At the current state, the game has 27 paid DLCs. If your eyes skipped the number, I will say it again: TWENTY SEVEN PAID DLCS! Before some genius will come here to defend Overkill with the argument that Borderlands 2 or Saints Row games have more DLCs, so they can’t see the problem, then, my friends, first of all, those games have Season Passes which is something that Payday 2 doesn’t have, second – most of the DLCs in Borderlands 2 are purely cosmetic on the same level like mask patterns in Payday 2, third – and my favorite - at the time of writing this review, both Saints Rows 3 and 4 have less DLCs than Payday 2. Actually, at the time of writing this, you can buy Saints Row IV: Game of the Century Edition (including all DLCs) for 5,99€. Can you see the difference?To be honest, we got some free updates as well - usually maps or some significant game updates. And you know what? They were usually very cool. And free heists like Hoxton Breakout are absolutely brilliant! Let’s talk about more problems, like developer’s approach. 2014 was memorable for Crimefest which was pretty cool, but some awards from it took more than over a year to get which is ludicrous. To give you some example - let’s talk about the new enemy. Overkill claimed that the enemy was taking a lot of time because he had complicated voice acting. In the meantime they managed to release: Gage Historical Pack, Clover Character Pack, The Bomb Heists, Dragan Character Pack, The OVERKILL Pack, The Completely OVERKILL Pack (we will talk about it later), The Butcher’s AK/CAR Mod Pack, The Butcher’s BBQ Pack, The Butcher’s Western Pack, The OVERKILL B-Sides Soundtrack, The Alesso Heist, The Golden Grin Casino Heist, Sokol Character Pack, Gage Ninja Pack, Yakuza Character Pack and Gage Chivalry Pack. Obviously, the voice acting was the huge problem. Btw check this - http://payday.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Winters/Quotes . Does this really take a year?Continue time. Their PR is absolute mess. Perfect example is hilarious fiasco with Disappointment Bat when Overkill teased the community for 35 days to give it the bat and the announcement of their new game. Another pure insanity was Hype Train, which was something like Crimefest, but instead of being fueled by number of the people in the group, it was fueled by the people buying DLCs. See the problem here? It also introduced OVERKILL Pack DLC and Completely OVERKILL Pack DLC which was for 20€ and included 4 masks. You read right. 20€ FOR 4 MASKS. Oh and one surprise bonus that nobody still knows anything about! Before you defend Overkill that Completely OVERKILL Pack was meant to be the support DLC and to be a donation - do you really think that studio that acquired the Valhalla engine for 8,6 million dollars needs to beg for money like that implying that the game and 16 (back then) DLCs were not enough to fund their studio? Anyway, the Hype Train also included rushed Infamy Update which didn’t bring anything new, because it just changed the number of infamies from 5 to 25 while not giving any bonuses except for more XP bonuses so you can level up quicker. It was obviously rushed because community was very angry with Hype Train and it was meant to make Overkill look like it listens to the community feedback. After this horrible update, Overkill said that it listened to the community again and it would eventually remake the new infamy. That was few months ago and nothing really happened since then, so we can just forget that. Like the ability to upgrade the safe house. I know it’s just the running joke now, but they promised it in 2013. It’s 2015 and it’s still not here. They said it was coming in 2016, so I can't wait to see how 3 years of developing of safehouse upgrading will look like. I think that Overkill is just pushing and pushing and pushing to see what they can get away with. Year 2015 was just a mess of new characters who have no connection to the Payday universe and nobody really cares about combined with lazy or ridiculous gun packs that don’t fit the game at all, which is of course subjective, but I don’t think that (for example) swords really fit with the modern heisting game, unless of course you’re the part of LOL SU RANDUM crowd that will buy 5€ DLC, make a le funi 69/420 review and never touch it again. DLCs went so far I just refused to buy anything new from Overkill this year. By the way, I think that Gage Chivalry Pack took the biggest ♥♥♥♥ this year with reskins and weapons clearly out of place, with visual bugs in trailer and by being paid (of course) while other games like Killing Floor 2 who collaborated with Chivalry offered Chivalry stuff for free. Only Payday 2 NEEDED paid Chivalry stuff, because Overkill is the small indie company and they have to survive somehow, am I not right?You see, no matter how poor content is, Overkill is always hiding behind the excuse that they are the small indie company. Even if true, it doesn’t make it okay for them to release lazy, ♥♥♥♥ poor content. So anyway, we waited for another Crimefest. I thought: “Well, it should be alright, it’s not like they can do anything more ludicrous than Hype Train, right? That would be quite a feat!” and... they pulled it off. The second Crimefest managed to bring microtransactions into the game on its first day. Yes, you have the game you pay for with 27 paid DLCs with microtransactions. It’s like CS:GO, but you have safes instead of crates and drills instead of keys. Oh and by the way, drill will cost you 2,19€. If you open the safe with your drill, you get some skin that will change your weapon stats, so it’s not actually like CS:GO at all, because skins in CS:GO are just cosmetic unlike here. Oh and weapon skins look like some 12 years old made them.So you probably know what I'm suggesting to you - don't bother with buying this game. Not worth it anymore.			"

												I have played this game a lot. And by a lot I mean about 1800 hours, so I would say I know a lot about the game. I really loved this game when it was in it's early stages, from 2013 all the way up to just a couple of days ago. It really was a great game. Fun to play with friends and downloadable content that was absolutely unnecessary to buy and were basically just side grades to the vanilla weapons.     Unfortunately, Payday 2's DLC had been going through what people like to call ""power creep"", which basically means that the developers made it so that guns that you buy were just slightly better than the previous weapon you had, and eventually the power creep is very easily shown by the stat difference in weapons.     With OVERKILL's newest update called Crimefest (which was said by the devs to be ten days of FREE content for the community), I was completely shocked. A new system of ""safes"" that contained weapon skins was released in the game. The catch? You can only open the safes with REAL MONEY, similar to the systems in both Team Fortress 2, and Counter Strike - Global Offensive. Now the real problem with this model for Payday 2, is that it is not a cheap game and the DLC is expensive. TF2 is free to play (so the micro transactions are acceptable), and CS:GO is relatively cheap with no DLC available. However, in both of these games, the microtransactions are COMPLETELY cosmetic, and Payday 2's skins offer stat boosts to the weapons, which threw around the Pay-to-win concepts.I am uninstalling this game, because the developers of the game can NOT be trusted, they only want money from us, and I will be HAPPY to leave this game behind. Goodbye and good riddance OVERKILL.			"

												Edit: They have recently updated the game and removed the microtransaction system, but that doesn't change the fact that we have been lied to and the game is still very DLC heavy.Old review:I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone in its current state. The game was already very DLC heavy (and they are pricey on top of it), but with Crimefest 2015 Overkill added microtransactions to that, and said microtransactions aren't even for purely cosmetical purposes. On top of all that, they promised us two years back they wouldn't add microtransactions. But now they've done it.I really like the game, but I wouldn't give my money to liars who clearly don't need it. You shouldn't either.			"

												I wanted to like this game so f-ing badly. I played and played and focused on the positives, but in the end, it's not a very good game. None of the grandeur of Payday showed up in the sequel, and though the graphics are better, and the skill trees adds some fun features, what made Payday great was the cinematic stages that kept you moving from objective to objective. Payday 2 almost always descends into Killing Floor style holding out, and Killing Floor does it better. The 'tons of guns' available are mostly useless, which means you'll be using the same load out over and over again, there isn't much variety of enemies, and almost no variation between playthroughs of each mission. Add this to the microscopic maps you're playing on, and the whole thing gets pretty stale fast.And, let's be honest, the way they're rolling out DLC is just slimey. This is a game that turned a profit during pre-orders; there is no excuse to keep charging us for content that should have been included in the finished game. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game, you'll only be disappointed.			"

 “What’s the Score, Slick?” ‘Payday 2’ is a fast-paced, slick, Co-operative First-Person Shooter (FPS) and a strong sequel to 2011’s cult-classic ‘Payday: The Heist’. While the first entry in the series was an un-polished gem, ‘Payday 2’ is bigger, badder and flashier in nearly every regard - a taut, adrenaline-shot affair with explosive running gun-battles around every corner. Gameplay | Key Improvements: Gamers once again assume the role of one of four main protagonists – Dallas, Chains, Hoxton or Wolf – who after a few years in hiding, have descended upon Washington D.C in search of new scores. Originally developed by Overkill Software (a small Swedish Dev.), the franchise has since been acquired by Starbreeze | 505 Games and the larger budget for this late-2013 release is clearly evident in its improved production values - adding all the bells and whistles one would expect from a modern shooter.  More Heists?  – Check – The game consists of 17 unique heists (compared to 7 in the original) adding some great variety that can be played in Single-player (with AI bots) or Online Co-op, with an additional 3 Heists available as DLC.  Better Customization?  – Check – The single biggest improvement from the original game is the inclusion of a deep and well fleshed-out ‘Reward | Customization System’ which allows gamers to use cash earned from heists to acquire and modify a large selection of new weapons and armor, customize masks for more personalized characters, unlock class-specific skills and perks, and customize load-outs for individual missions.  Better Online Matchmaking?  – Check - With the introduction of Crime.net, the game also improves the ability to setup and find online heists across a variety of difficulty levels (from Normal to Overkill) through a well designed User Interface.  Flaws: In considering its shortcomings, many gripes from the original ‘Payday’ unfortunately remain – A continued lack of a single player campaign, and rather simplistic AI, make for a somewhat one-dimensional experience over time. Additionally, graphics and gameplay are basically unchanged – and average graphics (considered below-par for the first game in 2011) seem increasingly out of date in 2014. The randomized ‘Reward-Drop System’ for weapon upgrades | new masks is another area which needs re-work as evidenced by some pro gamers (400+ hours in-game) still unable to get that one mask or weapon upgrade they so crave. Team-balancing issues with online match-making, the seemingly interminable grind to unlock better toys, and a trend toward expensive DLC-only content, mar an otherwise strong offering. In the final analysis, ‘Payday 2’ is a great sequel and a phenomenal heist game, improving upon the original in key areas. A fantastic premise supported by a pulsating background score, frenetic action, a good selection of heists and a deep customization system add to the thrill of taking down scores with your crew. Familiar gripes, and some new ones to boot however give this entry a feeling of ‘2 steps forward – 1 step back’, so while an overall improvement, its one achieved in steps not leaps and bounds.

												Payday 2 offers one of the most original and enjoyable experience since the day I started my gaming life so far.The 4-men crew and the shadow brain Bain continue to involve in series of heists, each one of them provides us a vary in objectives which is a good tradition since the first. Ranging from stealing cash, gold, jewelry, painting to cooking meth or even ""watch the world burn"", no heist is the same or repeative. Besides, the random element not just made a come back but also got improved, cameras, civilians and now map layout and guards' route are completely different each time you want to rob or steal something. I highly appreciate this mechanic since it gives us the replayability and above all, you need to plan ahead and patience to carry out the mission like a real criminal.Teamwork is a must, and of course it would be so much fun if you can play with your friends. Thus, headphone and mic are essential. To complete a heist successfully without ringing any alarm, we need TEAMWORK. Everyone has a role, a Mastermind takes care of guard and cam silently, a Ghost get in and get out undetected and shaped charges, drill and saw from a Tech and a Enforcer leave no safe or vault enclosed. Co-op never been so brilliant and professional like this before.However, failure is still an option and many subjective and objective aspects could screw up the whole thing up. And here we come the other side of Payday, the assault, and again, the 4-classes system shines one more time. Enforcer works like a suppressor tank, Mastermind distracts and Technician finishes anyone comes close. Meanwhile, Ghost grabs anything he could and rushes for the escape car waiting outside. In theory, yeah. Police is not dumb. They throw anything in order to bring you in custody. Initially, only few cops and FBI, but later on, a battalion of SWAT, Taser and Shield storm in from almost everywhere. And did I mention about the f**king Bulldozer? Luckily, with the limited but still sufficient war gears Payday 2 offering, you may escape.Reviewing Payday 2 without referring about the soundtrack is the huge mistake. All the EDM in game are so exciting, catchy and really impress me. Like an adrenaline pumping, it makes every assault section becomes a battlefield of dub step and bullet.Nevertheless, Payday 2 still bugs me about the unlock mechanic. Why you have to unlock the damn hologram optic while you have enough money to buy out the whole company who made them? At least gives us the option to buy things we cant seem to get unlocked.Verdict: 9,5/10. Trust me, the best weekend is the time when you rob the bank with other 3 friends online.			"

												The game was fun in beta and it got released wheres the promised features safe house modifacation, wheres the new heists?It was fun with friends playing with public players is a disaster in the making, sometimes you get lucky most of the time you get hacker duplicating gold bags or some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like spawning bulldozers. Then update 24 happened and ruined stealth by nerfing it into the ground, the funny thing is by butchered sneaking to make it more difficult by ruining the players ability to sneak and do what he needs todo to complete the heist. The biggest change was respawning guards and only 2 body bags. Even if your dodging guards a ghost guard is guarenteed to glitch through the wall and detect you leaving you no choice to down him and you only get 2 body bags......bravo overkill ...very slow clap.Don't buy this game until they fix this once enjoyable game! and overkill sort it out as payday2 had great potential until you started ♥♥♥♥ing it over with awfull DLC and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t changes listen to your players and use some common sense.......not asking allot is it really?Avoid it like the plague until they fix it and make the game fun again, if you fix it i will write nice things about you okay.

												Up until the newest patch Payday 2 was a very fun game to play.  The social aspect of completing the heists with 3 friends made this game exceptional.  However, with the release of the death wish patch, Overkill has completely dropped the ball.  They seem to have no intention of listening to what the fans/players/customers are looking for in this game.  The seem to only be concerned with pumping out DLC that you will have to pay for.  (Remind anyone of that completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ company by the name of EA?)  Sorry Overkill, It was a great game, but it lacks content.  Adding a incredibly difficult new mode while nerfing some player classes does not equate to adding new content.  It's just sleight of hand that anyone can see through. You showed so much promise, only to fail to deliver.			"

												I had approximately 100 very enjoyable hours, but I'm not on board with the recent patch discouraging the stealth approach to heists. I despair at the precedent set by fundamentally changing the gameplay of a game six months after release; I appreciate that devs should stick to their vision and/or cater for the most lucrative section of their market, but I'm disappointed in the way it was done. I can't see how a new player wanting the same things out of this game that I did when I bought it will have much fun in the early phase now; I don't see that player maxing the level tree. So on that basis, I can't recommend it. I'll keep an eye on changelogs.			"

												Game launched with the worst server browser ever made.  Even after updates it still terrible.  You can't just pick the missions/skill you want.  Have to wait for them to randomly appear somewhere.  Often times they never do.  This combined with a random loot system that drops worthless money or masks instead of weapon unlocks.  Developers don't seem to listen to players and make the game more frustrating to play by placing obsticles and turn it into a grind fest.  DLC was a joke for $5 for grenades, really?The missions are not much more than re-skinned versions of the same themes.  AI can often see through walls and set off alarms too soon making stealth too hard.  Mostly a game that wants to be good but fails to provide in the end.  I recommend you avoid this.			"

												After +1,200 hours spent with this game, i think its a good time to make a review out of it.GAMEPLAYPAYDAY 2 is a 4 player CO-OP shooter where you and your team are playing as criminals peforming heists on various things, ranging from Jewerly Stores and Banks to High-Tech Weaponry and Cursed Diamonds.These heists can be done guns blazing-like, shooting your way trough an entire SWAT team to complete objectives. But in some heists, you can also stealth them, if you are skilled enough for that. But keep in mind, not all missions can be stealthed!After completing a heist, you will be awarded with Experience Points to level up (duh), Offshore money to buy new mission contracts to play, to buy more skill trees or to be used on Offshore casino to gamble for Weapon Mods, Masks, Mask patterns and so on, Cash to buy Weapons, Weapon Mods, Masks and Mask customization. And also recently added Continental Coins, which you get rewarded with after every 1,000,000 XP, wich you can upgrade your Safe House and buy Weapon Mods with.Also you will get into your PAYDAY, that lets you chose from 3 cards, which can unlock you Weapon Mods, Masks, Mask patterns ETC.And after leveling up, you will gain access for new weapons, Skill points to use on your Skill tree, to determinate your playstyle by upgrading your armor and equipment, the strenght of your weapons and alot more and perk points, wich you can use on Perk Decks that improve your performance by giving you new abilities that are not given in Skill Trees, as health/armor re-generation, team stamina/health boosting, better chance to dodge bullets (yeah, dodging bullets is a gameplay style) and a lot more, once again.Weapon modding is also a very important part of the game, because with weapon modding, you can make your guns peform as you want! You can make it very concealed, to be used in stealth or with some skills in skill trees to gain crit chance or dodge chance. Or you can make your guns have bigger magazine sizes, do alot of damage or/and give them better accuracy/stability.STORYWell, it might not be very clear, but this game has some sort of a story, actually. So let me try to explain it:It starts up with Dallas, Wolf, Chains and Houston heisting banks and jewerly stores to ladder up into bigger jobs.Then one of the games contractors, The Dentist, meets Dallas, who now offers the gang bigger jobs, like robbing The Benevolent Bank, an enormous bank with massive vault, Stealing ""The"" Diamond, a priceless, cursed and historic diamond and Breaching in The Golden Grin Casino, that holds something important for The Dentist.Including those, he is also offering to free Hoxton from jail, by killing someone who has ties with the District Attorney, Commissar, in the Hotline Miami job. After killing him, the gang is ready to breakout Hoxton out from jail and start tracking down the Rat who got him real good.And then when Hoxton is out from jail successfully, they are going after the Rat.SOUNDTRACKPAYDAY 2 has one hell of a soundtrack.It is mainly composed by Simon Viklund, but now that he left OVERKILL, he became a Freelancer, but he still does most of the music (and the voice of Bain).There has been other people doing the music too, like Alesso (and his own heist that totally isnt an adverticement gimmick) and Le Casle Vania (The guy who made the soundtrack for the movie John Wick (Who is a playable character in PAYDAY 2)).The Soundtrack is most of the time Electronic, very high paced and and hyped up, but there are some differences on the soundtrack, because sometimes, there can be tracks that are based off Rock, Jazz and Synthwave with Electronic style injected in them.""CONTROVERSY""So back there I admired OVERKILL's actions a bit, because they have improved A LOT recently, but they do have some controversy behind.I gotta start with the most well-known drama surrounding PAYDAY 2: the microtransaction drama.Yeah, i didnt start with the amount of DLC, because thats like the ""le foni memo äksdee"", but the microtransaction thing, that was a big hit to the game.Because back in 2013-2014, OVERKILL devs has been saying that ""there wont be any microtransactions"", but in the Crimefest 2 (a community event for PAYDAY's birthday as a franchise) they added in these ""Skin safes"", wich are CS:GO/TF2 item cases, that you needed to buy a ""drill"" for to open them to get a Weapon Skin of different quality and contidion.I liked the idea for weapon skins, honestly, but seeing how we had to PAY TO OPEN THEM hurted me and basiacly everyone in the community, because this event is a free thing, that everything that is unlocked in it is supposed to be things that everyone gets without paying anything, but here we where. Weapon skins. And there where (and still are) weapon skins for DLC weapons, so if you got a skin for a weapon you didnt have, you had to BUY THE DLC TO USE THE SKIN. That made a bad situation even worse.But since Update 100, they did a big GOOD move, where they made it so that you can open new safes wihtout any cost, and the old, pay to open safes, got removed from the PAYDAY drop list. You still need to pay to open the older safes.Sure, they lied a big time, but in 2016 OVERKILL has improved alot, so i forgive them.So, now its time for the ""le foni memo äksdee"": The amount of DLC in the game. 35 DLC?! How do i own all of them and what am i doing with my lifeI have to say, even tho theres a lot of DLC, but i am personally okay with it. There where times where some weapon types where locked behind DLC, like Snipers, LMG's, even GRENADES, but OVERKILL has given free versions of them, so thats not a problem. Even tho, we still don't have a free Grenade Launcher, or Bow/Crossbow, wich at the time, are the more powerful weapons in the game.Then in some DLC, like in the Gage Spec Ops Pack, they have stuff that are, lets say, questionable. I am talking about this pack first, because there is one Weapon Mod that makes your gun reload TWICE as fast as it used to, without spending any skills.But besides that, most of the DLC nowdays gives you weapons that are kinda like reskins of other weapons in the game, with some differences like a bit more stability or accuracy, slower/faster rate of fire, you know, not a big deal.Theres also that the game gets on sale quite often, and when it gets in a sale, all the DLC gets in the sale too. Yeah, its still gonna cost alot of money to buy them all (45,90€ currently for all the DLC from a sale), but as i mentioned earlier, there are a lot of DLC that are basiacly useless, and not ""Pay 2 win"" in a way.Long story short: Started strong, kinda fell down, but then got back again with a bang.Well, now that the long part is over, time for Pros and Cons and the score.PROS+Highly Customizable+Various Ways to play+Good Challenge in higher difficulties+Modding friendly+Alot of Updates+Soundtrack from the heavens+AddictingCONS-Cheater parade-Toxic public lobbies, mostly-A lot of DLC-Somewhat repetive at times-Poor Engine (Diesel)-Way too easy lower difficulties-Huge Update sizes (Regularly near 1 GB)-No more Wolf voicelines :(SCORE10/10It wouldn't be the same if i just started the game, because of all the DLC, but i see myself getting back into the game almost daily, so yeah, it has taken me hard.I need to thank OVERKILL for making such a good game, even if there is some ""controversies"" behind the game, but the game is solid, and addicting.And another thank you goes for the modding community, that has kept me in the game for its variation, with new stuff added in by the modders daily.So that makes it for my first serious review, so dont smak me thenks			"

												This game was amazing I have put many hours into it. But the microtransactions ruined it. It shows the direction the game and the company Overkill is heading in and it is not a good one. At this point they are trying to copy other companies and make as much money as possible. This is truly a blow to what was a strong influential game and shows that the game is only going to spiral downhill from what it once was.			"

												I've been playing Payday 2 since the closed beta, and my god I don't know what to say about the game now. I still return from time-to-time to play some of the new maps and mess around with friends, but since the Microtransaction-gate uproar that surrounded the Safe and Drill update the game simply does not feel the same.The mechanics are simple enough: four heisters, a ton of loot, and you have to get it all. The game isn't lacking in creative endeavours to break up a simple monotony; skydiving, goat-looting, car driving, counterfeiting... by all means it should be a rousing good time.Herein the problem lies: the community is practically nonexistant as of my writing this.Before Safe-gate and all the subsequent updates, I could easily jump into a pub game, and while not perfect, for the most part you'd find helpful and knowledgeable teammates that would run through a few heists with you. The preferred method would be with friends only and an open Discord or Skype call. Still, despite the rough patches it was decent enough and you were guaranteed at least a good 2/3rds of your matches would end with a getaway and everyone getting some nice loot.Now, however, the game's fun and cooperative nature seems to have dried up as most of the veteran heisters have long abandoned Payday over their inclusion of microtransactions as well as a percieved pay-2-win scheme. While the latter is not true, the former sadly is, and it has drained this game of the life it had before. It saddens me to see such a great game brought to its knees by a single boneheaded move that Overkill refuses to undo or compromise on. They made a token gesture in the form of allowing drills to drop in the after-match cards, but the fact that the loot tables are now even more skewed with the addition of safes and drills makes it feel more like a backhanded ""sorry"".Overall, there was once a time I would have recommended the game with no reservations. It was fun, even better with friends, and there was a sense that Overkill cared about the userbase (except for the glut of redundant melee weapons, but that was fine). Even all the DLC was excuseable, seeing as none of it was absolutely necessary for the enjoyment of the base product save for one or two DLCs. Now, though, I have to say that unless you really love the concept of heisting and have a dedicated few friends to play with, the PUG scene is full of hackers and newbies, and very few people who play the game consistently.VERDICT: Wait for a sale, and be sure to have friends. This game is no longer fun in pick-up games and the amount of DLC and microtransactions is sure to sour your appetite if you go all-in when its full price.			"

												DLCDAY 2 is a robbery simulator.The robbery is Overkill releasing DLC every month or so which is increasingly becoming more and more overpriced, instead of fixing bugs and netcode issues that have existed since the release of the game.Also known as ""7 bucks?

												The 'game of the year' version of this game is proof of how terrible and greedy the developers of this game really are. A big fan of Payday, I bought the sequel on launch aond found that half the content that they boasted in the pre release trailers and interviews was non existent, which some still is, including a lauded feature to customise your hideout. In order to keep the cocaine pile full, they kept releasing weapon and mod expansion packs, charging a fiver for each, while ignoring game-crippling bugs. They have now gotten to the point where they are releasing new heists and missions, but all consist of boring 'click this, wait for the arbitrary time of 5 minutes, then go in and click the next thing and wait again.The community is awful, meaning rarely can you get a team that works unless you link up with people you know IRL and that have voice chat. I've been kicked by someone 2 hours into a mission purely because I killed an enemy that he wanted to because he was working on a bloody achievement.I don't know how much they have improved on the connectivity as I gave up playing this about half a year ago, but getting dropped from games due to a lack of dedicated server, or the ability to migrate the host to another player if the host dropped, not that they'd patch or fix that as they're too busy trying to make me buy another 15 minute heist or another weapon that by all rights, should have been free with the ♥♥♥♥ing game!A game with honest, true potential has been lost here amongst micro transactions and neglect by the developers who are either being ordered to focus on the wrong things or just don't give a ♥♥♥♥.Oh, and they got rid of the only playable character with any character from Payday 1 and replaced him with a genetic, unremarkable American. I know they brought him back to pander to fans, but if they think I'm paying money for that ♥♥♥♥, they have another thing coming.			"

												Mere days ago, this review would have been a positive one. But like so many others who own this game, I am disappointed and angry about the changes made. I can't recommend this game anymore.I tend to believe some changes were made, namely those to ""Rats"", due to people exploiting methods in order to earn massive quantities of EXP. I have played this mission many times, and can say that the friends I played this game with and I never exploited it. However, the gameplay changes are still affecting us in ways that ruin the mission for us. Having to wait for an escape vehicle is ridiculous, particularly since the problem with Bain giving wrong directions still hasn't been corrected. Is it intentional? I don't know. It could be a script error, a file-naming error, who can say, but having the lab blow up due to no mistake of our own and not being able to leave until 4 minutes later is a pisser.The EXP boost/reduction system when repeating missions is also annoying. If I want to repeat a mission, that's my business. You know, people might be more inclined to not repeat missions over and over if Overkill would actually get on with giving us new missions/heists like they've claimed they would since the game came out...I could go on, but the bottom line is, the latest update is making tons of people angry, miserable, and annoyed. I'm one of them. If you wanted to make the game difficult and misery-inducing, you should have kept the changes to the Death Wish mode- so real gaming pros and gaming masochists could enjoy it in that difficulty while the rest of us could enjoy what we've enjoyed all along in the game.I have no intention of playing this game from this point forward. I have no intention of purchasing more DLC. And I plan on avoiding Overkill as a whole because if this is how they treat gamers, and then thumb their noses at us when we complain, they don't deserve my money or my business.Friends, don't buy this game.

												Update 79 changed all weapons and added micro transactions. Weapon changes are a nightmare and micro transactions are pay to win intense power creep. Developers show no respect for their community and a gross ignorance for how their game functions.This game has brought me many hours of fun and exciment. With update 24 however my main method of gameplay (stealth) has been punched in the face, stabbed in the ♥♥♥, and throw into a river of sulfuric acid. Maybe I'm overexagurating, but it's still agrivating as hell to see a once great game developer release obviously untested material and then attempt to justify themselves. To me the game devs simply saw videos of the best Payday players doing master level techniques and said ""We want everyone to do that so let's remove every easy way to complete stealth. We know it's possible so we don't need to see how hard it really is.""			"

												In a world where John Wick, Hardcore Henry, Scarface, and Point Break all share the same universe, a crime syndicate led by a possibly Swedish man named Bain go on a quest to deprive the world of fusion power, cook up copius amounts of meth, rig political elections, steal nuclear warheads, and remove packages of cocaine through the anuses of goats.Payday 2 has gone through so many changes over its lifespan, and may have jumped the shark to a point of no return, but it still maintains one core element: fun and addictive co-operative gameplay. No other co-op shooter has the extent of customization that Payday 2 has. Weapons, cosmetic masks, characters, skills; your entire playstyle has limitless possibilities. While stealth is a forgettable pain in the ♥♥♥ that isn't worth it, going loud remains a fun way to spend 30 or 40 minutes with your friends. Granted, if one of you doesn't crash.But even behind the technical bugs, aging visuals, and some questionable developer decisions, Payday 2 still maintains a dedicated following. They have their shortcomings, but Overkill Software does their best to interact with the community on a personal level that few developers bother with.Oh and the music is amazing.

AND you are telling me you can rob banks? AND there are tons of weapons? AND you can cook meth, trade it to a dangerous street gang for some info, steal the meth back, kill the entire gang then steal their money? THEEEEEN you can eliminate ANOTHER gang and steal THEIR money?Why do some people not own this?Do I recommend this game? OH YES			"

The Gameplay: It still holds up despite it's still buggy as all hell.The Developers and Community Management: They ♥♥♥♥ed up. They broke a community promise and even when they try to counteract the backlash, they basically lost almost all trust to the community. And they did a mediocre job at responding to the hate.			"

												I want to preface this review by saying that I've always been a strong supporter of Overkill and everything they've done. I run a fairly successful Payday 2 Mod with a few friends, and after having spent thousands of hours with this game (lots of which were unrecorded by steam), I can pretty confidently say that I have a firm grasp on my feelings towards it. Lots of people complain about public matches and hosts kicking etc. I get that. That sucks. In my opinion, neither of the Payday games were intended to be played with people other than friends. This game is built on close communication, and knowing who you're playing with. (Again, just my opinion.) But to move on from that, Overkill has always stated that they work hard with the community to bring updates that we'll like. This was true for a while. But as someone who has spoken with, and tried to work together with Overkill, after support was promised to us, I can say that I feel the same way about the overall treatment of the community as I do with our personal treatment as a modding team. And that is that if there's something that requires some effort, or doesn't quite go as planned, Overkill slaps a band-aid on it, and dismisses it completely, until enough community unrest forces them to make a change. They've shown some very poor business practices that past few months, and tried to pull the wool over their communities eyes, but we've all seen through it. You can't try to flush out your community and bring in a new one with a few free days of the game without people noticing. (I mean really? Did you think that was the right choice amidst the panic of ""No microtransactions!"" being shouted at you from every direction by the community as a whole?) The microtransactions have absolutlely affected the fundamental way this game works, and its a shame that Overkill is so dismissive about it. I'm not trying to say that they shouldn't have microtransactions, because sure, go for it. They should have just been handled so much differently than they were, and should have been implimented WAYYYY after all the other content we've been promised since the BETA. (Hello safe house customization, I'm looking at you. And while we're on the subject, the desync was never fixed, so half of the game - stealth - DOESN'T WORK.)I've been a huge fan of both of the Payday's since day 1 of Payday: The Heist, but my review will remain negative until changes are made. This has gone too far.			"

												This could have been a good game, but the development team behind it behave as if they've never published a game before. Their handling of the game since release, and their constant belittlement of players cannot be overlooked or forgiven. Aside from the multitude of constant game-breaking patches, they only seem to listen to a small core group of players who belong to a gaming clan specifically set up to kiss the ♥♥♥ of these developers.Expect plenty of paid DLC and ""weapons packs"" to lure players to return. Have a look at the play charts to see where this game is heading before you make a purchase.They also spend most of their budget on producing these so-called ""webisodes"" instead of actually improving the game in any meaningful way.There are plenty of promises months after release that have never seen the light of day - including cloakers and safehouse customization.The lead developer of this game also refuses to acknlowledge players on the official forums, and instead only responds to players on twitter so as to be able to say whatever he wants to them without repercussion. David Goldfarb - look him up.He's the kind of lead developer that is not in tune with his core audience, and hence, could never develop a product that lived for very long or became memorable in any meaningful way.This game was not designed by the origional Payday designer.

Update Review 3.0Is Payday 2's problems from 2015's Crimefest finally solved?I think it's safe to say yes.For returning players, click this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZNB5dksBryt0RR2F1T7dJEAz2b69yhdLTe7oLvj753w/mobilebasicIf you're new, please take the time to read my beautiful helpful review (not heavily gameplay-wise though).What happened?You see, back at October 2015; Overkill released a major update to the game which is numbered ""79"" and named after the annual event ""Crimefest"" where the developers reveals special or exciting features every day within twelve days of Crimefest. But in order for the community to receive these features for free as I recalled, they have to do a set of challenges that every player in PD2 must do to uncover clues for these said twelve rewards.There were challenges related to Twitter which is...dumb as they say which were later changed to proper in-game challenges and there were times where players grind the ♥♥♥♥ out of one of these challenges such as repeatedly speedrun a Jewerlly Store to achieve the 'high amounts of money challenge' (One of the easy & short heists of the game which is why they repeatedly speedrunning it) hoping the effort of doing this said grind is really worth it.What was the problem?At the time of the event, we've been given rewards that are either magnificant (such as the Payday: The Heist map remakes) or extremely notorious which are the weapon skins that cost actual money and players deemed that they're 'pay-to-win'. These were the microtransactions of Payday 2 that disgusted many players of the community, it's just atrocious.Would you rather buy a DLC packed with a heister or a map with a couple of unique weapons or a microtransaction where you only get one ♥♥♥♥ing weapon with a colourful skin even though there's a mod that allows you to make your own skinned weapons titled as ""Goon Mod"" which existed even before the Black Market Update - the name of the first day of Crimefest. Just imagine that many players spend their time doing challenges for Crimefest only to receive something that the majority dislikes which is the microtransactions, it's just frustrating if you think about it and not to mention that Overkill originally said that they won't add MTs years ago so that was disgraceful to see them lied to our faces.There is some speculation that 505 Games (publishers) are behind this scheme.How did it got solved?As time goes on as Overkill tries to fix their relationship to their own community, they finally got most of the players back including me because in the 100th update: They announced that they own all the rights to Payday 2 from the publishers 505 Games and they're freeing up the Black Market so even though they didn't fully remove microtransactions, at least they're no longer pay-to-win and the rest of the future safes (similiar to TF2's crates and CSGO's cases) will be available to be unlockable at the start so no drill (key) will be required to unlock it, you can just open it once you received it on your payday so everything should be okay right?Almost, it's still a walking billboard (advertising other games/movies with crossovers occasionally), they haven't gave the Completely Overkill Pack owners the secret present that they deserved yet (but they are working on it), Infamy is questionable(?) and a couple more issues but does that make Payday 2 a bad game? Of course not. The gameplay is very enjoyable and you can mod it to your will without affecting other unmodded players, go ahead and play it with your friends.OMFG TL:DR-Overkill dun goofed to Payday 2-Porbably because of partnership with 505 Games-Microtransactions issue has been addressed-Also free grenades for everybody :D-Infamy problem, COP reward delay, Advertising/Crossovers is still a thing-Gameplay is fun as hell especially with your mates-Payday Subreddit is a fun place-Modding community is healthy and active-Game is good-DonacdumYou should buy the game but in order to get most of the experience, at least spend a extra cash on DLCs otherwise it would be quite limited in terms of weapon choices, map choices, character choices, etc.The essential DLC you should purchase is ""Gage Mod Courier"" otherwise get Payday 2: Game of the Year edition while the sales are currently active.

												Designed for multiplayer, but with a toxic community. So sick of getting into arguments with kids about who tripped the alarm (yes, I was seen trying to sneak a body out of the bank, but your dumb friend shot a guy in the lobby and left the corpse for security to find), but after getting kicked from 8 games in a row, you kinda realize you gotta engage and win those arguments if you expect to ever finish a mission. Also, DLC trap! If you don't get the DLC, you'll be invading russia with lightweight assault rifles while your teammates have grenade launchers, flamethrowers and gattling guns. Yes, you can play some of the game without them, but when you're pointing a pair of magnums at a swat truck with a machine gun turret, you start to envy the guy with the RPG.Base game gives, as of March 2017, 52/127 weapons, 35/57 missions, and 4/23 characters. (and that's assuming you've joined their community to get the community-only items). Also keep in mind the DLC totals like $200.Other than those issues, it's a good game. A real disappointment they ruined it... it's a pretty enjoyable.			"

												I've been holding off on leaving a negative review in hopes of some miracle that Overkill would be able to make up for their shameless actions over the past several months. Unfortunately it seems that once again greed has won over common sense and Overkill has decided to release another paid advertisement DLC in the form of heists based off of an upcoming movie. Also they still refuse to get rid of their microtransaction pay 2 win system which they promised would never happen in the first place. They had the perfect opportunity to build an amazing company. They had a wonderful game (which I spent 700+ hours playing), a loyal community following, and had earned the trust and praise of hundreds of thousands of people. Then they threw it all away just to make a few extra dollars. They don't care about the community anymore. They don't care about earning back our trust. They don't care about you.Overkill does not deserve a single cent of your money. Please do not buy Payday 2 or any Overkill game in the future.Edit 1: The new paid advertisement DLC game out today. They have the movie trailer playing right when you start up Payday 2. They couldn't have sent a clearer message that they only care about money.			"

												With over 1100 hours played, I think it’s time to finally make my Steam review.I love this game. It gave (and still giving) me tons of unforgettable moments, lots of laughter, and - of course – some freakouts as well.The game is about stealing. Starting with some jewelry or paintings, soon after that you will be robbing a bank or even destroying an entire mall. And even after that you’ll be stealing an EMP Bomb and some servers alongside with a fusion engine. And yeah, let’s not forget the nukes and goats. Yeah. Nukes and goats. For our beloved Russian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Vlad. (who is giving a ♥♥♥♥ing pig as a present for his Mama, really, Vlad?)Pros:-	Solid gameplay-	Pretty high replayability-	Tons of weapons with lot of customization (Throwables, Deployables, Special weapons (RPG, Minigun))-	High variety of skill setups-	Many different types of enemies (SWATs, Shields, Tazers, Cloakers, Snipers, Bulldozers, etc.)-	Lots of things can be modded  with ease (HUDs; custom sounds; or even custom, community-made maps)-       Many different playstyles (tank, dodge, sneaky ghost, etc.)-	Over 500 achievements-       6 difficulty levels, suits the beginners and the eliteists at the same time-	Best voice lines I’ve ever heard-	FREAKING GOOD MUSICCons:-	Cloakers, they can kick your ♥♥♥, no matter what you do-	Despite the high replayability, the game can be a bit boring after you’ve done everything in it-	Connection to other players sometimes can be inconsistent and unreliable-	That „host is the boss” system can lead to some causeless and unprovoked kicks from the game-	The entire game is based on the Diesel engine, which looks ugly and outdated-	The stealth mechanism is very unrealistic, but nah, I can live with that-	Cloakers-	The microtransactions caused a huge outcry for the community, but they – almost – completely wiped that away-	Tons of DLCs, you have to pay lots and lots of extra money for these, because this game without any DLC is like a naked bread. Nobody likes it without any extra „toppings”-       Lots and lots of cheaters, who are ruining the game and the community for no reason-	Oh, yeah, have I mentioned the ♥♥♥♥ING CLOAKERS?All in all, I highly recommend this game. Doesn’t worth the base price (+ the DLCs), but definitely worth giving it a shot, when it’s on sale.Update: I nominated the game in the ""Test of Time"" category for the 2016 Steam Awards.			"

												PAYDAY 2 is a first-person shooter game developed by OVERKILL. PAYDAY 2 is the next installment after PAYDAY: The Heist.PAYDAY 2, unlike the previous game, has many improvements, upgrades and changes in the gameplay. You don't just blaze your way around to rob a store or bank, drilling the vault and escape. You need more strategy and planning in PAYDAY 2, which also make stealth approach as an option, and sometimes a primary option for most heist. Doing stealth is not easy, but you get bonuses for doing stealth. Teamwork are more encouraged in PAYDAY 2, especially on stealth approach. As a matter of fact, you will need to work together on stealth heist.The police in PAYDAY 2 are more vary and some are even powerful, as some of them are technically not police, but FBI task force. In lower difficulties you may only meet the police and SWAT team, but in higher difficulties, FBI are your primary enemies. Dozer, cloaker, tazer, shield, they are making a return in PAYDAY 2.The upgrade system in PAYDAY 2 has also been changed and improved. Unlike PAYDAY: The Heist, you can choose skill tree and perks you prefer the most in PAYDAY 2 and has to focus on that as you cannot become everything, you have to be something for your crew. If you prefer stealth approach, you need to focus on the right skill tree like ghost, or if you like shooting people around, you could be an enforcer. Each skill tree has unique bonus, weapon skill and special equipment, but you are limited with what you are.Weapons in PAYDAY 2 are also more customizable, barrel, scope or sight, stock, magazine, laser sight and more. You can customize your weapons to suit your skill tree and perks, or just customize them to be something you prefer. Mask can also now be customized with patterns or colors to make yourself unique among other criminals.Graphics of PAYDAY 2 is far better than the previous, more detailed and more beautiful. With masks and weapons customization system and detailed models, they look so beautiful, making the gameplay so epic and making your customization even more unique. PAYDAY 2 performances are also good, despite sometimes I tend to crash.In the latest update, PAYDAY 2 introduced microtransactions system similar to those in CS:GO and Dota 2, despite the promises that there will be never a microtransactions in PAYDAY 2. The weapon skin on PAYDAY 2 have differenced however, as some rare skin includes stats bonuses.Overall PAYDAY 2 is awesome, I recommend this so much.Rating 9/10			"

Edit 2:Welp, they managed to sell themselves the hero. ""We bought our rights back! Microtransactions are gone!""... even though the old microtransactions are still there, you're still going to have to pay to get the skins you want, and that they came up with the idea for the microtransactions.Still no new free content which was promised from the Black Market Update.-Payday 2 was, for the longest time, my favorite game. It would be the ONLY game I was playing for quite a while. I just enjoyed what it was. A 4 person co-op which delivered. Cool mechanics, multiple ways to approach a heist, stealth and loud, multiple types of weaponry...And I can no longer recommend this game which I once raved about.I poured money into this game. Not including my account's PC purchases, I've easily hit upper-double-digits in terms of cost.I put $50 for the Hype Train with DLC, the COPack, and Hotline Miami 2:Deluxe Edition.I had so many ideas on how to rebalance the combat, how to improve the heists' RNG, how to add new mechanics. I became active on the forums.But, after all the lies and inability to address the problem, Overkill has stolen this game from me.I can look back, and realise just how many issues I plainly ignored because I loved this game. Game-breaking bugs, terrible optimization, brain-dead AI, a useless skill tree, a lack of ""real"" content, and more.Many of these were changed or improved, but far too many over the years.I left the console version because they refused to support it. I paid for access to Safehouse Customization and 30 unique heists.Nope, dropped the support on that one.I'm STILL waiting on the Safehouse Customization for the PC version, which was described as being completed before release.I also bought this game knowing that there would be ""NO microtransactions ([and shame on me for thinking that they'd stoop that low!])"".Shame on me?But worst of all? The Completely Overkill Pack.$20, 4 masks, ""It isn't a donation"" DLC with a secret item coming later. A secret, exclusive, cosmetic-only item ""crafted with love and care"".It pretty much failed every point there.I tried to refund it before they released the secret item, after they went from an unknown amount of time after several months to the end of Crimefest, to a week after Crimefest, to another week after Crimefest.Refund denied.Or the fact we had to work and grind (which raises the overall play time, which they count on their quarterly reports ;) to unlock access to the ""FREE"" paid microtransactions.When faced with a MASSIVE backlash, they lied and shifted the blame and refused to acknowledge where the problem came from. ""Players seem to be loving it, statistics say otherwise!"", ""All the media is nothing but clickbait!"", ""We're sorry, we messed up, we'll fix this, but we're not going to say HOW or WHAT we messed up. We messed up on how we presented it, not the fact it was an immoral, nearly illegal action""When faced with the massive backlash Day 1, they waited. Complete and total radio silence.""We just wanted everyone to calm down! Be rational!""and by doing that, they made the changes irreversible.They don't care about their community anymore. They can barely listen to their own forum mods.All they care about is money.Which they won't use to fund Payday 2. They'll use it to fund their 8 unrelated, multi-million dollar (each) projects.Just stay away.			"

												The addition of microtransactions to get skins that provide stat boosts? Even after Overkill promised us they would never be added! Sure, the ""drills"" drop in rewards now, but that doesn't completely take away the pay to win aspect. I'm over the greedy tactics of this game and the developer behind it. As it stands now, we have about $130 dollars worth of individual DLC on top of the game itself. Adding microtransactions to that was a terrible move. Remember when Overkill promised ""safehouse customization"" and never delivered on that? [www.crimenet.info] I love how they can implement an entire pay-to-win system, but can't deliever on promises they made to their community from the release of the game.

												If you are thinking of starting this game, look elsewhere until they roll back the Death Wish patch. You went from having 2 approaches to a mission, to only being able to do it guns blazing and even then, you're heaviest armor wont save you. The way leveling and rewards work in this game, you HAVE to farm repeatedly, but the new patch punishes you for doing the same mission twice in a row. Stop micromanaging how players should enjoy this game! What were you thinking Overkill?			"

												With the most recent updates, Payday 2 introduced paid microtransactions, after repeatedly saying ""Shame on you"" to players for even thinking about them being used, and using the fact that they aren't in the game as a selling point. The mission DLC was structured well, but overall almost nothing but weapon packs and other exclusive DLC has been made, culminating to this. Overkill is currently trying to nickel and dime the customer base, and I don't see that changing for a long time.			"

												So here's the thing. I have 2,000 hours in this game. I have a Youtube channel of me doing Death Wish heists solo without bots. I did the Tabula Rasa challenge solo without bots, unmodded weapons, before Grinder. You could say I loved this game at one point.That time is gone. Overkill has repeatedly broken promises. They directly said before release ""We will not ever have microtransactions."" And yesterday, October 15, 2015, they added Microtransactions. This game is not Free to Play with microtransactions. This game is not cheap with microtransactions. This game has a reasonably priced base game with $100 of DLC. In order to purchase this game with all DLC, you must pay $130 outside of a sale. On top of this $130 price tag are microtransactions. Just...think about that. The price of this game alone is more than the price of two AAA games. Overkill then has the audacity to TRIPLE DIP on this by adding microtransactions.Last year, there were a series of ""what's next"" audio files hinting at something. After a *month* of daily audio files being released, it culminated in an advertisement for another game that isn't released until 2016 and an in-game baseball bat.Last year, we had ""Crimefest,"" where the top reward Overkill was to release was a mystery. This mystery ended up being John Wick. A movie tie-in they were going to make and release anyway.Last year, some of the rewards for Crimefest were ""FBI Files"" (in-game stats), and a new enemy. These weren't released until this year. The FBI files ended up being a re-implementation of a community web page, and the new enemy ended up just being a bunch of shields standing in a circle.This year, Overkill did a ""Hype Train"" event. By pre-ordering DLC, we would get ""hype-fuel"" points. With enough ""hype-fuel,"" rewards for the community would be unlocked. In order to boost sales, Overkill finally delivered on a promise of finishing their new prestige levels (called Infamy). The first five infamy levels provided very small gameplay benefits along with awesome in-game masks. The next 20 levels released in Infamy 2.0 provided new masks and experience point bonuses (so you can infamy....faster?). I call this ""Mask Pack 2.0."" It took Overkill 14 months to release this. In response, people started refunding their DLC pre-orders. In response to THAT, Overkill released the DLC early so no one could get refunds. The latest Hype-train reward has yet to be released. In response to this, I completely stopped buying DLC. I have no DLC at all that has been released since Mask Pack 2.0.And most recently, Overkill added microtransactions after explicitly saying that they will NEVER do that along with intentionally breaking extremely well made community mods. Overkill does not deserve your money. They do not deserve any money. They have repeatedly broken their promises to the community. They have insulted the community. They have done absolutely nothing but show how far a company can fall.Overkill, shame on you. I do not believe there are words that can describe my level of disappointment with you. Am I angry? You bet your ♥♥♥ I am. But more than that, I'm just so disappointed. You've truly shown that you are nothing but liars and cheats, and I hope your company goes out of business.			"

												First of all, I know my hrs on record isn't big, but that's not the point.I loved this game. It was fun and the gameplay was pretty unique. I even convinced some of my friends to buy it, they did and then we had fun playing together! But no, the Overkill decided to flip the bird to the whole PD2 community by microtransactions and nerfing weapons. Not. Cool. I wouldn't mind if the microtransactions were for skins only. You wanna buy some skin? Good for you! But WHY are skins upgrading gun stats?? Like the amount of DLCs isn't enough.Never have I ever felt the need to write a review on Steam. But what Overkill has done is truly sh**ty.Edit:Overkill's brilliant idea for the fix - update 90. ""Let's just make the whole skin deal more unfair - bonus experience and money!""Almir, you said complete transparency and community interaction. Well, when did the interaction happen, I ask?

												Having played over 400 hours of this game I can safely say you can avoid getting into it now. I'll admit the game was great fun at first until Overkill got some of that EA magic rubbed off on them and now after building a huge community all they see is dollar signs.You could buy this game cheap now yes on a sale, just don't get addicted to it because you'll feel you need all the DLC which is a huge mistake. All Overkill is doing right now with this franchise is grabbing the community by the ♥♥♥ and milking out every dollar they can.Also the heists have very little replayability unless you like mindless grinding and literally doing the same thing over and over again.It was nice at first but now they just pushed it to far and are choking their own game giving it a slow painful death. But I doubt they care ... because you know guys money amirite? EVERYONE LIKES MONEY. ITS IRONIC BECAUSE THIS GAME IS ABOUT STEALING MONEY AND THAT'S ALL THIS COMPANY IS DOING TO THE COMMUNITY HAHA.

 About PAYDAY 2The only lacking thing with Payday 2 would have to be its story. Most of the story takes place behind the scenes, and there's an online web series to set the premise for the game. For those curious about the base concept, here's a summary using knowledge I've inferred:Between Payday: The Heist and Payday 2, something went horribly wrong at one point or another. A heist went south, and one of the core members (Hoxton) was taken into police custody. Since then, the Payday crew has had to leave behind a lot of their money and infamy in order to keep a low profile. Now that Bain has set up a crime organization network known as Crime.net, the Payday crew can once again fulfill their need for money and destruction, but they have to start from scratch. Because of this, all weapons, attachments and masks are ahead of you, not already lying in a stockpile back at your safehouse. This sets the stage for a lengthy journey to ""earn"" money, fight off cops, and eventually free your long time heisting pal Hoxton.(Please note, the above is purely assumed, as most of the story of Payday isn't clearly stated, save for the webisodes and the later heists that you cannot immediately access from level 0.) GameplayAs Payday 2 is constantly being patched and changed, the contents of this section are subject to change.The majority of Payday 2's charm is involved in its very, very customizable gameplay. As such, this section will be cut into three sections: Inventory, Character and Core Content. Oh, and it goes without saying - you have to fight cops, or in some cases armed thugs. But mostly cops. All of the cops. CharacterCompleting any heist in Payday 2 will award experience which will, in turn, level you up. Leveling up once grants a skill point, every ten levels grants two more, and reaching certain level requirements will unlock weaponry. Once you've reached level 100, you can choose to Infamy, a mechanic similar to prestiging in the Call of Duty franchise. Your level is reset to zero, you gain a special mask and more experience from heists, and you can choose to reduce skill point requirement for tiers in a skill tree of your choice. Speaking of which!Skill trees! There are five to choose from: The brutish and tanky Enforcer, the crafty saboteur known as the Mastermind, the stealthmaster and assassin Ghost, the tech-savvy destroyer of Technician, and the jack-of-all-trades Fugitive. All of these provide their own skills to choose from, and many builds incentivise hybridization between two or three skill trees. I, for one, play Mastermind/Ghost with a hint of Fugitive, but anyone can play any spec! That's the beauty of the skill system.All in All PAYDAY 2 is a verry Good Game9/10 From MeSweep "

												I've been playing this game since the first week of release back in 2013.  Even though games like Killing Floor and some others are decent co-ops, what separates Payday 2 is that it is dynamic.  You can play the same heists, the same difficulty with the same people, and the results will always be different every game.  You can breeze through the objectives or get crushed by the cops - either way it's fun to play with 3 other players to strive completing the objectives.  Perhaps the best part about Payday 2 is the mod community.  If mods did not exist in this game, I would've stopped playing it years ago.  I have around 20 mods installed, from aesthetics like background wallpaper to weapon modifications to, my favorite, difficulty mods.  This greatly enchances the number of cops, accuracy of the cops, and the aggressiveness of the cops beyond what Overkill designed.  This keeps the replay value high for me and makes me crave more, even though this game is almost 4 years old and approaching no more developer support. Most people will complain that there is too much DLC and that all of it together costs too much - which I completely understand.  However, if you have been playing PD2 since the start like me, you buy the DLC as it comes.  Why would you spend money on DLC for a game you would not play?  You wouldn't.  I must be the last of a dying breed when it comes to this game I guess, because I still love it tremendously, even after almost 4 years.  I highly recommend this game if you love co-operative games.			"

												Edit: 2015-11-20:Have a grievance with the developers? Leave the community group and join this one instead:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vocalminorityEdit: 2015-10-18: The game now has micro-transactions. Avoid like the plague. Used to be a great game but the developers have now gone completely overboard with paid downloadable content. Less and less content yet the prices just keep rising. Worse yet, they introduce pre-orders, limited time content and stretch goal incentives into a game that's been out for well over a year.And then try to pass off our purchase of an overpriced limited time only cosmetic item, with a secret component yet not revealed, as being a way to ""support"" the developers.How about you make a better product instead?Edit - And now it turns out one of the crowd sourcing stretch goals unlock more DLC that they charge for. What was even the point of the hype fuel then, if it was already going to be sold?Don't buy this game. The company employs practises that are bad for all customers.Edit 2015-10-18: Just discovered this and thought it would be fun to share:http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/576817490783699647/2E4E2AE5112EB1C9927BEF58DF3CA301E789107C/I've also heard that the game has gotten even worse.

												With the new update Overkill has now introduced a pay2win skin system, as well as micro-transactions.Overkill has lied several times in the past, promising no micro-transactions ever.(http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521) (http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/)The new skins (unlike CSGO) affects stats of the guns, and are not purely cosmetic.They have also disabled the free skin mods created by modders such as GoonMod, in order to prevent any competition with the pay2win system.This company has taken one of the best, and most loyal fanbases I've ever seen on the PC platform (even in the face of their ridiculous constant DLC releases that lock non-owners out of the new missions), and have lied and taken a huge dump on their trust and respect. I'm done with this game until this is changed, and I'd ask any other players with self-respect think about doing the same. Stick up for your values and show that you deserve respect and honesty as a customer and player.			"

												Overkill, Overkill, Overkill... Or perhaps Starbreeze, Starbreez, Starbreeze... Regardless the point still stands. This game has gone to crap. It was so good for so long; even despite the heavy focus on 5-10 dollar DLC with heists, characters, and weapons - which slowly did become less and less about quality and more about making a quick buck (Ninja pack was a bit lacking, Chivalry pack seemed silly, and Jiro just doesn't seem appealing as a character at all). And then Crimefest 2015 came about, and Payday 2 was hit with the microtransaction stick. Yes, now you have 'safes' that drop and you buy (with real money, 2.50 a pop) 'drills' to open them and get weapon skins. Oh, but it gets worse; those skins aren't just cosmetics, but they have actual STATS attached! And it gets EVEN FREAKING BETTER when you realize that these weapon skins with STAT BOOSTS AS IN PAY TO WIN cost an average on Steam's marketplace of... between 15 and 40 dollars, and that price is probably gonna go up. The game's core fanbase is abandoning ship at a rapid rate, and after this free-to-play time during Crimefest ends I'm willing to bet it just dries up. This is thoroughly unacceptable behavior, and I quite frankly do not plan to recommend this game to anyone, or to play it again unless these changes are reversed. You broke this game, guys. Fix it or we'll leave it to rot.			"

												I don't know what to say... It used to be one of, if not, the best co-op multiplayer game out there. It's fun and time consuming, trying to beat each heists, doing it loud or stealth. DLCs are kind of expensive, but they're on sales quite often and bring actual content to the game (i.e new weapons, new heists, etc). It's also kind of justified since the game itself doesn't have microtransactions. Until Crimefest 2015... What a disaster.. P2W stat-boosting skins that you get from crates (just like dota2 and TF), along with a number of other stupidly broken weapon rebalances. Oh, did I mention that you need a $2.50 drill to open the crates? So original, huh? To make it worse, they actually promised not to launch a microtransactions for the game when it was just released 2 years ago.I can't actually remember the last time I played a game where I need to pay for the game, pay for the dlcs, and still need to pay for a ♥♥♥♥ing microtransactions that's P2W. Yeah, that's right.. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU OVERKILL. and thanks for reminding us why we shouldn't trust a game developer.			"

												Dont get me wrong here, I love the game, its a great game to play with friends and to spend tons of time on. Still, I have to say I dont recommend this game. The game is poorly coded in all honesty, the way the game updates is absolute trash, I personally have to verify integrity of game cache every single time I feel like playing it, reinstalling hasnt done anything, trying to install it on a different harddrive hasnt done anything. If I dont verify my game cache, I cant join otherpeoples games for that everything is delayed and cant interract with objects, that is if I dont lose connection to the host every 10seconds.Another reason why I dislike the game is that half of the content is locked behind tons of DLC's that all together costs a ridiculous amount of money, especially when considering this game is half a year from its 4year anniversary.But again, I still love playing the game when ever it decides to work. Its fun and entertaining, even more so with friends to play it with, just has a ♥♥♥♥ load of bugs in it.			"

												I seldom write reviews.I also don't continue playing microtransaction games that use my wallet for ammo.Edited since Overkill made drills obtainable in game as card drops. Drop rate for free drills is still unknown but most probably very low; forcing people to either buy keys or farm 1day jobs for drops... Top rare skins still stat-boost weapons and are sub-par cosmetically and often make little sense, such as a shiny Judge being +1 concealment while a black matte Judge is +1 accuracy.The weapon rebalance is a mess. The F2P element is in stealth mode but still present.Overkill also killed off BLT&LUA hooks, so my fancy Payday: The Heist HUD is gone, as well as other mods such as Better Weapon Stats, and the very popular Overkill ""Approved"" HoxHud..Overkill also (badly) ripped off payday2stats hard fanmade work without due credit given.I wish I hadn't spent money on DLC's and I am still not going to play PD2 as it stands.Keep demanding Overkill remove stat boosts on weapons and add skins to after-mission drops directly, bypassing the safes! Forgive OK if they turn away from evil again, but never forget!Edit to this review will be in once I've done fair research into the new Update 100 and what it means in terms of microtransactions and the Payday 2 Win element. In short, Overkill has aquired the rights to their game from Starbreeze, a very significant move; in which one of their first actions were to make safes openable without buying keys. Jury is still out in regards to the DLC train however..			"

												TLDR Summary:Don't buy it.  They added lame microtransactions with stat-boosts to guns that they nerfed in the same patch, after saying they'd never do so.  The company has pretty crappy relations with the game community, which could possibly lead to an eventually dead game for online play (no joke).  And map design for recently released maps shows a trend towards boring, tedious gameplay, rather than the inventive gameplay of early maps. Now then, the review proper.I have around 250 hrs of gameplay in this game. I  bought it in 2014, picking up the GOTY edition, which (mercifully) bundled the DLC that had been released up to that point.  On the whole, the game is entertaining, and has offered a variety of gameplay approaches, including stealth and straight-up action.  Early on, the heists were interestnig and fun (most of the time), and it was cool to plan different builds for your character (e.g. you could build a sort of ""tank"" approach, or a ""stealth"" approach, or a ""buff/debuff"" approach, etc.).  However, I cannot, at this point, recommend the game to new players for several reasons. First and foremost, the recent introduction of microtransactions is a major negative.  If all the microtransactions were for was purely cosmetic skins (a la TF2's hats), I'd think it's silly, but it would be tolerable (more on the silliness issue in a bit).  But the weapon skins also include stat buffs.  This also comes at the same time as a recent ""balance"" update which makes many of the previous builds on weapons far less viable.  Weapons' inherent and modified (through normal additions that randomly drop for free throughout the game) accuracy has been severely hampered.  These two factors, taken together -- a nerf to weapons at the same time as the introduction of microtransactions for skins that buff weapon stats -- is unconscionable, especially in a game that (outside of a sale) already costs you $20, and has almost $100 of individually purchasable DLC (again, at full price).  There's just no excuse for this kind of change to the game.  Moreover, the microtransactions aren't even for the actual stat-modifying skins themselves.  Rather, they're for a system similar to buying keys to open crates a la TF2.  You basically are buying a CHANCE to get the stat modifying skin, you can get duplicates, and you can also get a skin for a weapon that's actually a DLC one you don't even have. Second, the company's relationship with its customers is...pretty abysmal.  Two company representatives -- one the now-departed lead designer -- were on record as saying ""We will never add microtransactions to the game.""  As you can see, the company itself has gone back on this.  However, there have been several other lies, delays, and general mismanagement of community relations.  For a game like this, you aren't just buying the game itself.  The game is constantly changing and being updated by the company -- sometimes in ways you don't like.  But players have no choice but to accept the changes and keep playing, or quit.  It's actually closer to an MMO model in that respect, so ongoing community relations issues matter to this game more than, say, questionable game changes where you can simply roll back to a prior version.  That's not an option here.  In the wake of this microtransaction debacle, the company has remained largely silent, including failures to respond to media inquiries.  My guess is that they're just laying low and hoping this will all blow over.  I wouldn't be so sure.  My point here is that the current company managing the game is not the same company it was when the game launched, and basically is not that interested in maintaining and managing the game's community.  This is a dangerous step, in my opinion.  The game relies on peer-to-peer matchmaking, which means if nobody's playing, your only way to play is to play with bots who are dumber than a bag of hammers.  As community relations continue to deteriorate, it's entirely possible that the game will enter a kind of death-spiral as people continue to quit, to the point where it eventually is about as dead as, oh, Brink. Third, as I mentioned above, the initial maps you play are, undeniably, a lot of fun.  They showcase the potential for complexity in this game, and inventive map design.  However, recent map releases have all started to focus on a particular style of map.  Basically, it involves ""loud"" action-oriented maps (or maps where stealth is fairly difficult to maintain), followed by having to drag the loot you steal across a long stretch of ground under fire.  This is tedious and boring, and while the maps look kinda cool the first time, actually playing them is just, well, a drag (pardon the pun).  It appears that the inventive design of prior maps is now a thing of the past, and we're basically going to be relegated to flashy, but boring gameplay.  On top of that, many of the recently released DLC packs have taken the game in increasingly silly directions.  The Chivalry pack and Western pack added medieval and western themed weapons and masks, which really have no business in a game about robbing banks.  It's not uncommon to see people playing with increasingly ridiculous outfits and weapons.  Now, in the end, this is more of a ""flavor"" thing, and not really a game-killer to me, but it's basically like the addition of ""hats"" in TF2.  It took the core design of the game and made it that much more ridiculous.  That's fine in a cartoony game like TF2, but this was, at one time, a serious bank-robbing game a la the film Heat.  Your mileage may vary on this issue, though.For a while, I really enjoyed the game.  I can't deny that.  I question how much fun new players will have, though, given how much grinding you have to do in the game, and given that a good portion of the playerbase is really, really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about recent changes, and the company's response appears to be an indifferent shrug or simple silence.  So, yeah, at this point, I wouldn't buy it.			"

												Pay2Day. Recent changes have lead to disgusting weapon balance (I mean, it wasn't that good before, but now it's atrocious) and added pay to win [more] microtransactions. But you can inspect your weapon now, so that's a huge gameplay improvement. Pardon the snide comments, I'm a bit salty.			"

												Very disagreeable DLC stance and pricing with how often they are put out.Recent introduction of microtransactions that actually give benefits in game, pushed out at the same time as nerfing already existing guns, as a ""reward"" for having the community hit certain milestones in an event about free content.The game is unoptimized in performance and content. Online connections are prone to failure. Stealth system is almost completely a joke, especially with how online is extremely finicky.This game is all about how much you can put up with, and it has pushed too far.			"

												Once upon a time there was a nice game called Payday 2. It was the sequel of a really cool concept named Payday: The Heist, and it improved so much over the original game that millions of people bought it. Sadly, that game is nowhere to be found now, as evil minions of chaos spirited away the original devs and added microtransactions (yes, the very same things that the original devs swore to keep away from their beautiful game)There was a nice game here.

												After the weapon rebalance and microtransactions update I can't recommend thisconsidering these add to the game's already existing flawsThese existing flaws include-Powercreep which means that newer additions will make previous content worthless-Infamy which isn't really as cosmetic as most players believe but reaching infamy 5 lets you have more control over the skill tree-Poor difficulty scaling-Excessive DLC which isn't really neccessary to progress but you won't be able to meet your team's requirements in certain cases-A skill tree that forces you to pick certain ""Must-have skills"" regardless of the build you're aiming for one of those skills is transporter which lets you move faster when carrying a bag otherwise you'll be useless to the team if you can't do that-RNG based reward system, which means you can take hours before you could get the weapon mod you want-Heavy focus on bag throwing and tasks that aren't fun such as picking a safe-Stealth is poorly designed because getting rid of evidence is way harder than in most stealth games and you have to place items such as drills that may attract enemy attention so you don't have control over whether the enemy sees the drill once your pagers and body bags are gone-Mediocre graphics-Poor optimisation on AMD GPUs-Built on an engine that was developed in 2001 and is designed for racing games which leaves the game incapable of rendering too many animations at onceHere's a video of the game the engine they used is developed for

												This game has gone on sale so many times in a Year already.It's desperate to get more players but fails to do so after its controversy of Weapon Rebalance to fit in Stats Weapon skin for Micro-Transaction in which they completely lied to their community that there won't be Micro-Transaction.The amount of DLC it has release that people paid for also has LOCK-Content that is behind Achievements...LOCK PAID CONTENT!!! It could be understandable for Free Content to lock said Content behind Achievement but not if we PAID for it!!They also ignore 90% of the community or more than 90% for the broken trust they had done.Now their latest patch update optimization has downgraded their Engine and Assets which makes the game now unplayable because they wanted to open up to Low-End specs player but backfired and back-track themselves.I used to love playing Payday 2 but ever since it hit Micro-Transaction and all its new Optimization to make the game so unplayable and unstable, I can no longer recommended this game.

Criticism they silenced, mixing in non-truths and lies masquerading as excuses.Simon Viklund's music is pretty cool though, as usual. It's not like the game was bad, either, it's just that they lied and that they lied about lying (and 'fixed' bugs that never were bugs solely to appease to stupid console players, in the process lowering the uniqueness of the game and the skill ceiling).

======================================TL;DR: I don't care if this review gets attention or not, the steam rating for this game deserves every single hit it takes, and it deserves for people to proactively take those shots.======================================Amongst many indie games that didn't quite reach their ambitions, didn't have the funding, or shot themselves in the foot, I find the steam community usually has things covered. Reviews often mention pros along with cons, or will admit if something is redeeming or good. You might hear that the mechanics are great but content is lacking, for example.Amongst many AAA games from greedy publishers, or with terrible quality, or maybe even just a poorly done port, I find the steam community often always has it covered. Sometimes, I think the steam community just likes to ♥♥♥♥ on things, and do it hard and dirty, and some things unfairly get a bad rap, or the rap lasts a little longer than it needs to.I have never, ever felt the need to put up a negative review for a game. Most of the games I go for have some redeeming or unique quality, if I don't find them to be wholly good. Other things, usually have the reputation they deserve.======================================But this...Overkill, you absolutely deserve absolutely every negative review you get.More than that, you don't just deserve what you get...you are so deserving, that I think people should go out of their way to make sure you know how the gaming community feels about these kinds of business practices. Even if it doesn't effect their personal experiences with the game much.Got it as a gift? Doesn't matter.Only have one hour in the game? Doesn't matter.Never bought any of their blatant advertisement DLC? Doesn't matter.Maybe you just think this ♥♥♥♥ is bound to happen eventually, and shake your head. No, ♥♥♥♥ that, doesn't matter.They deserve to know this isn't right, no matter who you are, how much, or what you've invested.Don't let this go. "

												Edit- Well, Crimefest 2015 is over. While almost every day seemed like it was part of an elaborate joke, there was no punchline. Almir, the head of the company, did an AMA on Reddit, and has outright said that the microtransactions will not be removed, that the stat bonuses from skins will not be removed, and that everything is going great on their end. He says that the only people upset are a very vocal minority.I've already bought this game. I've already bought a lot of the DLC (most of it). But I won't be buying any more games from Overkill. Almir wants to present Overkill as a tiny independent dev company, and this is not the case. Almir wants to pretend that the community was happy to have the safes, the crappy skins, and the stat bonuses, and we are not. Almir wants to pretend like Overkill is struggling, and needs the funds from microtransactions to stay afloat, while their parent company's own financial reports (publicly visible, since they are a publicly traded company) prove otherwise. In fact, they show that Payday 2 has been raking in the money.The blatant lies and disregard for the community shown by Almir, who is apparently acting as their community spokesperson as well, since nobody else has said a word, are rather disappointing. Even more disappointing, since this is, in fact, a great game.Original: This is a great game, and right now, you should not buy it.Prior to release, the devs outright said that there would be no microtransactions. Then, on the first day of an event they said would be full of free rewards for the players, after completing a large series of challenges, they added microtransaction safes that give you (awful looking) skins for weapons, along with stat boosts for said weapons.The endless cycle of DLC was already getting to be a little much, but with blatantly going back on their word, trying to downplay the blowback, and attempting to silence and wait out the anger in their community, I would recommend against this game.Perhaps if the microtransactions are removed, the safes no longer possible to receive instead of a payout for finishing a mission, some way to earn keys without actually spending money, the stat boosts removed, perhaps then it might be worth picking up again.But then you'll have to ask yourself: Is this a company I can trust anymore?

												It was a good game when it was first released.  Over the years there have been like 20+ DLC's released which has led to alot of power creep, which results in the company constantly rebalancing everything.  It makes it very hard as a casual player to be able to come back to this game after a while because you have to relearn everything again, which is the un-fun part of playing video games.  With crimfest, Overshill has added microtransactions to the game; the company previously promised would never be a part of the game many times over.			"

												Exhibit #1, how a fun reboot of a cooperative classic devolves into a shameless cashgrab with a pay to win structure, not even fit for a free to play game. This microtransaction hell is already layered on top of the full priced base game and an ever growing mountain of DLC. Thanks but no thanks. Enjoy how the playerbase exponentially vanishes and the goodwill of your community evaporates.			"

												The good 'ol times when the game used to be good. No more. They said many times the game won't have microtransactions - now they broke their own law. Introducing the tradeable skins with stats broke the game for me. R.I.P. Payday, we hope you will get a worthy ancestor.			"

												Overkill is already too money-hungry. Before the latest update, the whole dlc system was complete ♥♥♥♥. You have to buy it, then you have to earn the addons for the weapons in ridiculous achievements. Now, Overkill has crossed the line. They debuffed every gun in the game, and now theres skins for said guns. The skins improve the stats of the guns, and the way you get the skins is to buy them on the market. Each key (last i checked) was $3.00 dollars each. Overkill is too money-hungry.It was a fun game until this pay to win ♥♥♥♥. Who the hell has a pay to win system in a game that you have to buy? OVERKILL Almir also promised in an interview a while back that there will never be a micro-transaction element in the game. Who can trust a head developer of a game who lies?0/10			"

												It's a flawed but fun game that many of my friends have spent hundreds of hours in and that I have often wished I had more time to spend on myself.  But at this stage I couldn't recommend it due to the monetisation practices of the developers.Most recently, after years of promising 'no microtransactions', the developers rewarded the efforts of players during a crimefest event by introducing microtransactions.  Specifically safes that can replace traditional loot from heists and that can only be opened using drills purchasable with real money.  The safes contain weapon skins that can boost stats and conveniently mitigate the effects of a simultaneous 'rebalancing' in which many existing weapons were nerfed.Given that many of the nerfed weapons were purchased through DLC on top of a full price game, and given that after paying to open them the new safes can drop skins for weapons that require purchase through further DLC, I think at this stage the exploitation has gone well beyond double-dipping or even possibly triple-dipping.And that is frankly only the tip of the iceberg - the most complete and reasonably presented list of issues that I have seen can be found at; http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/8/598199244886890714/ "

												Payday 2 is a fun FPS with a lot of variety in both playstyle and missions, as well as an MMO-like talent system and leveling to boot. It's a good way to pass the time if you have absolutely nothing better to do.HOWEVER. Recently, they added a crate and key system to the game, similar to TF2, DOTA 2, and CS:GO. The only difference, is the weapons you unbox are direct upgrades from anything you can buy with the in-game currency. This adds a very ""Pay-To-Win"" feel to the game which is something they said they weren't going to do, and something that is extremely unfair to people who can't pay real money. The only thing that stops it from being directly ""Pay-To-Win"" is that you can find both the Safes and Drills (Crates and Keys), but the drop chance on them is so small that it's easier to just buy them.My over-all view of the game is this: Don't play this game UNLESS  You have a decent amount of money laying around You are OK with broken AI and strange pathing/animations You want to support devs who lieOtherwise, just stear clear as the majority of the community is pompous d-bags who will kick you from the lobby the second they see you aren't at least Infamy level 1.

												This was a game with huge potential. However, the devs released it long before it was actually ready. Right off the bat I didn't receieve the bonus loot I was supposed to get for pre-ordering. The game itself was actually very enjoyable. For about 3 days. Then you realize that most of the heists are just various versions of other heists, stealth is next to impossible, the higher difficulty levels are on the ridiculous side, and the bugs are overwhelming. For goodness sakes the newest patch made Payday not recognize your keyboard (I myself was included in this glitch). Add that with cops glitching through walls, heists that glitch key parts of it, etc and you've got a game that you shouldn't waste your money on. Especially since it seems since its release the devs would rather dish out DLC for you to pay for rather than fix the problems the game already has.			"

Please read the below link. Very relevant:https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3ow7pm/weve_overloaded_crimenet_we_can_do_the_opposite/-----As a new player, it is very disconcerting that such a HUGE part of the game is locked away via DLCs (and tons and tons of grinding). It is really very much all-in-your-face just how much content you can't access.Well, let's see. How much DLC is there?This game has 36 (THIRTY-SIX!!!) DLC packs.

And now they've added microtransactions on top of that!Skins that add stats? What the heck??My God. That's a little ridiculous. That makes me want to stay away from this game for fear that it's set up only to extort more and more money out of you.The worst part is they have been quoted MULTIPLE times as to how the game will NEVER have microtransactions. The lying makes it even harder to support the game. Please see the link at the top of the post.			"

												If you haven't bought Payday 2 yet, don't bother.  The most recent update has broken stealth mechanics quite a bit, to where every Heist requires you to ""go Loud.""  Even when your aim is go loud from the beginning, the new special units are so incredibly overpowered in all difficulties that it actually makes the game, not more challenging, but less fun.I loved Payday 2 when it was first out.  It had a great blend of stealth and gunplay, and the addition of the Infamy system gave reason to replay everything (even though the game is a giant exp/cash grind in the first place), but the newest updates has just ruined my motivation to even bother playing.OVERKILL seems to be more concerned with finding ways to make the current missions hacker/grind-proof, instead of focusing on providing new (longer than 3 day) Heists.  When you've already done every Heist 50+ times in an effort to hit level 100, of course you're going to grind the higher payday Heists.  Their solution was to give you a penalty to running the same mission more than once in a row, and to add units that will literally one-hit incapacitate you.  It's just not fun.  Hopefully some day they'll listen to the community and roll back the recent changes, but until that day, I'm just not in the mood to lose Heists over and over to absurd changes.Edit: Yep, more updates, still hasn't changed.

												Look how many hours I have in this game and try to come up with why I'm giving this game a bad review.#1: The DLCFirst off, I'd like to note that a lot of the earlier DLC's were very good and added some extremely fun things that made the game have more replayability. Having said that, Overkill decided to add micro transactions for the end of their yearly Crimefest ordeal. That (for me) was the start of their decline. After that they started adding a new DLC around once every 1-2 months. It would've been fine but they decided to start adding useless characters and boring heists (selling them seperately I might add). They would add weapons and perk decks that were always overshadowed by older weapons added in previous DLC's and updates. They would often sell the character pack (which is typically one new character that adds nothing to the game, about two masks, one or two weapons, and maybe a perk deck) and the heist (a complete heist which was alright if you forgot you dropped about seven dollars for something that you'll probably get bored of within a few days) which would be all well and good if the character pack and the heist weren't sold seperately at pretty high prices (about five to six dollars for each pack). #2: The EngineThe engine they used for this game is way too outdated for the stuff they try to do. I've noticed quite a few more crashes more recently compared to just last year. #3: The CommunityOverkill almost never responds to any of the community. Nobody wanted the micro transactions and it took Overkill months to realize that maybe making people pay for dumb aesthetic things that they could easily just mod in might not be the best idea. How Overkill could fix these problems#1: The DLCEither bundle the character packs and the heist packs together for a small decreased price (like maybe the Scarface heist and the Scarface character pack and bundle those for about eight or nine dollars. I know you would get a bit less for each purchase but a lot more people could buy it and maybe doing things like this might grab the attention of older players like myself). You guys could even still sell the character packs and DLC seperately but just make small deals on the forementioned bundles. For the microtransactions, things are a bit more tricky. You wouldn't want to completely remove them as there are probably quite a few people who have paid quite a bit for certain skins and keys and safes and all that. What I think you guys could do about the microtransactions is add more rare ones (did I just say add more paid microtransactions? Yes. Yes I did). What I mean by this is add more of the excedingly rare ones that change the whole model. I know it sounds like a dumb Idea but I do think it would make people a bit more excited to buy a key and open a safe for the chance to get that 1911 with a skull on the end of the barrel that they've always wanted. #2: The EngineJust update this damn thing. It might be a bit hard but I know you guys have some smart people and you can find a way around that. #3: The CommunityIf you take a mod from a modder and just throw it in with barely any changes, credit them. If the entire community is angry at you for doing something, then don't do it again. I get that you guys are a business and you exist for the sole purpose to sell a product and make money but at least add things to that product that people will enjoy. Overall, this game used to be very fun but it has significantly dropped. If you are a big fan of first person shooters with very challenging and hectic gameplay and you don't mind dropping fourty or fifty bucks plus however much the next overpowered DLC is just to make it playable on those higher difficulties, I'd say maybe go for it. Other than that, I would not reccomend this game just yet. Maybe if Overkill starts doing better, I'll change my review but until then, I don't think I'll be playing this game for a while.			"

I didn't particularly love it because it's not really my kind of FPS, but I appreciated how well designed it was even with its shortcomings and how well the developers supported the game with quality content. Things started to derail since 2014 with greater focus on DLC, microtransactions and artificial scarcity of content.

I've bought more than plenty of DLC for this game to expect not to have to wade through microtransactions for an equal shot at success.Microtransactions for stat boosts in a non-free-to-play game = thumbs down.

												This isn't a review of the game (there are plenty of those already), I just feel the need to voice my opinion to a zombified crowd of people who don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥. Okay, here we go.TL:DR: This game is bad because the community is cancer, the disk optomization is garbage, and the overall engine/gameplay is shoddy at bestAfter sinking over 100 US dollerinos into this literal titanic of a game, let me explain why I ♥♥♥♥ing LOATHE this game. Let's forget the whole crimefest circle-jerk, let's forget the EA style of releasing over half the game as DLC, let's forget the shoddy engine and overall gameplay, and let us start before the ♥♥♥♥ show.Before the notorious Crimefest drama, I had an appreciation for this game, having bought it when it first came out. Something about it had that charm, probably because there wasn't many games that touched on the subject of bank robbing, that, and combining the good times my friends provided, this was a decent game.Then the crimefest happened, and as it unfolded, I was angry, however, as months passed, and all my friends ceased playing this game, I decided to pick it up again.Playing alone is not the same as playing with friends, so I decided to join a public match. After being kicked several times for not having an aced deployable because of my dodge build; for taking a character that the host didn't like (Hoxton, because someone was already using Jacket); and being cussed at, kicked before escaping, and overall terrible team communication during deathwish; I decided enough was enough.Maybe it's my fault I didn't see how bad this game was from the start; maybe it's the community's fault for taking the older, more mature players, and replacing them with children; or maybe my opinion doesn't matter. What I do know, however, is that this is a terrible game, and not for the reasons most people present. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I hope my opinion will at least shed some more light on how some people still 'hate' on this game.			"

												don't misunderstand me. i really like this game and its ideas but there are some things that make me really angry and disappointed while playing this game. first of all the times you have to wait when setting up a drill, for example in the ""go bank"" heist. you set up the thermal drill and have to wait more than 3 minutes until the safe gets open and so it just makes the gameplay feel boring from time to time. in the ""go bank"" heist i mostly just crouch next to the thermal drill and wait for the safe to get open while watching videos on youtube or getting me something to eat because the police isn't getting in front of me. next thing are those new safes you can get on paydays. you draw a card, get a safe, but can't open it until you pay over 2€ for a drill that opens the safe...whose dumb idea was that?! it would be okay if you can just buy those safes in an ingame shop but it's really disappointing when you draw a card in a payday, then get a safe that you can't use until you pay real money. there are also some other things that would make the game better when you fix them -> please put your concentration on upgrading the graphics and gamesounds instead of spending time designing new mask skins or weapons, please make the heists feel more realistic and not like a zombie shooter with thousands of enemies, please make the harder missions more playable (less special enemies f.e.) and please make the times shorter that you need to open a door,set up or repair a drill, help up a friend, etc. thank you!

												It's an EXTREMELY fun game, especially if you have friends to play with! just be wary of all of the DLC they add, it's mainly 3-5 bucks for things as small as a mask or 2, maybe a couple mods, etc. Also, some weapon types are flat out UNAVAILABLE without getting a DLC, one of them being Sniper Rifles. Not one sniper rifle comes in the regular game. All DLC. You also get no grenades without DLC. None of those 'throwables' are free, either. So be prepared to spend more than ticket price if you want a wide variety of weapons.I'm not going to go in depth about the microtransaction stuff, plenty others have already made their reviews about it, and I'm too new to really pass judgement on that stuff, although I hate TF2 crate/key like things, and that's what they added to PD2. Dont' know why, since it's alredy a game that you have to buy. Oh, and the 'skins' that come out of them actually give stat boosts, so that's a thing.TL;DR? Amazing game, but if you want more than a 'demo' of the game almost, you're gonna be paying more than the game's price. I'm really neutral about the game, but I'm going to say No to it just for the fact that every update they do is just DLC and Microtransations are a horrible trend that games are taking nowadays... even in games that you pay for, apparently. Thanks for starting that trend, Payday 2. TL;DR the TL;DR? Fun game, but don't expect much more than a demo unless you shell out more than 3x the game's price in DLC.			"

												So Overkill holds an event called ""Crimefest"" annually which is preceeded by the Road To Crimefest challenges. Crimefest is where we get a bunch of free content for having completed RTCF challenges. Only this year they introduced microtransactions as ""free content"". Moderators are censoring everything negative as some form of damage control. After accumulating 2900 hours in game, I will be refusing to play until such time as they are abolished. Because they're simply a money grab to fund other projects, not the continuation of support they promised for this game.			"

Its becoming sad how many micro transactions you need to actually have fun. The only dlc's I would like, are havin outragous weapons like the Overkill but needing a 5 dollar transaction to get a decent assult rifle is just sad I love overkill, I loved Payday 2 but now its just another clash of clans game having more transactions then content.

												First, let me say that this is a superb game. Graphics are good, game mechanics are good. Gameplay is great. I've over 2500 hours over 3 years, so I feel like i've easily got my money's worth.The bad news is, the coding is SHOCKING. This game crashes so much, if I were Overkill, frankly I'd be embarrased to put my name to this. If I could say anything to the devs, it would be STOP writing DLC, STOP adding things, STOP tweaking things - just stop everything and spend the next 3 months making the game stable. No new stuff, no tweaked stuff. Just FIX the incessant crashing. I don't use mods - just 980ti with up to date drivers.			"

Updates they have said will be free come up as paid (This has happened numerous times now) and with their current event, Hype Train you unlock  'free content' for the entire community by buying DLCs (And Hotline Miami 2, because that game is badass). The worst part? Most of the 'free content' you unlock is actually even more DLC you have to pay for.Quote from Hype Train Q&A: Q: Do I have to buy DLC in order to get the Hype Train event rewards?A: No, as we said, the Hype Train rewards are unlocked for free for everyone.Now lets take a look at this 'free' content:Butcher modpack: Already out for 5$Golden GRIN Casino preview: They are literally letting you view a mission so you can buy it later. Very free!As of writing this review I can't be sure about the Bonnie character pack and the Hoxton Revenge Heist.. It is worded in such a way that would make you believe it would be free. But with the reputation of overkill, I would not be surprised (Look what they did with Butcher Mod Pack).Now lets remember, to unlock these 'rewards' the community has to pay for DLC. Which means, this event is literally buy DLC to unlock more DLC that everyone can buy themselves. It is for this reason, that many people I know who play this game simply download a trainer and unlock everything for themselves without paying (I don't personally agree with this and have never done it, but I can really see the appeal).If you think all of this is okay, you probably shouldn't have the money in your wallet anyway - because overkill needs their Payday 2.P.S sorry for that joke on the end but it's ♥♥♥♥ing TRUE.

												An excellent Co-op game - Payday 2 is more than just a PvE FPS where you mindlessly shoot endless waves of enemies.An efficient and successful heist requires team coordination, especially if your goal is to complete the job without raising the alarm.If you don't have any friends with this game, consider joining one of the many Steam groups such as T$E to find players who will show you the ropes.

												Payday 2 is a Co Op game. While it might have benefitted with a cool story arc for a single player mode the game offers a great outing with 3 other friends for an experience that will keep having you come back for more. Payday is simply put the improved, polished and closest experience you’ll find to robbing an actual bank.A superb co-op shooter, with rich character customisation and unpredictable missions.It's not the desire for cash or gold that'll keep you coming back, but the desire to pull off the perfect heist. The many missions and unlockables also offer plenty of food for many hours raid pleasure.In the end, this is by far the most engrossing co-operative arcade experience I have had in a while, probably the best since Left 4 Dead 2 came around.The guns really feel exciting and dangerous - one of the key differences between a good shooter and a great one. I have a feeling this one will stay with us for a while.Payday 2 is a great game and a damn good sequel. The developers took the best things of the first episode and improved them, delivering an intense, compelling first person shooter experience.			"

Pay 112 euro's.Sad to see such a great game turning into a money silk.Some other negative things about this game which were there from the beginning;The host can kick anyone he likes, are you in his game doing a good job? he might kick you so his friend can join in for the xp/card drops/achievements. (There goes the hours you put into that heist)Are you new to the game? The host will kick you without even letting you start the match.When the host disconnects, the host wont be given to another player, nope the full heist will be failed.There is a huge amount of hackers in the game, it wont really effect you cause you can just leave the game or gain extra xp but still.

Gameplay (4/10) The most interesting of the bunch, the only problem is that they nerfed every good gun in the game and buffed every bad gun to insane levels, the only way to get the old guns to perform decently is to pay money on microtransactions to have a chance of maybe getting a skin that might be for a dlc you own or might not and then it could be for your gun and then after all that it could have no stat boosts. Longetivity (7/10) There are alot of heists, I'll give them that, and there's a billion ways to complete each one. The only problem is that all the recent heists feel really like filler content, they're all forgettable (dont get me started on alesso) Story (2/10) Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ this story wants to make me shoot myself. The story starts out making sense, people rob banks and get money, and then you have the recent heists and weapon dlcs making it so you're a team of anime-mask wearing, suit running, bullet dodging, health regenerating, jumping out of planes with stacks of cash. Soundtrack (6/10) Most of the soundtrack is really good, however the person that made them has ditched the company so whats the pointTechnical Score: 4.8/10Actual score: 4/10			"

												    Eh, I will not lie, this game was very enjoyable when it first came out. Community was fun, the game itself great, but as time went on, it kind of died on me for a number of reasons.    Whenever my friends and I played, it was a blast robbing banks, mowing down cops, and raking in the loot, but again, the game jaded quickly for me. I soon realized this game has less diversity that its prequel. You run in, place drill, wait for drill, grab bags or the MacGuffin, and fire bucket everything to the truck. Basically all levels can be summed up as that. Sure, theres a couple variations, but they were ruined with patches (atleast for me). For instance, Framing Frames was a fun stealth mission, until they ruined stealth (again, in my opinion). If you like the new changes, good for you, but I can't stand more guards coming in for basically no reason.    Then, came the DLC. Yes, you pay for the game. Now, you need to chip in a few more bucks for grenades. Now another couple for snipers! I hoped with the price tag of $30, I'd get ATLEAST the grenades, but sadly not. People tell me that these are ""optional"" and don't really impact gameplay, but its still the principle of the thing that counts. Its not really fun sitting in the bank vault while all your teammates chunk grenades into the hall. Then theres the community. If you are not a high level, or ""prestiged"" several times, expect to be kicked or raged at a ton. If you have no idea what they mean by ""rushing"" expect to be kicked. If you accidently set off the guard, or if the host's friend sets off the guard and blames you, again expect to be kicked. Don't trust randos to play this game.   Speaking of which, the AI. Imagine the similar L4D AI. Now imagine that you need stuff done besides infinite shooting, like lugging a ton of bags that only you can do. Expect to only do missions that doesn't require bags with AI.   Finally, I keep this game updated, just in case any of my friends want to do some rounds, but it gets ridiculous at points. It seems like the game needs to refresh itself with every patch, having updates in the gigabytes. 5 GB updates may seem awesome, but its only adding like two more levels, some guns, and alot more DLC. I have a 2 TB harddrive, and could care less bout the space, but the time needed gets annoying.TLDR: Play with friends, expect half the game to be locked, don't use AI.			"

Each safe can only be opened with a specially-designed drill, which can be acquired from the Steam Market. Buy a drill, and then use it or trade it - the choice is yours.

												Since I came to the realization that my previous review of this game was more of a generic complaint explicitly directed towards DLC, I've decided to redo it. Be warned, while I wrote this thing in under an hour, it is a LONG read. I actually had to put the full thing in a pastebin, linked at the bottom, due to the issue of reaching the maximum character limit.That being said, welcome to hell. No refunds.Where to start?... Payday 2, it was a great game. However, it suffered a slow, but sure downhill ride ever since around the beginning of 2014, a couple months after I first played the game. I had fun with it. I even would've called myself a 'Payday 2 fanboy' at a certain point when I was still under its spell. But any rational person who has played the game long and often enough will tell you that the fun and quality in this game has been burnt out for him/her. Here's why:DLCNot starting with that this time since people will likely assume that I'm just whining due to being poorHost/lobby problemsI could get over the heinous and obnoxious players in public games, and overall awful in-game community. The majority are morons while a small minority are 'professionals' who believe they know best (and, coincidentally enough, in the case of this game, they usually do. However, this is only because the game is largely and insidiously easy. I'll elaborate on that further in a bit). This is a problem that just about every game, especially those which are free to play, has to terrifying extents, but it's still easy to get used to it.What I don't like, and am perfectly justified in not liking? Lack of host migration. Inexcusable connectivity issues. Unfair loss of progress as a result thereof.Even the oldest and most infamous of online multiplayer of games have host migration. Warcraft III has it. EVEN CALL OF DUTY OF ALL THINGS HAS IT. Every online multiplayer game of this day and age which doesn't use dedicated/listen servers interchangably or explicitly and is at least somewhat heard of has host migration, and there is absolutely no reason why Overkill/Starbreeze (I don't know who would be responsible for an addition like this, and I do not care) can't take a slight bit out of the tens of millions of dollars they're raking in every year to quell a big portion of complaints players have. Wouldn't you be upset if, for a hypothetical instance, you were one of the four record-setters for the Deathwish X-mas heist challenge (if you don't know what I'm referring to, get out. You're too new/unexposed to the game to even understand this review), and after so much trial-and-error, so much work of tossing tens of bags all around the map to kite cops and get them all to the pick-up area, only for the host to suddenly have a power outage JUST as the last heister is about to step into the escape zone? Or maybe in a public lobby, the host just decides he's ""bored"" when a heist you've been working on with him is about to be completed successfully, and that same host just decides, 'well, meh, nuts to them!'As for connectivity issues, and why they are completely unforgivable, have you ever noticed other players' latency? Oh, you haven't? Well, that's the right answer! Because Payday 2 has no way, shape, or form of displaying others' strength of connectivity. The only way to get an actual 'ping' is to mod, or, dog for bid, hack your game. In my experience using pocohud for the short time that I did before quitting, I never found anyone who had under a 150ms ping. And when I say short time, it was really more of 100-200 hours (take note of my playtime) of constant hosting/joining other players games (WITH MY PLAYERS FILTER SET ON ""NEAR,"" BEFORE YOU QUESTION IT). In actual gameplay, actual 'lag' doesn't seem to affect much at a glance. However, it is very, very easy to take note of irritating issues such as cops shooting you through walls before they actually come within line-of-sight on your screen, extended delay between throwing/picking up bags and other interactive items, etc. This kills the game for me, as it defeats the purpose of taking cover or playing defensively at all since you can always just be sniped and meatshotted by an enemy's gun that may as well be several seconds into the future for anyone who isn't the host.Poor updatesI'm not disputing that this game does get quite a bit added to it on a fairly regular basis; although, I am not content with the 'new' content. The fugitive skill tree is a laughable excuse of a lazy combination between the mastermind and ghost trees that also encourages running around and generally being a nuisance. I never liked the last-minute throw-in of a 'perk deck' system which is just another thing to grind for in order to take advantage of on the side. Every 'new' heist is either 'steal that,' or 'destroy/kill that object/person,' making it feel as if the game lacks any intuitive feeling even more than it already does. Every patch is a force-fed shovelling of bloated/expensive content, which makes the game more unstable, that also has minimal to nonexistent bugfixes alongside it.There is a reason why there are practically memes now which compare Overkill to EA. The game doesn't get supported or improved, it just gets more content. While that might seem nice, think about what you're missing out on. Would you rather have one slice out of a pure wheel of cheese, or the whole wheel of cheese after it's sat out in the sun for weeks and become spoiled and moldy? More is not better when what you're adding to is already a structure that is barely up to code and can only have so much at once in the first place. One must find a balance between quality and quantity, or just go all out on quality and make it so impressive that players will be left WANTING more. The best updates to Payday 2, however, involve one single 'new' heist, while the worst, and most common updates are nothing more than a few reskins of current weapons/weapon mods with superior stats which have to be paid for, which technically makes the game unquestionably pay-to-win to a degree. Yes, it really does. If you don't believe that, you seriously need to do some comparing between free, community, and paid-for weapons/weapon mods. Or, perhaps, you can try one of the newer shotguns with explosive rounds so you can stunlock the toughest enemy in the game at will, and throw all other enemies up in the air (INCLUDING CLOAKERS AND SHIELDS, which are SUPPOSED to require tactical teamwork and clever initiative to defeat) all just by giving Overkill another one of your $5 bills. Tell me THAT isn't a freemium model, I dare you, I WANT to see you make a fool of yourself by insinuating otherwise. Furthermore, please don't give me any ""you don't need it to play"" or ""don't like it, don't buy it"" comments, or anything of a similarly snide and unhelpful nature, because I've already heard this excuse many times. You really do need the DLC if you want to fully experience the game or not be completely alienated from the playerbase. Additionally, I already paid the full $30 for this game, and seeing the cash cow still being milked in the same way after all this time is a metaphorical kick to the balls and a loogie to the face. It's absolutely insulting and revolting to be blatantly treated like a walking wallet to be empited on a game developer's whim. Overkill does NOT -need- all the money that they're making, they're just being greedy and overextending themselves. Even if I didn't -need- the DLC, it still doesn't make what's being done with it right.(The rest of the review has been cut off due to the Steam character limit. You can read the full, unrevised, and original review in its entirety here[pastebin.com].)EDIT: lol microtransaction bandwagon			"

												This is my first review that I have ever written. I haven't played Payday 2 for very long, but I probably put about the same amount of hours back in the beta. I haven't bought all the dlc, but quite a bit. I was excited for this game to succeed, but following the addition of microtransactions (in the form of drills to open safes that randomly drop) for skins that could increase stats on a gun (that you may or may not have) is just ridiculous considering on multiple occasions Overkill has stated there would never be microtransactions added to this game. They flat out lied to their community's face, and frankly, don't even care. At one point, I would have recommended this game, but now? Absolutely NOT! This is a disgusting thing that this company has done, and they should be disgraced at their actions and behavior towards the community. Stay away from this game and do NOT support Overkill.			"

												The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!) and we've made it more clear that the PAYDAY loot bag is part of the Career Criminal Edition as well.  - Almir Listohttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521Shame on me? Shame on you, liar.My favorite game ruined, I've been playing the PayDay heist since it came out, do not fool yourself with my time stats, I had put over 1200 hours in Payday The Heist, I even got on Steam because I used to torrent the game, so I decided to buy it, and that's how I got in Steam. Soon, I got PayDay 2, god I was so happy, hours and hours of non stop playing, and by hours and hours I mean 10 or 12 hours playing,  then many many updates came as well as DLC's, okay, I got em... I started to get kind of ""ripped off"" then ""Completely Overkill DLC"" was already here to purchase $20 ""for a secret item"" that took almost a year to ""arrive"" and yet we don't even know what is it. Okay fine, it's a good game devs needs our money to keep developing the game and as a developer once said ""As long as you wanna keep heisting we will never stop making Payday 2"". Okay, great thanks.But this? What is this? Back in 2013 I read that you guys WERE NOT GOING TO ADD MICROTRANSACTIONS. You guys exactly said ""NO!, GOD NO!"". (Google this article for further information). And WHAT IS THIS ♥♥♥♥? WHAT IS IT?Microtransactions?!  Why did you have to kill the game like this?. No wonder why Simon left, maybe he knew about it and did not want to be a part of this, other than being a freelanced artist.There it goes, my favorite game to the ♥♥♥♥ing trash.			"

Heisters gonna heist... again!The Story:Well, this game doesn't follow an actual story.There is a network of criminals called the Crime.Net where lots of insane contracts given by even more insane contract-brokers meant to be accomplished by you and your teammates.A whole bunch of characters are known from movies and stuff like that.And of course we have our old heisters from PayDay: The Heist back in game.The combination of ""Non-Storyline"" and ""story based background"" combined in a fictive underground network still gives this game it's own charme and characterI think 8 / 10 fits perfect to this one.Graphics:The main stuff like the characters, the guns, the enemies and so on are almost perfectly designed.But from heist to heist you very often get the feeling of running through a copy and paste paradise.It doesn't destroy the game but it's some kind of a weakness in it.But it still is a good 6 / 10.Gameplay:The gameplay as a host is always smooth as hell. Sometimes you get a few collision bugs that crash the whole feeling but it's not a very big point in here.If you join a lobby you've got to pray for a host with a good bandwidth or otherwise the De-Synch will kill the smoothness and the game sucks on your side.The default key bindings are not my personal favourite so this is a minor negative aspect too.A total of 6 / 10 is good enough for that one.My Pros and Cons:Pro:Wide spectrum of customizationsMany different heistsMany different difficultiesWell written background storiesActive communityKontra:P2P-Connection systemDLCs are giving advantages (somehow pay2win)Additional Infos:Game-specific: Duration As long as it's fun to you Achievements 539

												Unfortunately, this game is severely hampered without purchasing DLC. DLC works like ""Booster Packs"" for CCG/TCGs to enable additional options and missions. Several achievements, the best missions, and best equipment are all behind the DLC paywall. After purchasing all the DLC, a few other games by the same studio, and joining the Steam Community Group (total $160+ regular price), the game opens up and becomes fully playable.As of the 2015 annual community event and sale, ""gachapon"" lottery style microtransactions have been added to the game at $2.50 per random draw despite lead developers stating PayDay 2 will NEVER have microtransactions (1, 2) and advertising the 2015 event rewards will be free of charge for all users (3). Lottery rewards include equipment ""skins"" with mechanical bonuses to further reward those who pay in.Despite overwhelming negative response from the community, studio and publisher representatives are refusing to directly comment as to the future of the lottery style microtransactions until AFTER the community event and sale are over, effectively threatening users who have not already gone ""all-in"" on DLC with higher prices (4). Some of the founding members of Overkill Software have left the company along with key developers and voice actors, threatening future development of the game.This is a co-op first-person shooter with stealth and RPG elements. The core gameplay is above average with an active modding community that continues to improve the UI experience. It is a solid go-to on par or better than games like Left-4-Dead, Team Fortress, and Counter-Strike; however, the DLC paywall and microtransactions on a full price game make this difficult to recommend.

												EDIT: Fixed links.EDIT 2: They changed the way we can acquire drills for microtransactions by including them in the drop system, but my position is firm. No stat boost from cosmetics. Ever.I’ve played Payday 2 since Beta and bought the Criminal Career Edition. I knew I was paying more in order to support Overkill. I wanted to show my appreciation for continuing the franchise. This game was profitable before it even released, and that’s the kind of success I hoped would mean we would have a long development. There have been multiple instances with Payday 2 where I believe that I got my money’s worth a long time ago. Having said that, many things went wrong.The GoodThe gunplay is satisfying. Vanilla didn’t have enough variety to make unique builds, but two years later you can choose between shotguns, snipers, pistols, LMGs, mini-gun and other fun weapons that give you the option to create your own setup. There has been a recent change in weapon stats, so the current state of the “best” version of each weapon is up in the air, but at least the dominant weapons are out of place.There are five skill trees to choose from and any combination can produce a tank, DPS, or support role. Specialization is generally discouraged as hybrid builds tend to achieve more skills that cover the weakness of a particular build, but specialty builds are relevant. Maybe you’d like to wear heavy jackets with high health/armor regeneration, or maybe a glass cannon that sprays death with revolvers or akimbo; perhaps you just want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up and bringing C4/RPG/Grenades is your thing. Regardless, there is no Jack of All Builds and you’ll find yourself experimenting to discover build archetypes. It’s fun coming up with your idea for build, then refining it to suit your needs.Heists are too short if compared to the first game, but I feel they are varied enough in their objectives. Each has their own atmosphere to play in and the music is built to fit each level. Some tracks are better than others, but that’s up to the user. If you’re not cutting a giant hole in the middle of a casino, you’re breaching an impenetrable vault with the big ♥♥♥ drill. You should probably seek to befriend heisters that do well with you. Grouping up is going to save you the hassle of pubbing and the lack of control you have over people’s performance.The BadRepeated lying on features. Repeatedly failing to deliver on other platforms. Breaking promises.It’s probably not fair to judge the game from its release state, but it should be noted that the Beta was a mess for consoles. Technically people could play the game early, and it was fun exploring ways to break the game in order to balance changes before release, but this situation was favorable only to PC as they were the only ones who could play and receive bug fixes quickly. Console players that bought the game for release got disks, which were burned with the Beta because there was no way for Overkill to release a Beta on PC in order to fix things, then burn the disks on time for consoles for release. Console players paid for Beta as a retail release; they had to wait for a patch. Overkill’s treatment of consoles, at least for the XBOX 360/PS3, has been atrocious. It’s true that the first patches started rolling out 3 months after the fact, and fixed many things from PC testing. This trend never changed and patches were few and far in-between. When pressed for information, Overkill excused themselves as being “too small” and patching console to be “costly”. I still give them benefit of the doubt about the cost part, but can you imagine paying for the same product and being told to wait while everyone got their ♥♥♥♥ first? The part that gained ire is that they started to produce DLC while dishing console patches. It’s fair to assume that at any given point, Overkill can develop both DLCs and patches, but how come resources are poured to release paid, but fail to deliver on fixing problems within the game. Console were being continually lead on that they’ll get something “soon”. They promised to treat console better and on February 26th 2015 they announce that development for the XBOX360/PS3 was terminated. We hate this too, because there’s nothing we can do about it., which meant some customers were not valuable enough for them to continue working with them. But hey, at least you get a 25% to pre-order the game for the XBOX1/PS4.The worst thing that drags down my faith in the company is the inclusion of microtransactions after explicitly promising not to do so. I mean the microstransaction system using crates/keys from TF2/CS:GO. DLC content bothered me, but I accepted them as necessary for the ongoing development, so I’d buy them to support future content. But this was betrayal and a revelation that the company sees its customers as money bags.  This would have never been a problem if the microtransaction skins you can unlock with real money didn’t affect in-game stats. That’s the biggest issue I have with this system and the reason for this review. No shame in copying a system[i.imgur.com] and failing to adapt it to the needs of their user base. This game was not meant for microtransactions because its infrastructure doesn’t work around it. Sure, the skins are cosmetic and that by itself would’ve been alright, but charging money for stat affecting skins; never mind that you randomly receive them, so you have no control.  Wonder why the older console generation stopped being updated? I wager my own impression that they couldn’t patch it fast enough to release the DLC on them as they could on PC, so they dropped them like a wet noodle. They couldn’t profit enough from them, despite having the long term goal to developer on them in the first place, but it was more feasible to abandon them.Despite my review being negative I still recommend this game to anyone that wants to play; it's fun no doubt. If you’re musing on buying or waiting for a sale, I’d say the game’s worth any price for sure, but the value it's worth is up to you. Even the DLC that was release pre-Crimefest 2015 is ok to buy because that’s your decision, but just don’t buy into the microtransactions. Don’t feed them money that you’re ok with this. It’s the developers that suck the life out of their own game. I can’t support a developer who lies to its customers.			"

Eventually you will want the DLC, but wait for a sale and it will be a great buy and will add more things to the game to play around with. Other than the DLC, the game is great. Graphics are great, animations look awesome, and the way missions are set up makes it simple and easy to get into a game and make some bank. Recommeneded!Personal Rating: 8.5/10			"

Even the billions DLCs, which I hated by the way.But I couldn't forgive the microtransactions.If you like the game then that's fine for you, but it died for me and it isn't worth investing real money to be able to play a so-called heist arcade-simulator.

												After multiple statements on different media that PAYDAY 2 will NEVER have microtransactions, Overkill introduces microtransactions.Now we've seen some shady business practises before, but this is just over the top.The rewards from Crimefest were ment to be free for all players, and players were getting extremely hyped during the Road to Crimefest event.1st day reward: ""You now have the option to pay us even more money so that you can gamble on getting a good skin with stat bonuses""Jesus Christ, even EA isnt this badTo anyone currently thinking of byuing PAYDAY 2 or any of it's DLC's, just don't.We can't keep being treated like this by modern developers and publishers, it's like taking it in the ♥♥♥ and then sucking them off			"

												PayDay2, a game made by a company who gloated, yes, gloated about being friendly, non-greedy, and caring for their fans.Oh. How they lied. They lied through their teeth, they are built up on lies. Overkill sofwtare is basically a minature version of Ubisoft.While, the game was some.. some positives, like music, gameplay, map design, that's all it currently has going. Yep. That's all the pros.Now.. for the cons:- Massive.. utterly, MASSIVE paywalls EVERYWHERE. 80% of all the content you see and want, is GOING to be DLC, grenades? DLC, barrett 50. cal? DLC. Minigun!? DLC. Golden skin? DLC, so much DLC. ""But!"" You suddenly exlaim.. ""What about the content you start with? Surely there's a lot?""Yeah.. no. You have about 10 missions, all which will tire out in a week. All the updates/new maps are DLC, and are horribly overpriced and underwhelming with content, so you need to break your bank with paying for multiple DLCs to have some more noticible content.- Uncaring, putrid company/devs. They have lied 2 times to us.1. New enemy announced! Well be out soon! aaand it took them.. 3 years to impliment, nice. Oh, and it was with the microtransactions update, nice!Speaking of Microtransactions.. that's #2! They promised NO Microtransactions, well, looked what happened on PayDay's birthday. Nice!And as for them being uncaring, they refused to have any anti cheat system at all, even though CONTLESS users complained about hackers ruining everything for them. Yeaaars later, guess what? They ad an anti cheat.. to their DLC/Microtransactions. Yep. THey simply made it so hackers cant steal the DLC, but it's fine if they still ruin game sessions, they don't care about their gameplay for customers. At. All. They basically declaired they don't give a hoot about anyone recently,- Ugly headache inducing visuals for years and they still won't ad more options for visuals, mainly the dreaded, disgusting, hated Chromatic Aberration. Yup, no way to turn it off.- Terrible sounds, guns sound like metal doors slamming and pop rocks.- Biggest of all, the new Microtransactions! This is utterly stupid, you just about, Idunno, 6$ for a skin on your gun.. with stat boosts. Nice, Overkill! Pulling more Ubisoft! And here's the worse of it: Those skins can be for.. DLC WEAPONS. SO YOU HAVE TO BUY THE DLC.. FOR THE MICROTRANSACTIONS.Skip this game, it will break your bank if you want any gameplay out of it, it's not worth it for yo, or friends, there's MUCH better games out there with MUCH more free content, infact, CoD:Zombies costs less, and they never lowered their prices for 6 years.

												This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥, horrible graphics and extremley boring unless you drop $60 in DLC which only gives you a few guns which are necesary to play on higher difficulties and grants access to more masks. The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥, they make it sound like you plan out the heist and carry it out the way you want. It is everything but. It feels like my hand is being held through the whole ""heist"". The AI is ♥♥♥♥ they all have the eye of the tiger mind set and dont care if you have hostages or not and they are also tanks on higher difficulties, like it takes a whole mag of 5.56 to kill one basic SWAT guy. Unless you get all 4 guys to carry around high powered rifles in close quarter situations then you will loose. I stoped playing when I finally realised that this game is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ police horde game then an actual heist game. Recently they released micro transactions which make the heists much easier even though they announced that they will never release any microtransactions for this game. ♥♥♥♥ these developers they do not care about game play but only to make a dollar onh hyping up an idea and ♥♥♥♥ing all in the ♥♥♥.

												I am going to be straight with you here, this is a game which:Cost money to buy as of writing this, has almost a hundred bucks worth of DLC.It is a game that since recently has microtransactions despite the developers bluntly stating it would never be added,microtransactions that compared to it's own DLC is crazy overpriced, 4.99 for a weapon pack compared to 2.49 to a single random weapon skin,HUD elements that give certain focus to the microtransactions and their related elements.On top of this the microtransactions were added in a ""weapon rebalance"" update which clearly lacked proper playtesting, with things like the minigun being able to give you a speed boost since they didn't pay enough attention to the ""game"" part of the update to consider removing the the speed boost on the light minigun mod when they removed the speed penalty that it compensated for.This game currently is priced at 19,99€ without discounts, with DLC priced at 109,92€ and keys/drills, giving a single random skin to a weapon which might be for a weapon DLC you don't have, at 2.20€.With more than 600 hours on this game and a good 10 with the new ""weapon rebalance"" I am secure in my statement, that is way too much to ask for when you cannot deliver promised content, a balanced game and functional net-code.;c I don't think I'll be keeping those helmets flying for much longer.A certain update have implemented a way to fairly easily aquire stat-equivalents of skins with stat boosts, making skins more properly aesthetic only, to me this is enough to keep playing but unless you are already invested I'm having a hard time recommending it. Recent cross-promotions characters have also been suitably priced at zero.			"

												Payday 2...a game I got into when it had already matured. The game had been out for many years and had too many dlcs to count, dlcs that added missions, guns and masks into the game. Even though this somewhat greedy dlc structure was daunting to say the least, it didn't deter me from enjoying the core, fun concept of the game: running bags back and forth for days on end. However, Overkill did  something that left a bad taste in my mouth and forever soured my opinion of the game. Microtransactions. Microtransactions wouldn't normally be this large of an issue (CS:GO, Dota, and TF2 all go about microtransactions in an applaudable way), but Overkill went about it in the most backwards way possible. First off, they explicitly went against they're word, since they originally claimed that microtransactions would ""never"" be in payday 2. Secondly, they made the microtransaction skins STAT-CHANGING, not cosmetic, a capital sin in multiplayer games that ineveitably leads to an enormous power creep. Third and finally, they reduced the power of the vanilla guns, which is basically a giant middle finger to consumers who dont want to dish out money for skins on top of all of the dlc available. Because of these reasons, I cannot recommend purchasing this game in its current state and supporting the continuation of such greedy devs.			"

												The players of Payday 2 should be allowed to refund this game regardless of Valve's 2 hour period. Overkill please be responsable enough to allow this becasue you went back on your words, the words that you used to market Payday 2 from the beginning! This micro-transaction descision has split the community (most not in favor of this change). Giving 2 free sets of drills and safes is not addressing the issue as you promissed after crimefest, it is a poor excuse of a band-aid...Give players past two hours of play-time the ability to refund the game as well as the $40 of DLC they bought as well.

Basic InformationTitle : PayDay 2Developer : Overkill SoftwarePublisher : 505 GamesGenre : Heist/CrimeGeneral ImpresionPayday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter developed by Overkill team. This game is sequel to Payday : The Heist. Two years after the events of the previous game, the gang comes to the Washington, D.C. area to rob banks. The player take controls of one of four principal members ( Dallas, Houston, Wolf, Chains ) to heist alone or multiplayer, but also of some secondary characters like Clover, Dragan, Rust, Jacket, Sydney and others. The player has a  part of a series of DLCs which includes many more weapons, masks, upgrades than original game. In my opinion, this game is the best co-op game that I ever played in my whole life.Strong points+ Co-op+ Stealth+ Weapons Costumization+ Masks Costumization+ A lot of achievements+ Great animations+ Difficulty+ Great maps+ Steam Trading CardsWeak points- Too many DLCs- Weak AntiCheatRating8/10 "

												Promised to never involve microtransactions, introduces them as free content! Well done.This game has been a love-hate relationship for me ever since. I like the stealth, but hate the shootings.It's fun, but not for long, caused by all those ridiculous mechanics the game has.You raised the alarm? 15 seconds later a 25 man swat team is on the scene? No problem. You killed like 150 cops? No problem, throw more at them.Sneak past a guard 1 meter behind his back, no problem. Hide a hostage 200m away behind a barrier, ""omg there is a hostage! Alarm!""It's really just a bunch of ridiculous mechanics and a lot of weapons and stuff (DLC dependant) thrown together.That doesn't meant this can't be fun, in fact in can be a lot of fun. But be sure to bring at least two friends, resistance to frustration and a lot of money for extra DLC if you want the full experience.The heists get repetitive after a short while and the randomness that decides about failure or success is really frustrating.tl;dr: Pro: Challenging stealth mode        Lots of weapons, weapon mods, masks and stuff.        Some really nice heistsCons: Stupid mechanics           Lots of randomness deciding the outcome           Greedy DLC-based sales policy           Microtransactions (Loot drops that contain weapon skins that can only be opened with real money)           Repetitiveness and grinding for money and xp           Bad performance (at least for me) "

												I liked this game. A lot. I didn't mind the huge amount of DLC that they released. You know why? Because it was a way of supporting them and their free updates and heists. DLC weapons and weapon mods don't break the game. You can play DLC heists without owning them, you just can't host them. The events (Crimefest, Hype Train, Spring Break) were all about supporting the community, giving back to it with free content in bulk.But in this last event they just flipped us off. People grinded objectives with that free content promise, and what did we get? Microtransactions. Those very same microtransactions that they promised twice wouldn't ever exist. And how do they plan to sell them? They're just weapon skins after all! Well, easy enough, they've nerfed all weapons and made the skins so that they increase the weapons' stats. You want your weapons to be as good as they were before? Pay up.EDIT: It would seem that now they went slightly backwards and drills drop as well. While I'm still not comfortable with this, if you can get some money out of it on the market and already own the game... it's not like there's much left to lose anymore.EDIT2: After Update 100, the microtransactions scheme seems to be off the table. Now all dropped safes are free to open. You can play once more with a clear conscience.However, I still stand by my recommendation: Don't buy the game. Do as I say, not as I do.			"

												RIP PAYDAY 2. Devs went too far with microtransactions. Congrats on burying this game even deeper. They didn't just put the nail in the coffin, they buried the coffin in nails.It really started going downhill with the Chivalry update which should have been free. Torn Banner implemented PAYDAY stuff in Chivalry for free if you owned PAYDAY 2, but greedy Overkill decided they should charge money for Chivalry items in PAYDAY 2. I tried so hard to like this game, but they just crossed a line. I'm sorry, but Rest In Pieces PAYDAY 2. There is nothing Overkill can do that will win their community back. They have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a huge community, big mistake, especially when you are making a new game. Overkill just lost a lot of potential customers who won't buy their game out of spite.			"

												I used to love this game. Ive spent a lot of money and time on this game and purchased all the DLC. Then overkill decided to try and steal even more of our money and THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHT. we bought the DLCs to get better weapons. Then they are gonna come in and reduce the stats on ALL weapons just so we have to spend more of our money on a drill to increase the stats of WEAPONS WE ALREADY PAID FOR!! how unfair is that?? how money hungry can overkill be?? think of all your fans and what we have given you. WHEN IS IT YOUR TURN TO GIVE US SOMETHING?! im fed up with this game now and the constant money stealing from overkill. dont waste your money because overkill will just keep finding new ways to take it. BOYCOTT THIS GAME!!			"

												Levels are now much smaller - about a building's worth in size. The engine is far buggier than the first iteration. Weapons combat is improved only in terms of visuals and is otherwise a glitchy unrepeatable mess in use. Most levels are just rehashes of each other. Netcode is worse. AI is worse than the netcode.Pre-release goals have seemingly been abandoned or now have an entrance fee in the form of paid-for DLC. The base game is just that. You'll need to pad out with over $30 in DLC if you want to get a meaty game. The whole thing? Forget about it. Most of the DLC isn't worth it and what is should have been included with the base.As if that wasn't enough, now you'll have micropayments. ""Safes"" drop and you'll need to buy ""drills"" to unlock them. Newly formed skins for weapons have stat boosting capabilities only available to those who will pay USD for them. The kicker was this released during Crime Fest (an otherwise FREE CONTENT week sponsered by the developers). I determined before release that this PAYDAY 2 release would be one of cash grabs. I jokingly said it would have more DLC than Killing Floor. Shame to say I was pretty accurate.As a huge fan of the first, the second is just udnerwhelming, disappointing, and a spit in the face to those who supported the game for so long. Everything was reversed to the point to where the first game could be seen as the sequel.Rest in ♥♥♥♥, PAYDAY 2.			"

												Payday 2 is a great game. Its unique and me and many others have spent hours into it.However, theres a few things you need to take in mind:1) Its a lot more fun with friends, teamwork and cooperation is very important and random people arent always the most teamwork orientated.2) The base game is very bland. Without buying any DLC, you will not have acces to the following:Shotgun ammo types, explosive rounds (or HE for short) being the most prominent and game changing one: they can stun every special enemy in the game, making them a lot easier to deal withSniper rifles: high damage, long range, and penetration, allowing you to shoot through shields and armorMost of the Light Machine guns: theres a free community LMG that was added, so you can use one but if you want the others, you gotta payGrenades, grenade launchers: explosives to kill groups and stun/kill all the special enemiesFlamethrower, molotovs: both provide huge area denial and crowd control, all behind a DLCDecent melee weapons: DLC melee weapons have the highest damage, the best DPS and there are 2 DLC melee weapons that have the ability to stun enemies. Standard melee weapons are kinda crap, DLC melee weapons allow you to go melee only if you build your character for itThe best gun mods: your guns can be modified with attachments, all the best attachments are locked behind DLCSome of the best perk decks in the game (sort of like a class mod thing) are DLCA large amount of heists are DLC: you can play any heist by joining it, but you can only host the heist if you own the DLC. This means that unless you have a friend that has the DLC, you have no reliable way of playing a DLC heist (other than hoping someone else is playing said heist, has a spot for you and its the right difficulty and everything for you)In short: you'll never see the end of DLC and every DLC is stronger and more gamebreaking than the last.3) They've added skins with stat boosts a la CSGO. Most players dont like them, if you have the money for them, go nuts. You can however get a skin for a DLC gun you dont own, so theres that.4) The game is heavily RNG dependent. To earn mods for your guns, or different masks or colors/patterns to customize them, you'll have to get them from card drops. At the end of every heist you will get one. There is no real way for you to get a long barrel for your AK rifle other than to be lucky. There are daily challenges you can complete that allow you to say you want a mod for your AK, but in the end its still RNG between all the possible AK mods.Its a great game, but if you dont have friends to play with and/or dont want to keep spending money on DLC's to be on par with the overpowered DLC user that just oneshotted the boss enemy with his RPG, I wouldn't buy Payday 2.

												As I looked back at the old payday 2 animations, dlc's, reminiscent of the good old days back. I remembered when I used to be played in the demo, it was still very much in place in the game, but lately the overkill team only interested in the money... DLC, DLC, DLC. It really hurts to see what you are doing with the game. A game in itself is good, but I can't take it anymore. Goodbye good times, and we expect you back.

												After spending almost 2K hours on this game, I can say that I have been with this game alot.  First of all, this game is AMAZING in the beginning. The feeling of the thrill of doing a new heist whether it be parachuting from an airplane or simply tying up a hostage is just overwhelming in the beginning. The gunfights are intense and there is a variety of enemies. This all help contribute to the pros of the game. I would give my left nut sack to be able to experience the thrill of doing a single bank heist now. But like all good stories, there comes what I would like to call POINT BREAK.After POINT BREAK the game seems to be a drag. It loses the element of shock and awe. Sure, all maps are ""randomized"" but seriously, they are just small things like security cameras and what not. It's not the same feeling as before. Plus, when your playing co-op online with random teammates, this is the point where you realize that the goal of the game is NOT securing the bags into the escape van but rather running around and trying to get the most kills as possible. After this point, your just constantly farming for exp and trying to get to a new prestige (it's called infamy in the game). So overall, yea I would say this game is great to play with friends online for a couple of rounds. But it is not a game where you can spend hundred of hours on it. I already regret the time that I have put into this mother♥♥♥♥ing game.  "

												Heads up!  Do not trust the positive reviews on this game!The positive reviews were written before the most recent patch.  I've put a ton of hours into this game and loved the hell out of it, but it isn't the same game it was on release.  The weapons have been rebalanced and the optional DLC has been replaced with awful pay2win crates and skins.  This game will milk you for all you're worth, and the developers will keep adding more DLC instead of patching the numerous bugs in existing content.Avoid at all costs, for the sake of your wallet.

												Once upon a time, Payday 2 was an enjoyable if not particularly deep shooter.  The game asked for a purchase price up-front and then contained a series of DLC that you could purchase to add to the game.Soon, the sheer volume of DLC started to cause even the most stalwart of fans to question the wisdom of it all, but many kept buying and playing the game.  A perverse contract had formed wherein many players were willing to put down money on a regular basis for bits of extra content and to fund the continued development of the game.  Amounts of money that are, frankly, a bit absurd.That wasn't enough for Overkill and Starbreeze.  To them I say, no more.			"

												So I played this game since August 2013 and had much fun with it. Pro point for that game .... but what sucks is, that over 1 year the makers of this game are releasing DLCs for this game like every month ones and that for 4.99€ or even more so you have to spend like over 150 euros now already to fully play all the heists and have all the weapons, masks, achievements and all the ♥♥♥♥ you probably care about. At all in 2015 was the worst year. Now they even added a micro-transaction ♥♥♥♥ system that you can even waste more money than before. First this game was all about robbing banks in a virtual game that was pretty fun .... but when it went so they (the makers of the game) actually started to rob your bank account so you can play this damn game. It´s pretty much like World of Warcraft .... you have to pay for playing it like every damn month and you are getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about that situation from day to day. This game mutated in a money crapping machinery for Overkill Studios and won´t stop doing it until as you guys won´t wake up and stop paying this capitalistic game that actually robs your bank and not that you rob a bank ingame. A friend also send me this hilarious video about Almir´s philosophy that actually mind♥♥♥♥ed me even more check it out if you have like half a minute spare time cheers. Thank you for reading my rage-review and maybe see you ingame have a great day.

												Ah, it seems it's time to give my two cents and write my second ever Steam review.I started playing this game a year and a half ago, during a rather mundane and part of my life an I was looking for something to displace my boredom. I had already previously played the first game of the series, PAYDAY: The Heist, and I thought that perhaps its sequel will entertain me just as well.My first few hours were spent learning new mechanics, skills, stealth, and few other things. I quickly grew aggitated as I continued to have issues with the simplest heist even on the lowest difficulty. Time, and time again I failed, but I persevered and tried my best to accomplish a heist, until one day I finally did. Yes, I managed to finish Bank Heist: Cash...but on normal.Time has passed, many hours were played, and now here I stand, completely unrecognizable from the day I first started. Starting as a newbie who had issues completing even the simplest of heists, to a proud vet who can solo any heist on Death Wish.During my time playing this game, I learned new things, gained new friends, and even became a ""somewhat"" recognizable frequenter on the community forums.However, not all good things come with a happy ending. Payday 2's developer, Overkill Software, decided that it would be best to implement a copy of a well known weapon system from Counter Strike: Global Offensive. It appears that they added in this system after noticing that they lacked the funds they deemed necessary to fund various other projects. With Payday 2 being the only source of income, they thought it best to add in said system in order to increase their revenue.As a CS:GO player, and as an individual who enjoys using skins in CS:GO, you would think I would be on board with the idea of skins in Payday 2. I was not. In CS:GO the skins are a purely cosmetic effect meant to give players some ""eye candy"" while they engage in competative games. In Payday 2, it seems the main focus was not set on the skins with the best appearance, but with the stat buffs or experience buffs that could come along with said skins. If you were to check the market for Payday 2 skins, you would find that the skins with said buffs are priced significantly higher than those without. This is most notable with the Beretta 92FS and its skin that grants a +3 concealment buff. While that may seem minor, if you are an avid Payday 2, most notably a dodge player, you would know that this is a rather huge buff.As of recently, Overkill decided to finally release the content for the Completely Overkill Pack, a limited time DLC priced at $20 for fans and supporters of Overkill. It was meant to be a DLC pack that included a gift for those fans and supports to show off how amazing they are, an how Overkill is thankful for them. They even created the items with care.It took 8 months for said DLC to finally release, well over its original release date, and a little after its delayed release date. The items created with care from Overkill was a chance to get a random skin from a set of 25 (or 250 if you include different conditions and whether they have stat boosts or not), with a random rarity, with a random condition, and a random chance for a stat boost. Needless to say, people, myself included, were not happy with this. As a thank you for fans, we were given the chance to show how great our luck was, and thus given a skin that could be better, worse, or more valuable than the next person. Essentially, we were told that we could not be equal as fans and supporters.This prompted a negative reaction from the community, and Overkill's very own forum moderators went on strike.This was a game I loved, enjoyed, and gained so much from. However, Overkill's actions with rebalance, updates, and skin system made me remove the game from my harddrive, and my heart. These things were not the only reason why I decided to write a negative review for this game. The developers have been known to talk own to the community, treat us as lessers, pass off our opinions and inputs in favor of whatever they wish, and just being rude to us, their fans. A notable example of what I mean is, ""Your opinion. My choice."" This was given by Bo Anderrsson, a founder and producer at Overkill, to a person who questioned the flashbang mechanic in the game, and how it should be changed to something that can be seen and avoided rather than something that pops up at your feet for no reason. Bo said that the current mechanic is fine as is, though he'll keep it in mind in the case if they ever added in a ""Baby"" difficulty mode, further belittling the input of anyone who thought different than him.So, here I am, writing a negative review for a once beloved game because of poor balancing updates, power creeps, bug fixes that were passed over in favor of making more DLC, broken promises, and a developer who chooses to disrespect those that helped make them what they are today.tl;dr GG no re			"

												Levels are now much smaller - about a building's worth in size. The engine is far buggier than the first iteration.

Most of the DLC isn't worth it and what is should have been included with the base.As if that wasn't enough, now you'll have micropayments. ""Safes"" drop and you'll need to buy ""drills"" to unlock them. Newly formed skins for weapons have stat boosting capabilities only available to those who will pay USD for them. The kicker was this released during Crime Fest (an otherwise FREE CONTENT week sponsered by the developers). I determined before release that this PAYDAY 2 release would be one of cash grabs.

												Heads up!  Do not trust the positive reviews on this game!The positive reviews were written before the most recent patch.  I've put a ton of hours into this game and loved the hell out of it, but it isn't the same game it was on release.  The weapons have been rebalanced and the optional DLC has been replaced with awful pay2win crates and skins.  This game will milk you for all you're worth, and the developers will keep adding more DLC instead of patching the numerous bugs in existing content.Avoid at all costs, for the sake of your wallet.  The microtransactions in this game are worse than most free2play games!			"

												So I played this game since August 2013 and had much fun with it. Pro point for that game .... but what sucks is, that over 1 year the makers of this game are releasing DLCs for this game like every month ones and that for 4.99€ or even more so you have to spend like over 150 euros now already to fully play all the heists and have all the weapons, masks, achievements and all the ♥♥♥♥ you probably care about. At all in 2015 was the worst year. Now they even added a micro-transaction ♥♥♥♥ system that you can even waste more money than before. First this game was all about robbing banks in a virtual game that was pretty fun .... but when it went so they (the makers of the game) actually started to rob your bank account so you can play this damn game. It´s pretty much like World of Warcraft .... you have to pay for playing it like every damn month and you are getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about that situation from day to day. This game mutated in a money crapping machinery for Overkill Studios and won´t stop doing it until as you guys won´t wake up and stop paying this capitalistic game that actually robs your bank and not that you rob a bank ingame. A friend also send me this hilarious video about Almir´s philosophy that actually mind♥♥♥♥ed me even more check it out if you have like half a minute spare time cheers. Thank you for reading my rage-review and maybe see you ingame have a great day.

												Used to love this game, and still do gameplay wise, but the fact that they added microtransactions even though they said they wouldnt shows how bad this company is, and boy oh boy this isnt the first time we, as a community have been let down, there has been similar times when they promised free content, yet for some reason made the content cost.

												(See EDIT pls)Used to be the best coop game ever ...And then greed turn it into a meh coop game, balancing is awfull atm (crimefest 2015 edition).The dlcs we bought for years now at least for alot of them made useless, mods we farmed for hours, useless too.Really all that micropayement adding was a joke that almost kick all the vets out, come on new sheeps come and try...EDIT 2016/0604 :Well the update #100... where to start =)Pros :#1 : The rework is globaly nice and gives us some ""fresh air"", builds now can be more versatile than ever. And tbh this is really a good thing.#2 :The weapons balance is really better, lot's of forgotten stuff will be back in our lobbyes due to that balance and new perks.Cons :#3 Games now easier than ever for vets, and so for the new heisters, who'll never smell the fear we had when DW cames out first place.#4 About the perk balance, yes dodge needed a nerf, be to me not a casualies so the crouch dodge bonus nerf was indeed a mistake, because it's a gameplay killer.Finally the removed the drills, well i wasn't that much ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about that first place. They still have market incoming due to transaction taxes, and because they removed from drop first batch of vault, they must had alot of income due to market huge transaction of the lasts days. Anyway, it's still a good thing drills are out :hoxton:Overall i think Overkill goes in the right direction with the payday2 franchise, from nowon, we'll stay vigilent tho ;)			"

												It hurts me to have to write such a devastating review of a game I wanted to love, but the fact is that Payday 2 is and has been a total disaster from the start. The root cause is the developer of the game Overkill software, and more specifically their lead developer Andrew Goldfarb. Everything done in development or since release for Payday 2 has been focused on slick PR, coercing players into buying DLC to help them advance, systematically removing as much fun as possible from the game, and breaking every significant promise they made to those that supported them in the move from indie mod project to AAA-level title, and as if that wasn't enough, they go out of their way to simultaneously insult paying customers who ask relevant questions or who have any type of complaint, legitimate or not. The last patch, the ""Death Wish"" patch, completely destroyed the game balance to pander to achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s (the 3rd or 4th time this has happened to date) and to give the appearance of the developer supporting the game above-and-beyond what is the norm. This is a standard pattern for Overkill, and nothing could be further from the truth. The 360 version of the game has never been patched to date. 7-day heists and safehouse customization, two important features promised for release, have never been added despite 24 patches and 5 pay DLCs. Every patch adds hideous new bugs and destroys game balance, while critical game-breaking bugs fester for months without being acknowledged, much less fixed. Hackers ruin the game regularly as it uses a peer-to-peer multiplayer model and relies on no master server, auth, or security. Overkill's answer to hacking? A pointless PR campaign that ""they care about cheating"" and a forum thread telling you to report hackers via email, but once explored is shown to be a total facade that wastes everybody's time as Overkill has no actual recourse to ban players or affect hacking in any way because of their poor implementation. Goldfarb does ban people, frequently and very loudly, from his twitter account if they are negative about the game or ask difficult questions, and why not? The man is a real hero and he wants you to know he stands for justice. The Payday 2 steam forums are full of trolls and sycophants, threads regularly disappear without warning, and there is a nasty little group of fellaters (players with cash.net in their name) that edit and remove posts as they please with no oversight or moderation. Through all of this, Overkill touts how they ""listen to the fans"", when the last 6 months of Payday 2 have proven to any sane person that not only do they NOT listen, they go out of their way to anger and troll their own paying customers. Examples of this are numerous: cameras added that can't be destroyed that say ""Suck it"" on them, special enemies that 1-shot you regardless of your stats/level/health while telling you to ""go to the forums and cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥"", and even making the aforementioned special have an incredibly irritating fingernails-on-a-chalkboard high pitched whine that is constant, cannot itself be disabled, and is the very definition of 'tinnitus'. This last issue has caused thousands of players to quit the game or play with their sound off, and Overkill have not acknowledged how serious it is nor patched it. I hope somebody sues the hell out of them for it, I really do. It might seem like I've listed a huge litany of complaints about the game in this review, but honestly I've barely scratched the surface. There simply isn't room here to discuss the countless ways that Payday 2 has been systematically destroyed.Put it this way: Overkill is so petty that they had Valve arbitrarily (and in secret) remove the COMMUNITY VOTED top tag for Payday 2, ""Bag Throwing Simulator"", because most missions involve throwing bags repeatedly as you move them across the level while surviving L4D zombie levels of supercops. They also regularly remove fan posted material from the steam pages if it is any way critical of Payday 2 or Overkill. This rigorous, draconian, PRC-esque clampdown on all negative material indeed does give the game the appearance of being much more than it actually is. Don't be fooled. I've got nearly 500 hours in Payday 2 and it was once a very enjoyable (but seriously flawed) experience. These days, it's just insulting.			"

												Having invested over 1,111 hrs. on this game...All I can say is great work Overkill Studios!!! The best developers, artists, programmers, level and layout designers, etc.!The game has a variety of heists for the run n' gun and stealth types. You have a wide arsenal with a ton of different weapon types, skillsets, perks, armor, etc. This is by far the best game I have played, it involves action, strategy, stealth, endurance, and mostly TEAMWORK! PayDay 2 brings people together to work as a team and cooperate in order to achieve the objectives, it is always up-to-date and it is a lot of fun. I can honestly say this game will continue for another 2 years without getting boring.Caution: This is a geek friendly review :)Note: Nominate this game for the 'Test of Time' award if you have clocked over 1000 hrs :D100/10			"

												Ye Olde farmers at Overkill have let their greed get the better of them. They have relentlessly tilled the soil, and their hunger makes them harvest the unripe crops. Forgetting the Old Ways of trust and respect, they have not rotated their crops. They have also let their vile excrement and waste, such as bad updates and terrible ideas, infiltrate into their farmlands. They bleed the soil dry and the fury in Almir's eyes grows as blood drips ever faster from his lips. They know not the doom they hasten upon themselves, the fire and smoke, the locusts and ash.The four horsemen ride on to the village of Overkill Studios intent on wiping it from the face the earth.

												This is a great game, ruined by mistakes from the developer. Many of the problems existed in the original game, Payday: The Heist, and some are new. Overkill's philosophy seems to have changed from ""make a fun game that people will buy"" to ""do whatever makes money."" The problems include, but are not limited to:-A completely broken enemy that one-hit kills you and can move through walls and do pretty much anything else it pleases, that they refuse to fix-Tons of overpriced DLC that you will have to buy to be on an even playing field-Achievements requiring that you own DLC-Achievements requiring that you and 3 other players own DLC-Achievements that can only unlock during a certain time of the year-Content that you can miss forever if you weren't around at the right time to grab it-Content that requires you to own other games you may not want on Steam-Microtransactions were recently added, when it was originally promised that there would be none-Above microtransactions increase stats, providing advantage to those that buy themEssentially the game has become one big money grab.

												This game makes me sad. I haven't played too much of this game, but I know the game and community, which both are pretty great. I had lots of fun with this game. Amazing moments to be had. Then they brought along all the weapon in skins, ruining it. Skins should be skins, and not change stats.  This game is being driven into the ground, and it makes me sad. A good tthing soiled by a cheap money grab. The only possible scenario in which I might find this new system excusable is if it was a quick way to grab some more funds for Payday 3 (assuming it's in the works). If not, get it together devs. We all expect more from you. I look forward to a fixed next game. Thanks for reading.TL;DR: Very good game ruined by being converted to pay to win.			"

												I've spent a lot of time on this game, and for a while I played the hell out of it every single day. It's still fun, and it's easy to enjoy, especially when you're playing with friends. However, as time goes on, I've noticed that paid DLC continue to come out on almost a monthly basis, to the point where I've spent almost twice as much money on DLC as I have the game itself. Time after time after time, Overkill (the developers of the game) will add new content and force it behind a paywall, to the point where the vast majority of content is locked behind DLC. There are almost twenty paid DLCs at the time of writing this review.However, the final straw came today, when they announced ""free"" content being released to the community. The first thing they did was release microtransactions. On the first day of a ""free"" update. This is made even more outrageous by the fact that Overkill has said in repeated statements that they never have and never will incorporate microtransactions of any sort into Payday 2. With the blatant lying and money-grabbing, I've lost all support for this game. If you want your money's worth, look somewhere else.2016 Edit: Recently, Overkill rescinded their microtransactions in a dramatic way: by completely removing the money cost of them. While this, in my eyes, redeems them, I still can't recommend this game, primarily for its bugs - which haven't been fixed in a very long time - and outstanding amounts of DLC.			"

												Payday 2 has always had a weird relationship with its playerbase, being a bit distant with them, doing some shady stuff in the past (especially the huge lineup of DLC, which is slowly becoming more and more optional with free alternatives to some weapons and weapon classes which actually stand up to the meta), but overall, and especially recently the developers have established that they do listen to us and our feedback about the game and what we want to see come out of it, as well as come up with plenty of insane ideas of their own to spice up a game that came out three years ago (and the game is still getting updated!?).To put it in short, Payday 2 is the successor to Payday: The Heist, expanding upon stealth mechanics, having a fairly in-depth weapon, skill and mask customisation to prolong gameplay and (as of writing) about 45 unique heists and a couple of reduxes with slightly different objectives/maps, as well as 2600 total levels across 25 prestiges or ""infamies"". It's kind of like the Left 4 Dead of bank robberies, but instead of basing around moving from point A to B it involves doing specific tasks such as holding out in a specific area, retrieving loot, killing targets or moving to point B. It also has lots of mods, as long as you can bother finding them, which can greatly enhance your experience with the game, fill out some features you wanted or just push the boundaries of stupid on the game.

												I'm a bit sad, because I genuinely enjoyed playing this game with my friends. Most of them have uninstalled, while a few still cling to the hopes that Overkill may somehow reverse or fix the situation.Pay for DLC.Pay for a soundtrack.Pay for microtransactions.Pay to play.Pay to win.I guess they must have thought about the name a few years in advance, because I see why they call it Payday 2.But despite what comes now and with what may come in the future, I'll always remember this game as a laughfest, heisting, once-great co-op game that I used to play with my friends.

												It is almost unbelievable how many hours of fun and frustration this game was. I was even swayed to buy some of the DLC as part of the conted they generated was for all users. I stopped playing just after the Hotline Miami patch as once I played Rats close to hundreds of times the game lost its allure. I kind of regret putting such a huge amount of my time on this game, but I guess either the game was that good or I just had nothing better to do at the time. I was a bit dubious if I could trust OVERKILL games as DLC kept mounting one after another. As today you can buy 112$ of DLC at the moment, most of which consists of weapons and masks, plus whatever amount you want to spend on the infamous microtransaction drills. If you are ok with this, by all means buy the game and have fun. I know I can't go back anymore.			"

DisclaimerNow I'm not going to write a review regarding the game, as there are several well written reviews out there. I normally don't often write reviews for that reason. I usually figure that I might just make myself useful and thumb these reviews up instead, for their genuine contribution.I do however feel that there have been an unfortunate misunderstanding in the community that I feel the urge to address.It is such a shame that most of the people that are defending Overkill have just skimmed through the outrage and assumed a theory, then convinced themselves that their theories are factual.The reviewPeople aren't enraged because Overkill implemented microtransactions into Payday 2 that mimics Valve's multiplayer source games. They are because Overkill made a fraudulent move at our expense.There was a time when the producer of Overkill Software, Almir Listo confirmed that there will be no microtransactions for the game, as there were concerns regarding this matter amongst the community. He then made a thorough statement, empowering their determination that the game will not feature any microtransactions whatsoever.Instead the game will have a set of DLCs that should provide beneficial content to the game, that purposely supposed to enrich the gameplay.After a while Overkill felt that these doesn't finance them enough for their plans of future major updates for the game, so eventually, instead of microtransactions they came up with a campaign. The campaign ruled out as a train track, with the train, that'd pass through stations of updates. The train would then need to be fueled by contributions from the community, and those would be rewarded with exclusive ingame items. It was known as the Hypetrain.You'd be able to buy Overkill packages, a basic one that still remains, available for purchase indefinitely, and an exclusive version that'd give four masks and an additional secret item that won't be released at any other point. These masks were four original main masks with eyes that glowed, each in different individual elements.The campaign had a roughly slow start, until Hotline Miami 2 was released. Since Overkill and Dennation Games...Dennation Games is the indie game-development studio that developed Hotline Miami franschise... made a collaboration on allowing some Hotline Miami tributal content into Payday 2. Overkill wanted to endorse Dennation Games' new game of Hotline Miami's sequel by allowing people to buy it through the Hypetrain as well. The money spent would then fuel the train also.That blasted the train through all the remaining stations, fulfilling the entire route, and skyrocketed from there on. Overkill made an absurd amount of finance out of that campaign.They proceeded on completing each update, one after another as promised, it took well longer than expected, some were brilliant, some were disappointing. But there was a lot of content coming into the game thanks to the community.After that Overkill felt thrilled by the whole concept and wanted to continue the whole idea of Crimefest, bear in mind that Hypetrain was the main attraction after the previous Crimefest. This Crimefest is an anniversary but also a celebration as they were given a two year contract by their publisher to continue with the game. They have always been contracted by their publisher, 505 Games, each contract depending on two years of development to keep the game fresh and reliable.They started the whole thing off with a few major updates, and a new main attraction; Microtransactions.

They shouldn't be selling crates with skins that give state boosts it's just bullocs. It's sad to see what was once a great game turn into a money machine. See what you did Overkill!			"

												If you asked me a week ago whether I would recommend this game, I would have given you a resounding ""Yes!"". The gameplay is amazing, quite unlike any other game on the market. You can enjoy sandbox games like GTA, but the amount of detail put into Payday's heists are amazing. Graphically, it's not super amazing, but really, it more than makes up for that in cooperative synergistic gameplay and variation in heists. Full of one-liners, entertaining in-game dialogue and a creative progressive storyline, I've put 900+ hours into this game. I've also bought almost every DLC at release price, pony'd up the money for masks and whatnot within the game. However, in the past week, we've had the Road to Crimefest/Crimefest event, which has brought an unprecedented, unwanted change to the game which we were promised would not happen. Yes, much like other games on Steam, Payday 2 has finally introduced microtransactions. Sure, it may not be marketed as such, and technically, you're really not forced to buy anything. But with the introduction of this content that ISN'T a DLC, and was marketed as part of a FREE event, this game has finally joined the ranks of those pay-to-win games. The new ""Crimefest Safes"", only openable by ""Drills"" that you buy from the Steam store might technically not be microtransactions per se, but this is looking bleak in terms of the promise that Overkill made that we would NEVER have microtransactions in the game. I love the game, but I won't be playing it until this content is either removed, or changed in a way that actually benefits the community, rather than financially benefits the developers, who say they pride themselves on giving back to the community. I'm fine with paying for DLC content, even if it's just guns or masks, because I believe in supporting a game that I enjoy, but this is new ground, that I cannot agree with.			"

												I would have recommended this game, and in fact, I did, right up until Microtransactions were added to the game. I'm sure I don't have to re-iterate that we were promised no microtransactions ever, but it's a fact. And, if business needs required them to go back on their word, some kind of heads-up would have made all the difference.As it sits now, I cannot recommend Payday 2. They've added in a way to get drills for the safes via in-game, but still allowing someone else to pay for drills faster is simply no bueno. If Microtransactions are removed, I'd happily recant this review, but I just cannot as it sits now.			"

												This was once a game that was made with love. A game that sought to give the players what they wanted, within reason, and make sure everyone had a good time. Now it exists only to serve as its hippocratic creators cash cow.It started with more and more DLC coming out every month, in lieu of the content we were promised.Next came their ""Hype Train"" event, where players were ""encouraged"" to buy as much DLC as possible so they could receive ""free"" DLC at the end of the event, putting the only reward players wanted (something promised long ago) at the end of the list behind several million dollars worth of DLC purchases.And today came the final nail in the coffin: The crate system and the complete destruction of modding capability. To allow them to charge you for tacky, disgusting weapon skins (when they had once promised to NEVER allow microtransactions to be a thing) that you unlocked by purchasing a ""drill"" to open a ""safe"" they decided to completely change how the modding scripts work. Your favorite sound mods? Unusable. The shadow mapping mod that made the game playable on older computers? Non-functioning. All of your favorite skins for heisters and weapons along? Donezo. All so they can cram microtransactions down your throat while modders desperately try to understand how modding will work now. And to think that these guys once had the audacity to claim they support the modding community.This game was once amazing. It was possibly my favorite cooperative game to play with friends on steam. I spent loads of money on DLC, and even partook in the second Crimefest just so I could support the guys that made the game I loved. Now... I'll never touch this game again. After certain folks left the dev team the others with horrid ideas were allowed to ruin it. And ruin it they did.Do not buy this game. Do not support these developers. If you must play something like it go play Payday 1. At least they haven't gone back to ruin that game... yet.Oh, and don't go on their community page to complain about any change you dislike big or small. They'll ban you for having the nerve to speak up about a game you love being ruined, and insult you while doing so. Remember when BioWare called the hordes of people who hated Mass Effect 3's ending a ""vocal minority"" and dismissed their fans complaints completely? Yeah, pretty much that. Just with more microtransactions and emoticons.			"

												Update as of 10/20/2015: It would appear that Overkill have added in the ability for Drills to drop as a Card Reward at the end of a heist, meaning that they can be acquired without paying anything but a tremendous amount of time. Depsite this, I will NOT be changing my review. It saddens me that such a simple change will placate so many people and distract them from the real issue. Guns are still absurdly broken. Skins still change how the guns behave. The company blatantly lied and tried to see if they could get away with it. I'm personally not happy being bent over a rail and taken advantage of, nor is a little bit of lube going to solve my saltiness. And trust me, it has nothing to do with entitlement. I would've been just as happy if half the DLC and events for this game never took place. I know a lot of people are rushing back to their reviews to change them to positive, but sorry, this won't be one of them. These kind of business practices continue to go on because of how easy it is to calm the masses.Original Text: Welp, after years of back and forth BS, the true Overkill has finally revealed itself. As players leave in droves, the forums burn, and the Subreddit has taken to changing their banner, this game is now dead for a lot of people. Myself included. The constant DLC was enough to keep a lot of people on the fringe, but the DLC was never truly required to play. Sure you could miss out on the some content, but it wasn't world ending. The gameplay was there, the fun was there. So were the bugs. That have persisted through ""update"" after ""update"", while they still managed to have the time to ask for more money. Now, with this years Crimefest, and event which promises free content, kicking off with a microtransaction scheme that would make even Konami blush after what they did with MGS V, well, let's say this is one game that will never see a single byte of my hard drive space again. Good night, PD2. It was fun while it lasted. I recommend you stay far, far away from this diseased limb of gaming space, that once had glory and motor skills. Something else will come along to take its place. There are plenty of good co-op games out there, and coming out. Give them a look. If the theme of PD2 is what interests you, I'm sure something will come down the pipe someday to replace it as well. There are a lot of talented modders out there who cherished PD2, so who knows. Maybe they'll be the creator of the next great crime simulator, with perhaps less of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Just a small edit, not that anyone will read this since all most of the people care about is that it's negative but, nonetheless: The reason I have 0 hours played in the last two weeks, is obviously because I haven't played in the last two weeks. I tried picking the game up again sometime after Hype Train and all it's wonderful loads of ♥♥♥♥, but with Heist Rewards (XP/Cash) being lowered yet again, I saw no reason to play. Took a look again once Crimefest rolled around this year, and well.... Yeah, not really going to play a game focused around gun play, where the gun play now makes zero sense, and microtransactions have been introduced after I've already bought all the DLC prior to Hype Train. Just a clear up in case anyone thought I was just following the pitchfork bandwagon. Though they do have good food, and aren't wrong.			"

												with over 700hours I have some fond memories. Uortunately overkill is starting to go the way of EA by ignoring earlier statements they have made. They have come around to their latest free give away and decedid to go with the ability to make microtransactions freely avaliable for all, despite statements in the earliest days that itwould never happen.

												The 2 words that officially killed this game: Micro TransactionsI used to support this game, and played it nonstop. Up until the Hype Train of 2015, I had owned every single DLC and even purchased the Overkill pack for myself and a friend. If I have to guess how much I spent on Payday 2, it's around $200 or $225. You know what. I'm not mad I spent that time and money on this game. It was fun back then.Things change. Games change, and apparently what the devs say about the game has changed. With that change, so does my wallet. It will not support this game anymore.Good bye Payday2. Burn in hell.			"

Pay2dayPros Fun premise Enjoyable characters Good degree of character customisation Reasonably pretty graphicsCons Absolutely abhorrent amounts of DLC Promised features still have not been delivered Mission goals are repetitive Team mate AI is terrible Clearly geared towards grinding Atrocious mission selection processFinal ThoughtsPayday 2 is a shame. It's a game with a great premise and so much in the way of potential yet it seems to squander it at every turn, throwing a sour new twist into the mix each and every time you start to enjoy the game. As a product it is entirely inhospitable for solo players - something which I'd argue is unacceptable in any game - with poor mission design  and unbalanced enemy types only standing out all the more when playing alone. Ultimately, Payday 2 is a shame because what could have been a fun game has turned out to be nothing but a grindy, repetitive waste of time. And that's without even mentioning Overkill's disgusting focus on pumping out DLC pack after DLC pack...Definitely would not recommend "

												> Introduces Microtransactions to unlock skins that give stats.> Nerf all weapons to ♥♥♥♥ to encourage usage of ugly-as-F skins.CSGO ripped system and skins got me annoyed, but what made me flip the table was the ""balancing"" to the weapons..absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Shotguns that do 3 times less damage than Pistols? 5 pages of Melee weapons that all have identical (AND STUPID) stats??WE TRUSTED YOU, OVERKILL.

												Oh how i really wish i could give this game a good review for its fun gameplay,  good skill customisation and good community, recent business moves from Overkill have forced my hand and thus with the introduction of microtransations and the poor way overkill handled it cuppled with the ""Reward"" for playeres who purchased the $20 complelely overkill pack being a safe AFTER the ♥♥♥♥♥torm of the blackmarket update (the updated that introduced the dreaded microtransactons), i must leave a negetive review until overkill does something to fix this red hot mess they have created.Update - Well its been a couple of months since i last played and when i saw the wolf pack DLC was free to those who owned it in PD:TH, i thought i might as well see what overkill has done to fix the mess they made. I can report that they have done a lot of good since the black market update, some free dlcs and some paid, and the new heists they added in Point Break and the revived ones in Wolf Pack were fun and a good addition. I feel though i should call into question OK's mental state with the Goat Simulator DLC, like seriously WTF.However if u are wondering if PD2 is good again, id say its better but still has a long way to go before its back to what it was originally, heck it prob wont get back to its original state but i guess we wil have to deal with it.Im still leaving my negetive review because i still feel really hurt by overkill and the black market update. The update itself i feel wasn't to awful looking back however the timing was akin to someone grabbing u by the balls, twisting then pulling and ripping them off.			"
