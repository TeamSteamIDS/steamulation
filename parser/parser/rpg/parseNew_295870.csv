Above is my early look into the Dungeoning. It was recorded before it was on Steam, but the info should still be pretty accurate.The dungeoning features rock hard difficulty, fluid feeling controls, and simple graphics. This is one of my personal favorite rogue-like/lite games. I love how easy it is to get into, but difficult to master. I've already finished the game once, and currently working on game+.Overall it's a fun light romp, that could have you coming back for more.Positives:- Easy to understand mechanics- Fluid feeling controls- Will challenge the player- Multiple ""Game+"" for replayNegatives:- Might be too simple looking for some- Might be too hard for some- Could use more options and features			"

												Very fun game! But Needs work.So far i've only done one run and it was a blast, very unforgiving but if you have the instinct to explore you will be fine. If you're a fan of some hardcore platformers and the Souls series, you'll find something to like here. I hope the developer sticks with the project long enough for maybe a graphical upgrade, and maybe souls style multiplayer? Exploring a dungeon and seeing enemy players challenging you for your weapons/gold would be exciting. Improvements that the game needs-Smoother UI, The menu system feels very dated, I'm not sure if this was on purpose but I thought it was just frustrating. there's not even a way to use your cursor when playing with a keyboard.-Proper Controller SupportThe game advertises controller support but this does not seem to be the case, the game would crash if I even moved my anaglog stick which seems to be a problem many players are having.To the developer I hope you stick with the game and make it the best it can possibly be. You're on to something special here.			"

												This is an exceptionally good game. If you're into the whole side-scrolling, rougey, procedural, pixely, dungeon crawlers then this is for you.+Graphics and audio are top notch+Controls feel good and responsive (espeacially on xbox controller)+Enemies can get pretty damn hard+Fun weapons and stat modifyers+Wall jumping!-Game is way too short. It didn't take me very long to beat it-Could use more variety of weapons and stat modifiers-Needs more enemies-WTF, there's no boss!!!Nonetheless, it's a fun playthrough. I don't regret the $4.00 I spent on it (Steam Summer Sale 2014)			"

												Reading the reviews which give this game a thumbs up, it seemed like it would be right up my alley.  Randomly generated dungeon?  Difficult but fair gameplay?  Inspiration from the 'Souls' series?  A liking to Legend of Dungeon?  Take my money!But don't let any of these fool you.  What you get is an overpriced, bare-bones, sleep-inducing and repetitive game.  This really needs to be labeled as Early Access because there's nothing to this game for the price-tag.  I'm sure the developer has plenty more to add in the future but as of the time of this review, this game has nothing to keep you interested for more than 3 hours, max.The dungeon itself is very uninspired.  The weapons all function exactly the same.  Every sword, every bow, every staff... exactly the same.  You cannot sell nor even DROP any of your weapons, so prepare to be battling with scrolling through your weapons the whole way through.  There's no armor drops, so zero customization there, and the stats are boring and should probably just automatically upgrade instead of making you pause the game, go into your menu, and add one point into a stat which doesn't make you feel any cooler, stronger, or tougher.There is some enemy variety, but it takes way too long before you encounter the next new mob.  A lot of the mobs, especially early on, are too boring to fight.  Unless you think fighting a bunch of plants that can't move or attack is fun.This game needs a lot more time to be fleshed out, and then it might be a decent amount of fun.  Right now, however, I would recommend you save your hard-earned money.			"

												I thought i'd be more impressed by this game from what I saw in some videos but its not as much as I hoped.The Dungeoning is a 2d rogue-like platformer, with an absolute perma-death system, nothing to save after you die other than the in-game achievements, I think its a flash game created with java considering that achievements only appears after you close the game. about the game You have only one character that you start with.You start with a sword a bow a slingshot and a wand, can switch between them with a simple button press and a shield to block ranged attacks.Use potions to heal, or scrolls to either heal or increase your power, Killing monsters gives you xp that you use to upgrade vitality, strength, defense or magicAnimations in all are great, controls do not feel clunky at all, fun fast-paced type of jumping and attacking monsters.Several monsters to kill, traps to encounter, secrets, merchants to buy from and moreGame-play is fun, good level design, good batch of monsters, nice difficulty built into it  Downsides When picking up potions they just pile up in your inventory and you can only use a button to heal, cant really pick which one or sort them out.When picking up weapons or equipment basically while fighting monsters you wont really know you did because the ""text""  is not that obvious its really small You have to open your inventory every time you want to use a scroll you picked up to upgrade yourself.You have to open your inventory every time you level up, it only just says ""Stats"" on the down left side of the screen so you know you leveled up.There's only 16 levels that are if you're good enough you'll finish in 2 hours and be done with the game,  there is NG+ but some people are not huge fans of that.Also no bosses or anything like that.Item description is vague, its just a very random backstory when you read it, cant really know which weapon is stronger can only guess if its name sounds cooler than yours.EVERY TIME I start a new game ""after closing the game"" It has to frigging give me the tutorial text pop-ups ... every time...Bottom line of all downsides is the Ui itself being horrible, not giving you options to edit how it looks or what to see or gives you proper visuals and texts to know what you're dealing withALSO I Highly recommend a controller for this game, if you want to play it with a keyboard you'll suffer because its mainly a controller game, although you can edit all buttons I still recommend a controller.TL;DRIf you're willing to look past beyond the ui issues, the game itself is really good and fun and for 6.99$ thats a good deal.

												This is Dark Souls through a Legend of Dungeon filter. Deep combat, tight controls, beutifully-colorful pixel art with dynamic lighting, and item-borne lore. A roguelike whose charming aesthetic does not come off as gimmicky as many others of its ilk. The difficulty is relentless but fair, and the music and sound effects are expectedly old-school and immersive. If you enjoy Risk of Rain and Legend of Dungeon, but wish they were more ""Souls-y"", The Dungeoning should already be in your library.			"

												An old-school roguelike through and through, The Dungeoning is a hardcore platformer that shows little to no mercy to the player. Beneath the simplistic appearance of this game lies a great deal of genuine depth, and a great deal of genuine fun (well, once you get past the whole ""dying in the first few minutes thing""). Be warned, though; this game is more than happy to beat the living hell out of you, and you are going to have to work at it in order to succeed.			"

												The Dungeoning is pixely.  It is brutal.  There doesn't appear to be any after death progression like in Rogue Legacy, however this game doesn't really need a feature like that.  The nostalgia is definitely there.  The gameplay too.  Played this on a 360 with the fancy dpad, works very well. "

												Well, I bought this game expecting it to be fun. But it happened it was not what I've expected. But it IS FUN. Do you catch up with my thought? :D You're a knight in a randomly generated dungeon where EVERYTHING is trying to kill you - rats, bats, ghosts, walls, bushes, barrels. Oh god. Once you die - you're dead. No respawns, no loot pickup. D-E-A-D. Want another try? Start from zero. You dodge, shoot, kill stuff and gain XP. You level up your knight, grow him stronger just to make it more painful to lose him to innevitable forces of evil developer. The graphics are nice (as for me - Thy Pixel Lover). Music/sounds are great and give some smooth ambient to the whole picture. As far as I understand - The game is still developing. Let us hope that it turnes out fine, adds some achievements, co-op, and other fun stuff. And meanwhile - hooray and thumbs up for the current build.			"

												The dungeoning is a Rogue-Lite Platforming dungeon crawler.  I've heard that some poeple has hinted that it's like a 2D Dark Souls but I would disagree with part of that statement, whilst on the other hand I can see where they are coming from.  Being a Rogue-Lite platformer, what really matters is how the game controls and I can happily concur that it controls really well & on par to Super Meat Boy which means when you die, it's generally your fault and not the fault of the game in any way.  The other element is the RPG part, you gain experience through killing the various different types of foes and pick up loot through looking in chests & destroying barrels.  The game in my opinion is a little short with only about 16 levels but there is a New Game+ to keep you coming back to see if you can beat the game again even though it's a little harder this time.  On the whole, I'm really pleased with the game & have enjoyed playing & would recomend it to anyone			"

												This game is pretty awesome. I enjoy these rogue-lite genre games, and this is a pretty decent one. The controls are (for the most part) rock solid and the gameplay is fantastic. The art style is enjoyable, and I LOVE the music. Two marks against it are inventory management, and a lack of rebindable movement keys. The invintory tends to clutter up with old useless tat that I can't seem to get rid of. All of the other keyboard keys CAN be rebound, but not the movement ones. I hate using the arrow keys, so I had to resort to autohotkey (binding of isaac method much?) to reconfigure my keys. Beisdes those two small issues, I find this game to be a keeper.			"

												Initial impressions are bleak.Tight controlls are essential in a game like this, and the dungeoning does them well. The only thing keeping me from doing a proper pogo stick kill from above is my reflexes. However, the enemies are identical for two levels, after which the difficulty shoots up. Seriously, I went from bats and green slimes to GIANT SLIME EYEBALL MONSTERS WITH A HUGE HEALTH BAR. There's no sense of ramping up at all.Leveling and progression is classic RPG, STR, VIT, INT, DEX, items seemed fairly basic. I've only gotten 2 or 3 levels in, but I find myself wondering why I am not instead playing Rogue Legacy.If there's any sense of long-term progression in this game, I'm missing it, which is not good for a roguelike. It's not that I dislike the game. I just don't not-like it, I guess? It's mediocre, the music is pretty low-par, the generated details are minimal, every room looks identical. Save your money, get rogue legacy. Sorry the dungeoning, you do too little to keep my attention.			"

												Calling The Dungeoning ""Spelunky Souls"" is spot on.  The combat and platforming feels like a less polished Spelunky, while the pace and ""learn from mistakes"" difficulty mirrors that of Dark Souls.The Dungeoning is a pretty short game, consisting of only 3-4 tilesets over 16 floors of the dungeon.  A full run only takes about 60-90 minutes.Encounters with enemies are very similar to Dark Souls, in that enemies seen unfair and daunting until you learn their attack patterns. Mastering how to react to and counter enemies will let you breeze past them in subsequent play throughs.The sword play is skillful and satisfying.  Bows, slingshots, and wands each provide different projectile trajectories making all 3 useful in different situations.  You will switch weapons very often depending on the dangers at hand.You have a shield, but it is only effective against projectiles, and only in a small frontal arc.  Unfortunately this makes blocking much less effective than simply dodging.There are no time limits, so much like Dark Souls you are free to slow down, take your time, and study each encounter before diving in.Every run is a fresh start, as there is no meta-progression.  This works quite well for The Dungeoning.  Progression is satisfying because when you get farther than before you know it is because YOU as the player got better.Pros:+Unforgiving but predictable enemy behaviors and attacks.+Nice pixel sprites that aren't too stlized.+Loot!  In the form of weapons, shields, rings, and consumables.+Visually stunning particle FX and lighting.+Great 8-bit pixel sounding SFX.+Short.+New Game Plus mode.Cons:-Clunky, difficult to navigate menus.-Meager character leveling options.-No save system, so a game winning run must be done in one sitting.-Consumables are slightly too abundant.-Awful video and control options typical of cheap indie titles.-No Steam achievements.Fun to beat once in a few hours if you can pick this game up for a few bucks.  I'd gladly play through this game again if more content is released.			"

												Type of Game:2D Action Platformer with PDL elementsVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, Legend of Dungeon and to a lesser degree Dark SoulsThe Good:- Randomly generated dungeons that contain secret rooms, vendors, enemies and treasure- The strategic gameplay consists of a careful balance between offense (swordplay, archery, and magic) and defense (shield blocking, player positioning, and enemy avoidance)   - This gameplay structure really supports the similarities between it and Demon/Dark Souls- The pixelated graphical design of the game is quite enjoyable and shares similar lighting effects with Legend of Dungeon- A plethora of items await the player on their quest such as swords, bows, rings, potions, wands, etc…- A progression system that boosts the player’s strength, vitality, defense, and magic though some are more beneficial than others (See The Bad)   -Scrolls can be looted, which also level up these stats- The a fore-mentioned rings can add unique tweaks to the gameplay, such as sacrificing speed to increase strengthThe Bad:- The length of the game is entirely too short to be considered a contender in the growing Steam catalogue of PDLs and roguelikes   - Just when I was starting to feel as though I was getting into a rhythm with the game, it abruptly ended with limited fanfare- Due to the lack of variety in level design, weapon-type options, and character choices: a player would have a tough time being compelled to continue playing The Dungeoning after their brief first run   - It doesn’t help that there are no achievements or unlocks as the player progresses in the game (outside of NewGame+, which is more of the same)- While the player is given four different areas to increase at each level-up, strength appears to be the only one worth sticking points into as the increased health can greatly improve the player’s chances of success- The difficulty level is not as hard as advertised   - While the player will die during their first dungeon run attempts, this is primarily due to the mild learning curve   - Once the player has figured out the controls of the game, it is quite easy to plod deliberately through to the end- While story sometimes takes a backseat in PDLs, the complete absence of one in The Dungeoning doesn’t help its longevity factorCan you play it while the children are awake?:Yes. The pixelated violence does not overdo it with gore and the damage indicator is an old school flash instead of a blood animation.Did I make time to complete it?Yes, but simply because it was so short to do so. My winning play-through took me an hour and a half to complete. There are evidently numerous new game plus iterations, but I never felt compelled to progress farther than NewGame+.Recommended Purchase Price:The Dungeoning was a fun game to play, but over far too quickly. While I like the unique strategic combat elements a lot, its lack of depth and replay-ability really don’t help it stand out among the crowded genre of roguelikes or PDLs. I would recommend picking this up on a Steam sale for $4.99or42% of current retail value of $11.99A Quick Look at those Games You Might Buyhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

I really enjoyed the constant challenge, preplanning attacks and having to keep analyzing the situation and enviroment before moving to the next step.I would like to see a bit more content such as dodging, more complex npc attacks, and possible classes but however the makers might be worry that the more complex the game the less traditional 8 bit it is.

												This game is very, very fun. It's like a Castlevania game with roguelike elements. I've only played a bit but I am currenty enjoying it. It is a difficult game, which I am personally a fan of, (though I know many others get frustarted easily and may be annoyed by the difficulty), and I feel a lot of the games fun comes from good gameplay and difficult levels. This is an early access game, so obviously many things will be added to the game in time. But there are a few things I would like to see added to the game. First, some bosses. While I found each level to be a challenge, I was dissapointed to see no big bosses. So I look forward to that hopefully being implemented. Also, some sort of stats for wepons in item descriptions would be nice. Maybe even add some new characters with different starting stats and weapons like dark souls? I look forward to each new update and seeing what's added to this awesome game!			"

												I usually end up getting bored of rogue-like games but that is not the case with The Dungeoning. The sytle of the retro art is great. The unique ememies you come across are creative. Maybe it's the leveling up that I like or the ability to keep weapons or discard them so you feel like your customizing your character. Each weapon will have a different effect and there aren't just swords, but bows, mages staffs which shoot magic, health bonuses, and leveling up your characters abilities over-all. And I like that it doesn't spoon feed you and tell you what each weapons damage rating is - you have to figure it out for yourself and experiment. All of these elements make this rogue-like more intersting so I keep coming back for more, more dungeoning that is!			"

												Unless I missed some in-game options the game currently does not appear to support WASD movement nor binding mouse buttons even with the rebindable keys. I ended up using the numpad for most of the keybinds just to keep action buttons on the right side and movement on the left. It seems that most of the reviews stating 'fluid' or 'solid' controls are either used to arrow key movements or are more likely using a gamepad. Gamepad or autohotkey required with this game for those that prefer a WASD setup.No complaints beyond the controls			"

												My time with this game has been short and sweet.  I write this review both with praise, and as a caveat.  I found this game during the Steam Summer Sale and it did not disappoint in the traditional sense -- that is, I had a lot of fun in the short time I spent with The Dungeoning.That being said, let me clarify some things.  Despite being a permadeath game, I found the learning curve fairly straightforward and the deaths in general to not be an issue.  I believe I died twice before completing the game, once on the first floor due to just starting the game with utter inexperience, then again on the fifth floor due to the difficulty curve pushing upwards in creative manners.Monsters pay experience (and occasionally coins) and this allows you to level (and potentially buy items from merchants later) one of four stats: Strength, Defense, Vitality, and Magic.  I did not end up using Magic at all in my run with the game and just focused on raising Stregth and Defense mostly, with a slight nod toward Vitality.  There are scrolls you can find in chests that may boost your stats as well, so that's a nice find.The character's controls are fairly fluid, though occasionally a bit spastic.  The hero moves fairly quickly and the swings they use have nice range to them.  The bow and slingshot both operate nicely and allow for depth in terms of how you approach enemies, provided you have sufficient ammo (which you will, if you don't stick with just one weapon).  Again, I never used magic, so I have no comment on staves in general.  The hero has several ""tricks"" that you can utilize involving jumps or swings based on movement input.  Also, jumping is a little peculiar but has a nice feel once you get used to it.  The hero really does feel pretty loose when moving about and I must say that for all the times when I had an issue because of a mis-jump or a bump into an enemy, I never really felt like it was anything short of my mishandling of the controls.  I do wish you could drop straight off ladders or attack while on them, but that's a minor gripe at best.The enemies are not plentiful by any means, but they are diverse enough to offer a fair challenge throughout the game.  There are no bosses or minibosses.  Sorry, folks.  In fact, the game ends rather abruptly when you find the item you've wandered into this lair to search for in the first place.  There is a New Game+ mode, but I haven't messed with it yet.  From what I gathered, it's mostly the same fare at a higher difficulty -- which is nice, given that one usually plays procedurally generated dungeon games for the replay value anyway.The graphics are pretty bland, though the lighting is nice at times (I actually enjoyed wearing the green glowing ring, which left a nice green ambient glow around your character that lit up the general area a little better or worse, depending on your perspective).  The sound effects are par for the course.  The music is where it's at.  Other than a strange lack of music on my last run through on Floor 2, there were some pretty awesome iterations of music that varied between levels.  I cannot state this enough, but the game is very short -- exploring every secret passage in my last run and killing nearly every enemy left me at about 90 minutes of playtime.  This is a bit disappointing, especially since there are a number of different background level changes that happen from about Floor 5 onward, so I kinda felt like the game would be made up of blocks of levels that changed backgrounds and aesthetics to let me know I was making progress; instead, it was simply another background/level theme change every few levels after Floor 5.  I don't know if there is a defined set of levels.  If there are, I finished the game on Floor 16, I believe.So there is my caveat -- the game is very short, despite being extremely fun.  I don't like recommending taking away from a developer's overall profits, but this game really is too short to be worth almost $10, except for the most committed Rogue-ish players who want to see as many variants as possible after beating the game.  I do not regret my purchase, and would urge anyone who has an interest in this sort of game to get it when it's on sale, because it is definitely worth it at any sale price.  Here's to hoping the developer goes back and adds more to the game, but it's worth a look either way if it's available on a budget price.			"

												Figured I'd buy it now that the controller support was fixed. Seems that's not really the case? I could not get my xbox 360 (officially supported by MS) Razer Atrox fightstick to work in it, which is a shame :/  Scootched around for a few mins with keyboard.. That's no fun. I will not give it a thumbs down, though, because this might be due to me trying to use a fightstick, still, it is xbox 360 compatible, and it works in EVERYTHING that has 360 controller support.. So yeah, keep that in mind, I guess. The videos I've seen indicate that this game is great.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I dig the style and I dig the approach, but there just isn't enough in it that I can rely on to have fun, if that makes any sense. The controls feel pretty good actually, but it lacks a certain rhythm that I crave when I play this type of game. It was a valient attempt and I definitely see the vision, but I get the feeling that the dev never really polished it or fleshed out his vision in the way he originally intended when he started this venture. If you're reading this, sir, I want to say that I think that you're on the right track and you could leave a huge mark in the indie world if you just get back on the saddle with this idea and see it to completion. You have it in you, both with your creativity and your idea, I feel like you just got burnt out. I'm following you for your next games, but I hope that you eventually come back to make the knock-out game that we all know you can provide.			"

												Fun game, I got it on sale for $6 but sadly I would not recommend it for the full $12. TBH, I'm sort of regretting that $6 cost considering what $6 can get you on Steam summer sales. The game is fun but if you're any good you'll probably beat it pretty quickly. I gather that it's a work in progress even if it says it isn't. I noticed a lot of features have been added at request of the community so I thought I'd ad my bug report to this review. Don't drop an item that is equipped. It will remain equiped but picking it up will not give you the same item object so you can't unequip it. I only have one ring slot this run now. :/			"

												I like the rogue-lite platformer experience, but it's a little bit too simple in my opinion. It could benefit from more complexity,  a user interface overhaul, and some higher resolution sprites. Also, the new game+ mechanic is relatively boring since the game doesn't appear to have any new content and only marginally increases in difficulty each time. I appreciate the Linux support, but I don't think the price justifies the content at this point.			"

												This game is cool. This is a fairly simple platformer rogue-like and it is plenty of fun especially for the price tag. I may only have a couple hours of play time as of writing this but I played plenty before adding it to this account. This is a pretty well balanced game that is easy to pick up and play with little learning to do. it guides you with some tips as you work your way through the first level without stopping you to make you read them. They just kind of pop up and fade out telling you what all you can do. So you can either glance at the tips or just ignore them and learn as you go. If you finish a game in the standard mode there is also a game+ mode with increased difficulty.			"

												The Dungeoning is a solid starting point for what could potentially be an absolutely fantastic game. There is nothing new or inventive here.. just time tested mechanics combined with the ever popular medival fantasy feel. I've had a few dozen runs now and its starting to get boring for me, however i dont see that negatively because there is so much potential for growth in this game. Off the top of my head there are many more time tested addins the developer could put into this title with little effort in order to increase the fun factor exponentially.  Beware, if you're a frugal gamer who wants bang for their buck.. this may not satisfy you when you consider the price, however as i said previously, this game has amazing potential. I definitely recommend this game if you're looking to scratch a specific roguelike fantasy grind game itch.			"

												In the world where there are many rogue-likes to choose from, The Dungeoning is on the lower end.  I own and play many, such as Nuclear Throne, Runers, Magicite, and Rogue Legacy.  Although this game is a couple bucks cheaper than the others, it's not as nearly as interesting as any of them.  Runs are too heavily based on chest drops.  If you are unable to come up with a good one, the games becomes incredibly brutal.  With all rogue-likes, there will be a good amount of how successful you are with what is given to you, but at least with the others it feels like skill plays a much larger role in how well you do in compared to this game.If you need a good rogue-like, I suggest you look elsewhere.

												Maybe if this game was $2 I would not have considered it a waste of money. However for $8 you get a very basic and repetitive game. No not repetitive like the addicting Rogue Legacy or Binding of Isaac, those games atleast had boss fights and unlockables to keep it interesting. All this game has is every couple of levels you will see a new type of mob (exciting stuff). Despite other reviews mentioning the challenge and difficulty of this game, It was surprisingly easy after about 10 minutes of adapting to the combat style. It also helps that at anytime you can pause the game to munch down on food for health Skyrim style.In short, if you are into mind numbingly simple and repetitive games like 'Legend of Dungeon', you might find this game good for killing some time, otherwise I would look elsewhere.

												The Dungeoning is a rather simple platformer roguelike written in java.Pros:- Lovely graphics- Roguelike elements (procedural generation, perm death)- Exploding barrels!- Good level generation, so far all levels were funCons:- Only one class- No information on what does upgrading stats after leveling up does (which is very important to know in this kind of games)- You can't sell items to the shopkeepers, you can only buy from them, and you can't check description of shop items- You can't check stats of equipable items such as weapons, shields, rings, etc. You only get a small description text- You have to use two buttons to shuffle between your weapons, which sucks when you have a bunch of different weaponsOverall it's a fun little game. It does have some fun and interesting mechanics such as exploding barrels, having to use your bow and slingshot to destroy them from afar to get loot without hurting/killing yourself.While the game doesn't let you pick a class, your character can use swords, bows, slingshot, magic wands (to shoot magic, duh) and you can upgrade stats to build a character the way you want.

												The gameplay feels very solid and the music is great aside from on floor 3 where it randomly shuts off every time.Stat progression feels very bland and making the stats more important could really help spice up the game since right now they feel almost pointless. Item requirements or perhaps something like skills that are associated with certain weapons unlocking when a certain stat is high enough would be great.There needs to be a mechanic added to discard / sell old weapons in order to make the prev/next weapon functionality usable. The way it is now they build up so fast that it makes the function pointless.Unfortunately, being unable to progress and having to worry about the game crashing every time you beat a floor makes it very frustrating and unplayable for me.

												As a big fan of Rogue Legacy, Binding of Issac and other addictive perma-death action platformers, I find this to be a perfectly fine addition to that library.  After changing the default controls and getting used to play, it was a comparable experience to the best of it's category.  I enjoy the control sensitivity, easy and ability to save mid-dungeon dive.  Not sure how deep or interesting the level design will get but the bosses, equipment and combat so far are cool.  After an hour: I dig it. If it's the same play in hour 3, I'm done.  Let's hope for more diverse abilities/spells/mobs/hazards/puzzles/things to destroy and not a broken random level generator - we shall see.			"

												Kinda disappointed. The good: The atmosphere is kinda like Unepic, which is always fun. Medieval. Nice lighting effects, particle effects, blood spatters, treasure chests, etc.. The bad: Character movement doesn't really feel right, almost like skating just so you'll accidentally bump into that next monster around the corner or falling ceiling block. Maybe I'm just more adjusted to games that aren't trying so hard to get you killed. There's no ""save and exit"" option. What if you're just tired of playing? Is it roguelike because it's supposed to be roguelike or is it because they couldn't figure out how to store character and inventory data? There are only 16 levels with 4 variations. You can't destroy traps, even with explosives. It's difficult to tell which item/weapon is more powerful. Sure you can attack boxes, plants, etc.. to test swords, but it's very hard to tell just exactly what rings do, and their descriptions don't help much. Neither do the not-so-helpful abbreviations.There's not really any point to spending your levels on anything other than defense.  At the end is a big sparkly chest with a trophy in it. You unlock new game+. I doubt I'll ever want to finish that. It seemed like it was a little more difficult, but I can't see any point in playing through again. Bottom Line: There's nothing here to keep me coming back. It might keep you busy for 2 hours, but it will ultimately feel like a hollow and unrewarding effort.If you want a more RPG-like side-scrolling game, then you might prefer Unepic. If you'd rather throw a few minutes of your life away while feeling completely unrewarded, then go ahead with this game. It wouldn't be bad at $2, but $5.99 is a ripoff, which is what I paid. It's too bad Steam doesn't offer refunds. Other notes: Keys. What's the point with all these keys? What if I run out? Will I be unable to move on? I hope there's at least one on each level. But really the keys seem mostly pointless unless there's always at least one per level in an attempt to make you get the key before moving on.Edit: I did run out of chest keys, but I believe there is always a door key on every level.

												This game is basic fun, distilled down to simple yet engaging play with no story filler, no stat filler, and no loot filer. It does not take too long to get good; there is a bit of learning early on and only a little in a slow pace a bit later on with new monsters, environment obstacles. traps, etc. However, once I discovered how to cope with the monsters and the mechanics of the game I really felt motivated to keep playing. I kept cringing before entering each new exit because I figured, oh it's going to ramp in difficulty for sure now. Yet while the monsters do get tougher and the dungeons get bigger after about 5 or so levels with each change including updated environment graphics and new monsters populating an expanding randomly generated dungeon each time, it doesn't feel like it's being too cheap or too random. My guess is that the developer played his game. A lot. This might sound like a stupid thing to write, of course game developers play their own games, but I have a feeling that the dev of The Dungeoning loved and played his game with as much humility and excitement as required to make a very good, fair, and most importantly repeatedly fun, game that will keep players coming back.It's not all perfect of course, and yes, there are some pointless things that occur; like rooms that are just empty, with no rhyme or reason, but those are easily tolerated because it's fun to play. However, I did not find a room chock full of high powered monsters. Everything, monsters, chests, loot, health, potions, etc. was sort of on this slow pace which made everything much more tolerable to a casual player like myself. You aren't overwhelmed with new weapons and armor, quite the contrary I found very little of those upgrades throughout my sessions thus far, but I really like that aspect. Too often rogue-like or rogue-lite games just copy the original rogue, or each other to the point where it becomes so predictable and boring when it comes to loot management and figuring out which piece of gear is better than which, this game is not weighed down by that kind of thing at all. Instead, it focuses on exploring the dungeons, learning how to stay alive by avoiding or killing monsters in the way, and finding the next exit. Movement in this game is solid and the platformer side of things is not at all difficult. The combat and inventory is shallow, but it's deep enough to make it not as trivial and the RPG stats and leveling have a direct impact on the outcome of the game. There are no fluff stats, it's all related to the game somehow. I find this a breath of fresh air as the game doesn't try to do all things but it pays homage to and definitely uses the RPG bits and pieces (attributes, leveling, derived stats like HP, MP, and stamina) very well. I've not completed new game+, I made it to level 15 though and just read in the community that there are only 16 levels total. It took me around 2 hours to reach level 15, and I don't have that much experience with the game yet. I can see a full pass through all 16 levels by a good player taking about 45 minutes to an hour, and I can't speak to NG+ yet.Overall, The Dungeoning is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a light, platformer with player advancement, and mostly-fair and fun randomly generated dungeons to explore and conquer.

It's worth more than that and should receive more attention.I like the really enjoyable music, good retro graphics, controls that feel very responsive and intuitive.
