												First impressions after just a couple hours:Fast-paced plot sustained by a very good and entertaining combat system keeping you fully engaged.Good dialogue, endearing characters (with nice vaired portraits), excellent sprite art and animations (some occur when you read the dialog, make sure not to hide the one you talk to), nice & subtle references (although I was expecting a tentacle somewhere in that mutagenic jungle). Catchy music.All that spiced with very nice (short) cutscenes.A modern Phantasy Star on stero√Øds ^_^.Inventory system is limited to 3 items (weapon, shield, accessory) per character, granting stats and some specific abilities. Items have only one use per combat but are persistent (not consumed). Abilities are accumulated fast, but available slots to access them are limited.The strategical choices are there and during combat with de-buff/attack/rest sequences in combo with the rest of the party. The start of the game is strong. It looks like it may be the best from Zeboyd so far - not as zany as other titles - let's see if the plot and mid-game holds up. I hope to see more world-building.Too bad I've got to go to work tomorrow morning...			"

												I am a big fan of all previous Zeboyd games, so I snagged this one on release.Game looks, sounds, and plays quite well. The combat and story are both interesting. Animated cutscenes are charming in their deliberately limited style. Lots of nods to previous Zeboyd games and references to others (Chrono Trigger especially), but they aren't in-your-face wacky HA-HA LOOKIT MY REFERENTIAL HUMOR. It is classy enough.Unfortunately, as of this review the game is riddled with bugs. I've seen idle sprites overlaying walking animations, battles in which the UI fails to reappear following an enemy turn (gotta force-quit the game and start from your last save), and I even found an NPCs whose dialog was ""placeholder"". Disappointing.There is a lot to like here. Expect this to change to a positive review once the game is patched, but for now I recommend others to hold off on purchasing Cosmic Star Heroine. In the meantime check out Cthulhu Saves The World!			"

												Definitely worth a look if you have any interest at all in ""classic"" JRPG's.  If you're familiar with Zeboyd Games, you know that they're very good at making turn-based combat interesting and more than the minor inconvenience you mindlessly mash through while in-between boss fights.  The different characters, skills, and items work in harmony to give you a wide range of ways to handle fights and offer enough options for future playthroughs.The gist of combat in CSH is that all attacks are limited to one use but can be recharged by defending.  Items are are limited to one use per fight but are infinite.  Go wild using items, item hoarders!   There are also ""programs"" that essential act as switchable armors that also add another layer of single use skills.  Some of the new touches include a hyper mode that rotates throughout fights for each character.  Whenever a character hits hyper mode, they get increased attack for that action.  By smart linking of skills, items and timing, you can launch attacks that can do triple or more damage.  There's also an ongoing ""style"" percentage that mostly plays into your characters not dying when falling below zero HP.  As long as your style is over a certain amount, you can survive an attack with negative hp and can then revive yourself as long as you bring HP back into positive by the character's next turn.  It's a cool feature, especially since there are offensive skills that only work while in this ""desperation"" mode, so it's not strictly a scramble to restore your hp scenario.The visuals are very good and better than I expected.  All the character sprites are well done and there's a lot of variations to the many NPC's.  There's also a decent mix of color palettes between cyberpunk-styled areas and the more colorful nature areas.  There's even a large amount of  short Sega CD style cutscenes, which was a bit of a surprise.The soundtrack is pretty catchy, especially the battle and boss themes, which is good since you'll be hearing them a lot.The wring is...inoffensive.  The previous Zeboyd games didn't hold back in making game references, and there's a lot of there, but they're generally used in a smarter manner.  If video game references makes you want to make an angry forums post, you'll probably be annoyed, but like I said, they're mostly inoffensive and occasionally funny and you should know to expect them by now if you're played any Zeboyd game before CSH.  The actual story is nothing special but the game is tightly paced and constantly keeps you moving forward; CSH is the rare game that respects your time and and there's little to any filler here.  If you sit down and play for an hour, you feel like you actually accomplished something and that's rather rare for most games, let alone rpg's.  It evens starts up to the main menu without telling you the developer name and every piece of middleware used in the creation of the game and I thank them for that.There are four difficulties and they're changeable at any time.  I played on the third hardest difficulty and it served as a good challenge early on, though by the halfway point, I felt that I figured out the battle system enough to handle most fights without too much trouble.  If I ever play CSH again, it'd probably be on the hardest difficulty, since from the little I tried of it late in the game, it came the closest to capturing the early game feel of making all your battle decisions feel important.The only major downside I have is that the game is still somewhat buggy as of April 15th.  I haven't ran into many, but I have had to reset a couple of times due to them.  Luckily you can save whenever you want, so I'd recommend doing so.  Other issues I have is the default movement speed is set to walk instead of run and there's no toggle to change it.  Stop doing this game devs; I'm going to want to be running 99.9% of the time, make that the default so I'm not holding down a button for most of my gameplay time.  The other is the character portraits are blown up too much and suffer for it, Chahn and Z'xorv in particular.  They should be closer to their native resolution.  Also, the game should default to continue instead of new game on the main menu once you've started a game.  Last, there are some aspects of the character menu that a bit clunky.In short, CSH is a must-play if you're interested in an updated and fresh look at the traditional JRPG experience.  It claims inspiration from such games as Phantasy Star and Chrono Trigger and it successfully blends them together in a fun, tightly paced game.			"

												Gotta beat this dead horse:If you enjoy RPGs from the late 16-bit era, this is a no-brainer purchase.You've got the story tone and humor of the Lunar games, the base-building of Suikoden, Chrono-trigger inspired combat (enhanced with the depth and lessons learned from Penny Arcade 3 & 4), a Phantasy Star-esque setting, and a Sega CD/PC Engine-style of presentation - anime-style cutscenes and all.The soundtrack (again by Hyperduck Soundworks) is stellar and is chock full of catchy tunes that ooze 80s cyberpunk, with some atmospheric tracks and pulse-pumping battle themes for good measure.  The game's Indie Rock Band playable character even has a fully voiced track that would be right at home in an episode of Bubblegum Crisis.  It's all great stuff, at least in my opinion.To get to the gameplay side of things: as the bullet point on the Steam Store Page says, the pacing is brisk - areas don't outstay their welcome but aren't 100% linear, either.  There's always a chest or three tucked in a hard-to-see nook or behind a switch-lowered barrier.  You can save literally any time you can open the menu.  There is no penalty for getting ""wiped out"" and losing a battle (other than the time it takes to restart/retry said battle). You can also change the difficulty at any time you can open the menu, as well.   There are 4 difficutly settings, ranging from ""I'm just here for the story"" to ""even the devs have trouble with this one"".  This allows you to adjust things up or down on the fly if you find that battles are either too easy, or maybe that one fight (or Boss) keeps getting the better of you.Combat is outstanding.  Each battle is a bit like a puzzle you have to solve using character abilities that synergize with each other or exploit enemy weaknesses.  But to be specific:Turn based.  A bar on the far right shows you the exact order that each combatant  will act (both your own Party Members and your foes).  Each character has HP, a Style level (given as a %), and Hyper squares that fill one per round.Each character has a set of up to 8 Skills.  A few of the weaker, basic attacks can be used over and over again, but most can only be used once before they are ""greyed out"" and become unusable.  There is no MP or anything like it.  The way to re-activate your disabled or used up abilities is to use your Defend command, which refreshes everything you've used.Each character can have additional abilities gained from their equipped Shield (this game's version of Armor).  These Programs are once-per-battle and do not recharge if you Defend.  Items are much the same but are shared by the party as a whole - so anyone can use any item, but then it's used up and no one else can use it until the next battle.Most abilities give you some % of Style.  Style increases the amount of damage you do and allows you survive otherwise fatal blows if it's above 50% (higher for tougher difficulties).Each round, the character gains a Hyper Point and a blue box under their HP bar fills in.  When all the boxes are full, the character enters Hyper Mode for a single round; while in Hyper Mode, damage is doubled and the chance of inflicting any status ailment is greatly increased.  Each character has a different set of Hyper Boxes, meaning that Hyper turns very rarely overlap and are instead spaced out somewhat evenly as combat progresses.I'm leaving out a few bits (Desperation mode) but the gist of it is this: in each combat, the key to winning is to ""line up"" your best attacks (or heals) with each character's Hyper round.  A character in Hyper mode who has been buffed by an ally and is exploiting an enemy weakness will deal SEVERAL TIMES as much damage as their basic attack would.You need to ""sneak in"" buffs and heals and ability-recharging Defend commands during the rounds while Hyper Mode is still charging, then unleash the fury on the proper turn.  This is pretty much mandatory in the 2 tougher difficulties.  In any case, spamming the basic repeatable attacks won't get you much further than 6 feet under - you need to strategize and think a few turns ahead if you want to be successful, and the game rewards you if you line your abilities up properly.  It's a blast and ensures that each fight feels meaningful and they never become repetitive as you are always learning new abilities and (eventually) have 10 party members in combinations of 4 combatants at a time, meaning your options are always expanding and changing.The story, as I said above, is very much like Lunar or Lunar: Eternal Blue in that there are high stakes and a serious undercurrent, but the snappy dialogue and irreverent banter give the moment-to-moment gameplay a lighthearted feel that balances the darker aspects of the main threat and villains.There are some niggles, to be sure.  No option to change key bindings, issues with the game crashing when changing resolutions, issues with battles sometimes freezing (the poison status ailment is involved somehow), but honestly it shouldn't detract much from your enjoyment as long as you remember to save often (which you can, since you can save after virtually every battle).  I'm willing to bet most of this will be updated or patched out in the coming months in any case.Kudos to Bill and Robert and the boys at Hyperduck - this is an amazing accomplishment and a hell of a lot of fun to anyone who pines for the days of Phantasy Star IV and Chrono Trigger.

NOTE: This recommendation does come with some caveats relating to remaining game bugs as of V1.04 released on April 14th.  The game is completable, but there are issues that can cause softlocking and more minor technical issues that do need to be addressed. As of this writing the devs are still working to patch these things up. This paragraph will be removed once it's determined that the game is in top shape.REVIEW: Cosmic Star Heroine is Zeboyd Games jumping full force into a project well beyond the scope of anything they've released prior.  More characters, more storyline, a startling jump in graphical and audio quality, and taking a stab at a more seriously toned narrative.  CSH's presentation is that of a later-release SNES/Genesis game on steroids, and there's enough unique assets and environments to look at that things never get old.  Oh, and the animated cutscenes are pretty rad.  The game largely succeeds with most of what it sets out to accomplish, featuring a robust and more strategic take on the JRPG battle systems of old that forces you to indulge in the variety of skills each character possesses in order to succeed  Skills are almost all single-use, and the only way to get them back is to spend a turn defending/recharging, so there's no way you're gonna be hammering an auto-attack button to mash your way through.  You'll always want to be planning two or three turns ahead to know when you'll be having a character recharge while others continue their assault and supporting one another.  The toughest encounters in the game, normal mobs and bosses alike, may require two or more retries until you can find a skillset or combination of characters that works for you, but all characters feel balanced enough that you won't always HAVE to have the most overpowered characters or skills at your disposal.  All-in-all, it's Zeboyd's most engaging combat system, and I hope to see it expanded on in future titles.  At its best, CSH's difficulty curve (played on Heroine) and overall balance feels very on par with many of Falcom's titles where you're going to be working to eke out each victory, though a level or two might make you sweat a little less.  Where CSH falls short unfortunately is its storyline, which feels like it's the unfortunate victim of the devs wanting to focus on a briskly paced/save anywhere/never wasting your time ideal.  The game's story kind of just whooshes by without much fanfare and is mostly people barking at you and telling you where to go next. There's never really any time to connect with the characters beyond what's happening at the moment, and given how well-written some of Zeboyd's previous work has been (On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 comes to mind), it's really unfortunate that CSH's characters and story never really get much of a chance to shine.  That said, I had a good time with  Cosmic Star Heroine. It's the engaging combat, excellent soundtrack, fun character designs, and gorgeous visuals that kept bringing me back even if the story really fails to deliver.			"

Cosmic Star Heroine feels like how I always wanted JRPGs to feel like. 	Where I'm coming from: Male, Age 29. Favorite relatable games: FFVI, VII, VIII, Deus Ex   The pacing is snappy, but doesn't skimp on exposition. We've seen similar stories before, but it's really about the presentation. The characters are endearing and unique, and each one fills a nice little niche in the cyber punk dystopia they inhabit.  There's a good amount of cutscenes that have a nice hand drawn quality to them. The art style didn't take long to grow on me.  It's very respectful of your time, not grindy. Game Over? Just press X and you're instantly back at the beginning of the battle. There's no pointless random encounters for miniscule amounts of XP; each battle is a chance to try out different strategies. Personally I died a lot until I started to respect the attention the battle system demanded. Oh... and you can save anywhere.  You start with full HP with all abilities refreshed at the beginning of every battle. If I'd known about this before playing, I'd probably hate the idea on paper, but really it workes well and serves to put the focus on the strategy of how and when you use your abilites. So far, no character fills the singular, sterotypical roll of healer, tank, DPS, etc....It's more about playing the long game - am I going to have Chahn use the abilites that set her up to unleash massive damage on all targets two turns from now, or do I leave that to someone else and play defensive, having her use shields and heals?I'd also like to mention that I haven't encounted any of the bugs listed in other reviews in my 2.5 hours of playing. You have to relaunch after setting a new resolution, but I don't think that's a bug.			"

It's been consistently amusing and fun so far.  There are some minor bugs in the release build which I've reported to Zeboyd, but they don't detract from the game in any meaningful wayNostalgia hoooo.			"

												This game is amazing, why am I giving it a negative review? Easy..... it is a bug filled mess of a game. And I don't mean random crashes or anything. I mean menus that bug out, getting stuck against walls permanantly, I froze the game because I killed an enemy with poison. It's like they didn't even test the game. So until they fix these bugs (and there are a lot of them) I wouldn't recomend this game. Aside from that though, the game is fun, and I'm glad you can save at any time.... because you need it when it breaks every two steps.			"

												Zeboyd did a great job with Cthulhu Saves the World and the Penny Arcade games.Cosmic Star Heroine blows their other games out of the water.The animation and attention to detail are amazing, the cutscenes are evocative of 16-bit greats without being beholden to their limitations, and the battle system has the challenge and nuance that we've been led to expect from Zeboyd. If you liked their other games, you need this one. If you didn't, you still owe it to yourself to check this one out.			"

												After playing for quite a few hours I am impressed with the amount of characters and the quality of presentation. The music is good, everything in this game is above average and in some cases excellent. I had really high expectations for this game and so far it has mostly delivered, I'm curious if the worlds open up more as of right now things feel quite linear. I'll update this review when I beat the game but if someone were to ask me to buy this game I would say if you like old school RPGs, definitely. I have some minor qualms but nothing that ruins the experience for me, more just how it stacks up to the games I grew up playing as a kid but maybe nostalgia makes me biased, and again my expectations were pretty high. More than worth the money. I understand this review is pretty vague but I don't want to spoil too much.  I have played a lot of RPGs and this is definitely up there with some of the best and for an indie developer, it's probably the best effort I have seen so far. Keeping in mind I have played all the greats...Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy series, Lunar, Grandia, Breath Of Fire, etc. etc.			"

												It hurts to thumb down a Zeboyd title, but the stakes, expectations, and even the price were much higher this time around than in games past. It's not necessarily fair to penalize a game for the length of its development cycle... but the supposedly final retail build we got after numerous long delays feels more like a full beta. In particular the game closing when you change the resolution at the title screen and a potentially game breaking bug (thank god I cycled my saves and only lost about 20 minutes) a mere 2-3 hours in just completely boggle the mind.That said... I kept playing the game despite continuing to run into random instances where it would hang at the start of battle, and still managed to have an OK time. So hopefully after one patch for gameplay (no run toggle killed my thumb as I marathoned the title, but apparently they're going to patch that in) and another for typos (can't fix those gaping plot holes though...) I'll be able to turn this red thumb into a blue one. TLDR: 7/10 if you can avoid the bugs, 9/10 if you're a Zeboyd fan.			"

												Honestly I don't like retro games, 16-bit RPG and the like. But I like this game. Battles feel enjoyable and strategic, they don't feel repetitive or grindy. Also grinding is not mandatory, without grinding I can breeze through Heroine (Hard) level.IMHO this game probably has the most fun combat mechanics out of all JRPGs on Steam. There's alot of customization you can have (with multiple party choices, ability choices, equipment choices, and item choices). The item mechanic is great, you have a lot of items but you can only bring some to battles, and they have infinite use (but can only be used once per battle unless you couple it with skill). This is a good thing.. how many times do you play an RPG where you rarely use ""elixirs"" because you were saving it and ended up with stockpiles of them, only to use a few on the final boss?			"

												Pros:- Even non-boss combats are interesting! Since the party is always fully healed at the beginning of every battle, any battle can be tuned to be very challenging -- and they often are!- Interesting combat system that rewards planning ahead a turn or two.- The plot doesn't waste any time having interesting stuff happen.- Combat is quick and snappy -- no excessively long animations.- Works great with an Xbox 360 gamepad.- When you pick up a new piece of gear, the game briefly explains what it's good for -- no need to dig into the menu to look that up.- Great soundtrack.Cons:- Controls can't be remapped (but the developer has said this will be addressed in a patch.)- D-pad input from my non-Xbox-360 gamepad (a Pokken Tournament USB controller, which generally works great with PC games) isn't interpreted correctly.  (Hopefully this will be patched.)- A few other rough edges that I expect will be patched.Recommended!			"

It's definitely an indie game, so don't expect a AAA experience like you'd get from SquareEnix, but outside of that, it's astonishing. You can totally see where the influences are drawn from Chrono Trigger and Phantasy Star, but even outside of that, CSH stands on its own well.The battle system is really fun, and I hope there's a future series of games that Zeboyd does with iterations of this one.

Product received for free
 Disclosure: I am a Kickstarter backer.  Do you like JRPGs but hate confusing stories, unnecessary bloat, and boring random encounters? Get this game!  PROS  No random battles - enemies exist on the map. No grinding  - you can grind if you want, via the BATTLE command in the menu. Fun, strategic combat - assign eight skills per character. In battle, most skills are one-use, but can be recharged by defending for one turn. Hyper and Style systems, and shield abilities add even more strategy. Great music - suitably cyberpunk. Obligatory awesome victory music. Beautiful sprite work and cutscenes. About 15-20 hours long for 100%. No bloat. Simple fetch and dialogue puzzles. Optional bosses and small 'mini-dungeons' Save anywhere via the menu. Also, HP, status effects, and items are reset after each battle (items are single-use per battle). Seriously guys, Zeboyd gets it CONS  Can't change gear of characters not in your current party, which is a problem at your base (as you walk around by yourself), or if a character leaves for a while Minor fixable bug - the only one I found was a bug that blanked-out a character's ability list. Fixed itself by closing and re-opening the menu. No Steam Achievements (YMMV) - Devs will patch these in, according to Steam Discussion.Cosmic Star Heroine is another great game from Zeboyd Games. All killer, no filler. 9/10 Edited 22/4/17 16:46 for formatting issues "

												FYI: I'm not an expert on the Phantasy Star series, nor do I have much experience with the 90's RPG's (except Final Fantasies, and some older Enix RPG's like Terranigma, etc.). Also I've only played this game for 5hrs, so far (and I'm hooked!)I totally love the art-style of this game. It looks really nice. The cutscenes may look a little different, though but they still look nice and do a nice job adding to the athmosphere.The next thing I really like is the soundtrack! It has some guitar influences and it also adds to the mood quite good. I hope that I'll be able to buy the soundtrack!The game itself basically seems kinda straight forward. At least the first 5-6 hours are.You're running/walking around and go through battle after battle and read lots of story related stuffs (mostly conversations). The map design so far isn't confusing, meaning you won't get lost that easily. Still you'll be able to find hidden Stuff. Also you sometimes get to do some small ""quests"" which offer a reward (either credits or equipment).So far I haven't seen a ""real"" world map, only a city map which resembles to be a world map, therefore you won't be able to stray off too far. Given the fact that this games main feature is the story line, that's fine.The battles are turn based and require you to use your skills in a sensible way. Especially at the beginning (Hard difficulty) you get into real trouble, if you mess around too much. After a while it gets easier, though (new party members, new skills, etc.) To successfully win the battles you have to think ahead, when you will use the different skills, because most of them can't be spammed. Most skills are ""depleted"" after one use but if you take a defensive stance for one turn, you'll get to use them, again.One thing that wasn't clear for me at the beginning was the item-system. Usually in rpg's most items deplete if you use them but in this game, you can use once per battle. They won't be lost after using them. But to emphasize the tactical part of the game, you're forced to choose which items you'll be using in battle, meaning at the beginning of the game you may only equip 3 items. Between the battle, though, you may choose your loadout as you will.Later on you'll be able to add more than 3 items to your loadout.Also you'll be able to choose your party members, once you've progressed far enough through the story (haven't been able to do so, yet but there's a menu for that).The characters are quite charming and offer a great variety of different skills (which btw. you can choose up to 6 for your current loadout per character)About Bugs:I've encountered only 2 bugs so far:- I've got stuck once in a particular spot (Interior of a base)- One boss summons minions which grab and shackle characters. Sometimes a second minion grabbed a already grabbed character, which lead to odd behavior if the first minion was killed.Haven't been able to to determine other bugs but the developers already have rolled out patches, already, so I wouldn't worry too much about bugs ;)So far I can recommend this game. It's fun to play and the story is interesting. Once I've played this game long enough, I might edit this review.EDIT:A few more bugs occured:-Once the game kinda froze in the middle of a battle. Had to reload a savegame.-More map errors, luckily nothing too serious, since you can save the game and the reload it.So far it seems like the developer is actively fixing bugs and is present in the steam forums.04.16.2017: PLEASE READ:Although there are relatively few bugs in the first few hours, they grow in numbers later on.If you don't want to play with bugs, you probably should wait a few weeks before purchasing the game.If you can live with some bugs (most of them can be ""fixed"" by reloading a save game) you can give this game a try.Despite the bugs I'm having a blast with this game and the dev is and has been working on patches.

												Solid RPG, everyone's said stuff, you know what it is. Here's what draws me in, this game on the hardest difficulty is in its essence an incredibly complex puzzle game that is immensely rewarding to play. Defeating the first boss is a real treat.			"

												Absolutely gorgeous retro rpg. The cross between phantasy star and chrono trigger is immediately apparent. If you have a nostalgic love for nineties square rpgs, this game is definitely worth a look.			"

												I've been a fan of Zeboyd Games since playing Cthulhu Saves the World/Breath of Death VII; their games are inspired by RPGs of old, with the idea of removing a lot of the extra fluff and problems that make the genre notoriously cumbersome, slow and at times, daunting. As such, I have been eagerly awaiting Cosmic Star Heroine since I first heard of it. Retro-JRPG-inspired Indie titles are a dime a dozen, so it becomes a real challenge to find one that stands out. And having played Cosmic Star Heroine, I can say that, for the most part, this game absolutely delivers. Here are my pros and cons of this game as I see it. Note that this is from a playthrough on the Heroine difficulty.Pros: +This game has a superb soundtrack, with numerous memorable and catchy tracks of many different genres, many of which stand out yet never feel out of place. After getting the battle theme stuck in my head, I immediately went to look for where to download the OST, and eagerly await when it goes up live on Steam (and recommend it). Fantastic use of music.+The Battle system is very much distinct and one of the most engaging I've ever played with. As someone who has done speedruns of existing Zeboyd RPGs, one thing I very much enjoy in RPGs is experimenting with combinations and trying to find ways of tinkering with and optimizing combat. In this game, combat is seldom ""Just unload your most powerful techniques and win""; each battle feels as though I have to strategize and adapt, which is very hard to do in an engaging way but is pulled off well here. Combat is less about power and more about timing your actions, where turns in which you are doing damage are only somewhat more important than non-damage turns, having contingency plans for when things go south, and (in my experience) finding synergy between party members with their various equipment skills, abilities, and items. Figuring out winning combitions is very satisfying. Likewise, I much enjoy the removal of disposable items and MP in favor of not having the player fear regretting a decision.+The pacing of CSH is pretty solid. Rather than being full of needlessly long and dramatic cutscenes, drawn out animations and slow sequences, nothing in this game ever drags out. It's conservative enough that it gets its point across in a way that's visually appealing and satisfying, yet quick enough that it doesn't become tiring.+Speaking of visual appeal, this game is very nice to look at. Much of the scenery in this game ranges from beautiful and lush, to mechanical and dark, making each scenario distinct and a treat to the eyes. The spritework is clean and the pixel art is superb and quite pretty. And the animated cutscenes are lovingly crafted and a blast from the past. This game knows what it is trying to present and does it impeccably.+No random encounters, and many encounters are skippable (though it leaves you underleveled if you aren't careful). I always find this to be a plus.+The writing among NPCs and character exchanges are goofy and amusing. I found myself talking to more NPCs than I do in 99% of RPGs just to see what random things some of them say. If there's one thing I enjoy about Zeboyd Games works, its that they have a touch of humor sorely lacking from the RPG medium. While some jokes or lines fall flat, the majority of them are somewhere between mildly amusing and actually pretty funny.+The heroine difficulty is just right. Here and there are some fights which I really had to think about how to go about winning, some of which walled me a good while. The game is also quite forgiving, allowing you to retry battles and save anywhere, and even with understanding of the combat system I made enough mistakes to be punished for them without it feeling unfair.+There are numerous unique and enjoyable mechanics to this game. For instance, having characters be able to go below 0 HP and either do a desperation move or get one chance to heal (a reduced amount of HP) is a nice touch and even plays into strategy as some characters and abilities utilize this risky mechanics. Status effects work on bosses (THANK YOU!), but seldom in a way that makes a boss truly ""easy"", and those play into strategy as well. I've never had a game where I actually found a use for an ability like ""make bosses weaker to this element"" until this one. +The menus are very intuitive and easy to follow, a trait which a surprising amount of games get wrong.Cons:-The number one issue with this game right now is one the developers are working on: it has some areas which need polish. There are at least a few typos, improper textboxes, and bugs. While some of them are amusing and others are minor oversights, there are a few which are a major hindrance to the game. For instance, I have encountered soft-locks in which I was forced to reset the game a total of around 5 times, and a couple other glitches such as a character remaining at 0 HP after I hit retry. A few other bugs have been reported, and while it is getting updates, for the time being I would suggest both being patient and making sure to save frequently (save time is almost instant, which is a big plus). If this is too offputting, I suggest waiting until they are fully ironed out. -The game lacks much in the way of exploration. I know it's a limited game, but it ends up being a bit linear for a game advertised as ""explore three planets!"" Now I've yet to get to any bonus content and whatnot, but it's a fairly small game. It's also on the shorter side, around 15 hours, but considering both the price point and the fact that those are 15 pretty solid hours, I'm not too shaken up over its length.-The game could use a manual. The stats in this game include things like ""Cunning"" and ""Hackitude"", which aren't self-explanatory and if you miss early game tutorials on how these work (or forget), there are no readily available resources for teaching you how some of these mechanics work and it can be confusing. In the coming days I'm sure there will be community guides and the like, but I think having a built in glossary or library which explains terms would benefit the playerbase considerably. -The script itself is very enjoyable but I can't say too much about the rest. While the story is passable for ""interesting enough to keep the player invested"", the characters have minimal focus or depth, and the main character (Alyssa) is not a very deep or interesting character herself. This is more of an RPG you play for what the characters have to say in dialogue exchanges (and for the gameplay) moreso than who the characters are or how they develop. So if you're more into character-driven narratives or deep, thought provoking storylines, this might not be the RPG for you.-The character portraits are the weakest part of the game visually. Most of them are all right, and they're far and away an improvement from BoD/CStW, but a few faces are a bit...off-putting. Not to uncanny valley levels, but they could still be better. Inevitably, CSH is going to get comparison to its inspirations. It resembles a pastiche of Chrono Trigger and Phantasy Star, so it certainly is not the most original game. But to dismiss it as simply ""trying to be those games"" is not a wholly accurate judgment because it plays functionally quite different from both of them. There are a lot of design choices that clearly come from someone who has a lot of experience playing games in this genres, knowing many dos and donts and player frustrations, and then built a game around what they wanted to see in an RPG. And for the most part, this game definitely succeeds. The 13 or so hours I've played of this game so far are 13 of the most consistently fun hours I've had playing an RPG in ages. And hey, there's a difference between being unoriginal and being uninspired. And this is certainly not an uninspired game. What it lacks in overall originality, it makes up for in execution by being fun to play.			"

												I seldomly put up reviews but sometimes I feel it to be needed. Cosmic Star Heroine is one such case. I had no idea it was coming out so i was surprised when I looked in release lists and it had come out on the exact day I was looked. I instantly bought it because I liked Cthulu saves the world and was mostly curious. I have now finished the game and I can wholeheartedly say that I like every single aspect of this game, I would be hard pressed to mention something I truly disliked.The characters are amazing and all of the feel pretty¬¥much unique and quirky. They are designed incredibly well, I felt myself being amazed at the visuals at almost every turn, from the cook slightly animated scenes to the sheer coolness of the normal sprites, everything just felt great.The combat is a pretty regular turn based system but with the hyper mechanic and loads of differenct characters and abilities to choose from, it never felt as if it stagnated, I was always changing stuff up and shifting characters.It never felt as if the game dwelled too long in certain areas, I can admit I got confused as what to do in certain places, but that fixed itself by just talking to random people.At first I was confused about the story, then it took off and while I kind of knew where it was all leading, I still felt encouraged to know more because everything else just pulled it so hard.I did hear people have experienced a lot of bugs, I didn't experience one, but I felt like I had to point it out.Zeboyd Games have shown me that they can create something really cool three times now and I am eagerly awaiting what else lies in store for the future.Cosmic Star Heroine gets a huge recommendation for me, one of my favourites of 2017 so far, if not THE favourite. If you are even the least bit interested, try it.			"

TL;DR:DEFINITELY give it a FAIR chance! This is my favorite retro-esk JRPG of ALL time. And I played pretty much every single one. BUGS ARE MOSTLY FIXED NOW! If you liked ""Pokemon games"", ""Cthulhlu Saves The World"" and ""Chrono Trigger"" you'll certainly like this.Like I said,it feels a lot like a mixture of pokemon (set amount of skills) with a fluent battlesystem of chrono trigger in a 90s futuristic saturday morning actioncartoon setting. The enemies in the game are scripted and don't respawn and they appear often very weak in the beginning of the game itself and in the battles which might put some people off. What many didn't realise is that this is due to typical (very nice and useful) features of Zeboyd like:- ""Style""-system: Pretty much the damagemultiplier of ""Chtulhu Saves The World"". Allies and enemies receive an increase of their percentual multiplier with almost (few exeptions) each attack each round which makes long and especially boss battles engaging and tough at times (I'm looking at you gunmancy trial >.>). also its nicely implemented and fooled around with in several ways (extra style under certain conditions, style steal, very dangerous style-down attacks of enemies, BURST-attacks that increase in power in proportion to your current style and so on...) - Menubattles: If you're like me and love to grind your characters you might find scripted encounters disheartening in your overall experience at first (Dragon Age origin <.<). However Zeboyd found the perfect solution. Like in CSTW you can engage battles in the main menu. As often as you like in every area you encounter enemies. This helpes a lot when you want to explore the area more rather than battling fiends all day long and still be able to grind as much as you like when you want that.- No autosave BUT you can save ANYTIME! ANYWHERE! (exept in battles)-Recharge system: (haven't seen this in CSTW and Breath of Death before) You can have up to 7 skills and one recharge ability with has its own effect. Each skill can only be used only once unless it's reusable. This forces you to think more stategicly especially in combination of weaknesses of enemies your so called ""Hyperstate"" (doubles damage) and your timing in regards to healing abilities as well. This even applies to items as well. It's very balanced, thought through and prevents you from spamming the same skill over and over again (which I am guilty of as well in the past).The atmosphere is very dense and intriguing, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! The writing of Zeboyd games is known to be rather silly and funny in a ridicouling way which does have its charm however in this games this has been reduced to fit the tone of the setting more and it was the absolutely right choice to make.There are still LOTS of references to older games, you can even recruit partymembers of CSTW and 90s shows. The charcters are not on a ""The walking dead"" level of deep and detailed of course but unique enough to be believable and fun to play.There are two aspects that are offputting for some people which should also be mentioned here real quick:- It's a linear storyline. You can branch off here and there to recruit new mebers for your team, doing little ""bring me this, kill that""-quests. Very marginal things, so if you are looking forward to playing lots of sidequests and experiencing a non-linear offbraching world, you will be disappointed in that very aspect.- Slow battleengagement: What I mean but that is that the battles are very easy at first which makes you rush through the story in the beginning. Engagement of YOU as a player in the battle. The skills are limited and most enemies are killed with the first hit. THIS CHANGES LATER ON. TRUST. ME. But this problem can be helped if you change the difficulty to a high one. Fortunately, you can do that anytime in the game so just set it back if it gets in the way of your storyprogression.To me personally, these negative points are deminishingly irrelevant in the big scheme of the game and I enjoy every storybased game wether it is linear of not as long as it's written well and engrossing. The 9 yo self infront of TV watching action cartoons all morning would gotten a heartattack of joy, Im certain of that.So you see, I am absolutely rapturous, elated, stunned, just blown away by the game and most of all by the thought that this piece as been developed by TWO. GUYS. I said it in the beginning and I say it again. I love CSH so much. It's the best retro-JRPG I have ever played and I stand by that.‚ô• Pease support Zeboyd Games. Definitely give it a go if what I said evokes your interest. It is worth it!			"

												A fresh take on the JRPG genre that takes classic gameplay elements and makes them far more convenient and interesting. The game's combat takes its queues from Chrono Trigger (with a bit of Grandia). There is no mana or resource management; instead, skills have a set number of uses before requiring the player to ""rest"" or defend in order to regain their use. This makes combat interesting, alongside a system which buffs attacks every n turns (varying based on the character), allowing players to manage their skills wisely and think ahead to determine how best to deal damage or heal their party members. Also, you are fully healed after each fight which allows you to go all-out each time you encounter an enemy; this feature makes combat much less tedious than I have found it to be in other JRPGs, as much as I love the genre.The setting is a mixture between Phantasy Star (less like the single player games and more like Online, IMO) and standard Cyberpunk, at least a few hours in. Perhaps this will change once I get closer to the end, and if so, I will update my review. The writing is very entertaining, characters are likeable and witty, and the setting itself is really interesting. One character that I am quite fond of is a ""Gunmancer"" who summons various guns to help her in combat. Another is a hacker who can literally hack into robotic enemies (of which there are many) to debuff them, deal damage, heal party members, etc. While roles are pretty clearly defined, the fresh take on them and a bit of skill/gear customization makes the game's characterization feel rather deep.One complaint that I will mention is that, at least at the point I am at in the game, there has been no backtracking. While this sounds like a wonderful thing, I mean that I often cannot even leave the screen that I am on to explore an area I just left; sometimes I feel that I have missed things or wanted to talk to someone, but I am unable to as the game pushes me forward constantly. It is not a horrible thing, but it does make it feel as though I am not getting to explore as much as I would like at times. Take this with a grain of salt, as it may change and even if not, I am not that bothered by it- I just wanted to complain about something. :)I am greatly enjoying Cosmic Star Heroine, and I hope that others will give it a shot. I admit that I have been following the game since it was first announced with bated breath, so I may be a bit biased, but I believe it to be worth far more than the $11.99 that it is currently going for.

												As someone who doesn't play a lot of JRPG style games I was a little hesitant to pick this one up (I only have a handful in my library and most of them I have never played).  So far I have only completed the first 2 chapters I am very glad I bought this.As some of the other reviews point out, the flow of the combat and the pacing of the story so far is a little on the quick side, which really appeals to ""non-jrpg'ers"" like me who don't want a long drawn out snail-paced story which requires endless backtracking and grinding.The difficulty level can be adjusted mid-game so that also helps as well.  I left it on default (the 2nd easiest setting) and it feels right for me, it makes it just hard enough so I have to strategize a little in larger fights.I am definitely looking forward to playing the rest of this.

												I'm already in love with this game after a mere 90 minutes. I'm a huge fan of old-school 16 bit-era JRPG's, and i've played damn near every recent homage/throwback/retro version of 16-bit JRPG's that has come out over the past few years. Unfortunately, very few of them actually come close to capturing the same feeling that games like Chrono Trigger and FFIII gave (and continue to give) me. Cosmic Star Heroine, in the little bit that i have played, has already managed to do so. The writing so far has been really good, the graphics and environments are nice, and the character designs have a great style reminiscent of Phantasy Star (which is a huge plus, in my book). Most important of all, however, is the combat system. It is excellent, and has a deceptive amount of depth. There are no Magic Points or Skill Points. Rather, most skills can only be used once in each battle before they are locked off. In order to use them again, you must use your Defensive move, which refreshes all of your skills. This sounds cumbersome and slow, but it is anything but. Battles are actually pretty fast-paced for JRPG standards. There are other interesting aspects as well, such as the Hyper meter; every few turns, your character gets a turn in Hyper Mode, causing any attack or healing that they do in that turn to be significantly amplified. As such, you must plan ahead and strategize when you will use each skill. It adds a great strategic layer to the combat, and you can't just simply spam the same skills over and over. There are also items that can do damage, cause ailments, or heal, that are shared between all party members. These items aren't spent with use, and refresh at the end of each battle, adding yet another layer. Once you get a few party members (which takes no time at all), the combat takes on a wonderful amount of depth . One character, for example, has a skill that causes her next ability to target all enemies (or allies, if it's a heal or buff). So if you know she's going to enter Hyper Mode in 2 turns, you can use that skill, then in the next turn hit the entire enemy party with her most powerful attack (which is usually single target). This may sound simple, but when you have numerous characters in your party and a wealth of skills, items, and abilities at your disposal, it becomes a strategic chess match. You must plan ahead, especially on higher difficulties (i'm playing on hard, and have already had some very tough battles).Definitely check this out if you're a fan of 16-bit era RPG's, or just quality JRPG's in general. I can't wait to play more!(please check out and subscribe to thecrankymessiah.com for reviews, early access impressions, and more!)			"

												CSH is a really cool sci-fi/SPACE ADVENTURES IN SPACE JRPG. Which in itself is already pretty rad, considering fantasy seems to be standard fare for most JRPGs. Anyway, it takes a lot of influence from games like Chrono Trigger. It's got a turn-based combat system, but with its own unique spin on it. There's the Style and Hyper mechanics; Style goes up as you use abilities and increases your damage the more you have of it, and Hyper is a gauge that builds up and gives you a huge damage buff when it's full. But perhaps more notably is the way abilities work. There's no MP or Mana or anything. Instead, you use an ability, and then it gets disabled (unless it's marked as Reusable). In order to reuse your abilities, you have to defend, which refreshes all disabled abilities. This is really cool, because it actually incentivizes defending. All in all, you're basically saving your biggest hit for your Hyper turn, and making sure you plan out the turns that lead up to that accordingly. The characters are all pretty likable and well written (well, except for a few that were kinda meh). There's humorous, snappy dialogue. The story is pretty simple (Bad Guy's doing the Bad Thing! Go stop them!), but well executed nonetheless. There's four difficulty options, I played through on Heroine (equates to ""Hard"", I suppose). It felt pretty challenging without being overly punishing, which is what I expected. Kept me on my toes. The game did start to get kinda easy towards the end, but maybe that was because of the the party/ability loadout I was using. Hard to say! There's also the Super Spy difficulty, which I guess you could equate to ""Insane"". I didn't touch this one, but if you're really seeking something REALLY hard, give it a shot. Also, you can change the difficulty settings at any time in the menu.CSH lets you save the game anywhere, which is super nice. It's a game that really respects your time, in that sense. The pacing is also pretty good, there's never really a moment of downtime or anything, it just keeps moving forward. My final clock-in time was about 17 hours, but I'd estimate 15 hours on average.Also the music is nothing short of fantastic. It's SOOO good. ANYWAY, CSH is a nice lil' indie JRPG that is certainly worth your time and money. It's not the Second Coming of Chrono Jesus like some people would have you believe, but it's definitely a good game regardless. Buy it!			"

												Cosmic Star Heroine is a beautiful homage to the golden 16-bit age of Japanese Roleplaying Games. Everything from its combat system, to the pixel-art, to the amazing soundtrack are a loveletter to games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI.Cosmic Star Heroine has a wonderful storyline and it is challenging to boot! A must-play experience for anyone who is looking to satisfy the JPRG craving that has existed in their hearts since 1995.			"

												Played for just over 1 hour and already love it. It has me as soon as I heard it was retro and like Phantasy Star / Chrono Trigger. I just had to buy it and see for myself and I love everything about it. 2017 really is the return of the JRPG's!One thing I especially love so far is the customisation and combat. It feels nice and is fun, something very interesting is the negative HP thing, I've not really seen this done before and it works really well. You don't just die straight away you have a chance to live while you fight with negative HP and you can recover from this but you must do it before your turn end of that character does die. Onto the text and story - seems good so far but obviously too early to tell how good it will be but the general chat amongst party members themselves is good and quite often funny. I've already laughed out loud several times in my first 1 hour of play time. It's a nice refreshing game to play and I haven't felt like this in a game in a long time. This and Persona 5, what a year for JRPG lovers and I can only look forward to more.			"

												Edit: many of these bugs have been fixed according to recent work on patchnotes, which should make the game more acceptable; the rest of the review still stands though, and I am waiting for more work to go back to the game on the hardest difficulty to see if it can be turned into a net positive.Plagued by bugs,  including hardlocks.Playing on 2nd highest difficulty: about 40% of the encounters don't seem tuned properly.Not to mention: theres quite a few encounters and even bosses that just auto-die (and, laughably, theres a few that die while their sprite remains on the screen afterwards too).Game itself is fast paced and story isn't terrible, but it feels very incomplete, should have been kept in the oven a bit longer.  Notably, theres a lot of ""the devs DIDNT think of everything"" going on as well, especially going back to areas.  Theres even a few places where the dialogue of an NPC literally says ""Placeholder"", not to mention random NPCs simply named NPC#.Combat abilities are interesting and abilities combo well, the one saving grace (and I suppose comboing everything to practically one-shot the final boss doing 100k damage in the opening shot was fun at least).  Some weirdness though in some abilities, not to mention the hardlocks I had with poison and the bounty hunter auto-attack.Theres even bugs in the credits!Do not recommend without some serious fixes and some work - I ended up rushing thru it just to get done.

												From my brother's review of the game: My first impressions were quite good. I have been waiting for this game ever since I found out about it by it's upcoming physical release for PS4 and PSVita. Overall the trailer set my expectations reasonably high and I'm happy with what I have played so far. (the first 4 chapters of the game)The characters (so far) have easy to understand motivations, and the dialog is just about the right length so that you can get back into the action of the game smoothly. I like how there is some thinking involved in collecting the extra stuff in each area, however the sudden and frequent ""door locks behind you"" stuff really bugged me, you need to save often, because if you explore and hit an ""advance to the next room"" toggle, you might not be able to go back...unless you load your game. (I know that there are clear story reasons for some of this, but from a gameplay point of view this bothers me, and disrupts the game-flow as I'm a very eager to collect everything. There are some unclear puzzles that do require you to move forward past a one way area, then after a plot point happens the game lets you return to solve it.)  So small nitpicks aside, the art and music work well with the setting and the action of what is going on.The game runs best (imo) on a game-pad, but keyboard controls are also an option.Yes, the game will exit if you change a setting, but that is a minor bug and will hopefully be patched out within a few days.PROS:+ Clearly a lovingly crafted retro RPG for all us fans.+ Fun unique combat mechanics.+ Very nice awesome pixel art.+ Interesting Characters.+ Not too much dialog in cut-scenes.+ Respects your time, and allows you to save anywhere and anytime (outside battle)+ Some battles can be replayed to grind for loot (it's in the menu for some reason)CONS:- Invisible one way triggers will force you onward and you can't go back. (unless you load)- The ability select screen is a little odd to get used to, took me about 45 min to understand it and reordered my skills how I liked.			"

												I want to like this game - I've loved every other Zeboyd game - but this game honestly just feels buggy and incomplete. It lacks the usual complete transparency of mechanics that other Zeboyd games have had, and the lack of any audio or control settings for a game that's been in development for so long is just... sloppy.I hope this game gets fixed up with patches.

												This game is LOADED with bugs. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, but when I got to the last dungeon, all my save data was erased.The small bugs on the way were bad, but managable. Im not playing 11 hours again for that though.Fix the bugs and you have a solid game.			"

												I kickstarted this game and I'm happy with the results. The battle system is one of the most fun RPG battle systems I've used in a while. It takes some real tactical planning to use your skills at the right time. The story is interesting, the characters are memorable, the art is great, and I'm curious to see what happens next! (I'm only on Chapter 3 so far.) The flavor text is hilarious: many puns and funny quips. The music also has some SERIOUS 80's nostalgia. The game has a few bugs still, but I hear from a reliable source that those are being worked out. I'm convinced the story is going to carry through and cover up whatever flaws may be found.			"

												Needs at least another patch or two (I would only save at the beginning of rooms until the bug is fixed), but really fun RPG otherwise with a fairly unique combat system.Just make sure you play on Heroine difficulty your first time.  Tourist and Normal are too easy, and Secret Spy is ridiculous, bordering on RNG luck based gaming... or a lot of grinding.			"

												A good game, if unpolished.Pros:- Sci-Fi JRPG- New combat mechanics, heavy focus on exploiting elemental weaknesses Cons:- Very unpolished (e.g. you can see your character sprite clipping through environment, for an example check out the trees in the festival area, also some battles will bug out / force a restart).- Can't quit (without Alt-F4?)- Can't load (without quitting!)- Status effects aren't visible, e.g. do I have a buff?

												I love JRPGs, but I find it difficult to sit down through RPGs with overly long exposition or rote, repetitive combat mechanics.  Enter Zeboyd, whose every game has been like a breath of fresh air.  So naturally, I preordered Cosmic Star Heroine and waited... and waited... and waited... and it's been worth the wait!The game starts off with action and adventure, and never lets up.  The pace remains quick, the characters fun and light, the combat delightful and each character's mechanics encourage exploration of their abilities, and each new level/zone has simple little puzzles.Most Zeboyd games have been ""lite"" snacks, a game you can finish in a few hours, but Cosmic Star Heroine has some real staying power.  I wouldn't quite call it a ""full JRPG experience,"" but if Zeboyd keeps moving in this direction, we may well have a proper epic on our hands.I have some quibbles: you quickly ""level out of"" the interesting items, which means that while you can swap in and out accessories and abilities, your weapon and shield tend to be dictated by what the ""best"" item is at the moment, which I find unfortunate.  The game has plenty of equipment, but given the good/better/best nature of weapons and shields, those choices quickly disappear into ""just a handful useful currently.""  The game also has some bugs, though the only one I've found is that sometimes the UI for editing abilities disappears and the only way to fix it is to quit out and restart.Is it worth a buy, even at this price (which is far, far more than most Zeboyd games)? Yes, definitely.  This is the Zeboyd game you've been waiting for!			"

												Absolutely in love with this game. Story-line so far is great, absolutely love the mix of characters and different play styles. Lots of customization when it comes to your party. Unique combat and very retro sound effects and music. I decided to write the review after a side quest that is very Resident Evil-esque. ;) I feel many developers and publishers focus too much on graphics, and neglect all other aspects. This game is definitely a bang for your buck. My only negative feedback is I had a bug that froze after a battle, which could have been very rage quit worthy, but luckily I saved just before it. Also you guys need to get some achievements on the board! This is a game I would love to 100%. Keep the nostalgia alive!			"

												I don't write reviews to often but Zebloyd games hits a grand slam with cosmic star heroine, I beat the game in about 15 hours which is a fair amount of time.  This was a great experience and love the sound track, My only issue is when the game freezes, like when I used unleashed with an ability from slot 7.  So the Dem boss froze up a lot too. But the game has a rich story, great battle sequence and music that's upbeat. Buy this game if you're a fan from old school JRPG like chrono trigger or fantasy star.			"

Disclaimer:  Helped Kickstart the gameZeboyd Games returns with their most ambitious rpg yet!  Cosmic Space Heroine is a delightful throwback to the 16-bit generation of JRPGs with great pixel art, fun music and an all around fun battle system and adventure.This game is Zeboyd's largest work so far with an adventure spanning multiple planets with a good amount of optional sidequests that you can find/unlock as the game progresses.  From old rusty factories to lush alien jungles, their is a great variety in locations that you'll visit.  It's not overburdened with stuff to do in each place but just enough to make you curious about checking the corners of the maps!The combat is where the game really shines!  You can have up to 4 party members, each with their own 8 user-set abilities.  Each ability unless specified is a one time use so if you want to refresh it you have to defend.  Along with abilities there is the HYPER system where you gain a charge every turn and once your HYPER bar is filled your next attack will do extra damage (or heal will be stronger)!  It flows in well where you constantly look at the enemy type and check if you have any buffs or basic damage abilities to use as you charge up the HYPER bar then you use your strongest moves or combinations to burn down your enemies.  I enjoyed how the various ""Shields"" you equip both increase your basic stats as well as give additional once-per-battle moves called ""Programs"".  Depending on how you set your team up, one could be a dedicated elemental magic user, another a healer, or just a straight damage/debuffer.The character designs are fantastic: Alien Bounty Hunters, Cyborg bugs, Robot funk dancers, and more will assist our protagonist Alyssa L'Salle in saving the galaxy!  Plus you have the option of finding new ""recruits"" or supporting characters to give you an extra boost in battle.For a single playthrough I'd say it's around 16-20 hours depending on if you really want to grind 100%.While I did experience a few bugs here and there like other reviewers have mentioned, the developers have been working hard at fixing them and releasing patches quite frequently so the few soft locks/sprite errors I had were completely fixed by the time I finished the game.TL;DR - Cosmic Space Heroine is a great little indie RPG by Zeboyd Games that does an RPG right!  It's not too long or crazy complex in story design but it's perfectly satisfying for the asking price!  9/10 "

												If you love old school RPGs you really really owe it to yourself to pick this game up.  Its like chrono trigger's pacing with a future scifi ambiance.  The good:  The Humor, The Combat, The Story, The Characters, The cheesy but great cutscenes.  Seeing the two (think its two) programmers who made this game build up from their previous games is just amazing.  And i'm one of those dorks who loved chrono trigger more than my family as a child and now keep the original copy sitting in my desk.  You know people like me don't ever give a game enough love to compare it to chrono trigger, but this game is something else.			"

												I greatly enjoyed the game. I like RPGs in general and this give me a good feeling playing it and actually finishing it. The Story is OK, the Characters are well thought out and the game as a hole (I have all zeboyd games) has improved compared to the earlier titles. I finished the game in 20 hours with level 60. I played on Heroine difficulty and had no problems fighting my way through the game. The End Boss was easy. I backtracked a lot to finish some side quests, to recieve some cool items and beat some Boss characters. I like the Beginning (chapter 1-3) and the way new characters are introduced. The music is great and fits the game. I do not like the encounter system (I like to grind) and the lvl-up system (i want control over the stats i see as important).""Games like this help to define what a RPG is!""  "

												What really made this game for me was the combat. Other reviews discuss the combat mehanics in-details, so I will just briefly summarized what I liked about it--the depth. In this game, you do not have MP or SP like in your traditional RPG. To me, the combat has three distinct features that make it interesting:* abilities may be used freely, but many require defending for a turn to take them off cooldown* charaters go into ""hyper mode"" after a certain number of turns, boosting their damage/healing/ailments* damage ramps up the longer the fight goes on (esp. enemies)Timing buffs/debuffs and big hits is really the way to go here, making fights less of the normal tank'n'spank sort of deal found in many other RPGs. It's fun using normal attacks to deal, say, 800 damage, and then using a buffed hyper-attack to slap a boss with 40000 damage.The only problem I had with the combat was the difficulty pacing. Many battles seemed too easy (even on Heroine), but there would be the occasional battle I would barely survive. This happened multiple times throughout the story for me. Thankfully the game lets you freely change the difficulty.I personally felt that the story was not very interesting (minor spoiler: it's as simple as bad guy is trying to mind-control people, stop them). A simple story can be carried by interesting, dynamic characters. While there are quite a few characters with interesting designs, they rarely have much to say outside of when you first meet them. There was really no character development at all.Music was enjoyable, but I personally did not find anything that memorable. The main battle theme is pretty sweet, which is awesome as players will hear it a lot.I'd personally wait for a sale unless you are a die-hard 16-bit RPG fan that needs a quick-fix.Edited for readability.

												I'm really impressed with the game so far. The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is solid and fun. Combat in a lot of RPGs is somewhat lacking in strategy, but this one gives you a lot of options and rewards both planning and resource management in a way that I love. I especially like how items are limited use but aren't truly consumed. I tend to avoid using consumables as much as possible in games, but in this it's more of another ability type. The resting mechanic is also great, and being able to choose which skills to take with you into battle is very satisfying to my need for customization. If I end up getting to choose party members in later parts of the game, this will be the whole package.I've played other Zeboyd RPGs before and they were mostly okay but a little simplistic, but this feels like a much higher quality game. The dialog isn't bad and it has room for improvement, but otherwise I feel like I'm playing a SNES classic. This is by far the best new RPG I've been able to find on Steam in a long time. If Zeboyd announces another RPG kickstarter project, I'll probably be backing it after this.			"

												Holy shoot!!!! They were not kidding when they say it's kind of like Chrono Trigger!! Not only the battles and general style, but THE REFERENCES!!!!!! Spoiler alert: there is an early boss during an escape sequence, on a side scrolling bridge, that is a mechanical dragon. I'm only a couple of  hours in, and apart from the battles, there is a lot of details that reminds me of CT, and also other old school games... Oh, and don't think that the references are only from CT! You'll find some from Star Wars and a lot of other good stuff!Well, so I guess you already noticed that the references are a good point, but really, the game is great. Nice music, cool graphics, excellent gameplay... I really can't think of anything bad about it, besides that once you start playing, it's hard to stop.If you like JRPGs of old, sci-fi pop culture, or are just looking for something fresh, you can't go wring with this game!

												Okay, I played this game for a few hours and here's what I think of the game.Pro:Gameplay: It is good, with a nice choice of party members, each with their own abilites and skills. I find it hard who to switch out and who to put into the front line. Also, the Hyper system, which increases damage and debuff success rates, helps me figure out what skills to use first for maximum damage and having advantage in combat, instead of mashing the Accept button to win.Music: The Soundtrack so far makes my ears happy. I still get the boss theme and the song from Nightshade stuck in my head. ConsStory: The story, mostly its pacing, is too fast. It's like I'm watching a story unfold on fast forward. The plot twists happen too quickly and I can't enjoy any setting before I leave to the next area in the next five minutes. Not only that, I've got more than half the party members joining the main character almost immediately before I make to the second planet.---That's all I have after playing for a few hours. Given that it's done by two people and with the $15 price tag, I'd say it's worth it.			"

												Note: I'm one of the original Kickstarter backers for Cosmic Star Heroine so I've been waiting nearly four years for this game to come out. It's kind of crazy because I had just gotten out of College at the time. In the intervening years, I've moved from one end of the USA to the other, gotten a good job, made new friends and so much more had happened that I had honestly forgotten that I had backed CSH. I really don't want to write the review this way....but let's get to it. The pluses to CSH: Worlds are decently fleshed out and they certainly created a unique setting. You get to meet a wide variety of races and characters that come with their own charm and unique visuals. They have done really well to craft this unique universe with some interesting ideas here. The Battle system is probably the most enjoyable jRPG battle system I've run across as well. There's no grinding required though you can do random battles via the menu if you want. And there's a nice variety of abilities and strategies you can implement at the individual and team level. Stats aren't well introduced and aren't as intuitive as other RPGs though. But it makes for an enjoyable time as you exploit combos and elemental weaknesses in the enemies. The minuses to CSH: The story is just....so boring. The characters are two dimensional at best and man does this game suffer for it. What Zeboyd humor and references are put in are a nice touch. But it's not nearly enough to outweigh the problems. The story mostly serves as a means to direct the player from one place to the next. While that does work early on, I was starting to crave some sort of change to the pace mid to late game. It's just ""Hi, nice to meet you, do this thing, kill X enemies, kill the boss"" rinse and repeat. There's not much for side quests or dungeons and they serve mostly as a distraction to give you nice items, most of the time. It's a real shame that the story doesn't hold up because I think these would be very interesting characters to work with here. But they aren't ever allowed to develop into believable people. Even on quests that seem to be hand-crafted to build up backstory or maybe camaraderie, the characters are mostly silent during it with only the lightest amount of conversation going on. It's a completely missed opportunity. Made even more noticeable that 99% of the NPCs' dialogue in towns is completely forgettable/skippable. Or the cutscenes that were a nice bit of flair but ultimately pointless most of the time. What ultimately stopped me was the various bugs and glitches I kept running into in the game. Most notable were the soft-locks where the game would randomly decide after casting a spell to ""lock up"" I couldn't cast spells, bring up the menu or anything else. There was also another graphic glitch that occurred when I swapped characters around. Or the game refusing to acknowledge that I hit the A button to read the dialogue. 11 hours in, I ran into another soft-lock and lost a significant amount of progress on the third planet you visit. At that point, I was already losing interest and was just bored. The story didn't give me any reason to invest myself in the characters, the combat system was nice but it wasn't enough to finish the game over either. I'm also a little irritated that a game that was in development for so long that's approximately 10-20 hours had so many bugs present in the final product. Is it worth picking up? No.			"

												Well I have played the 1st hour and I did like it.  First the negatives though.  1.  Include how to bring up your character screen in your tutorial.  I was pressing every button on the keyboard until I found that it was TAB. 2.  I couldnt find any way to adjust sound settings.  I wasnt too fond of the fast paced music but couldnt turn it down.  I think I would have warmed to it more if it was quietly in the background rather than at the same audio level as the sx.  Also a small thing that I think could enhance the combat would be to make the atttacks look better.  I dont mean the animation but more the little white number that tells you how much damage you have done.  Doesnt give you a wow feeling when you hit something.  Maybe make the font red and flash or enlarge it or something.  That is about that for the negatives.Positives.  I like that it isnt overly complicated.  Easy to pick up and fun to play.  2 of the best selling points for me.  I like that you start on low HP and your attacks do low damage.  I played the free trial of skyrim the other day (not that I am comparing a small indie game to that game) but I started the game with like 17500 health and I do damage of 945 when I hit an enemy.  Why?  Do games do this for theatrical effect,  Do people grab fists full of popcorn when they seel 900 damage?  I dont get it.  I much prefer low numbers like on games like this and WAKFU.  I am still early into the game so cant say a great deal but I enjoyed it so far and will continue playing.			"

												Outside of the bugs and glitches, the game is a very curated experience from story telling to gameplay.  So curated in that 9/10 treasure chests are simply money.  I was 4 hours into the game and I already amassed 100,000k.  There are no other weapons other than the ones the devs wanted you to have at a specific time.  .  The battle system is fun and kind of neat but since there are no random encounters you don't fight as much in other games.  The story also goes by really quick from big set piece to fantastical location to unbelievable events and etc.  The pace and humor keeps it from being an ""epic story"" and instead more ""Saturday Morning"".  There are lots of sprite cutscenes though. I wonder if thats what took a bunch of their time.Bugs go from the ATB getting stuck to srpite glitches to freezing.  I couldn't recommend it.Disco Robot is garbage tier.			"

												So far I played the first 2 Acts but I'm not sure if I want to continue that why I write the review now.The Good:- Interesting Story- Limited exploring for extra items, lore and maybe combat- Turnbased combat where it is not enough to use the same ability over and over The Bad:- The graphic at 1080p feel like its just scaled up from the minimum of 480x270 what make it straining to the eyes in dark areas- no mouse control- The character level up automatic with absolut no control for the player- The items are the only thing where the player can make a difference but during my play so far I only found 1-2 for each slot beside the one you got at the start so there is no real choice her also- Except for some dead end paths for exploration the game is absolut linear with no branching at all- Exit the game and save are in complete different menu so that you first have to go trough the character menu (tab) to save before hit esc and confirm to leave the game-  the place to interact with a item or NPC is sometimes realy difficult to findSo over all the game get down to some combat and walking around while watching and reading the story. Sadly the story is not that interesting that it make me wonder why I'm not read a good book or watching a good movie instead of playing a game that have cut out the choices whats make a RPG interesting to me.

												In this games current state, it is a absolute mess and this is really disapointing too because to it's core it could be potentially an absolutely amazing game.   I feel the devs are still working very hard to patch and iron things out.  They have been very adamant on the community forums about fixing bugs.    That being said this review is subject to change.Firstly I would like to discuss difficulty,  The games difficulty is a mess.  It's all over the place in some cases the hardest difficulty is well suitable, In most cases the 3rd difficulty is absolutely the best eaxperience.   It's challanging and keeps you on your toes without being too punishing.However this takes a turn for the worst during later chapters where enemy HP is spiked up and battles run off too long to do enough damage to finish the fights. I feel the difficulty ramp could have been much more adjusted.  (My only critic I can give to the developer since research shows they moved from XNA to Unity is to look into Analytics plugins.  If you the dev are reading this I would like to mention its a great tool and you should make use of it it will provide you a     powerful way to polish your game. )You will have the option to assemble your party to your liking and the game tells you no, you are going to do this dungeon with X,Y and Z party member and heres V too.  They turn out to be a very poor combination to boot.  I feel this could have been executed better.Next I will talk about level design and some annoying quirks that I have noticed very minor but they were still an eyesore.  Firstly was Placeholder NPC's and random UI misuse.   There have been a few occasions that I have run into an NPC just to read ""Placeholder NPC""  running around keeping track of what you are working on is important in development losing track of a placeholder isn't exactly a good thing. I get the feeling it could have been a joke or intentional but it breaks the immersion.   There were also a few instances where I had confused naming conventions,   ""Person A"", ""Person B""  I didn't quite understand because they didn't seem important to be given a name and it was only used once.  It's like the middle point of the games development was used for testing new Classes they may have programmed in.The next which is the sole reason this gets a thumbs down, is due to the massive amount of bugs this game has.  You don't release a game in this state and just because you, the developer play through it and don't experience bugs does not mean it's going to be the same as multiple others experiencing it.    Some of these seemed to be more due to lack of testing features mechanics.   No pre-determined programming or planning.   What I said above compliments the sole problems with the game.    Judging on everything I've read I can only imagine that this games purpose served to teach the devs how to use Unity.  Which is fine but extensive testing and organization skills could have highly avoided these issues.     The list of bugs are very heavy but with the benefit of doubt they again are working very hard on patching these and I hope they continue to work on this until they have smashed out every bug. Next is the story, the story is pretty interesting and the devs did a excellent job capturing the charm of each character. I felt a yern to keep playing at every turn, if it was not for bugs completely demolishing my save file I would have probably did a full playthrough.  The world feels lively and each npc is crafted with thier own problems, even unimportant npcs have a unique charm to them that very memorable. I haven't felt that way since playing Xenogears for the PS1 years ago. This was the first game to mimic that worldly feeling that I craved in RPG's that was lacking.     The pacing in the story is okay but I feel like it does rush a bit too much, theres hardly any downtime and things are always happening.   I don't think this is bad thing but I do feel it can be a bit much. The soundtrack is very charming and very excellent I really only have good things to say about it no negatives at all.With everything said above I can only say that this game is a super mixed bag with so much potential, It's really a shame because with proper gameplay polish and being bugfree,  This could have easily been one of the best games I have ever played.  Now is it worth the buy?  It kinda is, but you are gambling on the small team actually fixing all the issues and not just leaving to work on their next project.   Thing's are looking promising hopefully I can flip this review with a thumbs up eventually.			"

												Cosmic Star Heroine is a JRPG from the makers of Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death 7. Designed to resemble a 16bit SNES RPG, Cosmic Star Heroine is clearly inspired by other classic JRPGs such as Chrono Trigger. Just looking at it causes the nostalgia to drag me back into my childhood. With that being said, there are issues that bothered me as I played the game. One of the first things that really bugged me was interacting with NPCs. You can walk through (most) NPCs and for whatever reason you have to be in a perfect spot to trigger dialog, which can be really frustrating, I often found myself walking around in circles around a NPC until I could actually get the chance to open dialog with them. The combat, while it didn't really seem to be a big issue at first, ended up being one of the most frustrating factors of the game. I am sure the developers thought they were doing something ""cool"" or ""unique"", but all it really did was make fights longer and more annoying. Characters have skills, abilities, items and ""programs"", all of these things have like a cooldown on them, so while in the midst of combat you can't just spam one thing. The issue is, not all characters have a basic attack to rely on while in combat, so eventually you are going to find some of your party members have nothing else to offer besides waiting a few turns to recharge their skills or abilities. It's stupid and poorly thought out. Besides that, you can't really ""grind"" in this game, because from what I've seen, monsters are not recurring, they are scripted, so while you might encounter a monster in a area, you can't simply walk around to continue to fight it for more money or experience. And grinding is one of the biggest draws to RPGs, it's watching numbers go up. The writing is yawn inducing. With RPGs of this nature there should be a balance that you strive to achive as far as it comes to dialog, unfortunately I often found myself just autoscrolling through mounds of text because I really couldn't find the energy to care about their poorly written story. The map layouts are really forgettable, for the most part they take a fairly linear path, which may occasionally branch out for a few steps or walk back up upon itself, but it never really goes far enough to actually encourage exploration. The game is mostly fine, even with it's tedious combat, terrible writing and uninspired maps. I just feel like it was really overhyped and as a direct result, the end product just doesn't feel as good.			"

												Needed far more playtesting before it ever officially launched on Steam.  Should've had an open beta or early access period.  This is also the developer's first simultaneous multiplat release, and as a result they are struggling to keep on top of fixes.FURTHER REVIEW AFTER PLAYING FOR 8 MORE HOURS:If you only do the first four chapters, you won't think there's much wrong aside from a few technical bugs, but beyond that, it's obvious they either didn't have the money for everything they wanted to do, or just figured they'd put it out there with what they did, do some damage control to get as many sales as possible, and move on.  The game ends up falling apart in every regard, and regardless of motive, the core of the failed delivery is obvious: They just didn't put enough money into it.- missing sound effects (pretty obvious when you start unlocking later skills, then you use them and there's absolutely *no sound* to go along with it - same goes for some enemies you'll encounter)- NPCs that are just called ""NPC"" with a number for them, because they forgot to give them an actual name (ie. ""NPC46"")- fights that are entirely RNG based, you may lose some encounters simply because they didn't do enough playtesting to ensure proper balance, so you can try eight different things and they'll all be ""right"" but you'll lose anyway, and you can do the same thing ten times, lose nine times, then win on the tenth because of who the enemies decided to target (on your team or, if charmed, on theirs)- plenty of softlocks from things like untargettable enemies and then the game freezing on the selection screen, or the game not even giving you a battle menu at all during your turn, so in either case you have to force close the game- a ton of the game's mechanics aren't explained, not as some intended means for difficulty, but as in the way a lot of things work aren't explained to you- not enough info on the UI when in combat, like what type of attribute the skill you're using is modified by (would be helpful so you know how buffing works), or when a buff has run out (ie. be notifed a defense buff has expired so you know to rebuff, rather than being hit for max damage and going oh I guess the defense buff wore off, don't know when though!)- skills will sometimes just randomly deactivate and be unusable, yes I know there's a skill you use to recharge skills, I'm talking about sometimes the game just flat out refuses to let you activate available skills- the character that uses drones... I don't know how to word this, it's so bizarre... when you use the drone, it takes until the start of the next turn to attack?  And sometimes it ends up robbing the turn of the character that was supposed to go first.  This is clearly a bug, but makes an already broken game even worse.- a few of the characters feel like poorly planned sketches in combat, like they didn't finish developing them, which is exactly what this entire game is.  A lof of it is Reminds me a lot of Citizen Earth.  A game desperately trying to emulate a peak from the golden era of JRPGs, that just ends up failing miserably.  Though in this case, for entirely different reasons... but still not worth playing, at all.  If this were a house Zeboyd built that we were all living in, we'd all be dead from carbon monoxide poisoning the next morning, and just like carbon monoxide poisoning, there are people experiencing this game who are dealing with all the same issues, but for some reason just aren't aware of the negative effects.  Save yourself and stay out!			"

												This game has many lazy/cringeworthy parts to offset its potential, which I am listing below.Good parts:1) Battle system has style and disables some moves to bypass spamming the same techniques ad nauseum.2) Nice overall cutscene quality and soundtrack to reminisce the Sega CD days.3) Bosses can actually be affected by stun/poison, actually making room for strategy.4) A type of adrenaline system so characters can continue fighting with 0 hp or gain an aura to do more damage motivates battles.Here are the parts I couldn't stand.  First of all, it is very counter-intuitive; why can't alt+enter full screen this?  I don't even know about the manual they talk about.  To bypass this experience, go to system before starting a new game.  Otherwise you will be dumbfounded by tab being the menu key, escape quitting the game, and an inability to change that tiny window.Now that is out of the way, here are parts I can't avoid:1) Lazy/ripped off references.  I would rather play Phantasy Star IV with Alys/Chaz than these Alyssa/Chana ripoffs. Cosmic Star Heroine advocates inspiration, but it feels lazy.  At least the 3rd character is named Dave and not Chronos.2) The Beast lacks cutscenes.  After Dave asks why won't the monster die, Alyssa kills it without a cutscene and the screen turns black.  What are we, little kids who trigger over death?  Also, I kid you not, he is generically called The Beast, and has none of the swag from X-Men's Beast.  The lazy part is the game makes a cutscene to show some chief type character with light reflecting off his sunglasses, but they fade to black and show the beast crushed by something rather than show the action to completely kill the mood and make me quit.3) Chahn is completely derivative, unlike Alyssa who just has a similar name to Alys.  It just makes me lose complete immersion in the game.  Regarding Chahn's derivative nature, she has a red headband like PSIV's Chaz, and humatama equipped (hints at Phoenix Wright's magatama for a mystical origin). Chahn's movesets for her gunmancy (I kid you not) is that unique abilities for her would be to attack everyone by wasting a turn, or repeat her last gunmancy, which kinda undermines the point of style with this battle system to not repeat moves, though her fire attack is decent; better than using stupid healing guns, which I feel the other characters do much better. I will compare to the other 2 characters which are far better: Dave can stun/poison bosses, and Alyssa has many different attributes for weapons, so you can really fine-tune for weaknesses.4) Weaknesses for enemies are automatically shown.  Some people may hate this lack of experimentation, plus in terms of style, it is more fun to find a boss' weakness, than to have the game give you an idiot light (similar to bosses with glowing body parts you are supposed to hit) without needing an accessory.5) Menus are terrible (Remember what I said earlier about accessing by pressing tab).  You always have to equip items, and stats are on both sides of the screen.  In other words, a person's stats are on the left, but the attack of the weapon is on the right, as well as what it does, so it is very disorienting.Overall, this is the game equivalent of the Hungry Marie manga, overemphasizing references to make you yearn more for the original material.

												Zeboyd has done it again! Cosmic Star Heroine is a 16 bit masterpiece! Amongst recent games such as Breath of the Wild, Persona 5, and Mass Effect: Andromeda, CSH is an indie game that draws upon one of the strongest forces in video gaming. Nostalgia.And boy does it work. From the very beginning, you're thrown into a detailed world full of highly stylized sprites, incredibly well-done backgrounds, and a fun and catchy soundtrack. It gets better from there. Different from previous games by Zeboyd, The gameplay is reminiscint of Chrono Trigger, with enemies visible on the main map and battles conducted on the screen, eliminating screen-switching entirely. This coupled with maps that are vibrant and alive, full of detail and color evoke memories of Lunar, Phantasy Star, and other 16 bit series.There has been much detail poured into this game as well. So many little things make the worlds feel vibrant and alive, such as bugs running around on the ground, or birds that fly off when you approach too closely. Ambient sounds also make you feel immersed, as the hum of a generator getting louder and quiter as you approach and distance yourself.The writing is interesting as well; interacting with NPC characters results in amusing references to previous Zeboyd games, anime, observations regarding the world you are playing in, and nods to the RPG genre in general.The game is quite forgiving, as most battles can be won with a little bit of attention, even on 'Heroine' (Hard?) difficulty, and explains the unique mechanics utilized in battle via a short 3-stage tutorial. If you are a fan of classic RPG games, then this game will certainly trigger your memories and evoke the same excitement as you experienced with those. And if you're not a fan of the series, but want to try to get into it, CSH is an excellent choice.5 Stars. A+++. Whatever the current popular rating system is. It's fun.			"

												Cosmic Star Heroine may be influenced by classics like Chrono Trigger, Phantasy Star IV, and Suikoden - which admittedly is a great pitch by itself - but don't fool yourself into thinking it's a cheap cash-in on nostalgia. The game has amazingly detailed pixel art, clearly showing the years put into it, the soundtrack is top notch - not chiptunes, either, and the writing is excellent. The game's overall plot is serious and more than intriguing enough to keep you playing, if a bit melodramatic, but it can also be very funny: expect deadpan snarking, absurdity, oblique references to Hitchhiker's Guide and Star Wars, among others, and just general goofiness.Then there's the battle system. It's by far the most well thought out and unique battle system I've seen in a JRPG, at least in a long time. In some ways it resembles Chrono Trigger, with battles taking place on the same screen as exploration,  and three characters to control. Beyond that, though, it's vastly different. Everyone recharges health after battle, there's no MP, and items can only be used once per battle, but recharge after. Each ability can be used once, but the defend command also recharges your abilities. This encourages you to try out every ability and use different strategies, and combined with some other features, really makes you plan ahead. Especially on high difficulties, battles feel like puzzles, not just ""mash A to win"".Of course, the game does still have bugs and is a little rough around the edges, as it is just after launch, and from a tiny team, but if you can forgive the (mostly minor) issues, you'll have a great time. It's around 15-20 hours, which might be a con for some, but as long as you don't expect a 60 hour game, you'll find its fast pacing welcome.			"

												I had a great time with this game! It's a good 16-bit cyberpunk turn-based RPG. Highly addicting. Good retro graphics and good soundtrack. Solid gameplay. It takes the good elements from its influences and steps it up. I recommend playing this game at at least ""Heroine"" difficulty. This is quality retro RPG, and I would recommend it to those looking for one. Get this game! Great value for a great experience.			"
