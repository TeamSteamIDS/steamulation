												Gyromancer is a match 3 puzzle R.P.G. developed by PopCap Games Inc. and published by SquareEnix. Players assume the role of Rivel, a summoner who is sent by the king into the enchanted Aldemona Woods in search of a group of zealots known as Temperance after their leader murders a well known member of the empire. This being a match 3 game, one can safely assume that the battles all take place in puzzle format. I've read that this games battle system is heavily based on Bejeweled Twist which is another popular PopCap title however I've not yet played that game myself so I can't testify to the validity of that statement? When you battle, Rivel summons one of three beasts in his stead against his opponent. The goal is to match three or more gems on the battlefield and build power in order to unleash your chosen beasts abilities to try and defeat the opposition. Throughout the game you will have the opportunity to command over fifty different beasts or monsters a la Pokemon...I'm assuming as I've never played Pokemon and am only guessing that the two are similiar in this fashion? Pikachu...here boy!!!While the story in my opinion is a little lacking the gameplay is definitely the gem, pun totally intended, of this great title. The puzzle battles are extremely fun and like all great puzzle R.P.G.'s require some strategy to win. Do you pass up an easy match 3 on this side of the battlefield in order to block your opponents potential match 3 on another part of the field? These are just some of the many dilemmas that you will have to face. You'll have plenty of chances to battle as this title spans twelve unique stages but beware because this game could quickly become as addictive to you as it did with me. Graphically this game is beautiful...it's a Square Enix game so that's a given. The gorgeous hand drawn art of the various characters and monsters is both pleasant to the eyes and makes you want to see all the beasts. The battlefield and gems are bright, colorful and well animated. The music is catchy and fits the title well although it's not nearly as great as the musical scores in the Puzzle Quest games. The sound effects in this game, however, are spectacular. You definitely hear it everytime you connect a match 3, build power, make combos and launch attacks, etc..I'm thoroughly enjoying this game but I have to mention one big problem with it. I've played many a puzzle R.P.G. over the past year or so and this seems to be a consistent problem with almost all of them. With the exception of Puzzle Quest 1 and 2, most of these games do a completely horrendous job of explaining what you need to do and what various things in the game mean. The tutorials, if you can call them that, are severly lacking and there are very few instruction manuals to read. I looked and looked on the internet and could not find an instruction manual FOR THIS GAME!!! Thankfully I was able to find some fan created walkthroughs and F.A.Q. links to help me. Everything else I learned through trial and error by just playing the game and figuring things out on my own. Fear not because there is light at the end of the tunnel because once you know what you're doing the frustration quickly goes away and you are able to finally enjoy the game. With that said, I still love this title and will be playing it for years to come and highly recommend it to any match 3 or puzzle R.P.G. gamer. Gotta catch 'em all...please don't sue me Nintendo.

												Not sure why i've decided to buy this game after i have tried a demo many years ago. Maybe i thought it would have more things later in the game. But the game is more of the same stuff and it gets too repetitive and boring fast. Also the vague story telling doesn't help to improve impressions. Dialogs are often weird, story twists are silly and confusing. Hero controls on the global map are annoying. Connecting 3 items (or more) in a row by rotating a square of 4 items clockwise is a bit of too much. One has to have a very good spacial imagination to quickly see combinations. Enemies don't have to do that, so this is a bit unfare. They use your combinations for resources for their attacks. Also you don't  just have to make your attacks, but proactively remove enemies attacks from the board. It quickly becomes very frustrating as game starts to introduce more blocks (locking certain items, making enemies' attacks to trigger faster, punishing for idle rotating of items, etc.). And the attacks your monsters have don't matter much. Yes, some trigger faster and do less damage, but you still just connect lines of items all the time without keeping much attention to them and the attacks trigger automatically. Puzzle Quest is way better in this regard, where you have to select what attacks to equip, when to trigger them and it actually matters what colors you connect. This game also has steep difficulty curve. You run easily through one stage and then stumble on another because monsters are much harder. Some challenges are based on simple luck (you have to make a cascade of 7 subsequent combinations, and you can't really prepare the board for that, because the board is too small and you have to rotate 4 items at a time, so you just sit their and mindlessly rotate them hoping to get that challenge..).There are better and more interesting games in that genre (both mechanically and story wise). Gyromancer is a bland and boring clone, which can't offer much strategy. You have to repeat samish battles over and over again, slowly grinding levels to beat stronger monsters. And the story told is boring and not rewarding.			"

												Second Impression (update to my first impression) :I've been looking for another good ""Puzzle Quest"" style game. Up to this point, the only types of those games that I did like were the actual Puzzle Quest series. Puzzle Kingdoms, Dungeon Hearts, and Legend of Fae were almost good, but not good enough in comparison to the quality of the PQ series. I loved Runespell: Overture, but that involves cards instead of gems. I've been looking forward to Gyromancer for a while and had it held up in my backlog for even longer. I definitely enjoyed it at first, though the latter half of the game may turn off some people. And like PQ, it does feel good to earn you wins through a bit a strategy, but I found alot of ""close calls"" came out in my favor purely due to the luck of the way gems dropped on the board.Instead of swapping adjacent gems horizontally or vertically, you swap them with a rotation tool of sorts. While unique, it does feel rather annoying when you have an easy match, but can match gems because they are in a odd corner, to the left of your cursor, or stuck near locked gems that can't be moved. This is part of the game design of course, but in the later levels especially, you often feel like you may not have what you need to match gems to prevent damage to you or attack the enemy. Only the player gets to make the gem swaps, but over time and also depending on which gems you swap, the enemy's ability meter will increase until they activate and morph a gem into a timed attack gem on the board or cause a status effect to one or both monsters. You then have a limited amount of turns to use that morphed gem in a match and remove it before it causes damage to your monster. This generally requires strategy and a bit of luck. My other complaint is that the game does appear to want you to potentially replay completed levels, as some paths of a stage are not cleared until after you beat it, which also mean you can't complete all the stage challenges in one run. One annoyance in gameplay I have is that you don't get enough items. In the start of the game, you get a few, but I never felt like I needed them. Once I got into the 3rd part of the world map, rounds were harder and there were so many situations where I could have used a Magic Mirror to rotate gems counter-clockwise or a Magick Key to unlock a locked gem, but couldn't because I only had one left that I wanted to save or had none at all. Items are found in chests and not in any store, but it almost feel like luck to get them because chests are found on certain parts of the level trail and you can't see the entire trail to know where to go.  You have to assume where your route will take you. Another irritant is that it seems like you will probably need to grind to play the later half of the game succesfully. When my monsters were around level 20+, I started seeing monsters at level 50 plus. Thankfully, some older levels will have paths you couldn't get to before, but can now, but it also feels like a pretty articial way of extending the game more than it needed to be.Gyromancer seems pretty good from the few hours I played. It doesn't keep my interest long enough which each sitting for me to have long play sessions like I did with PQ. The need to grind and backtrack put me off a bit - I don't mind it in certain games, but I don't really care for it here. That could be part of the reason it isn't well known, since this can get fairly difficult for casuals. This is probably the next best thing to the Puzzle Quest series from what I played, outside of Runespell: Overture.			"

												Game really reminds me of Bejeweled - In fact it is Bejeweled Twist with the RPG Elements of Square Enix. Its very challenging but you have to go through the tutorial to really understand it , because if you write off this Bejeweled Themed game as a puzzle game with a visual skin slapped on it, you will not win at this game. There have been people who have not been able to run this game. It has to do with people who don't have very high resolution monitors or their monitor can't support certain resolutions. I've posted a workaround in the forum for this that should work for everyone but it will result in a 640x480 resolution.  "

												Ignoring the issues others have mentioned - boring, easy, repetitive, RPG elements VERY minimal, no reason to complete most of their challenges - my chief complaint is that suddenly, after 8 hours of play, all my menu text disappeared. Restarting didn't fix the issue...ok fine, I'll verify the files. 2 files redownloaded. And then apparently the issue was my saved game, because it wiped it.  So I thought I'd test it again. Started brand new game with no issues. Exited game. Verified - 2 files redownloaded. Started Gyromancer again...yep, save game wiped again.  This is a MAJOR issue and I realize it's a rather old game but the thought of replaying the last 8 hours made me never want to touch this again.  Do not buy.			"

												Gyromancer started out well enough. Sure, it's cribbing on the whole Puzzle Quest phenomenon but the game was fun at least. Then a few missions into the game, they added a new rule where you can't switch jewels without causing a match without getting penalized. That, combined with an enemy ability that locks certain jewels into place makes this game too hard and too unrewarding. If you really want to play Gytomancer, just get one of the Puzzle Quest games instead.			"

												Fans of Bejeweled Twist should consider this game!How many times in BT have you wished you could rotate the gems the other way?  This game gives you that opportunity (and you may change your mind).When your beasts reach about level 25 the next story stage does show level 50 enemies, but all you need to do is pay attention.   (I read several negative reviews when I reached that point in the game.  I think the authors may have gotten to that point and stopped playing.)			"

												By opting for an asymmetric style of puzzle play (as opposed to Puzzle Quest et al's symmetric style of you move, AI moves), Gyromancer more consistently rewards mastery, making for a much more satisfying play experience. If you enjoyed PQ but felt frustrated by its high variance, Gyromancer is for you.			"

												I found this to be a fun match up game. Though I did find the controls to be a bit tricky to get a feel for at first and some of the challages like making chains a challage. But once you get the feel for the game flow it's quite fun.There is a bit of a pokemon feel to it as you do collect beasts which you fight with and each have their various skills and level limits. Though I only played for a few hours I find it's a nice casual game easy to pick up and the various area challages easy to do. The music is fair to listen to, I yet to find I want to turn it off though there's not much selection. Plus there's a fair bit of text reading and the story line is a bit simple for my taste but not completely bland.So if you liked puzzle quest then you will enjoy this game as well.			"

												With a slightly different twist on the typical puzzle game, Gyromancer could have been a little better, but was still fairly satisfying.The gameplay is about what you would expect of another 'Puzzle Quest' type game, just with a few different rules concerning the switching of gems. If you liked 'Puzzle Quest' then you'll probably like this one too. The story was actually interesting, but was unfortunately very short, could have been flushed out better, and at a few points left me a bit confused due to seemingly random plot points.That having been said, Gyromancer's one true failing is that it is far too short. You'll likely only get about 10 to 15 hours out of story mode assuming you poke around a bit. Despite that, if you're in the mood for a decent puzzle game, or if it's on sale and you'd like to have something to pass the time other than Solitaire, then by all means buy Gyromancer!			"

												PopCap and Square-Enix have created a lush, lavishly written that is arguably the best of its kind. While the base mechnic feels somewhat restrictive, you are encouraged by the dramatic, sweeping soundtrack, gorgeous characters and sparse but delightfully period writing that distinguishes itself in a sea of match 3 games.Regrettably the market is awash in cutesy, free-to-play match 3's that the price will at first appear bloated to casual players. This game has no in game currency or real world microtransactions, and there are no artificial barriers of difficulty. You either have the time and patience, or you don't. It's down to you and you're getting the full game for the lean price of its high quality content.This is the most appealing match 3 game I've ever played. I encourage you to pick up this unsung gem and explore it thoroughly.			"

												I loved Puzzle Quest, Puzzle Kingdoms and Clash of Heroes, but Gyromancer is the first game of this match-3/RPG hybrid genre that I just don't find fun at all.  There's no equipment, no choices when levelling, you only get one unit in a fight,  you can only have 3 units in your ""roster"" at a time and have to take into a map and have to pay in-game currency each time you want to replace one, the overland movement in a map is sloooow, as is the actual combat.  Some parts of a map don't open up until you defeat the boss - and then you're dumped straight to level selection so you have to start the map over from the beginning if you want to explore it further.  And the enemies in a fight don't even make moves the way you do - instead they automatically gain action points (or whateve their called) and then place countdown tiles similar to the way goons do it in Marvel Puzzle Quest.And I had to use a third party utility to limit the framerate to 60, becuase the game insisted on putting my GPU at 96% load for 800-1500fps, and the ATI drivers were as useless at forcing vsync as they always are.Really, the only reason you might want to play this game is the ""rotation"" mechanic for gem matching which I haven't seen in any other Puzzle Quest style game.  And I personally don't like it, but some might find it a refreshing change of pace.The story seemed ok so far, but I honestly don't want to keep playing the game just to find out what happens.			"

Nice puzzle-RPGA mix between RPG and Match-3 Puzzle Game.At first it was a little hard getting used to the ""twist"" system, but eventually you get the hang of it and it's very satisfying to chain large attacks and wreck your enemies :)I find it visually pleasing, with nice 2D backgrounds and monster/character illustrations.The story is kinda generic but the battles against bosses are pretty epic, specially thanks to the great boss music themes.Rest of the soundtrack is OK, with nice ambient tracks.There are plenty of monsters to unlock. Sadly, you can't get very attached to them since they all have a level limit, beyond which they won't get any stronger :( The good thing about that mechanic is that it encourages swapping and trying different monsters but yeah, you can feel a little constrained at times.The gameplay is very addictive and I enjoyed the main and post-game campaigns. There's also a kind of survival mode (I think it is unlocked when finishing the story) and you can try to complete the little achievements (mostly score-based) in every stage, if you want.- BEST:Addictive gameplay, awesome boss battlesSome post-game campaigns- WORST:Sometimes you need to use certain monstersThe amount of encounters (more in the endgame) can get cumbersomeAlso, I wish I could recruit some monster bosses and this game could get more life with achievements and trading cards.All around a solid recommendation if you enjoy the concept. I grabbed mine on a sale and it was a great buy.			"

												It may not be the best example of story-telling you've ever seen, but by jove, the gameplay more than makes up for it.If you haven't seen PopCap's 'twist' on the Match-3 genre of casual games, this will come as a total surprise.  If you have, then you may appreciate the further strategic bent this lends to the original design.Instead of swapping turns with an omniscient and overly-planning AI opponent (Puzzle Quest), the outcome of each match can be determined almost solely by the player.  Moves must be selected carefully to prevent opponent's skill gems from counting down, while also trying to detonate your own.  Features originally introduced as chains and locks make a comeback, but are used as skill results, not just randomly mixed in.Overall, don't miss this.  It's a fantastic example of how to blend two genres of gameplay into a masterful whole.			"

												Most important thing to know about this game is that it is NOT PUzzle Quest.  If you come into this game expecting something like Puzzle Quest, you will be disappointed.  Puzzle Quest is an rpg with a puzzle game as the core of it's combat system.  Gryomancer is a puzzle game with a fantasy theme and a few very light rpg items tacked on.You have skills, but they all work automatically.  Make a match (using Bejewled Twist instead of Bejeweled) and both your skill gage and the enemy's fills up.  Match your current monster's color to fill a lot fast, match the enemy's to stop it from filling at all.  Full gages turn jems into jems that do things when involved in matches if it's your, or timed jewels that go off if you dont' get rid of them if they are the enemies.That's mostly it.  There are also maps to explore and experience levels which change the rate of skill filling and different monsters you can add to your party.  The focus is more on the puzzle side with the other stuff flavoring it.Is is good?  Yes, I think it is very good.			"

												Got this game as part of the Humble Bundle because the mix of the two developing teams was very interesting to me. The Bejewled Twist mode is definitely not my favourite one, the first challenge is to understand everything based on the tutorial. The instructions are not necessarily clear, but with a little trying out, you'll get the hang of it. The difficulty grows throughout the game, but not too much. The fights aren't timed so the ability to leave your chair for a moment if necessary without having to pause the game or losing progress is a nice plus. The twelve stages are packed with monsters and repeatable ... so if you want to, you can puzzle endlessly!			"

												I was lured in by pretty graphics and match 3 gameplay. I quietly suffered through cringeworthy writing and an interface that is so bad I was amazed that any one at Square Enix allowed it to be published. I made it through an obnoxious boss battle where the guy keeps running away but the screen dramatically announces my ""DEFEAT"", then I chase him around on the silly map until he finally stops and I can go through it over (... and over and over) again. These weren't the reasons I decided to put the game away for good. What really got to me were the things added to provide a ""challenge"". I need a good challenge but there comes a point when it's not fun anymore. I'm very familiar with match 3 games and lots of them add things like locking or freezing pieces on the board or making pieces require timely removal before something bad happens. This game uses all of those but in ways that are excessive. There were too many times when a dangerous piece appeared but had a very short timer and I had no matches on the board and frequently no matching colors anywhere near the piece. So I'd have to make what the game calls ""Idle Twists"" to move the pieces where I needed them. The game makes sure you know every time you've done this by filling the screen with the words ""IDLE TWIST"" in an overly dramatic way and punishing you. It feels excessive because it's making an awfully big deal about a necessary part of the strategy. Then to top it off, when you produce a special attack piece it gets locked in place. I don't know why. It seems unnecessarily cruel. But it's fine, right? I mean, in most match 3 games that's not such a big deal but in this ""twisting"" style of game it creates big limitations and to top it off you need those pieces fairly quickly to advance but you also immediately need to get rid of the ""bad"" pieces but none of the matching colors you need are on the board or if they are you still need to slowly nudge them over while getting punished with every careful and tedious click. On some boards I played I had absolutely no chance of winning because of the game's design and algorithms. That wouldn't have been so annoying if a loss didn't mean such a heavy penalty as it does in this game because of the ""rpg"" elements. I just wanted to play a cool twisty match 3 with a fantasy story and pokemon-like pet collecting and nice pictures. That's not what this is. This is a game that hates the players and wants us to suffer.Tl;dr: I feel like the people who made this game didn't have an understanding of what makes a match 3 game fun to play.			"

												I played this game all the way through when it first came out on the xbox 360. This is my favorite puzzle FPG game.The map is very primitive but the gameplay makes up for it. The monsters slowly increase in difficulty but you never feel like a battle is impossible. Unlike other puzzle games that restrict the board layout or prevent invalid moves, this does neither. If you perform valid moves  in a row your multiplier goes up. If you get stuck you can do an invalid move to set up for more plays. The only penalty is a reduction in the multiplier.There is a lot of variety to your roster and the effects are nice as well.The only downsides are that the audio is choppy and there is no native controller support. I was able to create a controller mapping in Pinnacle Game Profiler in about 10 minutes that matched how it played on the xbox.			"

												Gyromancer is a solid puzzle game that combines a simple crystal matching system with an adventure mode and selectable creatures that bring a tactical advantage to each match.  The music is well done and the artwork is very good although cutscenes do not use any animations and are mostly reliant on text updates.  The Steam Overlay is supported but widescreen modes are not, resulting in a letterboxed image and squished aspect ratios on the intro splash videos.  While these minor issues are irritating, they are not enough to prevent me from recommending this title to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, particularly fans of Pokemon or Magic the Gathering will find the tactical system adds an extra layer of interest to an otherwise fairly standard puzzle game system.  While not an essential title to anyone's collection Gyromancer a competent entry in the puzzle genre.			"

												Gyromancer is a new take on the traditional puzzle game. There is a collector's aspect to it, where you can find new creature to use in ""battle"", as well as a leveling system. The basic gameplay is that you can rotate a quadrant of symbols to the right, if they create a group of three like symbols, those disappear and add to your attack points. Once you get enough attack points for a given move, it will automatically trigger and either damage your opponent or initialize a different effect, such as poison or lower armor. This is a game where time doesn't matter as much as accuracy. If you make a rotation that doesn't chain symbols your opponent's attack points significantly increase. The story is not super in depth, but I don't think it is the force that drives the gameplay, so I am fine with it. The variety in creatures/moves makes the game semi-replayable, though you could just switch them out often to get a feel for each one (as I did.) Outside of the puzzle portion of the game is a game-board setup where you move your character around the board attempting to find the goal. On the board are bosses, new creature tokens and challenges. Challenges are set boards that have a goal, and once you reach that goal you get to move on. Overall I really enjoyed Gyromancer, especially for those situations where you are only playing 10-20 minutes and can't get too involved into a game. If you are a fan of puzzle games I would definitely add this to your library, you won't be disappointed.			"

												A mix of pokemon and bejewled, Gyromancer is part of SquareEnix's initative to branch out and away from the tried and true Final Fantasy Formula that they've built over the years, and spreading their eggs to other baskets like this hopefully pays off.

It exploded one weekend at first she was like, I feel very sick and we took her to the doctor and the doctor said she was fine. Then it exploded and she felt better. Then she felt alot worse and so we took her to the hospital. The hospital didn't have anything good on TV and so I played much Gyromancer. I am fairly proficient now in Gyromancy, I took the skill. A gay nurse commented to me telling me I looked like a sexy golfer. I am uncomfortable with the feelings I had in that moment.			"

												I was expecting this to be a little more like the Puzzle Quest series of match 3's where I could actively decide to use spells to manipulate the board/damage the enemy. Instead, after a few hours of playing I find out that you match endlessly, and the different ""spells"" all do basically the same things: blow up a small area, blow up a large area, blow up rows and/or columns, freeze or lock specific tiles, change one color to another. As others have mentioned it gets repetitive very quickly. I was fortunate enough to not have the game crash on me or wipe my save - but at this point it doesn't really matter as I have no incentive to continue playing.Another element that I did not like about this game was that the AI never took a turn, so you are endlessly rotating tiles. AI just casts a spell after *you* take enough turns that don't involve matching the AI's color. Very boring and lazy on the part of the devs.Very disappointed in this collaboration. Got this on the steam sale so I didn't spend much, but I also didn't get much out of it either.			"

												Square Enix AND PopCap?  Oh yeah, I figured this game would be awesome!  Boy was I wrong.The graphics are OK.  I don't expect puzzle games to be winning awards for revolutionary graphics.  What I saw was acceptable and fit with the game just fine.  If I wanted a theatrical production with my game I'd be playing Final Fantasy 23 or whatever it is up to now.    The plot I didn't pay much attention to as I skipped later cut scenes after the first one.  I don't see how anyone can come up with an engrossing plot for a matching game.   What of it I did pay attention to was adequate.  You are the Good Guy on a Quest to stop the Bad Guy who has done Bad Things.  You meet someone I assume will be your Companion and a possible Love Interest.  You choose three monsters from a pool at your disposal to battle mobs on various maps.  Now go match stuff and beat the Bad Guy. There is your plot.  Ta-daa.I did not find the tutorial very helpful.  It seems that it was trying to explain too much while you are playing the tutorial, making you pause between each move so you don't really get a feel for the flow of the game or a concept of the rules.  I went through the thing twice and left it thinking it was a turn-based game when, in fact, you are the only one making moves.  If you match colors that correspond with your opponent, you give them the 'energy.'  I prefer written tutorials followed by a short video support.  This one was like watching a movie while someone was talking and hitting the pause button.  Annoying, to say the least.Music in games is not generally a factor for me.  I tend to decrease the sound (I use a headset) so I can hear what is going on around me.  Sometimes I leave it on higher than normal for me if it is really good, but in this case, I found the background music absolutely awful.  I could not mute the music on this game fast enough.  I removed my headset so I did not have to suffer it further while I desparetely searched for the Options menu to silence what sounded like a large bag of cats.I also greatly dislike the one-way twist mechanic about this game.  I would prefer that it at least allowed you to rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise.  When I play standard Match 3 games, I can move the objects to be matched in more than one direction, so why not here?  For me, the twisting is already bad enough but I am restricted to just one direction?  Ugh.Shame on me for not doing more research on Gyromancer before I purchased it, but at least it was on sale so I am not out the full price for something I will be uninstalling from my machine and trying to repress in my personal memory.

												I started off reasonably optimistic about this Puzzle Quest like game.I thought that using twists was a very clever way of mixing up the old formula - give it enough time and you will see the patterns that make some twists work. The ability gems that spawn on the board are a workable mechanic but not great nor bad.But there's one mechanic that completely ruined the game for me. ""Idle twists"" - a move where you don't make any matches. The penalties for an idle twist are so severe, that you are hurt so bad in taking a turn off to make a huge combo the next turn, that you'd be better off just making match-3s the whole time, just to avoid the idle twist penalty. This discourages high skill play that would otherwise count on setting up these combos. Maybe I overreacted slightly - one can still find ways to move around the board in subtle ways with match-3s and still potentially set up combos.... But I still stand by it limiting gameplay, instead of fostering higher skill play.The plot/dialog is super iffy, but no big deal if what you're trying to get out of this game is match-3. The user interface on the map (outside of battle) is pretty crappy, but just be glad that you don't spend too much time there. All in all, I can't call Gyromancer bad, and the price point is set correctly.  But some poor design decisions leave me scratching my head wondering why I don't play Puzzle Quest instead.			"

(Yeah, I use Joy2Key.) That alone is enough reason for me to not recommend the game (because this laziness has to stop).I can't comment on the rest of the game, because of these two reasons I won't play much further. Come on PopCap, you can do better than that!			"

												This type of market for bejewelled clones right now, is fairly cut throat with some hugely successful ones, and others which don't really cut the grade.   Gyromancers defense is the game is 6 years old now - and I guess back then, it was good but these days with games like Huniepop showing how a good match 3 puzzle game really is...it makes games like this one, just look old and antiquated. I like the RPG aspects of this game, and it tries to take an interesting direction with the bejewelled style gameplay, however the actual excution of the game just doesn't work too well.  They really should have stuck with a traditional style of selecting gems instead of a fairly poor rotate 'clockwise' system which makes the game far harder than it really needs to be.Then throw in enemies who can summon ability gems constantly, giving the player a very limited amount of time in order to break the enemy ability gem, and most of the time - its nearly impossible too, leaves a very sour experience.   This game would have been so much better if they went with a traditional matching system instead of the rotating system.			"

												Interesting concept, bad execution.Bad UI, several bad design choices (why do I exit levels after I beat them and they have to replay them :| ). The game is slightly repetitive and grindy, and quite slow. Game would be better if it had a bit higher pace, less of a grind.Worst though is the crash bugs. Don't play fullscreen, but even in windowed, the game crashes occationally. Very frustrating.			"

												Didn't like it.   The Bejewel-esque fights as you progressed through the game just got longer and tedious and the puzzle solving elements got more tedious as the game droned on.  The map controls were unintuitive and seemed like they were designed for a tablet device.  Save your money for something better.			"

												Well, it's got music that is too hyped up for a game where you can walk out and do something for several hours. It often seems to have rendering problems or just straight up crashes if you have a second monitor. The third PC I have tried to play it on is much more stable, but could not tell you why (it still crashes though). I find it very odd something that has so little to render has a problem with simple tasks. As far as RPGs go, Rivel may be the most faceless character Square has come up with yet.Don't worry about the story. I don't get it either. At least not three levels in, which is as far as I seem to get without giving up on the crashing.			"

												I haven't played much, so I'll update if my impression changes, but...I wanted to like this game. I got it in a humble bundle and wasn't expecting much, but it seemed like it would be a fun little time waster. I like match 3 games well enough for a little mindless, positive feedback fun. And I like rpgs/story games. So I hoped it would be more amusing than the standard bejeweled-type game. But either I rushed through the tutorial, or it just did not explain well enough. I can't seem to figure out the specifics. I make matches, trying to maximize the gem matches for my creature's affinity - sometimes I win quickly, other times I'm overwhelmed quickly. And I haven't figured out why yet. I know a little more of the mechanics than I'm typing here - their are gem color affinities, and good/bad enemy match ups, etc. - but the flow of ""battle"" still seems mostly out of my control. I'll try playing a little more, with a more serious mindset, to see if it suddenly clicks. But it really doesn't seem like the type of game you _want_ to give that much thought to - I doubt the end payoff is worth the effort. Sad to say I can't recommend it. But I will update if my impression changes.			"

												PopCap and Square Enix is actually a brilliant combination. But this game is not. It adds the casual gameplay of PopCap and about 30% of the depth of the SE games into one package, but... they missed one vital thing: it's all been done before. It's nothing new.Yes you can level, yes you can collect creatures but in the end it's just a 'match 3' game like all the others out there. And somehow it lacks the fun factor of other, similar, games. It just didn't pull me in. Try Plants vs Zombies or Peggle instead.[Rating: 64/100]			"

												This game takes way too long to finish for a match 3 game.Gist of the game:You play a match 3 to fill up your monster's attack bar, then you match the glowing gem to attack the enemy monster.  A match game can end very quickly.The problem: monsters have levels, you will hit the level cap and will be unable to keep your monster to fight in the next level.  You will also have to level up pretty high to beat some of the ""farm/grind"" monsters.  Speaking of which, they respawn every time you leave the map.  You are forced to leave the map after each boss fight, so when you re-enter the same world, you have to fight all the low level monsters all over again, which takes a lot of time.To fully explore each world, you would probably spend many many hours because of the interruptions from the low level monsters, thus it just becomes a boring grind.

												Well this one is a close one because I don't like to thumbs down a game just because it's not my cup of tea.   This Bejewelled ripoff (offical - it's from PopCap) has a little story and some other mechanics which make it better than Bejewelled, so it's got that going for it, which is nice.However, it's basically a browser/tablet game.  As far as tablet games go, the quality is quite high.  But it's a tablet game! What is it doing on Steam!!  No support for advanced graphics, no option to even change the game resolution.  If you're a man and don't want to be caught playing Bejewelled, but can't resist the pretty gems and shiny colours, then there's enough veneer of mythology glued on around this one that you could argue to your imaginary girlfriend convincingly that you're still a man.Otherwise, it's Bejewelled, and it doesn't have PC game qualities.

												A dull, poor man's Puzzle Quest. I only bought it because it was on sale and those PQ games were/are still at a high price point. In this game you battle with yourself... that's it! There's no competition with the computer even in the so-called 'campaign', no skirmish mode, no multiplayer, nothing! It's ridiculous cause even Tetris on the NES had a mode were you could battle the AI and that was my favorite thing to do, same thing in Puzzle Quest, going through the campaign, defeating the ever increasing AI. Also, the way you 'battle' is not intuitive as Puzzle Quest's, the way of handling the chain reactions isn't either. At the end, this is nothing more than a sugar coated Bejeweled. Don't fall for it!			"

												I have to say that this game - unlike for example Puzzle Quest 1 or Puzzle Kingdoms - quite a few times made me scream in horror at how random, unfair it can be; leaving you without control.See, in this game you play alone. There are no moves done by the computer, basically you just rotate stuff (in one direction only) and pray for a good outcome. Then a bit later into the game there's this thing ""Idle twist"" - sometimes you just can't match anything, and you get PUNISHED for this.Bonus games - create a x8 combo (later one) - it is of course doable, but to set the whole thing up is like the greatest pain in the butt, fighting with the game's mechanics.And then there's the length of the game - it surely outstays it's welcome for my taste. 15hrs of stupid rotating and I'm somewhere halfway through, although I have to admit I've wasted some time unlocking ""rewards"" (nothing rewarding, no sense of accomplishment, trust me). But at least it's looking better than Puzzle Quest 2 which was even longer and tiring, I'll give you that.5/10, weak puzzle game, too random and repetitive			"

												I started liking the game but out of nowhere and for no other reason than to mess with you, the game difficulty escalates and starts to punish you for moves that are part of the strategy. Considering that you don't have any influence on what blocks appear next, I find it unfair that the game punishes me for ""idle moves"" when they are part of preparing sets. The only good point that still remains for me is the art is done nice and the story so far seems okay. Gives you purpose to play but when your creature has an attribute bonus on the enemy, it shouldn't die easily.			"

												Not worth the aggrivation at any price point. It's a very basic match 3 with a RPG ""skin"" and a few usable items to affect the play field, your ""enemy"" doesn't even make any moves they just attack you if you match the wrong kind of gems.Main problem is this game is not stable, every 10-15 minutes the game will freeze or crash to desktop, seem to happen in both windowed mode and full screen mode. Maybe it work better on some systems, guess it's an older game but judging by the forums I'm not the only one with this issue, ultimately the game is not worth trying to figure out what the problem is for me at least, I'll just refund it myself before I pass the 2 hour mark.

I'll probably keep giving it a try, but, ehhh....[EDIT]I kept trying.  It crashes consistently for me, enough so that I can't complete the first level.  I can't even get far enough into the first level to feel like the end is in sight, and what little gameplay I've been able to find is riddled with minor imperfections that make me wonder if this was tested at all.The interface and gameplay just don't feel good, and the program itself doesn't work.

It's a very basic match 3 with a RPG ""skin"" and a few usable items to affect the play field, your ""enemy"" doesn't even make any moves they just attack you if you match the wrong kind of gems.Main problem is this game is not stable, every 10-15 minutes the game will freeze or crash to desktop, seem to happen in both windowed mode and full screen mode. Maybe it work better on some systems, guess it's an older game but judging by the forums I'm not the only one with this issue, ultimately the game is not worth trying to figure out what the problem is for me at least, I'll just refund it myself before I pass the 2 hour mark. So would not reccomend it.			"

												This game is basically Bejeweled Twist. If you hated that game, you'll probably hate this one. If you loved Twist, then this is a nice extension of that type of game play with a storyline and beasts that you fight against each other. The story feels flat but I play it because I like Bejeweled games.			"
