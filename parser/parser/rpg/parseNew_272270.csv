												PS:T remains one of my top 5 all time favorite games. I reviewied it many years ago on GamesDomain. So of course I backed this game. I've been playing RPGs since the original Wizardry. I watched a couple of videos but avoided playing the demo because I wanted the entire experience at once. I was truly excited to play this one.And...meh. If there was a ""meh"" button on Steam, this game would be the poster child for it. The first problem the game encounters are the expectations. When you name your game the same as one of the most beloved RPG of all time you're setting the bar quite high. There's no way for an experienced PS:T player to play this and not think of the original. It doesn't deserve the name Torment so I'll refer to it as Tides.Normally I'd talk about the graphics, the sounds, the quests, the bugs, the pros and cons of the game. That's my normal MO. But I can't do it in this case. So let me tell you why it finally got a thumbs down from me.Sure it's linear - but so was Torment.Sure there are bugs (like the combat freeze bug - inexcusable) but those will get patched out.Sure the graphics can get muddled. But those are acceptable.Sure there are exceptionally annoying sequences (not really combat) in the game that if you don't have the correct build you will struggle to get through.Nope, those aren't the problem.The game commits the cardinal sin of being unmemorable. How? Let me provide a few examples. The NPCs are all fairly dull. People still remember Morte, Annah, Fall-From-Grace, Dak'kon and Ingus. I haven't played that game in 10 years and can rattle off the characters. I finished Tides a week ago and can't remember one character name. I guess you could chalk that up as a Senior Moment but the characters aren't even worth the time to talk to. Plus there are some very weak NPCs that you simply should avoid. There was no attachment to any of them by the end of the game and that's a darn shame. I HAD to pull Morte out of that pile of skulls 15 years ago. There was no such urgency or attachment in Tides.Remember the Morgue? Farods? The Upper Ward? Curst? Torment had some great set areas each with a different feel. In fact, if you go look at the screenshots of the upcoming remastered version the areas look awesome. Tides? There's one - the Bloom - and that's about it. The main town just seems like a collection of different ideas with no coherency at all. Other areas aren't memorable at all. Like the NPCs, the world isn't very interesting. Go to the Tides website - or better yet, just Google - the Tides wallpapers. Those captured the imagination. The actual set designs were so flat and dull as compared to those it's mind boggling how poorly executed the art design is.But the worst, most cardinal sin is the writing. It's writing for writing's sake. It's like a student trying to pad their essay to get to the magical 1,000 word count. Much like this review, it just goes on and on and says nothing new. You started off in Torment with some fairly extensive dialog but it wasn't overwhelming. Only later - as you got more engrossed into the world - did it explain more and more to you. Torment built up the world, word by word, until you were fully engrossed. Tides just spews dialog at the player without ever really taking the time to set everything up. Thus it has little meaning and no emotional impact.Now next week a remastered version of Torment will be released. You can get the existing game for half the price of this one and it's a far, far superior product. Tyranny, another RPG recently released, is a superior product. Now maybe they'll create an enhanced edition with new NPCs, areas and dialog that makes Tides into something more. But until that happens, I'd say you have better options for your money.			"

												I was very excited for this game when the kickstarter was announced (4 years ago!!!) and backed it for $250 dollars.  I have been playing isometric crpgs since the 90s, and have always loved games like Baldur's Gate 1&2, Icewind Dale 1&2, and of course Planescape: Torment, the game that originally inspired this one. This review is both a commentary on the game itself, as well as inExile as a company.  First, to inExile - you can skip a few paragraphs below if you're just interested in the game. In 2013, inExile was happy to take backers money to make this game, and slated the delivery for T:ToN in December of 2014.  They made about four times as much money as they set their funding goal at, and as stretch goals made many promises about added content to their backers.  Ultimately, it seems that many of those promises have not been kept, which is disappointing, but forgivable if the game is well-made at the end of that process and the company is communicative with the people who helped to fund the project. However, after the kickstarter funded and pledges from people like me were locked in, inExile announced that they were changing the combat system from Real-time-with-pause (RTwP) to Turn-based (TB) mechanics.  They announced that this was to better fit the mood of the game.  That claim is very dubious, as the 90s game that they are basing this sequel off of (Planescape: Torment) has a RTwP combat system.  ""What can change the nature of a game?""  Well, an obvious answer would be to change one of the fundamental mechanics of the game.  Personally, I would never have donated money to inExile for Torment had I known they were planning to make a TB game.  But why would inExile make such a fundamental change for a fan-funded game that so many people felt so passionately about?  At first, this was not obvious, and it really wasn't until the game was coming close to release that I really understood.  From a business standpoint, RTwP combat-based games have one major issue.  They require a mouse and keyboard, and are therefore mostly a PC-friendly market.  TB games, on the other hand, are easily adaptable to controller-based game play and have a wider distribution on consoles.   Since inExile is releasing XBox ONE and PS4 adaptations of this game, it is fair to say that they chose to screw their fan-funders for a market friendly combat system.  Adaptations to new systems cost money, and so it is even more frustrating to find that inExile has cut a massive amount of content from this game that was promised during the fund-raising phase on kickstarter.  Over a four year development cycle, they made no announcements to their backers about cut content, even though it is now clear that they spent a lot of that money that was supposed to be used to create that content on console ports, and actually only let backers know that anything had changed in the game about a month before the game released. The cut content included promised characters, an entire city, and while I personally have not finished it, reports indicate that the game is relatively short for a crpg.  During that time without communication to their fans about the dropped content, inExile raised millions of dollars from two other crowd-funded projects - Bard's Tale IV and Wasteland 3.  In addition to cuts from the game, inExile also gave a worse deal to fans who purchased a collectors edition during the kickstarter than those who purchased it at release, and also cut a promised Italian localization in order to ship this game to consoles.  Game Review:Story 9/10: This is where this game shines - it is well written and the interactions between objects/characters in the game is fascinating.  In places it is badly in need of an editor, but after playing for about 5 hours, it is clear that the game story lives up to - but does not surpass - the game that it is trying to emulate.  The protagonist is not as well characterized as the Nameless One from PS:T, which detracts from the immersion. The major focus of this game is to tell a unique, strange story in as much depth as it can, and it succeeds in keeping your interest.  If you like to read, 95% of the game play is reading text in the vein of a choose your own adventure novel. Well done here. Graphics/Interface 5/10:  There is no way to change how fast the interface moves with a mouse scroll - presumably because the game has been adapted for console-controller play.  This is inexcusable, as the game is run on the Pillars of Eternity engine, a game that was released in 2015, and that game had the option to adjust the mouse scroll.  The 2D backgrounds are beautiful, the character models and animations are not.  Character's momentum/inertia during movement is incredibly distracting, and the strange need for the camera to follow your character is very odd for this style of game.  Altogether, these things add up to a very frustrating interface that slows the pace of the game down.  For a game with a 4 year development cycle, it feels like I am playing an alpha build.  Combat 2/10:  Even for a TB game, the combat mechanics are incredibly weak.  Divinity OS, which I played for a very short amount of time, had an excellent TB system that used action points to define your movement and abilities.  You could do anything in any order, so long as you had sufficient AP to perform the task.  Torment uses a simplified mechanic where each character gets one movement and one action.  When you choose an action, or move your character, there is no way to confirm it or take it back, so if you misclick, you are screwed.  By modern standards, this is just pathetic.  Additionally, in virtually every combat you will find yourself highly outnumbered, and this is the game's way of telling you that you should just settle everything with conversations.  If you do find yourself in combat, you need to win on the first round, as the enemies will simply target your protagonist on their first available turn and kill him/her, sending you to the mind labyrinth.  Additionally, because combat is fairly rare, you will most likely have no idea how to use your abilties to their full effect.  This is incredibly disappointing, as the other crpg revival game that is currently on the market, Pillars of Eternity, has a very innovative RTwP combat system that is a true spiritual successor to other isometric RPG games. My other personal beef with TB-combat is that it is SOO SLOOOW!!  RTwP battles can be finished in just a few minutes, even when the combat is challenging.  TB always takes considerably more time, even for trivial battles.  Torment is no exception to that rule.  Torment is not a bad game, but it doesn't feel like it is a finished game.  It would be an excellent game if it had been released 20 years ago, but compared to all of the other crpg nostalgia releases that have come out over the past five years, it is one of the weaker ones.  This is many due to clunky interface, and poor combat mechanics.  I'm very disappointed that inExile chose to enhance their distribution instead of trying to stay true to what their fans wanted.  This half-baked game is the result.  I will not be supporting them in the future.			"

												EDIT: Revised significantly.I backed the Kickstarter campaign early on, and have been looking forward to Torment: Tides of Numenara for years. And, having played it for several hours, I have to say I'm quite disappointed.Generally speaking, the game designers seem to have neglected game mechanics to concentrate on narrative. That would have been a credible tradeoff -- but frankly, the storytelling isn't very good.After nine hours of play, I realized that I don't care about the protagonist or his predicament, I don't care about the antagonist, and I don't care about the protagonist's companions. Each has a narrative; none has a personality.If you've played table-top role-playing games much, or online role-playing, you're likely to have met an enthusiastic but inexperienced player who has written out an elaborate back story, and then reads it out at the first opportunity. But no matter how well-written that backstory is in itself, it's a static element, and not an interaction that builds a relation between characters in a dynamic story. The NPCs in the game are like this: all static backstory, with little interactivity.The game opens with a classic setup: the protagonist has no memory, and is in a crisis. This is a classic precisely because it forges a bond between player and character, based on their common interest in getting answers to the obvious questions. But, that crisis is quickly resolved, and immediately after, you get the basic answers to your questions, and several strong hints that completing the main quest really isn't in your best interests at all. All the virtues of this classic storytelling opening are quickly abandoned, and you're left with only an arbitrary main quest that the protagonist has no real motivation to pursue.It doesn't seem to get any better after that. Everything confirms that initial impression; nothing hints at an alternate interpretation. The companions are flat and dull, and offer no additional motivation.In general, the writing feels like a compilation of creative writing class exercises with no organic connection between them.It concerns me that whether TTON is remembered as a success or a failure, it will be regarded as such for the wrong reason. Many reviewers, professional or amateur, seem to accept the idea that TTON is about elevating writing over gameplay, so that if it's a failure, it's because players want only hack-and-slash power fantasies, and if it's a success, it's because this is the kind of writing we like. But in my opinion, it's a failure, precisely because it fails in its primary emphasis, as an interactive story.The real tragedy is that many of us supported this project because we saw an opportunity to send the game industry a message that we want intelligent, mature interactive stories, and we were willing to provide all the resources needed to make them. That opportunity was squandered.			"

Early Access Review
								Beta review - 26.01.16You can't help comparing Tides of Numenera with its spiritual predecessor Planescape: Torment. For good or ill, this is not PS:T 2. Without Avellone, there is a noticeable shift in writing and the setting itself greatly differs from Planescape. I had worried that it would be a pale imitation, a weak creation that mimics but does not understand what made Planescape: Torment so great.I was wrong. I am not very far in the game, but after having talked to many NPCs and finished several quests, I feel like I have a good gauge of Tides of Numenera.1. The writing is superb. I still miss Avellone, but the new writers raise many interesting questions about legacy, always finding a new unusual facet to explore and introduce you to. It's not a shallow game, which comes as a great relief to me.2. The choices are introspective. The game not only asks what you would do, but why and how? It is very refreshing to be asked to ponder on my motives, especially compared to Pillars of Eternity, whose choices took a more results and action oriented view.3. The gameplay and combat looks promising. I can't say more, as the game is yet unbalanced and I only experienced 2 crisises yet. 4. Bugs and lack of optimization. Currently, the game lags pretty hard 3-year old gaming laptop. The loading times are exruciating. Smaller levels need 3-5 minutes, the big marketplace requires whole 10-15 minutes. Overall, I recommend the game, but only buy it right now if you have either an extremely powerful PC or a lot of patience for the loading times. I had the patience, but doubt that many other people will.			"

												Torment: Tides of Numenera is an experience. It is a vast, sprawling world of strange and bizarre sensations. Filled with wonder and horror. It is a very wide and deep world that allows you to dig into all kinds of strange backstory and really learn the setting and the people and creatures inhabiting it.Frankly it is a very good argument to try out Monte Cook`s tabletop version. It is also a rather poor game, unfortunately.As i mentioned, the world, the canvas on which this game is painted can be explored, poked and prodded like no other game i can remember in at least the last ten years. That part is exceptional and memorable. The story itself is...good. Not great or amazing but good.But everything else from the graphics to the UI to the combat to the utilization of the PnP ruleset is lacklustre and uninspired and/or cut. I have seen the Devs argue about making the cuts for the benefit of the story, that they had to do it this way to make it fit properly. And i dont believe them. I would like to do so but the state of the game would be obvious, should have been obvious at least a year back and yet they said nothing. A month ago they did tell us some content was cut but did not mention all the other cuts that happened. Lies by omission may not strictly be lies but they certainly dont engender trust.Torment: Tides of Numenera is an elegy to halfassed shoddy work in almost every aspect but the world and story, which admittedly are the two most important parts of a RPG but that cant make up for all the other failings.Do i regret Kickstarting this game?...No, i dont.Would i have Kickstarted it even knowing what i do now?...Yes.But that is because this is exactly the kind of experience that i love. And even then i have to think it through before i answer in the positive.In the end Torment behaves like a game that was made by people that would rather write a visual novel. Four years and millions of dollars was spent on Torment and the game part of it show no evidence of that at all.To sum it up: Do you love Planescape: Torment`s story and weird worldscape? Then you might like Torment: Tides of Numenera too.Do you want to play a RPG game? Then i cant recommend Torment: Tides of Numenera.And ultimately i believe most people want to play a RPG game.			"

												So full discosure, I was a huge fan of Planescape: Torment, as well as all the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games and kickstarted this game back in the day.Skip to the bottom for a TL : DRI really want to reccomend this game, based on my history with the genre and the devs, however I simply cannot, especially at the current price, and after the amount of time it was in development and the amount of kickstarter money that went into it, I can only say it was a massive disapointment in nearly every regard.- Giving credit where credit is due, the world is fantastic, and intriguing, unfortunetly this is not an original part of the game, they simply lisensed Monte cook's Numanera setting, though this was a great choice.- The main problem I have, is that despite the setting, there is no game here. It's a puzzle, and an easy one at that. There are mayble a half dozen mandatory combats in the whole of the game and most of them are more puzzly than combat anyhow, which would be fine if there was any sort of challenge persented.  The problem I have is not the puzzles themselves, but that simply taking a balanced party (one specialist in each of might, speed and intellect), which most gamers will do naturally, makes every challenge and crisis laughably easy  - Puzzles are good, not having to fight things is interesting, when the ""puzzle"" to avoid the fight is a single line of dialog with a percentage chance to pass or fail, and its nearly impossible to fail, ya dun farked up the game design son.- The other problem is, for a game that is supposed to be about player choice, your choices mean very little, and dialog options are more about solving a puzzle than adding any depth to the story or meaningful character development. Also there are a dozen insta-deaths in game, with no warning, for choices where you have done similar actions before. Great game design there lou.  I will admit, the ability to die in the intro, which I discovered by accident, was very amusing, it still comes from the pants-on-head school of game design choice - Because the choices don't do anything other than solve puzzles and the game is almost entirely linear, there is little to no replay value, unless you want to change a few lines of text in the credits screen, and not much change at that.- The graphics which aren't background are mediocre at best, however the backgrounds are gorgeous.- You can't use many movement type skills, which would be great for stealth, outside of combat, nor, as far as I can tell, can you seperate your party members to make sneaking about easier.-  You cannot survive the ending without screwing either the world or all of your friends, regardless of in game actions, and this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t trend in story driven games that needs to end. On my first ending choice, I both screwed over the general populace and was remembered for my generosity and self-sacrifice... WTF? Another trend, the in game choices meaning nothing except for a few lines of dialog at side of the credits screen while the whole of the ending being decided by one choice at the end, is present here as well, though there are happily more choices than in Mass Effect 3.  None of these would be a problem if there were much of a game to play through, sadly there isn't.- The only ""exploration"" is holding down the tab key to look for items and interations, there are no optional areas apart from a ""secret"" room or two and the game is almost entirely linear, even the sidequests are all completed by just checking out all the locations and talking to people in the areas you go for the main story.- The game is only 15 hours long, I took 17.1 according to steam doing every sidequest + pixel♥♥♥♥♥ing for treasure and  save scumming for the endings, since once again, your ending is decided by a choice after the last boss, not your actions in game, so you an experience every major ending by simply loading the auto save before the ending choice. - To make a comparison, Pillars of Eternity has a larger world, longer playtime, just as much if not more (and arguably better) story and a much more entertaining and versatile gameplay experience and was made for less money and in considerably less time.TL : DR - Buy if you want an expensive, over-produced puzzle with high end indie quality and gorgeous scenery, avoid at all costs if you were looking for a AAA experience in the vein of the old Bioware Infinity engine games and buy Pillars of Eternity instead.

Early Access Review
								As a 33 year old lawyer I consider myself somewhat of a ""stealth gamer"". It took my girlfriend 9 months to find out that I like video games... Due to a busy work schedule my Steam time is somewhat limited so I normally don't squander it writing reviews. But for this game I will make an exception. I was not familiar with the Numenera universe before playing the early access version of this game. (I still don't feel ""familiar"" after completing the early access version.) I consider myself a diehard planescape fan and couldn't suppress the feeling that the developers simply couldn't afford or wouldn't dish out the necessary funds to use the the planescape universe and make a ""real successor"" to Plancescape Torment.Boy, was I wrong!After playing this for 22.5 hours it went from my ""I'll look into it"" pile to my ""dear god, no more delays"" pile. The writing is simply stellar. The characters have incredible depth. The themes are mature and compelling. The developers have avoided the infamous genre pitfalls and clichés (""avenge loved ones, rescue princess, save the world""). Tides of Numenara is without a doubt the most original rpg I have ever played. I hope that the decision to make the game available across many different platforms will make it more available to audiences, who have avoided the rpg genre due to the above-mentioned clichés. In my view, this title shows that great art comes in many forms - even in the form of a video game.If you truly enjoyed Planescape Torment this is for you. "

Planescape: Torment, arguably the best RPG ever made. The game with cult following and, when it comes to story, nearly no contenders out there.A new challenger appears -  Torment: Tides of Numenera, the game from the people behind PS:T. Will it prove that the heights of PS:T can be reached, that people still can make games with unique setting and strong personal story? Will it be a spiritual successor to highly aclaimed RPG?Plot twist, it won't and here is why (in the form of the glorious WALL OF TEXT).Spoiler-free tl:dr version at the end.WritingWhat can change the writing of the game?Main PlotThe main plot revolves around The Last Castoff or better to say it doesn't. It revolves around the Resonance Chamber, a macguffin to fix it all, stop the menacing Sorrow and save all the Castoffs. The premise drops to much information (in the form of walls of text upon walls of text) and the game for the next 5-10 hours has nothing to add to the plot, aside from go there he/she knows. Everything from there on adds to the exposition of the weird things in the world. World building is important, yes, but it is essential to establish rules of the world and in T:ToN there are none. Psyonics. Timetravel. Constructs. Nanomachines. All of it is just there for the sake of being and all of it is presented , you can guess, through walls of text.After 10 hours of reading I asked myself, what was it I was supposed to do? The game presents no urgency, there is no menace. It contradicts what it tells you in the beginning. Then, there is a plot twist, which should have shifted the focus from Resonance Chamber and feel the urgency to act fast, but it doesn't. It is simply presented and the player suddenly has to care about it. And after 10 more hours there is another plot twist and more exposition as to provide the motivation of the villain (finally).The ending is presented in a style of Mass Effect 3: you did a lot of stuff throughout the game but it doesn't matter, choose an option. And it ends.CompanionsPS:T had a wide range of non-typical companions with unique personalities and ties to the protagonist in one way or another. A talking skull, tiefling, githzerai, a piece of armor and it is without saying anything about their personalities. Just the appearance.T:ToN has humans. All of them. And that tells you something from the very beginning. Their stories are bland, their unique quests are just ""carry me around and at a certain point I'll tell you something"" and that's basicaly it. Their arcs (if you can call their stories that) end abruptly and give no satisfaction.Writing itselfThe game has been advertised having word count higher than the Bible and that's not an exageration. Word count is too damn high. Everything in T:ToN drops a wall of text upon the player, for right and wrong reasons. The game lacks editors hand, who would have cut half of the text.Such word count would be okay if it delivered something superb, unique and interesting. Instead, it spills nonsense and amateurish purple prose.It does get better by the second half of the game, because the amount of text is significantly reduced, but by that time, you will be tired of it all.GameplayI may be bested in battle, but I shall never be waiting for 10 minutes for enemy's turn to endSkillchecks or Effort systemIn T:ToN attributes (Might, Speed, Intelegence) are presented in forms of pools. Each pool can be used to increase the chance to succeed in skillcheck (either in combat or dialogue). The player can replenish the pool by resting or using special items.Starts as an interesting mechanic and ends as a easy way to bypass and win at everything. Companion pool in 50% of events can be used in checks, items to replenish pools are everywhere making skillchecks a joke.CombatDevelopers wanted to improve the combat as opposed to PS:T. They failed.The combat is bad as in worse than in 99. Enemy turns take forever (literaly as AI can simply freeze and do nothing forcing to reload). There wouldn't be any problem if combat, as it was stated, was really optional. It is not. There are forced situations, which can be finished without killing anyone, but are nonetheless buggy and force to reload time and time again.Character classesThere are 3 classes and the only one you have to consider is Nano (aka Mage). Why? Because 60% of skillchecks are Intelegence bassed. Going with anything else results in failing checks and combat. And why combat is bad? Check above.ArtdirectionOur progenitor was funny like that. Substance for the next location was always a last minute decision.LocationsLet's go location after location.Sagus Cliffs - a place where everything is an attraction. Here you see a strange looking clock, there you see a strange generator, here a strange fountain with fish-like creatures instead of water, there a soundproof building and a place of diplomacy. It is so obsessed with little things that it fails as a whole.Valley of the Dead Heroes - a place of backer content. Though the most generic location, it has the most interesting quest - Endless Gate (which appears out of nowhere, sadly).Bloom - the only location in the game that feels consistent in what it is. The art is solid and supports the narative.Oasis - nothing to say about it, 'cause it has been cut.Calm - there's not much of it but it looks okay primary because of the fanthoms.Overall, in comparison to Pillars of Eternity, locations feel cheep and lowres.UIIt is atrocious. The inventory has no sorting. Trade screen has no appropriate buttons and has ""it's not a bug but a feature"" feel. Dialogue interface takes a lot of screen space but only 50% of it is text box. CYOA sequences have no proper scaling of elements and thus look like an indie project with low budget.All in all, as one man said, it looks like a Winamp skin.PortraitsJust plain bad. They had great portraits in alpha-beta build and changed them to low effort paint over photo. Moreover, none of the NPCs have portraits, though in alpha they were there.Bonus section. inXile's communication or lack of thereofIt was mentioned time and time again - cut content, which was promised during kickstarter campaign. It isn't the problem something was cut, such is the nature of game development, the problem is it wasn't properly mentioned until the exposure.Right now inXile is somewhat ignorant of the complaints regarding the final product. Technical forum is filled with unanswered threads and I gave up refreshing the page to see if the problems I mentioned are going to be addressed.tl:drProsthe design and pacing of The Bloom hub;multiple quests resolutions (sometimes more than 3);several interesting sidequests.Consbad and buggy combat system;bland companions;weird world for the sake of weirdness with little to no explanation, why and how everything works;mediocre main plot, which goes from ""personal story"" to ""chosen one story"";choices don't matter;abrupt ending akin to Mass Effect 3;atrocious consolidized UI without proper scaling;cut kickstarter strechgoals;VerdictA lot more can be said about each aspect of the game, but there isn't enough space.The game as a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment gets a solid 2 out of 10 for failing to do everything it was destined to do: improve combat, tell a complex personal story, have unique companions and present reactivity, choice and real consequences.PS:T aside, it gets 5 out of 10 for trying to be original but failing to do everything else properly.

												EDIT: This review has been edited a small bit from it's original state to indicate that there is, without a doubt, a fairly large group of people who will love this game and be very very happy with their purchase. I'm not part of that group, sadly. Read through to find out if you are.Backed this game. Was REALLY excited for it. I kept my spoilers to a minimum...and in doing so apparently missed my chance at getting a refund. Which, to be clear, I would have certainly done had I realized how bad of a shape this game was in.To start, there has been a MASSIVE amount of cut content. Not JUST Kickstarter Stretch Goals, as many people will insist, but also cuts to the core game. Cuts to the fundemental rules set the game is built upon (aka, if you're familiar with how the PnP Numenera game works, there are MASSIVE cuts to that rule set).Further, there are other major issues with the game. These include truly ugly character models/animations (although the rest of the game looks quite nice), an extreme imblance in the importance of different skills/abilities/classes/companions/etc (saying much more than that would be super spoilery, but, simply put, if you choose X, Y, and Z there can be no need to replay the game, as you'll have seen basically everything in a single playthrough, where as if you choose A, B, and C instead, you'll see about a 4th of the game's content, max, even if you're SUPER dilligent), unnanounced timed quests (aka quests you can fail by taking too long IRL to do them, with no indication that you need to do them in a timely manner), and relatively short playtime for a RPG of this price.Finally, some other things to note, smaller, less important things, but bothersome things nonetheless include but are not limited to voice acting for the female player character that is probably the worst I've heard from any game in years, certain static images (like loading screen images and such) being the wrong resolution regardless of the resolution you set (resulting in things like ""loading tips"" being off screen), the inability to lock the mouse cursor to a single monitor in multimonitor setups (even in fullscreen), the lack of a boarderless window mode, the fact that you can die in the text-only intro of the game and get a game over screen, and many, many other small problems (including performance issues...which this game should have even a little).Combine all this with what I feel are many poor design decisions that happened in the middle of development and had I know what was coming, I certainly would have asked for a refund back when I had the chance. Sadly, as this was a Kickstarter game for me (aka I got a CD key) I cannot get a refund through Steam, even though I've barely used it at all.To be clear: If you are looking for an in-depth CRPG with heavy RPG elements, a complete Numenera experince, or a mixture of both, you will likely be dissatisfied with your purchase. If, on the other hand, you're here EXCLUSIVELY for the story and want a Planescape: Torment like story experience, this IS the game for you, and you'll likely be VERY satisfied with your purchase. But I fall into the first camp, not the second camp. It should also be noted that if you want the game promised in the Kickstarter this is NOT going to live up to your expectations.All in all, this is not the game promised, it's a shell. It's not a CRPG, it's an incredibly detailed and intricate Choose Your Own Adventure visual novel with EXTREMELY light turn based combat on rare occasions. The broad strokes of the original premise are still there, but compared to other recent CRPGs (Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin), the RPG elements are EXTREMELY lacking.So, should you buy it? Well, that's up to you. Some people WILL be VERY satisfied with this purchase. As for me, I wanted a complete Numenera CRPG. This is not that game. So I can't recommend it.			"

												I was an early backer of the game, I usually back each and every CRPG that resembles old school RPGs. But TTON was my first big disappointment. I think mainly because of the hype that the devs built up, by promising a deep, multi layered inticate world. I really want to like this game, I am still trying, but even after only 9 hours, this title feels more like a choir than fun. My main problem is one of the selling points of the game, that you can beat it without killing anyone. I expected some sophisticated dialogue and skill system, but in reality, it is simply using Tide points to ""solve"" dialogue options that come up in every situation. Tide points are divided into 3 sections. Might, Speed and Intellect. The more Tide point you spend in an interaction, the higher chance you will succeed. The problem is, that Tide points can be used individually by any party member, so even a dumb brute can easily convince a fanatical deth acolyte to stand bck from his plan. For a brute, the options should not even pop up in my opinion. But like this, basically you can talk yourself through the game without ANY effort, in case you run out of points, you just need to rest and continue.Pros:-Interesting setting-Unique environment-Okay graphicsCons:-Tide system; you just talk yourself through the game in literally ANY situation-Combat is clunky and pointless-Main character is blank, you cannot even customize its look-Almost non-existent and bad voice acting-Uninteresting cliche companions with zero motive-Dull soundtrack-Tiny, cramped maps-Cyphers (so far) are more annoyance than use-Writing is tedious and overcomplicatedAll in all, given its hype and huge funding, the game underdelivers in almost every aspect for me. I keep going as long as I can, maybe I find the fun part of it, but so far it is more like a tedious graphic novel from a conceited literature student. For full price I definitely do not recommend it, on sale only if you are up to tons of reading and ONLY reading. (And by too much reading I mean compared to any other, enjoyable CRPG.)			"

												~May contain Spoilers~Don't waste your money, wait until it goes on Sale!Torment: Tides of Numenera is not worth the advertised $50 price tag. Pro's:-The backgrounds are well done and have great detail. - Idea for the storyline is awesome.- Clean user interface.- Wide range of CyphersCon's:- Exceptionally linear storyline, with hardly any sub-plot.  - Choice and Consquence theme barely flushed out to its true potential.- Tides aren't maximized in a useful manner to benefit the player.- Could complete entire storyline and every quest available in less than 24 hours of gameplay. So not nearly enough quests or alternate storylines.- Inability to revisit old areas. Area's that are outside the city(s) are small and lacking, if they exist at all.- The game favors one style of play over another and the way to achieve that is primarily intellect usage. Can't play the dumb oaf because you'd be dead before the second chapter. - Species introductions and encounters are limited to the game area (chapter in main plotline) you encounter them on and no where else. - Character and player party npcs models are about as good as Neverwinter nights when it was first released. - No main character customization. Can't dye your hair, get tattoos, new scars or even decent looking armor. - The main plot line feels like its rushed, and that they couldn't end the game soon enough. - Not enough fluff. Whether that be useless quests, strange things to find, or weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ - There's practically no party banter and the personal quests aren't very engaging. - Character movement pathing is cumbersome and poorly designed. There isn't a multi-waypoint system to tell a character to move around an obstacle.  - Game mechanics in hostile situations are still buggy.- Player class is limited and unoriginal. Fighter, Rogue, Mage, like really? That hasn't been done to death.I really do hope that this developer will add more content, for free, as they introduce their updates. But as it stands, one day after release, this game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor excuse for the genre it represents. And considering that its supposed to blur the lines between what is magic and tech. This developer didn't reach far enough, to implement what could of been a great and engaging game. Instead I firmly believe, they spent the money from their backers on trying to make this game cross platform versuses making a solid game that could be converted afterwards. There are better games out there and some of them are nearly 20 years old, like Baldur's Gate.			"

												Pros:- Mechanics: Game works very well mechanically, including options to interact with terrain is a certain feature I've craved for in isometric RPG's- Story and setting: Story and dialogue are very decent, characters seem memorable and interesting.Cons: - Cut Content: I don't thik I've ever seen a case, more brutal than this one. When the game was in early Alpha, it contained several additional features that are unavaible now at release, some being key to incorporating the true feeling of playing in the Numenera universe. The intro sequence and start was severely reduced and it doesn't seem that that content shows up later on, it's just... gone. 3 out of the 9 promised companions were also cut with the argument they want to focus their efforts on developing a deeper evolution for fewer characters than spreading their efforts out.Now the last and most dissappointing fact that was falsely hyped up (some would say promised) by the developers: only 3 foci... The essence and meat of the tabletop rpg Numenera is the plethora of foci you can choose from at character creation and the amount of starting diversity that offers you. When the alpha/beta started, one could only choose between 3 such foci, each one more or less designated to work with a certain type, so you can get a feel for the game. Back then, there was even a message that popped up as you were choosing, stating there will be more options in the full game. Well those promised additional options never made it in the full game for some reason and what's most annoying about this situation is that these issues were either never adressed or flimsy minor excuses were presented to justify these decisions.The only reason I could think of for all this content being cut/removed, is they want to add it as future DLC... Which 1st of all wouldn't work, because Isometric RPG's with a non-branching story don't go well with character options DLC, since most players will only play the game once. And 2ndly, the developers know they can't add cut content that was actually in the game at some point during the development as DLC, they probably know they'd get eaten alive for such silly and anti-consumer practices.Because of these confusing and silly decisions, I simply can't recommend the game to anyone.TL DR: Game is good, but lots of content was either cut for no logical reason, or never delivered despite being promised. Those cuts really hurt the game and don't give the Descriptor/Type/Focus system justice.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm not a professional reviewer or anything but I'm 32 (golden age of gaming) years old and I've played and finished every single CRPG on the planet, some of them multiple times.  This game definitely has the potential to be among the best I've played.  The writing it fantastic but I have to say, what I like the most is how the game mechanics are setup.  Most games like this you would reload if your character fails at doing something or persuading someone, but the way Torment is set up failure can lead to something new and interesting and the best moral choice won't always lead to the best moral outcome.  I love that because it simulates real life decision making.  Nothing is black and white.Post Release Edit:I've just finished the game.  I definitely feel like there's a lot of room for replay because of all the branching choices. I still stand by my original words but I do feel mildly disappointed though I feel it's my fault.  Torment isn't really an CRPG in the traditional sense.  I feel it's more of a point and click adventure game with some combat elements (mind you I was a Jack so I got through many things without combat).  I was very excited to hear that the game was set 1 billion years in the future. I am a fan of all things sci-fi.  I love the bizarre and unknown and some of the concepts in the game (such as the Bloom) were genuinely cool.However the downside is being so far out made it also somewhat unrelateable.  I had a hard time caring for any of my companions. I also believe I've been spoiled by voice acting in RPGs. I don't mind reading at all but I honestly prefer to read what an NPC said rather than a novel-like narration though the skill with which it was written has my respect.  One let down was the lack of a world map.  I though perhaps I would get to visit some of these places I heard about in the game but alas they were only lore.  I was disappointed with the overall plot though there were some twists I didn't see coming. I felt like the billion year into the future plot was really interesting but I really wish it was more organized.  I felt like there were a lot of random elements and things that didn't really fit in well together. I also wish I could delve more into the backstories of some of the more interesting elements.  For example, I wanted to know a lot more about the Bloom than what was given.Overall, it's a good game though I believe Planescape Torment was better (though in all fairness I am a fan of that universe).  Perhaps it's just me since this is my first experience with Monte Cook, maybe if more comes out in this universe I'll grow to understand it better.			"

												Having now completed what must be about 80% of the story, it seems like my initial concerns were well-founded.In a nutshell, this is a very nice rough draft.Where to begin? Let's start with the choices. Most of the time, they feel inconsequential. Granted, characters die, NPCs can be killed or made friends, but never did I feel like the death of a party member (I lost one person) or letting Qorro live changed anything momentous.Skills and abilities didn't seem to matter much mostly because there are only about a dozen fights through the whole game. The advancement system seems very compelling, and I was excited to progress. But then I never got a chance to use my new talents.Balance seems off, too. Either I found myself overwhelmed with up to a dozen foes with twice my hit points, or I was just talking my way through everything. I like that enemies could be spoken to during a crisis, but that only happened twice, maybe three times. The worst part about being outnumbered wasn't the frustration of difficulty, but how slow and repetetive the battles got. I'm looking at you, corpuscular maws.Plus the game feels short, the pacing is tedious (if well-narrated), the voice acting is confusingly sporadic, crisis instructions were vague at best, and most of the game is the script to a cut scene that budget didn't allow to be rendered.It's got great ideas. It has a fun world and character advancement system. It just doesn't do anything with them that makes any of it exciting. Had I spent $15, I wouldn't complain (or replay). At $45, I have to warn others to wait for a discount or a better option from another developer.			"

Early Access Review
								I've put in a decent chunk of time in to the Torment beta over the weekend and while its obviously clunky and unfinished I had a great deal of fun with it.There are so many people you can talk to in Sagus, the first city, that you can easily spend over 5 hours just going around and annoying people with endless questions. Best thing about it is that pretty much every single bit of dialogue is well written and all of the characters have some sort of compelling story to tell, if you can get them to share it.For example there's a cannibalistic cult that lives in the depths of the city and rather than the usual RPG business of having you kill them Torment actually managed to convince me to not just leave them alone but concede that they might have a good point...However, while the story really is amazing, possibly just as good or even better than Planescape: Torment's the combat, graphics and performance still need a lot of work done to them.The combat right now is best described as generic low-level DND combat with the one big difference being the various items and background objects you can use (the titular Numenera) if you have either the necessary skill or knowledge to activate them without blowing yourself up in the process. I'm guessing things will become a whole lot more interesting once you get a few more abilities under your belt but since you're mostly stuck as a low level character during the beta it was fairly meek.The performance is also a bit of a sore spot. Its not uncommon to have your game freeze for a couple of seconds mid combat or while interacting with particularly complex background objects or even when simply accessing your inventory or any menu besides the dialogue one.In other words, while Torment has an amazing story that's well worth exploring, it is still very much so a beta and as such I'd recommend you buy it either because you want to support the developers or because you want to soak in the story. Just don't buy it expecting a finished game because it most certainly isn't one just yet.I've also done a video where I go far more in-depth about Torment so if you're looking for more info I welcome you to take a look:

								""What does one life matter?""Apparently, it is a question where the answer would only make sense to each individual's code of beliefs and ethics. And sometimes, for a rare few, there isn't any answer to be had at all. But much like ""What can change the nature of a man?"", it's not the answer where the satisfaction is derived, but the journey to that answer through self-discovery.This game does exactly what Planescape: Torment has done way back in 1999, that is to say, it has achieved a narrative that is thick with philosophical metaphors, witty dialogue and wonderfully delightful characters. Like Planescape: Torment, it takes every known cliche, knocks it down and rebuilds it in a manner that most ordinary folks wouldn't have ever imagined, let alone foresee it.As such, this game is really not for the faint of heart, at least when it comes to reading. The text is heavy and littered with many proses and vocabulary that are somewhat archaic in format. Throw in some in-universe colloquial slang, and many players would easily be put off by the game within the opening moments, but that is essentially the charm of the game. Soldier on and you will be rewarded with an immersive experience that probably surpasses even Pillars of Eternity.So, what does one life matter? It doesn't, but you make it matter anyway, because it's your story to tell, and perhaps, that is actually all that really matters.			"

								Being a regular player and GM in the world of Numenera, this game could only please me. It really feels like it's coming from where it claims it's coming (or something like that). Moreover, this fantastic universe of weird stuff and strange people is taken over by cool devs from a nice studio with the goal of reproducing the experience Planescape : Torment was while not forgetting to enhance it. So it's like a dinosaur of the oldschool rpg world but with a facelift, featuring a marvelous -but super weird- universe, dialogues where you can actually go pretty deep (not in all cases, but i don't care if i can't discuss the meaning of life with the guard patrolling the area), sceneries where you can actually feel the work which is provided by the devs, and a crisis system which is refreshing the good ol' pen'n'paper turn based system without disorienting the nostalgic ones, giving a sense of returning to the roots of the style which made some of us lovers of all this game can represent : a good videogame, a good adaptation of the pen and paper rpg Numenera, but also a great storytelling in which your choices feel decisive.Prepare yourself for tons and tons of dialogue though, so if it's not something you're searching for or if you simply think you'll not be able to stand it after a while, i would suggest you to go your own way on another wonderful steam page !PS :Early access is early (no♥♥♥♥♥♥Game is buggySpaghettiEdit 10/06/2016So many bugs corrected, it feels great and the new hud is less laggy than it was before. Generally speaking, everything is smoother. I'm glad I can restart a game without having to deal with game breaking bugs (negative fettles which never disappeared, i'm looking at you right now). I read some people talking about how the game is thinking too highly of himself, looking for complexity and deepness at times it's not needed and I understand exactly what they mean as I find this irritating as well, but that is not the vibe this game gives in my opinion.

Early Access Review
								Where to begin... I am an old school Planescape: Torment fan, and a D&D tabletop player/DM. Let's set a few things straight about this game:1) Best Writing Ever! Amazing story, characters and settings with personalities of their own.2) Uniquely awe-inspiring environments with unforgettable experiences around every corner.3) A massive project filled with love, both from the Devs and the Fans!4) The Spiritual Successor to Planescape: Torment, and I could not be any prouder!5) Just to clarify: This is not D&D, nor is it technically part of the D&D universe... but it's also technically could be, in a way. Afterall, Planescape: Torment took place in Sigil, and that city could take you anywhere in the universe... I wish not to debate meta/universe lines or copyrights, so I will just leave it as that. No it doesn't explicitly have any connection to the previous game, but the feel, wonderful bizarrities and incredible writing feel right at home.      Thus far, the game has been amazing. It has the updated graphics and sounds (plus voice acting!) that were needed to drive the series forward. Planescape: Torment is held dear to the hearts of many, and this game shall not disappoint! 12/10 Can't wait for the full release!If only it weren't so late... I want to play FOREVER!P.S. The in game bug-reporting system is great! I need to make a torment account, but I will surely be giving useful information to help squash bugs before release. I have only had one bug at the beginning, one of my guys couldn't move during combat. I hit the space bar or something to skip the turn and it fixed it. Didn't cause a major issue.			"

												The most difficult decision before writing this review is wether I would recommend it or not.Not recommending it would probably gather me more votes but that's easy way out.If you are considering buying this game and expecting a ""traditional"" rpg with character options, interesting combat and encounters like Baldur's Gate I&II, Neverwinter Nights, Divinity series or Dragon Age: Origin you'll probably be disappointed. You might be pleasantly surprised by the setting though. So what is this game then?It calls itself the spiritual successor of Planescape Torment, a beloved, text-heavy old rpg which is a lesser known but much loved game in the genre.In nearly every conversation I've had with another gamer who said he liked rpg's I've probably said: “Yeah, that's cool, but have you ever played Planescape Torment?” If he/she said “yes offcourse!” and I was drunk I probably hugged him or her. I should stop asking that question … If you enjoyed Planescape Torment you've probably backed this game so this review is rather pointless but you like reading wall's of text, clicking a button afterwards and influencing the world around you so, be my guest, and keep on reading. Is this game something for me then?I honestly don't know. It might be if you like exploring locations, talking to npc's, reading item descriptions and diving, head-on, into a world you haven't seen before.The one thing I can assure you that you have never played a game like this one before.Wether that's a good or bad thing is up in the air though. Like everything in life, the game is a mixed bag. Sometimes it shines and sometimes it stinks. Currently (06/03/2017) the game still has several annoying bugs, combat is repetitive, cumbersome and will test your patience. It delivers on the text heavy style of its spiritual predecessor but unfortunately the story, although well told, isn't as good. Where Planescape left the downtrodden path of most rpg's where you're the focal point of the world who has to save the town/country/the world/planes of existence/ reality itself from a certain evil and his macguffin. Planescape told a personal story of a man trying to find the bane of his own existence, Tides manages to rehash the standard rpg story from the get go. You're a castoff, on the run from or towards, depending on your point of view, of a big evil who threatens you and every one of your kind and the key to all this is, you guessed it, a certain macguffin that you need to repair. Thankfully the creators, for the most part, told this story in a interesting setting and  there are several memorable gems in the dialogues with npc's and companionsWhy a positive score if you're mostly negative?In a world without Planescape this game would have blown me away, in a world with Planescape it only rattled my cage. It was an interesting ride and if you, someday, want to play something that's more different then most rpg's then atleast put this game in your wish list.			"

												I tried very hard to like this game, since Planescape:Torment was one of my favorite games growing up and I've been waiting 18 years for a new ""Torment"" game. But unfortunately, after about 30 hours, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a worthy successor. The characters are bland, the story is contrived, and some of the voice acting is so bad / irritating that I had to turn the voice-over volume to zero.The combat is a slog with basically no strategic curve, and the maps are hilariously cramped.You can easily tell that this game suffered from major budgetary constraints, technical limitations, and last minute cuts -- and that kind of ruins the immersion for me.This game is basically ""Wasteland 2"" with worse combat, UX, and maps. AND WL2 didnt really do any of those things particularly well to begin with.			"

												You can't threaten or persuade a common kid into answering your questions. Either you pay him money or leave the dialogue.You can't get into a combat with a group of thugs competing with you for the same bounty, you have a gazzilion of dialogue options but you can't attack them and get into the real combat. Even if you manage to get one of them killed via one of the dialogue options you can't loot his corpse.Often you can't discuss a reward for a quest before you complete it. Even if the quest involves something illegal or risky you can't ask about your payment before you complete it.Often you have to believe when you are being lied too, because most of the time there is no option to claim that whatever obvious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t a NPCs tells you is a lie.There is a lot of text, yes, but very few choices and ways to roleplay any other type of personality except a common good and nice hero, that helps every person in need them/she/he meets. For a game with focus on dialogues there are too few real options in dialogues besides asking questions.			"

												I thought it was pretty cool at first. Very interesting and well-written. My only real complaint is that it's so short. I did absolutely every sidequest and stumbled into the ending in just over 30 hours. I was expecting the game (from the descriptions and adverts) to be at least longer than that. No real character development either. I mostly talked my way out of stuff, didn't have a name, couldn't customize my character. I mean, it's not a bad game to just try out, but for 45 dollars, I feel like I didn't get my money's worth. If you can catch it on sale, by all means give it a go, but I can't recommend it at its current price.			"

												Just my two cents...A decent and intriguing game in its own right (I'll rate it at 6.5/10.) I backed it early and got it for half-price, and I can't say I didn't get my money's worth. Most people have singled out the combat as its major weakness, but while I found the animations/interface a bit sluggish/awkward and the character models rather ugly, overall it's still acceptable to me.However...(1) It's NOTHING like Planescape: Torment. This is not necessarily bad per se, but I (and many others, I think) jumped to back this PRECISELY because of the Torment link. To claim that this is a ""spiritual successor"" to that game is not only inaccurate, it's deceptive and cheap. While this doesn't really affect my enjoyment of the game, it does significantly put me off backing future inXile titles. (I think it's safe to say that I likely wouldn't have got this if it was just called Tides of Numisomething rather than TORMENT: Tides of Numisomething, and it wouldn't have been a major loss on my part too.)(2) Considering the amount of money it raised, I find this game underwhelming compared to other games with less budget and development time. It's not as impressive as I hoped/thought it would be, nor as fun as other games out there (and I say this as someone who LOVES isometric turn-based games.) I certainly won't be speaking of it in the same breath as Planescape: Torment.(3) Some of the things that were a major disappointment for me were the lack of character portraits (the few in the game depicting your character and party members were just awful); the lack of evocative music (which was one the things that made Planescape: Torment so memorable for me); the lacklustre story and NPCs (NPCs were also what made Pst memorable for me); and finally, poor pacing and balancing (by the time of the third act, my Stats were high enough that ability tests were trivial and I was all of a sudden swimming in cash but had nothing I wanted to buy.)Bottom-line: I mildy enjoyed this game while it lasted...but, for the amount of tme invested, I think you can get a lot more enjoyment and value out of a good novel. On this basis alone, I really can't recommend it. Wait for the sale.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter and had high hopes for it, and I did play it all the way through, so that's saying quite a lot.However, I feel like it missed the mark, or else, our hopes were all set too high.First, the game is buggy. Very buggy. Freezes are not uncommon. Graphic corruption is not uncommon. Freezes are often persistent, such that you have to just skip that chunk of the game to get around them. (For example, if entering a certain area causes the game to freeze, it will generally do so every time, so the only workaround is just to not go there.) The 1.0.2 patch didn't help that for me -- if anything, it made it worse. Also, there are little ""bugs"" like the wrong gender in dialogue and things like that, but there are a fair number of them, so it does interfere with your immersion.Second, the game is surprisingly short. That's likely why I actually got around to finishing it. It just didn't take all that long. For a game of its type, for what I paid for it, and for the reputation of its franchise, that was a bit disappointing. [Steam tells me that I played for 38 hours, and that includes restarting areas multiple times due to freezes, and walking away from the computer for hours at least once.]Also, there's a lot of dialogue, but it's not very fluid and doesn't evolve much. Conversations feel pretty ""gamey"", and you can generally explore every conversational thread -- none will get cut off because of another thread you followed. It feels ... old school in that respect, and not in a good way.And then, there are just a lot of bad UI choices. For example, when you use an ability, it plays a sound effect if you succeed and labels a button ""Continue"", but if you actually click that, which I kept forgetting to not do, you'll actually skip over the screen that tells you the results of your action. (It's surprising how often that happened and how much I didn't really care.) As another action, on a complex battlefield, if you want to use an attack or ability on an ally or enemy, you must pick them out on the battlefield, even if other characters occluding them make that nearly impossible to do. The game is *aware* of who you select using the character portraits in the initiative list, but won't use that information. Why not? Also, many items have a ""Use Item"" button that does nothing because instead the game wants you to click back to the main game screen, click on the little backpack on the left side, and then select them there to use them. Why not make both work? If the button doesn't work, why display it?I didn't hate the game. I did enjoy parts of it a fair bit. But the tone is often grim-just-to-be-grim and the fact that it didn't really draw me in made that feel less ""adult"" and more just egregious, or even childish. Also, I would have liked to see not only more content and a larger adventure, but more locations. There are hardly any in the game. Oh, and this probably matters to very few people, but I largely backed this game because I'm a huge fan of the Numenera role-playing game, and the system implemented in the video game is *not* the same at all. It barely qualifies as ""inspired by"". They should have made more effort to stick to the actual system where possible if they were going to market it the way they did.In the end, I think people who own the game will enjoy it, but I'm not likely to recommend people run out and buy it. I'm going to go tackle Pillars of Eternity next, and I'm expecting to get more out of it.			"

												I got banned from the Torment Steam Community Discussion board for posting this review there:I grew up a huge fan of all the infinitiy engine games. I backed Pillars. I backed Torment. I thought the new golden age of cRPGs was upon us. It had to be, these games had record funding.And they were incredibly poorly planned and managed. We saw some of these issues, much less significant, with Pillars - where ambitious stretch goal were delivered but hastily developed, not fully realized, insignificant to the grander scheme, and tacked on feeling - but it's even worse with Torment.Much of the base game that was planned was cut. Entire stretch goals that we earned were cut. These cuts, while not only making the game significantly more shallow with significantly less replayability, are the antithesis of this RPG system. Go on, count how many companions shipped at launch, the laughable amount of focuses, literally no factions as we were promised, no crafting system. No orchestral sound track. Compare the stretch goals, which is literally what people were paying for, to the final delivered product, which is what we were given. Imagine yourself being Italian backer and being promised an Italian localization that wasn't delivered- Because that happened.Kickstarter is allowing developers to deliver whatever they want. And that is something I'm never going to support again. If there would be a platform that binds the developers with a contract to fulfilll their promises and design targets, I would reconsider it but Tides, along with so many incredibly successful kickstarted games simply aren't delivering what they're promsing. What we paid for.InExile has had zero transparency about the entire thing, and will only acknowledge it after the fans make it into a scandal. Zero accountability. I am sorry I backed Bards Tale 2 and now I understand why they kickstarted the next Wasteland before this launched and blew up in their faces. Who knows how many dollars from this sinking ship they put into those more marketable games?			"

												So as the thumb shows. I don't recommend this and just to point this out. I did not back this on kickstarter and bought this purely on an ""looks like a neat RPG"" motive. I don't know Torment Planescape or have played it. I'm essentially new to this kind of ""world"" or... whatever it is people are comparing this to.So why do I not recommend Tides of Numenera?It's not a simple, short answer. I wish it was. It'd make it easier.Unlike other people who don't recommend this on the basis of ""can't create your character appearance"" I don't really mind it very much, but I will admit whoever drew the male and female 'main character' avatar pictures... should be fired. They're horrible, I've seen better ones in far worse games.It would have been nice if there was a place in-game where you could 'edit' your avatar's appearance (and that horrible picture), but like I said I don't find it too big of a problem. I pester npc's no matter my appearance. This is simply a QoL (Quality of Life) thing that 'would' have been nice to have, but does nothing to impact my opinion on the game as a whole.Now the 1st third of the game is in Sagus Cliffs is great. It's fun, it's interesting. Once you leave Sagus Cliff's to continue the story... it slowly, very slowly but surely gets worse.Adding onto the fact that if you do not have 3 companions with you after leaving Sagus, you're screwed as you'll never get another companion afterward. Why? No idea a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ design decision I figure, and you CAN lose your companions so if you lose them, you don't get a replacement as you'll never return to the first city to grab another one, which in turn makes combat (if you get into it) annoyingly hard.EDIT: Thank to a few people who commented on my review. I've discovered you 'can' swap companions, but somehow in my playthrough I was never able to. Why? Apparently an item that allows you to swap them, was in all likelihood bugged for me and prevented this. Given you can't access the companions in later areas, it seems this bug I had with swapping them should have been dealt with 'before' release given it is particularly critical. (If albeit rare as I seem to be the lucky minority)And combat as it is in-game is like putting your hand in an active garbage disposal. Painful. Combat isn't fun, it isn't ""intuitive"" It's annoying, it's painful... it's tormenting. The game calls battles a ""crisis"" and it is one, for you because you're going to go through your own crisis trying to ""win"" these battles in a horribly made combat mechanic. So if you DO buy the game... avoid combat like you'd avoid getting the plague. You'll save yourself a lot of headaches.The 2nd part of the game (before getting to the end-game city) is strange, and not in the 'oh this is neat' strange. It's a ""What is this?"" kind of strange, with admittedly bits of the first kind. The 2nd part is mostly there so the dev's can say ""Hey, look at these names. They backed us."" Beyond that, it really serves no purpose in the game.The last part of the game is... almost as awesome as the first, but it wears off quickly and it gets replaced with annoyance. The third part of the game feels rushed, like some invisible force is whipping your character to do things right away and while you don't have to (and if you buy the game anyways) you should go slowly. Makes it a bit more enjoyable.But therein lies the problem. The first part of the game will take you 10 hours to get through it. The rest of the game... 8 hours and that is doing ""ALL"" of the side quests as well, exploring the cities, talking to npc's, etc.And it's not even worth replaying the game in a different way. It'll all lead down the same path no matter what. (Yay for youtube)Nothing changes very much beyond how much your companions ""like"" you, and how other npc's might, and it takes a lot to get them to dislike you. (All npc's generally dislike you to start with, so your screwed there either way)The companions, they aren't very... interesting. Actually no, I'm lying. Only 1 companion is interesting, and this is ""AFTER"" they cut 3 other companions to 'expand/flesh out' the six they kept. Apparently they didn't put much effort into five of these companions, so they probably should have just kept the other 3 anyways.  The companion who is the most interesting (in my opinion) is Rhin. A girl misplaced in the world that you can save/adopt. Compared to all of the other companions who are interesting for a span of five minutes. Rhin is a companion you'll likely find far more interesting than half the maniacs who want to join you. However, she's a child and thus isn't made for combat which makes her even more interesting in my eyes. Eventually through the course of the game she eventually sees your character as a surrogate parent of sorts and then you'll come to a decision in the end part of the game... that just kicks you in the gut. This choice is: You can have her stay with you or return to her real family as you discover a way to send her home and if you (like me) really really like having her around. It's a painful choice to make.  The rest don't have this kind of impact. The rest are screwed up beyond any measure of saving or bothering to learn about.Playing it, it feels like the dev's were doing good in the first part, but then said ""screw it"" and rushed up the rest just to shove it out the proverbial door and if the steam forums show anything.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off almost everyone who have backed the game because of cut content, changed goals, etc.Which even though I didn't back this. I feel it's a horrible move by the dev's given that while they have the choice. They should have brought it up to those who backed the game, the people who PAID them to create this game and paid for the ""cut content"" that isn't in the game. (Especially when people paid the 'stretch goals' for specific content and the dev's just told them it won't be there. (That's downright lying)Sure there are ""creative problems"" and issues they have to be worked through or past but they aren't allowed to make those kind of choices when the people who paid money for specific content are told ""Yeah, you paid for it to be in game but... we feel it's not a good choice to put it in. Sorry.""In business, this causes a business to go OUT of business as the investors abandon it for another business that'll do as it promises. Speaking of cut content... I'd say this decision was a bad move given how short the game is past the first part of the game, but chances are it was ""cut"" so it will be later added as paid dlc.If it doesn't I would be surprised.In the end, with the bad business practices, relatively short gameplay (with it's price as it is at the time of this review), no replayability, downright abusive combat mechanics, I can't recommend this game to anyone until it's priced around $20 (or regional equivelant)I'd give this game a 5 out of 10. It's average, in the end that's all it is. Instead of buying this, go watch a let's play on youtube. You'll find it more enjoyable and if combat happens. At least you won't be the one harmed by it.

												This game to Planescape:Torment is what Atack of the clones is to Empire strikes back.....In core its alright story driven rpg,however as succesor to Planescape Torment it fails.It feels like fanmade torment tribute game,not something that was backed by kickstarter and made by profesional dev company.The great thing about PS:T was the originality in world setting or characters : no knights in shiny armour,barely any armour at all in fact,only a few swords to be found etc. and even though the world  setting in Tides of Numenera  is fresh and original nothing else really is.Nameless immortal character with amnesia exploring own past while trying to stave off some kind of shadows ....Also combat,even though its surely not the main focus of the game,is even less enjoyable than in PS:T and thats saying something i managed to skip most of it through persuation ,intimidation etc. Also when figting large amount of enemies i had time to make cup of tea while waiting for my turn.the good things about it:-One companion which i felt atached to (Rhin ftw)-Enjoyable side quests-Interaction with objects-World setting - nice design,fun to explore,cool lore.-Solving problems can be done in several waysthe not so good things:-Every companion minus Rhin-Boring prolonged combat makes you want to solve everything peaceful way -Expected more content-Main storyline is shallow and unoriginal-Glaive jack and nano is just different name for warrior rogue and mage -crashed several times during combat (played on the release so might be fixed now)If you want good cRPG ...thumbs up (even though Pillars or Tyranny are still much much more better choices)If oyu want experience something on level of Planescape Torment go play .....Planescape Torment,because this is not it "

												First thing first: TToN is not an RPG. It's a story-driven adventure game and should be judged as such. Its progression type is actually that of a point-and-click game: you get a hub, you find the correct order to click things, you uncover the plot and then move to the next area.This is all fine in my book, but should be kept in mind.Sadly, the game has a bunch of glaring downsides: The visuals are imaginative, but poorly-executed The balance is atrocious (as others have mentioned, most challenges in TToN are basically non-challenges and have no reason to be there) The whole game feels clunky in a bad way Glitches abound Non-plot Meres seem to be pointless It's obvious that the game was written by many different writers with different styles.Does this all make the game unworthy of playing? No. Unworthy of its price tag? Yeah, perhaps.Trying to remember PST without nostalgia goggles, I'd actually say that TToN does a good job of capturing the spirit of the now-franchise. You get the sense of a huge and wondrous world with plots and events criss-crossing each other—and there you are, thrown in the thick of it, your head spinning from the weirdness that surrounds you. This feeling is strongly enhanced by the fact that the game rarely repeats the assets—meaning that most characters and situations you'll encounter will have unique models, scripts, and so on. The lack of junk content makes the world feel rich and true.TToN actually builds upon PST's methods, trying little neat tricks to make everything seem... I wouldn't say ""more natural"", but rather ""more engaging"". You get dialogue options that are only available once. You get failure states more interesting than successes. You get hidden timers that make certain events change and unfold. You can never be sure. All these things are great improvements over PST.Another thing that captures the spirit of the old game to a T is the soundtrack. Reserved, non-grandiose, yet full of genuine tingling sorrow, it seemed perfect.Honorable mentions to some other elements of the game: The Bloom is dark and imaginative, rivalling the best moments of the whole PST setting; a brilliant concept that was well-executed The ""Ashen Imitation"" quest (the one with the same girl being reborn over and over) intrigued me greatly The replacement of monetary rewards with Oddities (pointless items that exist only to be sold—so they're basically shins, but flavourful) Some writing is quite captivating (The Genocide) or funny (""coital cluster"") Companions have a lot of dialogue and react to A LOT OF things happening in the game How Perception and other unasked-for checks are done, making you feel super smart every time they trigger Some Crises are very engaging (like the one where you need to retrieve the Cortex) The quiet, fanfare-less moment when you find Chile ErritisA WORD ABOUT COMPANIONSThey're okay. The game features: Two well-executed typecast fan service characters (the ""naive little girl you need to protect"" Rhin and the ""charming rogue with a tragic backstory"" Tybir) A rather bland companion who's important to the plot (Matkina) Two characters who seemed very bland apart from the beginning (Callistege and Aliger) A brilliant character who only shines if you use a particular skill—a skill that I actually found detrimental to the rest of the game since the explication of characters' thoughts destroys the whole point of fiction in all cases but Erritis'sThey're less original than in PST, but way more fully-realized. However, for some inexplicable reason they are also all human.THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOMNow, like I said, I do recommend this game. For all its downsides, it's more than worth your time if you just want to immerse yourself in the Ninth World and play an adventure game of epic scale.But—and there's no way to put in lightly—the main plot sucks.I'm not talking about the writing, although I did find the major plot scenes to be among the less well-executed. But that, once again, would be forgivable... if the game didn't spend its second half to destroy the great premise of the first half.You start as a person in a startling, but not unique, situation: you are a shell of a body, cast off by your creator who jumps vessels to stay immortal. You are not special in any existential way—however, you are technically the best candidate to oppose The Changing God/Sorrow, since each new body he makes is better than the previous ones, so you're the best among your brethren. Sounds like a great ""fit for this story, but not The Chosen One"" setup.Oh, only you are The Chosen One, because your skills and body are unique—no one else could have triggered the events of the ending. And the tutorial guy is actually The Changing God, your creator. Oh, no, he isn't. The brilliant yet narcissistic and ruthless Changing God, so excuisitely built up at the beginning? He shows neitehr brilliance nor ruthlessness—he's actually a lost and sensitive guy who started this whole mess to revive his sick daughter. Only he's not trying to revive her. And he's actually dead, because... reasons. Why was he even running from death so hard? What was his personality like? We don't know for sure, he never gets much of a spotlight. And that looming thing that's hunting him, called the effing SORROW? Nope, no metaphors, it's an ancient guardian or something. There to protect the Tides, that are a gameplay mechanic, but not really explained to you. Did you use Tidal Surge? Did we tell you it was bad, even though we never told you how and it had no repercussions? Yeah, now decide stuff in an ending that fully revolves around dilemmas and entities that were not explored in the game at all.Basically, it's a mess of ""Fahrenheit"" proportions. In the third act, new entities get shoved down your throat one after the other, every new screen is a revelation that turns the plot on its head... leaving you confused and the game, robbed of focus.THE TRUNK OF THE ELEPHANTWith all its oddness and quirkiness, down below PST was a very simple, almost Hollywood-like story of redemption. The question it asked was Shakespearean in its simplicity: Is there a fate worse then death? And the bittersweet yet fulfilling answer was, Yes. It was a game about accepting death, plain and simple.TToN's premise is actually at times more imaginative than that of PST... but what is it about? The ending devolves into a tangle of personal motivations, of who went where and who did what—but there's no central issue, no subject the game would explore and revolve around. It's just... abut people.It's like a castoff: pretty and able to surpass its creator in certain areas, but ultimalety empty.And that, my friends, is a bloody shame.			"

												It's not very good.This has been one of the most anticipated Kickstarter games of all time, what with it's prestigious legacy, and it falls short.To be brief and fair, I'll not compare it to it's spiritual predecessor overmuch, and will instead judge it on it's own merits as it's own game.Torment: Tides of Numenera feels like a game that was in the oven for so long that it was held in stasis, while an entire generation of new, great cRPGs (the Divinities, Tyranny, Pillars of Eternity...) came and went. It's been in developement for four years, and yet it still feels like a rough draft that pales in comparison to what other luminaries of the genre accomplished with less.  It's on the short side for a cRPG, but I'll not hold it against Torment: I rather like shorter cRPGs, as Tyranny showed.The biggest problem I have with this game is how rough the interface and controls are. Movement is somewhat floaty and imprecise, interactable objects and characters can be tricky to click on, character icons can overlap and block environmental interactables, there is no fast movement/exploration option, the UI feels slow and clunky to resolve... It lacks polish is most every regard. One of the best ways to explain that lack of polish is in the sound design. There are many effects in the game without any accompanying sound effect, making for a weird feeling of incompleteness. The sound desgin that there -is- is actually quite bad, with many zones being hampered by repetitive, grating, loud and annoying sound effects. Coupled with the lackluster and sporadic voice-acting, after a while I just started playing without sound.Many people have complained that there is very little combat - and they're right. I can't remember participating in much more than a dozen combat encounters overall, but I won't chalk that up as a negative. One of the few innovations Torment brings to the table is the introduction of the Crisis System, a sort of turn-based gameplay that is mostly used for combat, but also for some interesting non-combat interactions, even in the -midst- of combat. Through the Crisis Sistem, you can interact with objects and other people even while in combat, which makes for an interesting, if not very refined experience. I had no problems at all with the very low number of combats throughout the game, especially because combat itself is not very enjoyable, what with that cardinal sin of 3D RPGs - slow and clunky animations. Torment utilizes Monte Cook's Numenera System and scenario. This is an entirely subjective point on my part, but I have never enjoyed Numenera, and this game has not changed my opinion. The mechanics of it are quite weird, and they exacerbate the particular mania of many a player.Specifically, especially in the lower levels (or 'Tiers'), you have to burn your attribute points in order to increase your chance to succeed at any particular task. Early on in game, you fail at most everything, missing all your attacks (I had a pitiable performance in the very first combat encounter in the game whereupon I missed all of my attacks for so many turns that combat ended, the boss literally taking pity on me and leaving) and must trade even your slightest chances to succeed later to have an ever slighter chance to succeed now. This curves rather awkardly - later on in the game once you've stacked enough Stats Pools and Edge, you steamroll through any and every test and check. There is not happy middle ground. In the end, it's pointless, because you can just savescum to succeed in most every check - and I'd argue that this system encourages you to.In addition, there are Cyphers, which are items that produce powerful, reliable effects - but are consumable, each Cypher having only one use, with very few exceptions.Having to burn your own Stat Pools to have a bigger chance to succeed, and almost all your powerful attacks being one-offs, feeds into that particular gamer paranoia of not wanting to use up your limited items or resources for the fear of needing them later. I know I'm not alone in this, and I finished the game whilst hardly using any Cyphers at all or burning Stat Pools beyond my Edge. Finally, there's the Numenera world itself - the Ninth World to be exact. It's a literal mishmash of random sci-fi and fantasy elements from dozens of different sources, what with the debris from different worlds and realities piling up in a giant junkyard reality, with nobody knowing anything about how anything works and just cobbling everything together from alien junk. The aesthetic is all over the place, from wooden shields to pilot jackets to H.R. Geiger walls to future guns. There is no consistent design, everything seems equally plausible, there are no real rules. It's hard to be invested in such a scatterbrained world.The story is- fine. Functional. The companions aren't bad, but they feel like holdovers from the Planescape Torment era. Nowadays we're used to much better written and relatable companions, from Obsidian to Bioware. It's just not good enough for the present age.In short, Torment: Tides of Numenera is a middling cRPG at best, unworthy of your hype, or your money. Avoid it unless on sale.			"

												This game was early backed for me as a gift.  I tinkered with the early-release for a while but was never really wowed by it.  Once release came, I decided to devote some real effort to the game.  I ran through with different options and different NPC's in group.  Ultimately I have to say, it was really a pretty big let down.  When you compare it to the RPG's its supposed to harken back to, it lacks depth, it lacks immersion, it lacks complexity.  Sure, there are lots of ways to 'handle' the various situations that arise.  But it almost always comes down to either having a skill or rolling a skill.  Which can be influenced by effort.  Honestly, I had more fun going back and replaying Dark Sun: Shattered Lands than I did playing this game.  And the excuse of not including certain milestones in the final product because it would have 'taken away' from the game?  Yeah... no.  This came across as a 'take the money and run' endeavor.  Save your money and get something else.			"

												Have you ever been offered chocolate cookies but after the first bite found it was raisins? Felt betrayed.""I am one with the tides, the tides is with me..."" - Castoff Chirrut Imwe - Admit it, they look alike.Expected more, but was disappointed.Encountered a great amount of bugs that made it dreadful. Battle mechanics was cheezy and does not pull you in. Some people say its not the main focus but should be more interesting.The story is rich and great but there should be a balance and events to get you back in.One thing I hated the most was the bugs on quests that shows complete but your journal never updates, then it freezes.It is so easy to avoid conflict. Once you have edge up you would never fail a task. Companions were interesting at first but then they get all over the place real quick as you go on and felt forced/rushed.The tides has a few impact on the game, unless you went Silver/Blue.It felt really incomplete. I hope in a year or so they implement all things they promised and more. Then I'll recommend it.			"

												There have already been some excellent full reviews of the game here on Steam, so I'm just adding in my summary:Pros:- At times very good story writing (I agree with other reviews that TTON plays more like a visual novel than a RPG)- Amazingly interactive world. A breath of fresh air and quite a lot of fun...even though it did seem a bit disjointed at times.Cons: - The combat and character mechanics absolutely killed this game for me. I ran a playthrough with the sole purpose of avoiding ANY combat but at times it is unavoidable. I can't remember the last time I was so upset with fight mechanics in a game from this genre. - Very little replayability. Without a large pool of companions to choose from and the shallow character generation (only 3 foci) I doubt I'll ever re-roll.			"

												What does one promise matter? Deception.A tragic tale of modern CRPG where all the dreams about a true successor of the greatest CRPG of all time shattered like broken glass. Torment: Tides of Numenera has everything going for it to be the definitive modern CRPG to remind people that this genre doesn't lack behemoths. And what a disappointment it is, 4 years in development, having collaboration from Mask of the Betrayer's original designers, PS:T's Colin McComb and Chris Avellone, over 4 million dollars funded on Kickstarter, comes a video game proved that inXile Entertainment forgot what made PS:T a true masterpiece.For a game that boasted itself as ""having more words than Bible"", T:ToN surprisingly has very few memorable moments and characters, its writing relies on unnecessarily long and flowery descriptions that seems to try too hard to shout ""look at me, appreciate all these Pulitzer-inspired writing prompts"" to readers. There's no fault in bringing a lot of text in CRPG, because it's one of the definitive features of the genre, but the problem is T:ToN has very few interesting things to say, and one thing won't get more interesting no matter how you keep describing it. It's a wordy game for the sake of being wordy, it sometimes feels like a very long pretentious short book that was made for people who don't have a huge vocabulary. As someone whose native language isn't English, I can read the translated version of Witcher saga from Andrej Sapkowski which has arguably equal amount of vocab but way comprehensive than T:ToN.You have a lot of questions, NPCs have a lot of answers and descriptions, but only a few of them is worth listening to. The story itself doesn't have any real climax or tension, one plot twist revealed near the end of act 2 is way too predictable, none of the companions is memorable or relatable in any mean except Shin, and the story only gets somewhat interesting when you reach The Bloom. It's 2017 and we're comparing role-playing games through words count? Why is the successor of Planescape: Torment is more boring, forgettable and lack any suspense when compared to Tyranny - a side project from Obsidian? Morte blew all of the companions in this game out of the water which is incredibly stupid because important character arcs is the trend of writing in modern video game yet T:ToN failed short in it. It's too proud of its pretentous messages and forgot that there are confusing readers being left behind in its mess of a narrative, a dumbfounded hollow of writing in CRPG that missed all the marks, lacked any emotion and didn't give us anything worth remembering.Everything else about Torment: Tides of Numenera screams lack of professional game design. The UI is stupidly designed, NPCs don't have portraits (yet several important ones have it in battles?), available portraits span from terrible to horrible, crisis has a decent concept yet in reality, is tedious because inXile has no idea how to make compelling combat sections, so they throw roaming/respawning/a huge number of enemies into your way as obstacle. Effort mechanic leans to Intellect skill checks too much, there's no reason to play Nano unless you tend to fight your way (which is not a great idea since all battles in this game are crap) or you want to cripple yourself. The Tides' impact is incredibly hard to notice. The Cyphers span from being completely useless to overpowered. Mark Morgan's 50-track OST doesn't have any remotely memorable tune. The Meres get old quick with more and more overexposition.Torment: Tides of Numenera was supposed to be the ""dream game"" for CRPG followers, instead, it's a game where hipsters try to pluck through the narrative then come back and ♥♥♥♥♥ slap people ""because you don't like reading in video games"". T:ToN is a badly made video game and a mediocre book with millions of unheard words that better stayed silent.			"

												I don't do speed runs, I don't ignore side quests yet the first run through took only thirteen hours to complete this game. (I have no wish for a 2nd run through)  I'd like to say this was down to my brilliant RPG skills cutting through the Gordian Knot but given it took me 23 hours to complete Tyranny (not known for it's length); no, this game is short and I'm feeling short changed.I'd make some combat about how weak the combat system was, but I really didn't see enough of it to be qualified to comment.  I think I had a grand total of 5 fights (or crisis) all game, what little I saw did not impress me.  In most RPG's you see more fights before getting out of the tutorial.  All that really sticks in my mind was how slow it was, if there was an option to speed up the enemy animation I didn't find it, those few fights I did have really dragged.  Without combat, what was there?  Puzzles?  What was there was so simple I'm not sure they were meant to be a puzzle or not.  The game was mostly running back and forth, clicking on NPC's and ploughing through the turgid dialogue.  I think the writers used every word in the dictionary except brevity, very little of it was useful to completing the plot.  At no point did I need to engage my brain in this game.  Humour?  Nope.  I got more laughs from watching Clockwork Orange.  The real killer though wasn't it only took 13 hours to complete.  No, the clincher is; at no point in those 13 hours do I remember enjoying the game.  "

												EDIT: Review below.I am enjoying this game.BUT I have to give it a negative review because of the scummy business tactics used by inExile.No matter how good this game is , it is most certainly not a 5 year long , $5 million game.Where did the time and money go ? Other projects? Mismanagement? Who can truly say at this point.But the crux of the story is that this is NOT the game detailed and outlined on their kickstarter.(no where near it).It's ok to cut a few stretch goals to finish in the proposed time. But cutting down even the core content after years of delay? Inexcusable.EDIT: The Good: -incredibly strange and unique world.-story is alright so far, it's fun and enjoyable to work through.-Side quests and characters are so interconnected that plot threads feed the living world quite well.- Background detail is sufficient.- Background music is good.The Bad:-Combat is a boring slog, it doesn't come up often though which just means 1/3 of the characters skills and uniqueness is pointless in this game.-UI : The game is clearly rushed in terms of UI/UX polish.-AI: Path finding is Bugged as hell. Often lose a character because they get stuck running into other characters and objects.- AI: Combat AI is pointless, never had a fight which is interesting from a tactics point. Considering the few amount of fights in the game I was hoping they would all be very unique.-Settings: For a game built on the Pillars tech, it sure lacks settings and options.- Virtually Silent: this game has no sound bar the one time I heard voice acting , and the very subtle background noises now and then.CONCLUSION:A decent RPG but no where near what the ""Big Name Reviewers"" are promising. But it if you have a hankering for new weird locations to read about and explore.If you are looking for a decent CRPG experience then look at Pillars of Eternity instead.This game lacks a serious amount of polish and design. The story is good and the amount of detail sufficient but the gameplay elements are very lacklustre. If the game was never ""about combat"" then why bother spending your limited time and resources fleshing out a combat mechanic?Game could've been so much more , but threw away too much in pursuit of a ""great story"".

												Heavy handed. Boring and disappointing. I can deal with the repetitive combat. It's isometric RPG, and while some games can still pull that through, that's quite a high bar to not recommend this on. I can forgive the stale and forgettable companions. Creating a Bioware class side kick is difficult, something even the best RPGs fail to do. I'm not asking for another Minsc or HK-47. After all these years I've waited for something akin to Morte, Nordom, Vhailor, Dakkon, and Grace to resurge (no, I didn't like Annah, and Ignus was a filthy traitor), not finding any of character even close to likeable is disappointing. But this is not Black Isle's baby. It's just a self proclaimed 'Spiritual successor'. I would have at least contended with something akin to Pillars of Eternity. Pillars was okay. Felt more like Ice WInd Dale than Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment.But then I reached (to spare you spoilers) a mid point crucial moment, and met a mentor like person who supposed to 'teach' you things, I felt the heavy heavy heavy hand of the writers imposing their point of view on you. It's not necessarily 'poor writing' but it isn't good for gaming, especially this sort of gaming, where player agency is paramount. You are presented with a fantastical world, and I've gobbled up all the text. I've read through every minutiae of description on baubles that you sold off as junk, just because they spiked the imagination. But after all that, if what you are faced with is some pedantic idiot spewing pseudo philosophical gibberish in their proclaimed role as the Obi-Wan Kenobi, then screw this game. It's not RPG; it's not even Choose your own adventure. It's just the writers masturbating to their own writing; it shares its genealogy with the worst of Eurotrash, High minded, looking down on the player, force feeding mindless philosophy. It's not Planescape Torment. It's a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor imitation, and I regret backing this during kickstarter.			"

												Four years after its record-breaking crowdfunding campaign, and more than two years after its planned release date, Torment: Tides of Numenera has arrived. Fans of Planescape: Torment had long looked forward to the game’s release, excited by the opportunity to play an isometric RPG with a focus on thoughtful story-telling, compelling characters set against a bizarre backdrop. Today, those fans are decidedly underwhelmed. Let me be clear, this game is not awful, but it pales in comparison to many of its ‘isometric rpg renaissance’ peers, and comes across more as an awkward imitation of the original Torment than a loving tribute. While the backdrop of the ‘Ninth World’ echoes the oddness of Planescape setting well, the games are otherwise very different.Where the 1999 game’s plot was engaging, surprising and satisfying, Tides of Numenera’s is thin, obvious and quite forgettable. Where the Nameless One kept company with a floating skull, a demoness and a mechanical box-thing, the Last Castoff will journey with people that many orthodontists would find to be a bit dreary. It is not just the game’s writing that leaves much to be desired. The action – rare as it is – is maddeningly slow and repetitive. The character generation system – which initially seems to offer a great deal of choice – has very little impact on the game. Even the vaunted ‘tides’ morality system, which appears to have the potential to add depth to your character’s choices, has little more than a cosmetic impact on the game.Reader, if you are hoping to recapture Planescape: Torment’s unusual approach to adventuring, this game will be a terrible disappointment... but dry those tears. A few month ago, rival game studio Obsidian Entertainment beat InXile to the punch, releasing a bizarre isometric RPG of their own. While Tyranny’s setting is far less similar to Planescape than Tides of Numenera's, it entertains in a very similar way. Characters include a haunted suit of armour and a mind-absorbing maniac named ‘The Voices of Nerat.’Skip this, get that. Don’t let InXile get away with phoning in such a promising idea – especially after the crowdfunding efforts, the two year delay and the big selling job.			"

												I was not a backer of Torment: Tides of Numenera, however I am a great fan of original Planescape: Torment and text-heavy RPGs. I waited for TTOM (I'll use this abbreviation) for a long, long time and it is one of the worst disappointments I have ever faced in gaming.So now, dear friend, let me shortly summarize how incompetent InXile was while creating this mess.1) Writing. Many people here complain on terrible combat (that's true) or broken promises (that's true), or at best complain on awful companions (also true) but whitewashing the writing of this game. As I have written above, I am a fan of original Torment and text-heavy RPGs in general. But if TTOM is what devs nowadays understand as ""deep, high quality writing"" then I'd prefer to play hack n slash, because surviving the writing style of this game was... torment.Planescape: Torment had a lot of wonderfully written, moving, wise, meaningful text. Torment: Tides of Numenera looked at this and the only thing it understood is ""a lot of ANY text is good"". The final result: the game is filled to the brim with verbose, overdescriptive, exhausting, pretentious, and worst of all - completely redundant, meaningless, non-engaging writing. TTOM is proud of describing the most trivial **** in the most bloated, pseudo-intellectual way possible, and breaking rules of ""show, don't tell"" in every way. And trust me - I read a lot of books, so I'm not averse to a lot of reading - I simply hate meaningless writing which confuses quantity with quality. Maybe I would be less angry on writing in TTOM if next to this nonsense it actually bothered to be emotional in some aspects. But it has completely failed to move my heart and soul. In this game you will get 100 000 words describing how characters look, yet very very few words which even attempt to make you feel what those characters feel.2) Story. Another catastrophic failure, on a level completely separate from the horrible writing style. Planescape: Torment had story which was simultaneously personal, moving, emotional, philosophical and coherent. In this game, you spend 90% of it to ""find x to get information on artifact y"", waiting for hours for your questions to be answered - for some kind of reveal - only for this reveal to be super disappointing. Within first 15 minutes of  the game, you ask yourselves a lot of plot questions (""What is Sorrow"" etc) - none of them are really answered in a ridiculously rushed, chaotic mess of an ending. Main story of TTOM is hilariously desperate to be ""philosophical"" but it doesn't have anything genuine to say, so it indulges into pseudo-intellectual babble about Tides, while failing to build empathy towards any of its characters. 3) Companions and charactersInXile originally promised us 9 party companions, then delivered only 6 while saying ""we needed to cut out those three to make remaining ones really good"". I have no idea how bad those characters were before, then, because the final result is party of completely bland, uninteresting NPCs you don't give a **** about... with one exception - hilariously, that exceptional character was written by an outsider ""guest"" writer, not devs themselves. Other than this one character, I failed to care about anybody in TTOM universe, including main character.4) Nonlinearity, morality and endingsMy character was follower of compassionate, Golden Tide, so he got two extra lines of description on one of the static, ugly ending slides.5) Difficulty levelI don't really wanna to indulge in mechanics of this game here, let me just say that it is so ""brilliantly"" balanced and designed that after first few hours you will be capable of passing almost every single skill check with 100% success rate - at least that's how it worked for me, although I am not alone and others had similar problem. No tension or difficulty at all. 6) Awful combatCombat mechanics in TTOM are quite probably the worst I have ever experienced in any RPG, with the possible exception of Arcanum. Combat here is rare, but when it happens it is incredibly slow, bugged, frustrating, non-strategic mess. Encounters you face are absurdly designed - for example, the moment you begin combat your enemy insta-kills your weakest character and cripples three other party members. Generally 90% of enemies you face have higher initiative than your party, so good luck with strategy when everybody you encounter jumps on you from all sides.7) Nonexistant soundtrackI can't honestly say TTOM's music was ""bad"" because I have barely heard anything of it over the course of game. For some reason 90% of it is quiet, bland ambient.8) Broken promisesInXile has promised us: few more locations (especially Oasis M'Ra Jolios and Ruins of Ossiphagan), three more companions, crafting, player's stronghold, lacunae, separate Labyrinth mechanics, dozens of Focuses and many other things. It not only failed to deliver them, it failed to inform us of them.So, that's my opinion on Torment: Tides of Numenera.			"

Early Access Review
								UPDATE: I've been playing the final game now, but not on PC. FIRST OFF: My gaming PC broke like a week before the game published. I had no ready cash to sink in to a PC, so I bought it (again) on PS4. So I cannot comment on the technical side of the game on this review. On PS4, it works better than expected (I didn't expect much, to be honest). It's a bit sluggish and not super amazing looking. But honestly, it's not like anyone played Planescape for graphics, either.IN SHORT: Very text heavy RPG, basically a novel of ginormous size that you can wander through and read all the accompanying lore. There is very little combat, and all of it can be avoided. There is a number of systems at play in game that are not very well explained and take a long time (in some cases) to figure out. Despite some items having a lot of lore attached to them, they are often just random throwaway stuff that you're just meant to sell away.SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCE: Torment Tides of Numenera, I am glad to say works as intended. It has a story that is mostly about thematic depth, interesting conversations, very interesting lore, and more text than you can possibly imagine. This is probably a guinness world record, isn't it? It also, at least on first glance, seems to have quite a lot of options that make difference. It's hard to say if this is actually true unless you play the game several times over. But at first playthrough it seems to be hinting at quite the number of decisions. I am not saying the crisis system is the best system ever, but it does bring an interesting de-emphasis to combat. You don't need to fight a damn thing in this game, and often you should be thinking: should I even fight? In conclusion; if you liked Torment: Planescape, you will like this game. Unless like so many, you are blinded by nostalgia. The fact is that most gamers are nostalgic to a fatal degree and can't grasp that some things will never have the same impact once you've experienced them once (like playing a truly story driven RPG first time, like Planescape). It doesn't mean Numenera is worse than Planescape, it means you are different. I think Numenera is better than Planescape, but mostly because of presentation and technical things. Planescape was horrible game when it came to combat, and the whole DnD aspect dragged it down badly. The strange world of Numenera lifts this game up, and the systems don't in general get too much in the way of the game. However, I haven't finished this game yet so I can't say for sure that the story is as good. I might update this review once I finish the game, or I might not. Who cares? This is just my opinion anyway.Like I said, I recommend this game for those who want a story driven, text infused, very slow paced game with mostly optional combat in a very surreal world.			"

												I have mixed feelings after playing this game. I bought it hoping for a proper RPG game and it delivers in some aspects, but it doesn't in most of them:+multiple ways of solving riddles (there are usually 2 ways to solve a quest)+different endings (you get a summary of how different lifes went on after the end of the game)+story (quite interesting)+""colors system"" which shows you if you did chose the ""righteaous/curious/YOLO"" path-""you can complete the game without fighting"", no, you can't and this statement is just an excuse for poor combat/lack of.- story (it feels like a copy of Baldur's Gate II though, where you are a ""child of a god"" as well and another child wants you dead)- poor combat (since it's there anyway, it's actually an important aspect of the game because it should force you to build your team, but in the end, it doesn't matter so much which characters you pick and what offensive skills you chose for them)-------- In polish version, a voice actor that is a legend due to his voice acting in Baldurs Gate was advertised to work on the game, but afterall he reads only the intro, which IMHO was cheating on the customers.I was not a fan of PS:T, was hoping for something closer to BaldursGate/IcewindDale therefore I'm dissapointed but I admit that nobody was advertising this one as a competition for these titles.Spoiler:- Skip offensive skills on you character, invest in stuff that helps you questing (intelligence, persuasion, knowlege, anamnesis(or whatever it is in english).- The only usefull spell I found on nano is ""summon living fire"" which always draws all NPCS during combat, letting you save HP- Just get Callistege and Erritis, give them the ring that lets them share states so callistege can buff erritis and erritis kills everything			"

												Torment: Tides of Numenera, the successor to Planescap...wait, no.Torment: Tides of Numenera, the spiritual succ...nope!Torment: Tides of Numenera, the thematic successor? (What the heck does that even mean...?)What is this game? Here's a better title:Numenera: The Fluffy Tides Make You Fall Asleep (a poor attempt at Star Wars: The Force Awakens.)Who's in torment? It certainly isn't the Last Castoff. The Tides may as well not even exist, or be referred to like something as gravity for that matter. They have no impact on game play, nor are they an ethical system, or what people think of you. Legacy is just another name for ""extra screen at the ending.""So we're left with this idea: take the template from Planescape:Torment, look at it, then throw it away.-Switch up the setting, since they can't get the license. (The setting is amazing by definition, not by opinion.)-Create a boring protagonist who has the character of a blank RPG sheet -- minus the stats, since there are only 3.-Forget everything from P:T that made the characters deep with their personal conflicts, faults, and philosophies, and forget putting tropes upside down on their heads in a fantasy D&D setting. Instead, create people who are simply there and have almost nothing to do with anyone (save maybe Matkina?)-Get Chris Avellone to write the only entertaining character, Erritis, instead of putting him in charge.--""Oh but if you give Rhin to X, she becomes tall and...""--zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.-Waste Mark Morgan's time and have him create over 40 pieces of forgettable pieces of music.-Get, in some cases, highschool level artwork to have ""meres"" or memory experiences that change other castoff's memories or time or whatever (?), because that worked so well in Pillars of Eternity. So you can change your tidal affinity. Which does nothing.-Re-invent ""turn based combat"" by providing dozens of weapons and armor -- armour that only you can wear -- but half the time during ""Crises"" you're going to be talking, or running through a group of enemies to solve the problem in a non-combat way. Essentially the strategy of running around like an armoured up A-Team truck, because a selling point will be to ""go through the entire game without fighting."" Thus, making combat for people who play Glaive, or of players who want to actually play a game, a chore. Thanks, endless amounts of teleporting Bloom--Predatory Echoes. (If I wanted to play a visual novel, I'd get one with sex, nudity and actual drama. Thanks, senpai.)-Lie about in the marketing how Glaives can attack twice in a turn (note:provided your first turn killed an enemy, and you bothered to get the skill to attack again.)-Get oddities from long sidequests that literally do nothing but clutter up your inventory-Have a scrolling inventory of useless items -- 2 rows of 14 items at a time-Pick up Cypher Sickness when completing a quest if you didn't choose a Jack. If you are a Jack, die.-Bombard us with narrative fluff in an already padded out story of figuring out how to fix a Resonance Chamber, whatever that is, 95% of the time.-Beat your daddy by telling him he doesn't exist, because he's actually an AI program. I'm not kidding.People who were expecting Planescape: Torment? Get used to entire weird worlds of disppointment.People who want drama and philosophy and conflict and layers of meaning and memorab-- look elsewhere.Pros:-I'd say the writing is on a level only slightly better than Pillars of Eternity. And Good Lord is there fluff; you'll be going through this text faster than any other Infinity Engine style game, choosing the option where you get to use your Effort.-You can tell all your hipster friends you like narrative heavy games, because you're a smart video gamer.""What does one life matter?"" After 4 years and 5 million bucks of delayed, dropped content, I don't know, Colin.  If that's your response to ""what can change the nature of a man"", well, I guess we all knew what we were getting into beforehand.Like Star Wars, The Force Awakens, this is a fan made game trying to use a winning formula, only worse: they didn't understand why the original worked.

												As someone who have played the original source material (Numenera RPG, the tabletop one) before. This one is hard for me. inXile did put a breath of life to the Ninth World fantastically. The world, the background are weird and odd, but carry the abstractly beautiful aesthetic that is a throwback to the old games like Myst, Oddworld, and The Longest Journey. However, the story, dialogue, and bad adaption of tabletop system kills the fun for me.Story is good, but not really something to write home about. Maybe I did set the bar too high, but it did not leave a strong lasting impression. It will entice you to follow it, but sometime I get bored and just quit the game. Instead of wanting to get to the end on my own, it feels more like a carrot on a stick. Also I do not like most of the companions as a person. That maybe a good or bad thing because I do not know how others do find them. I feel that they are really unlikable, almost Anti-Mary Sue like unlikable. I do not see anything good in them at all. Everyone except for the Lost Child who Talks to God, and the Furtive Jack who Murders. One thing I really appreciate about this is inXiles decision to separate the continuity from the source material because lately it has been cancerous lately not so subtly pushing political agenda, but also to let the uninitiated have an easy time understanding this weird little world.Dialogue carries the worst sin in this game. For the denizens of the Ninth World, they sure do speak and behave like typical Hipsters and the Millenials of San Francisco of today. Not all of them, sure. But when I came across one, the magic is shattered and the wonders fade. The other times, it just feel odd. I understand that this is the future world where everything is eerie and weird, but I just cannot seem to relate. Star Trek and other Speculative Fictions also do boast weird alien cultures, but it is done well. Not in this case though.The gameplay. Where should I begin, this will be a long topic. First, how about lack of character customisation though your mileage may vary with this one. Planescape: Torment is an old game, lack of customisation is excusable for the game of that period. I feel this is a missed opportunity, even though 'your appearance is a plot point', so why the so called plot point cannot follow the player customisation. Why the devs do not let players have fun express themselves properly through the 'Role-Playing' game. I seriously do not want to be some guy with bad tan and a bad hairdo.Second, the severe lack of Foci option. You only have 3 foci which is not really much, the source material has about 30 which I believe can be easily translated. Why I cannot be a Jack who WIelds Two Weapon or Wields Power with Precision, or a Nano who Explores Dark Places.Third, the introduction of HP, stunted starting pool, lack of Edge in the beginning. The Cypher system is simple enough to translate to video game format without much difficulty, yet the dev decided to 'adapt it to video game' and the work did screw up the balance and fun of the system. For the uninitiated, the source material has no HP. Any damage you sustain goes into the appropriate pool (mental assault hits Intellect, a hamstring hits Speed, a slash hits Might), if the appropriate pool are depleted then it goes to the next appropriate. If one pool is depleted, you are in big trouble with a penalty to every action. If two pools are depleted, you are near death as in utterly covered bruises and bleeding or something along that line, can take no action and can only crawl. Three gone, you are dead. No need to introduce HP at all. Your starting pool are higher (average out at 9-10), and you begin with appropriate Edge or two of your chosen class so that, say a Nano can use Onslaught with for free without having to run to inn every time he depletes his pool (and put himself in a bad situation). Also you have 6 Tiers and recover your pool through recovery pool, not magical inn rest that cures everything including AIDS.This will be direct questions to the dev: I poked around the inner workings, I just want to ask why? I saw that you were going for a 1-1 translation of the game, so why everything ended up half-baked. Dangers of Kickstarter of having to listen 100 opinions pushing you 100 directions as a designer so you have to compromise to satisfy everyone but in the end let everyone down? Also the 'hand-crafted' combat encounters is too heavy handed, let thing flow, give some space for players to work with please.Everything feels like a giant half-hearted of a letdown in attempt to please everyone. Not every customer wants what they say they want, you are game designer, developers. You should know these situations well where if you let a customer just use you as a tool which is precisely commanded through feedback, then the end result is going to be bad.No more please. Never again.Message to the devs ends hereTo summarise. I would not recommend this. It is fun, charming, lovely, but ultimately a massive letdown and you see a fleeting grand vision of what could have been a magnificent masterpiece, a disappointment you cannot let go like an ex with a tragic breakup.

												Disclaimer: I do NOT reccomend the game at its current pricing. Furthermore, after much thought, I do not reccomened it for what it claims to be. This is no Planescape: Torment and it is not a worthy successor. Nevertheless, there is something worth the time it takes to play, even if it is deeply flawed. Below is my first formal attempt at a review, which I have tried to do indepth and professionally as possible.At the conclusion, there will be a numerical score with a breakdown for my reasoning behind it.---Background---I backed this game for a sum of forty dollars the week it was announced. I discovered the kickstarter just as I was finishing Planescape: Torment, the last of the great CRPG classics that I was cleaning out of my backlogue. Starting with Baldurs Gate, I have gone through that entire series, the Neverwinters, the Icewind Dales, Arcanum, and had also played entirety of the newer roleplaying games of both high and low prominence, such as Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Jade Empire, Inquisitor, Knights of the Old Republic, and was also following the development of Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, Age of Decadence, and so on and so forth.I was one of the cautiously surprised wave surfers of the ""age of incline"" or the ""new golden age of RPGs."" And Planescape: Torment had just become the crown jewel and the capstone of that period of my life before the new era began.Should a developer or InXile affiliate read this, I have a personal note. This was my first Kickstarter I ever participated in, and I was very hesitant to lay down that much (or any) money for any project. While my tier was low as far as backers go, it was a lot of money for me, considering that I was funding my own education at the time and came from a poor background. So I placed a lot of value in this game. During the years it took for T:TON to be developed, I went through multiple rough patches where suicide seemed to be the answer. Yet thought that persisted in my mind when I came close to doing something drastic was that I would never see the return on this monetary investment, and I didn't want to die after wasting thirty five ♥♥♥♥ing bucks. So yeah. I'm not claiming T:TON saved my life. It didn't. I had other reasons or pulling through in the end, but it was one of many minor things that kept me going.---Development, Production, and Publishing---Hype was generated through regular Kickstart updates and YouTube videos with lofty promises, but I have always been a pessimist and I decided early to not buy in. Many did, however, and ended up donating even more.In the months to come, major cuts of important goals were promsied, but never mentioned. These were things that people donated for with expectation of their deliverance. It would have been forgivable if they had been straightforward and transparant about it, but they were not. A backer had to discover it and confront them before it was admitted.An apology is owed to the backers. This is a shameful incident. Luckily, they managed to salavage (from whatever unknown difficulty and strife was responsible for these cuts) a decent game that delivers an excellent story.They acceped a publishing contract with Techland  who, if I have the story correct, was responsible for the decision to port it to XBox-One and PS4, and footed the bill for the ports. The game was promised to be optimized for PC. In the end, it was not.Of note, the Italians were also screwed over and never got a translation, as they were promised.In the end, the hype:delivery ratio would make Todd Howard proud.---Review---Artistic Visuals:  First off, the enviromental visuals are utterly fantastic in my opinion. The otherwordly vibe of official Numenera artwork and universe is captured perfectly. Every single location in the game seems irreplacible unique and incomparable to other settings. This is most definitely a worthy introduction to the surreal beauty of Numenera. +2GUI: In stark contract, the GUI is minimalistic most of the time, and overwhelming at other times. Thankfully, this game is not one that is reliant on the GUI to be playable. During exploration, it is very clean. Perhaps a little too clean. During dialogue, the box is far too large. It is visually appalling and sometimes even detrimental to the actions being described, as characters and objects are often cut off and sometimes not visible at all.A classic CRPG feature is pressing a 'tab' to highlight all objects. Here it is absolutely overwhelming. Every name is enshrined in a massive decoration that is unecessary, while everything else is covered in an icon indicating its purpose. It doesn't simply highlight, it adds a whole new layer of buttons and symbols, along with respective text labels for all of them.There is also no way to see where a scene transition is going to take you without consulting your map, which is on a separate screenThe CYOA UI of Meres is nice, but I've heard of some bugs at higher resolutions. -.5 Combat: I'm not going to go into depth here due to the character limit, but it is mediocre at best and flat out atrocious at worst. It is not a focus of the game, but it is still a feature. A bad feature. -.8 Writing: Varies wildly. Most tertiery background characters and minor antagonists recieve the most depth, while most companions are lacking in enough dialogue to make them feel human. The main characters, such as the Changing God, the Sorrow,  and the Last Castoff are tragically the worst written. Rhin, Erritis, Tyber, Inifere, and the Bloom are the best characterized.It frequently devolves into adjective porn and purple prose. More edits should have been done. I have a large vocabulary and was able to understand everything in the game without consulting a dictionary, but there were some cases of uneeded verbosity. However, what is actually being written, is indeed literary. Reminiscent of Gene Wolfe in particular, and yes, even PS:T. +3.3, -.7 Story/Plot: It is definitely not on par with PS:T, but it isn't entirely dissociated from it. It is excellent for the era it was released in. This is a cut above Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland, Sword of Dragonspear, etc. On par with Age of Decadence, with better writing. However, it tries to be too different AND too similar to PS:T at the exact same time. The epynonymous ""torment"" element is particularly lacking. +4, -.2 Choice and Consequence: Average. It delivers what should be expected of all story heavy RPGs. Not as hyperreactive as promised, however. +0, -0 Pacing: Sagus Cliffs is the only decently paced area in the entire game and the ending feels rushed due to cut content that would have filled the gaps. -.3 Levels: The non-linearity and linearity is unbalanced, again, due to cut content again. But the content of them is rife with well designed quests, and non-quest exploration that is rewarded and engaging. Size varies, but feels right in the end. The Bloom is fantastic. +2, -.5 Mechanics: Stat Pools are laughable and easily abused, but are drained enough to need management. There is a bias towards being a nano and getting their mind reading abilities, but overall, the games skills are balanced and are checked often. They add a lot in the end. -.4, +.5 Bugs: Minor ones still present during writing of review, but nothing that will ruin your game. But some annoying ones none the less. -.2---Score: 6.9/10 PS:T's score: 9.5/10---Go in with zero expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It has an amazing world with a capitvating story. Expect what was promised, and you'll be very disappointed. This is one of the better examples of the RPG 'renaissance,' but a crude imitation of its inspiration, riddled with inconsistent quality, a bad development history and broken promises. I felt like it was worth my time, but I did not feel satisfied due to how much better it could have been. Buy it on sale.			"

												This should not be a game, it might have been a good pick-your-own-adventure book, but as a game, it´s mediocre.I loved Planescape Torment, one of the few 10/10 i ´ve played.TTON is at most a 5/10. The team promised a lot and delivered very little. If a selling point is ""you are able to complete the game without fighting"" (which is an option i like having), i´t cant be the only interestings way to complete it.Equipment wise, the game is poor, cyphers are irrlevants, classes are irrelevants, stats too. You don´t neet to sacrifice anything to get everything.I was imagining playing this game several times. After 1 and half playthrouhs i got bored. The numenera setting is very interesting, but the is so poorly implemented. and what is more, there are no plans to enable the community hub (which would have been a silver lining).4 years, 5+ millon $, a great team and such poor results can only be described as sad			"

Early Access Review
								Ah, Tides of Numenera. This game has great potential. It -can- become a truly great game. Perhaps one of the all-time greats.But we are not there yet. The game as it stands in December 2016 is a 10-hour buggy mess with a crappy combat system.So how come I recommend it do you say? Well, here's why. It -does- have great potential. The story is engrossing, the world is strange, mystical, and refreshing, the skills and abilities are cool and, for the most part, work really well. The combat system is an exception. It doesn't work well, and doesn't feel slick and dangerous, like combat should.Without going into spoilers I want to say that the main story so far looks really well put together. There are many throwbacks to Planescape: Torment, but this is definitely its own thing.The three-stat system, and how you use stats for skills and conversations all work really well.There's a lot of bugs in the current build, and hopefully by the time you read this review, they have ironed out the worst of them. I expect a lot of this game. I count on inXile to deliver. "

												Did you always want to gently massage the rim of a giant alien's sphincter in order to climb up it? Listen to endless people drone on about Legacies and whether their life matters or not in paragraph after paragraph of wordy, description-heavy text? Go bake a cake while the game plays itself, as masses of enemies march around endlessly in unavoidable Crises? Read stories and look at pictures which looked like they were made by highschoolers with a too-high opinion of themselves? Succeed in every skill check because you're awesome, they're awesome, everybody's awesome? Congratulations, Torment: Tides of Numenera is just the game for you.For my part, next time I'm in the mood for this level of entertainment, I'll just wash the dishes. At least that gives a certain sense of accomplishment.			"

												I've tried very hard from day one to love this game and it's wonderful story.  Yet I felt like I was forcing myself to justify paying a steep premium for something I had buyers remorse for and could not return in time. I won't bore you with deep introspective reflection and waxing about the original which I enjoyed. I felt the story was the only part of the game that was polished and the rest was left behind. I need more than just talk and it fell off the radar for me. No offense to the developers or those who love it, I realize this game is somewhat of niche game but it's not for me.			"

												Sadly I am joining the ranks of users dissatisfied with this game.  I gave it a good 8 hours but when I realized that I was forcing myself to continue playing in the hopes it would improve I decided it was not worth my time.  I'm sure there's a great story here, but I don't want to have to slog through text block after text block to uncover it.  I like playing my games, being involved in them moreso than just selecting another dialogue option.I believe the lack of combat gameplay really hurt this game - in other CRPGs the combat/dungeon crawling provides a break from the text and allows the player to experience the world.  This is very lacking in this game.  There is very little combat at all and the existing combat is all staged - it feels less interactive and more like an alternate form of dialogue.I guess that's my overall impression of the game: it's a videogame that feels like its designed to be read and not played.There are so many ways a videogame can be used to show something, immerse the players, but this feels like someone telling me a story as opposed to showing/letting me experience it. The introduction has you falling to your (believed) death - but, instead of having a quick cinematic showing you falling from a great height and crashing to the ground, there is a 10 minute narration about the fall, oh look there's a forest over there, oh were you being chased by something? oh wait is that the ground....wait for it....still narrating...finally, you hit the ground.  And the graphic display for this?  A black screen with white streaks that I think are supposed to be wind.Each character you meet has blocks of descriptor but I have yet to encounter a single character portrait concept art.  There is a section of the dialogue box that looks designed to hold a portrait but it remains a blank grey canvas.  Even when you speak to your companions there is no close up portrait of them.3 million plus words is not a selling point!  It's a sign that a better editor was needed.			"

Early Access Review
								First, let me say at the time of writing this, this game is early beta and it shows. There's quite a few bugs, it's not very stable even with high end computers, and you can tell there's some basic features that haven't been implemented. Thankfully, this build of the game has a convenient and ever present feedback button that makes reporting the bugs and other issues much easier. Second, in spite of that knowledge, I'd like to recommend opting into the beta because this game is just that promising. It's still too soon to say with any certainty if this game will be just a good game or a great game, but I will say that what I have seen is special. Everything from the setting to the writing to the mechanics is just brimming with potential, and even with the game only being partially realized I can say that it is worth checking out and that you should keep your expectations high.

												Badly mismanaged development leads to a crudely foreshortened final act. This is a decent game but far too short for the price.The botched final act is why I left a negative review. All that time looking for a way to fix the resonance chamber but it just floats into the room after half an hour offscreen with a Mazzof who was still covered in Bloom vomit. In general the areas are quite claustrophobic, with some cut entirely. You can see the loose ends of cut content in many places.Also the setting is too much random, disconnected atomised trinkets, with little or no cohesion. The frustration from that is exacerbated by the overly adjective-heavy writing. Sometimes less is more. Plus, I don't find an endless series of literal Deus Ex Machinas a satisfying narrative device.The character portraits are apparently photos of faces that then got surrounds painted onto them - Aligern's face is set square to the camera while his body and head are at an angle. Not only that but I saw some much better alternative portraits, which Inexile made, which looked far better than those used ingame, for Tybir, Callistege, Aligern, Matkina. The ones in game are expressionless; that's arguably fitting for Matkina and Aligern and Erritis, who are cold, depressed and vacant respectively. But the alternative portrait for Callistege is so superior - it expresses her personality very well. Reminds me of an exgirlfriend of mine.Also, what's with the lighting being so flat?However, Rhin is not only good, but is something I've never seen in an RPG before. very unusual concept. It's a decent/good game but it's so obviously worse than what it should have been, it pisses me off.			"

												Loads of text is not the same as good storytelling.Longer description is not a better description.Dialogue overflood with nonsense words is not the same as clever dialogue.Playing this game makes you feel like walking through the museum looking at the exhibits in a glass cases that you cannot interact with and ultimately that you don't care about. Next to each of the exhibits is a plate telling you what awesome thing it is that you can see, but again, you don't care.This game is nothing like Planescape, It's pretentionus, boring, filled with pseudo-philosophic babble. I played it for 4 hours and it felt like 40 hours. Good game should give you the exact opposite feeling.			"

								Now I've been through the early access version meticulously (expected bugs included) and in spite of the few glitches, it's obvious what a completely awesome and amazing story this is.I totally and gleefully look forward to the finished version.Lifting the legacy of Planescape Torment is, in my eyes, quite an impossibility. I've kept coming back to that game like a favourite story since it was released, but I almost think they might succeed. In creating a setting so different, and yet so similar, I feel like I'm being given all the same philosophical, ambiguous and metaphysical strangeness, but in a new world without it being just old stuff reiterated. The atmosphere is different, the characters, the tone. And yet somehow, it's recognisable as a successor. Long story short, this is the kind of story that I will likely keep coming back to in the future too.I can't wait to see the finished product.10/10			"

												I was a massive fan of isometric crpgs in my youth and have naturally replayed all the reworked version in later years. Pillars of Eternity was for the most part a great experience and I am looking forward to the next one in 2018.Quite unhappy with how this game turned out though, even as a massive fan of the first one. The combat feels slow and dull, oftentimes enemies just zerg you and you have to win fast. Also you feel compelled to do at least some combat as it often leads to greater rewards than the more diplomatic approach. I don't miss the massive amount of trashmobs from PST but i do miss the crpg combat system.Story is fine 13 hours in. Game looks decent even though movements oftentimes are ugly and wierd. Generally is just really miss the pacechanges from crpgs - going from hardhitting dialogue the has you all wrapped up in stories, characters and places, to fast paced pause-based combat.I so wanted to like this. So much. I just find the game somewhat tedious, and would much rather just read the story as a book.Edit: Pillars of earth :D			"

												You know that weird guy downtown who talks convincingly about things that don't make sense? Well I only made it 14 hours into this game before my party died of boredom but its a whole world full of those guys.  There's a point at which creative and esoteric becomes convoluted and just confusing. Not in an immersive way.  When something weird happens, I die and just come back...no fuss...even less so. This game felt more like a showcase for an obscure setting than anything else.  I'm glad I supported it because I don't want to see the genre die...I just want it to be more fun.			"

												I'm giving this a thumb down with really a heavy heart.And this be a high(ish) tier KS backer bleeding heart, for that matter. And that's the crux of the problem, I think.By no means is Numenera an objectively bad game, but I think it unfortunate that the KS campaign is probably the best excecuted area of the whole project. I admit I could not manage my expectations because PS:T is forever a favourite. Someone coming to this game with lesser vested interest will probably really like it.The writing is quite good, with interesting and even touching little destinies. I mean: why did I feel so sad for a ""stillborn"" robot, for example?? The story is a definate highlight. I also think visually the game is pleasing.But I really, really hate the combat. It's not particularly good as far as turn based go, IMO - and because the emphasis more or less has to be on ""social"" skills and checks to get the most out of the gameworld, I've found myself quite on the plain side as far as fighting prowess go.Here the promised but not delivered death labyrinths would have been handy, to add a silver lining to the fumbling combat.I find the turn based solution poor and inorganic - not to mention that BG-style pausable tactical combat could be played as turn based by enabing auto-pause. Why not deliver both worlds, when this has been the case in the classics of the genre inXile is paying homage to?Do I regret backing? Not exactly. I did not get what I hoped for, but at least inXile got my good-will when it needed it the most. I wish to be optimistic that this title will serve a basis from which inXile can improve many a tantalising idea that did not get the depth it would have deserved. But I doubt that I would pre-pay them on faith again.			"

												When I first ran the game on release day and clicked on the options menu, I noticed all the text in the settings menu was blurry. When I entered the actual game, I saw that the in-game text was also blurry. Since I wasn't sure if I was the only person with this problem, I posted in the forums to see if other people were having it, and to my surprise the blurry text turned out to be there for everyone (although there are varying opinions about how bothersome it is).After some debate about it in the forum, a developer message responds:""Thanks for letting us know. We're aware of this behavior - this is not really a new issue with Unity, many games using UGUI seem to exhibit it.Prior to release we weren't able to find an ideal solution that didn't also introduce other issues. We'll investigate our options further for future updates.""You can find the thread about the blurry text problem here:https://steamcommunity.com/app/272270/discussions/0/133258092255625842/Unfortunately, I can't play a game that is so focused on text dialog if it has a blurry text problem. Since Steam can provide refunds for any reason, you should be able to buy the game and then judge whether the blurry text problem is annoying enough for you to justify returning the game. If this problem ever gets fixed, I'll update my review, but for now the game is going to sit on my digital shelf since I kickstarted the project and have no option for a refund.			"

												I recommended this game, butit is definitely not for everyone. Planescape: Torment was like reading a book in game form. As the Spiritual successor Torment: Tides of Numenera (T:ToN) is the same. So if you aren't into dialogue heavy games then this is not for you.The writing is very good though. It is interesting. Sometimes it feels to me like there is some trying hard to be different and exotic, but mostly it's excellent.Combat is done fairly interestingly. You ""spend"" your stat points to perform actions, or boost them. Then use consumables or rest to restore them.Ciphers are special consumables, you can only carry a limited amount, or you get penalties, and they are one use only. But you get enough that I don't really get the ""I'll save this for when I need it"" hoarding.Annoted my logbook.			"

												Can't believe this was 4 years in the making!?Where's the VO and NPC portraits you showed us in the preview video from 3 years ago?! At least you could have recorded VO for plot critical NPCs.Writing's mostly uninspired, that Planescape Torment charm is noticeable only in traces, humor is almost nonexistent, the Last Castoff's in the background and everybody's just talking about the Changing God all the time. It makes you feel like a sidekick character who's in a wrong story. Presentation of critical events is anti-climatic and areas, while visually interesting, are devoid of events that make them feel alive.Combat system is worse than PST's which says a lot! And what's the purpose of a mind reading ability if that info is almost never useful in conversations?I backed this up on KS for $20 but if I bought this for $45 I would ask for a refund. This is the last Inxile game I'm supporting.It looks like not everybody's heart was in this (I believe Colin's truly was) and Inxile probably just pursued this because they wanted to cash in on PST's legendary reputation. This is a missed opportunity where a lingering thought of ""what could have been"" remains in the end.			"

												I would have loved to rate this positivly, but the game isn't worth it.  I think they made a mistake going with the numenera system.  While the setting is fantastic, the system is absolutly geared towards pen and paper, high role playing, not CRPG.  As such, story and campaign wise, it would have made for a great P&P game, but it falls flat in this medium.  It is to easy.  I went back to play Planescape: Torment, and died twice trying escape the first level.  There is no tension here, and some pretty poor decisions in the NPC interactions (dialogs are *pain*) turn what should have been an enjoyable, well though out and well written (it is very well written) world into  a chore.I'm really sad about this, I have played Numenera with friends, I love the setting, the writting is good, the art is fantastic, but this is a bad video game.

												It's probably my fault for expecting a story on the same level (or there about) of Planescape Torment and being disappointed. I found the main story to be pretty linear and that's saying much for a story that involves time travel.The companion backstories concluded in just two or three main exchanges each and paled in comparison with what was included in Planescape Torment, a game developed with less resources, in much less time and 18 years ago. The developers are boasting about the 1.2M words of text they have put in... the form of wall of text that add almost nothing to the story.The only redeeming quality I found is the Numenera setting that deservers to be explored again, hopefully by someone more committed to making the best game they can instead of cashing out as much as possible on their Kickstarters.

												I want to like this. I want to recommend it. But I can't.At its core, a Torment game should be a visual novel.Except the writing in this game is terrible. There's no details, save when you  use Anamnesis, but even then it's vague.They should have taken a page from Shadowrun: delve into the writing. Don't just tell me about the world, show me it in words that grasp the entire human vocabulary.And the world. InXile's representation of Monte Cook's world manages to take the exotic, the alien, and the innately fascinating, and turn it into something mundane.This is science fantasy. This is Clake's Third Law.Distilled, pureed, and rendered homogenous. Instead we're left with a lackluster swipe at fame, an attempt to emulate the greatness of Planescape torment without understanding what made it special.As an early backer, I'm disappointed.As a fan of Planescape: Torment, I'm saddened.As a person whom yearns for the days of old-style CRPGs, this title solidifies the fact that we're not going back. It is no longer possible to do so.			"

Working my way through almost all the side quests and exploring I finished the game in 15hrs. Due to the limited number of available party members I feel the replay value is not that great. Hence, 44EUR is too high a price (30 would be more reasonable.) The game is interesting but somewhat incoherent. The concept of several layers of reality is neat, but what that means in effect is that the thread of interesting plots/characters is lost against the mish-mash background. This leads to clicking around an area 'just because' rather than any central drive or natural curiousity. By the end I didn't feel like I had a real understanding of the characters involved, or what their motivations mattered.			"

												For reference: I have played through Planescape:Torment 3 times over the years.I had played this game for 110 minutes when I started to doubt whether there would be fun or an interesting story sometime soon. So I went and checked the, at this time outragiously good, reviews and suggestions and so on; And after pondering a view hours, hovering the mouse over the play button, wondering whether I should refund the game or not, I eventually went with the later. Unfortunatly at that. After 7 hours of playing, fun still nowhere to be found. The story is dull to say the least. The companiens, except for the little girl, are forgettable placeholders. All the characters are purposefully ugly. Their flawed nature is supposed to be the point I guess but still... There is no romance option. The combat system is annoying at best and again begs the question why devs constantly try to reinvent the wheel.I personally enjoyed but one quest so far; The one with the psychics in the bar.I am aware that one could argue that I might have seen nothing of the game after that time but still though. I'm not playing games in the search of eventual fun.For the equivalent amount of money you could have bought the original game, both icewind dales and would still have something over to grab a hard copy of Anno 1602 from some green case stack.Originally I swore to myself to never buy a Unity game again. Should have stuck with it.			"

												Too much text, not enough gameplay. They say good dialogue is what made Planescape great. They're not wrong, but what they didn't understand is that what kept the original from being a true masterpiece was the lack of decent combat gameplay. I remember playing it and by the end thinking ""man, what a great story, great characters and intriguing world... now if only it had the combat gameplay mechnanics of Baldur's Gate, it would have been the best"". Instead of correcting this, they made it worse. I can't play this 10 minutes without getting bored and rushing through dialogues and without the dialogues, there's nothing left. Show, don't tell. I find it ironic that whenever you ask a character a second time to repeat the trivial information he spent so long to describe he manages to summarize it in a few sentences only. These summary, more often than not, should have been the first and only answer.The fact that you can't engage in combat with anyone also diminishes the impression of freedom and choice of action and reinforces the impression that you're really just a spectactor here, and the game just wants you to go about speaking to people and solve their fetch quests. Whatever your choices in Baldur's Gate, you knew you could always attack the npcs. Here? The game really just wants you to listen to its lore... I don't recommend it. This is for hipsters stuck on nostalgia saying that PT was about something else than gameplay. PT was great but it's never been the classic game than Baldur's Gate was. It could have been so much better with a better combat mechanic and simply MORE COMBATS. I understand PT strived to be the ANTI Baldur's Gate, and had its heart in the right place by having you focus in stats like charisma, intelligence and wisdom instead, but it went overboard with it, as it ends up way less balanced than BG and having little replay value. Fights is what give replay value to these games. Fights can go in so many directions, although less so in turn based combats, but that's another issue (at this point I'm just desperate for anything else than listening to NPCs narrating a fantasy's short story, so I'll take turn based, even with its obvious flaws). Dialogues options, on the other hand, is just a matter of reloading and finding out what happens if I click on one answer instead of the other. They are ""nice to have"", but they're not the meat of these video games.Unfortunatly they chose poorly in this sequel by focusing even LESS on gameplay. I guess it costs less to produce. 50$ for this is ridiculous. It's worth 15$ at the most. Will not be purchasing from InXile again.			"

												I've pledged this Kickstarter, I was following this since the beggining. The game I've receive is not what was promised, it's just an lazy animated book, filled with meaningless text 80% of the time. What's the point of interact with a blue floating orb that emits light, if the only thing I'm presented is a text saying ""it's a blue floating orb with light pouring from it""? Yes, I can see that, are you just trying to increase ingame word-count? You can't take pride of 3+ milion word-count if almost all of those words are just wasted text.It's  just a little bit of Numenera (the world), if you already read the Ninth World Guidebook you'll be disapointed because this game can't make justice to this amazing world.It's not Cypher System, in the worst way, as the developer just got a system that made a paradigm shift in RPGs and returned it to the status quo. The system uses your stat pools as ""HP"", the developer just ignored this and created out of thin air a HP stat. There are just 3 foci, instead of dozens that you have in the original Cypher System. And even with all those changes, if you make a Nano and go full INT, the game turns so easy that's almost like you're cheating. Just to show how poorly implemented the system is: you can 90% of time use your companions stat pools in your personal checks. It doesn't make any sense. You're not that good at lying? No problem at all, because this other nano is a lying machine and will make sure you deceive everyone around you with his talking skills, even while he is not taking any part in the talk!Very lazy texts, unpolished UI that screams ""CONSOLE GAME"", forgettable NPCs, boring combat system. It's an abomination to call this a ""spiritual successor"" of Planescape: Torment. It isn't, and by far.Stick to Pillars of Eternity if you're dying for a CRPG, it's a better product than this mess.			"

												Torment Tides of Numenera is what happens when individuals who dont understand creating fun games try to copy one portion an old game that was fun for multiple reasons.  It falls miserably short.  TLDR version Backed game, played beta.  Did not enjoy stat pool version of combat still beat early crises even with difficulty apparently ""too high"".  Streamlining occured for ""reasons"", combat no longer important pools made more simplistic so people couldnt kill themselves with difficulty.  What we get  is a talky often incomprehensible game with the illusion of choice but no real part in the plot.  Planescape torment had plot, but it also had player choice that felt like it actually matter.  Torment tides simply does not.  Exploring portions of setting and sidequest is more interesting than learning why the main character is who he is or why he exists.  THATS NOT GOOD NEWS			"

												Had high hopes for that game. Finished it thoroughly, read all the text, talked with everybody, etc... and there's nothing special to remember. The single quest with Baron in Witcher 3 is twice better than this whole game. Which is sad, actually.Not even close to the Old Planescape, of course.Combat is bad (you can skip almost all of it, but that does not make it better), UI and inventory are clunky, companions are bland, but what is the worst - all the walls of text you trudge through, are not exciting. They are boring. Ah, and one more - your decisions actually does not really matter. The whole Tide system is for nothing.The game is not a total disaster, but for the money and time that was invested in it it's more of a joke. A sad joke.			"

Early Access Review
								I searched for a game that offered a compelling story and enthralling universe. I found Torment: Tides of Numenera and instantly purchased it. This game, which is set to be released at the end of the month, is beautiful. I became fully immersed in this game, just as I did with Shadowrun Returns (+xpacs). Give this game your attention and patience, and you will certainly become hooked and intrigued. The game is not combat-centric and I really enjoy that. It works for the Numenera universer, the storyline, and the pacing of how things develop.Highly recommended.			"

												Before this game I got and quite enjoyed such recent ""oldschool isometric RPGs"" as Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland 2, Age of Decadence and Tyranny. They had their ups and downs, but Numenera is regrettably the worst of them. In some ancient past I revered Planescape as much as the next guy. Don't remember much details now though, so no comparison here.Nonexistant gameplay leaves you with what tries to be an ineractive book. Though full of interesting ideas, the writing is actually bad. This is not a book, this is a simulator of a journalist in a madhouse: Hello there, what's your name, from which dimension you think you came today, which one of your split personalities is causing problems you think? Ok, yeah, the next one please, hello, what's your name. The game is ridiculously easy: three types of easily restockable resources will get you through every dialog check and battle in no time, you just keep minimal reasonable balance when upgrading your characters, no real planning needed.Interface is fine, but with overwhelmingly enormous infodumps why not make these super helpful hyperlinks like in Tyranny. And yeah, you have this large placeholder in the bottom interface panel, where logically you expect to see your dialog partner portrait, but it just stays empty every single time. Characters and situations are often interesting but resolve too mundane, sideqests are mechanically short and primitive. I find it depressing that characters often have rich and tasty backgrounds but don't do much in actual game. Main quest is really great, for me it's the best thing there is in this game.I have only finished the first large hub, it's 1/3 of the game I figure, so I cannot really tell about reactivity - have not seen much of it yet though.Tides mechanics are funny not in a good way: they are supposed to change NPC reactions in dialogs, but I have no idea if it really happens. Seems you need second playthrough to evaluate this mechanics.There is this 'use environment' mechanics in fights, but I did not bother, simple attacks solved all 5 or so fights.Visuals are bad, Wasteland 2 was much better (when it was finally done properly), leave alone the gorgeous beautiful Divinity Original Sin. Art design may appeal to some, but it left me cold (though I expect second hub Bloom to be better). Thanks for Linux support though, love to have it.I'll update the review when I finish the game. But from where I stand now you can do much better reading Gene Wolfe's ""The Book of the new Sun"" cycle than playing this game, it will scratch your itch, I guarantee you.			"

												Update:There are a dozen things that I should be doing right now, after having neglected life for the last two days in favour of playing/finishing Torment, but I felt that I should update my review.The beginning, much like the original, starts off slow, and is not a good indicator of the plot pacing throughout the rest of the game. As I continued to play beyond the early access content, I couldn’t believe how amazing this game is. The general narrative, dialog, and characters (even minor NPCs) are developed incredibly well, so much so that I felt like I was playing through a well-written novel.There are numerous ways to compare it to Planescape: Torment (including several in-game nods), yet Tides of Numenera is very much a creature of its own. Given the setting change, I didn’t think that it would be able to hold a candle to it’s predecessor—it does, and then some. It’s hard not to feel involved in the plights of your party members, and the worlds/areas are so unique and rich that I found myself excited to explore.I like that most of the quests don’t provide much hand-holding, the story in this game is such that it wouldn’t be anywhere nearly as immersive if I didn’t have to use my brain to remember who I’d spoken to and what was discussed. I can see that being extremely frustrating for people who prefer to zone out while gaming, along with the quantity of reading required. The game is also -not- combat-centric as most RPGs are, so some may find that lacking.My only complaint is that I wish the game were longer, because I didn’t want it to end.			"

												I can't get myself to finish this game. I suppose I'm about halfway through, but everytime I try and play it again I quit within 10 minutes due to boredom. I love RPGs and have played many of the classic ones, including Planescape Torment. I'm not averse to reading, but what I read has to at least mean something. Much of the dialogue in this game is lengthy descriptions that ultimately don't say anything, they are just words for words' sake. I'd much rather read a good book than have to wade through Tides' wordy dialogues. What else is there to the game? There's a bit of combat which is neither interesting nor difficult. There's a plot which is not very engaging, in my opinion; It's revealed to you in the beginning who and why you are, so there's hardly any mystery left in the game. Also, while you do level up in the game, it doesn't feel like you are getting any stronger; dialogue skill checks are absurdly easy to pass even in the beginning, and combat is so rare and far between and easy that it doesn't seem necessary to level up. I guess it comes down to the lack of anything to look forward to in the game. I can't look forward to trying my new cool high-level skills in a difficult boss fight, can't look forward to the reveal of the mystery of the story, can't even look forward to saving the world. Just wade through the dialogue and wait for the game to finish. A shame really, as I was really looking forward to this game. It's just not engaging at all. It'll probably be the first RPG I own that I'll never finish.			"

Early Access Review
0. Conclusion I'm not a native speaker, but I like reading English novels. I loved every piece of the stories in the game, and actually, quality of the stories was the only thing that made me keep playing this game. However, if I had wanted just good readings, I would have bought a book. Every feature in this game is not that desirable except stories, and if I have to point out things, I think I should talk about  2.animation  3.combat  4.voice acting. I saw some people saying that this is a story-driven game and the other things are not needed, but this is not 'Planescape: Torment' in 1999. If an essential feature of the game can be developed as a firm structure, and it can enrich the whole game without hurting or shortening stories, I don't see any reason to prevent it.1. StoryFor people who like reading novels - (10/10)For people who don't like or are not familiar with reading - (5/10)If you like reading books, you'll be satisfied just for good stories. I like novels, movies, and TV shows which focuses on sophisticated stories, and I haven't seen any stories like T:TON. Describing the stories of this game with my sloppy words will only debase the true value of it because there are not many writers who can describe 'a world unlike any other' better than this team. So here's an example of the stories in the game, some words from a person whom you get to meet in the game.""A spoken lie lasts but a breath, and those who hear it can answer with the truth. But a written lie lingers long past the lives of those who know it to be false. enduring until it can lead a whole race astray.""However, I think not everyone will like this game because it contains too many reading materials. It was hard to read all these vast amounts of texts, and it was much harder than 'Pillars of Eternity'. Actually, You'll have to spend 85% of your time for reading, and 95% if you choose to avoid or resolve the crisis(combat). In my case, I liked it cause I liked those stories, but I think it could be a huge threshold for those who don't like or are not familiar with reading.2. Animation (6/10)


Torment: Tides of Numenera 
A Screenshot of Torment: Tides of Numenera
By: Gamebot




1) silver of mirror : a red line comes out.2) side mirror : A torrent of golden light flows through you.3) oval mirror : The pulsing blue star expands as you watch. Pale clouds of blue light surround your heads.4) center mirror : it shows your unaltered reflection, the crease between your eyebrows.When I was choosing each action, I expected they would show me some animations, or at least some glow on each mirror. However, all I could see during the whole sequence was the exact same static picture without any changes or movements. It's basically a picture book which I have to read multiple pages of scripts separately. It doesn't feel like a real world. I'm not saying they have to make some fabulous fantastic actions. Is it really that hard to make one bit of red or blue shining line, or at least some glow? I can't imagine that devs are somehow apathetic or lazy. This scene really made me think if there had been anything wrong with development progress.This is just one example of many things. I couldn't see any animations when 'the clock mission' started, and 'master foreman'(enormous robot) didn't even blink even when I was talking to him(But he was still talking and shouting). If it is a really hard part and can't be changed technically, I can accept that. But small effects in the important scene can't be hard and can't hurt stories. I can't understand why they didn't do anything about them.I don't think these issues are just some minor bugs or mistakes. If devs don't change their whole perspective, we'll have to read scripts on the lifeless and static picture book for most of the time.3. Combat (7/10)As you all know, 'Wasteland 2' and 'Divinity: Original Sin' had similar combat system. For instance, if you have 12 action points in 1 turn, you get to move(2pt), heal/buff/debuff(3pt), attack(5pt) and spare 2 points. In T:TON, simply put, you can use only 1 action(use item/skill/attack) and 1 move in 1 turn. Combats actually work like this.[Initiative]Enemy1 > Enemy2 > Team1 > Team2 > Enemy3 > Team3  TURN 1→ E1 Attack E2 Attack T1 Attack T2 Attack E3 Attack T3 Attack →E3 Dies   TURN 2→ E1 Attack E2 Attack T1 Attack T2 Attack   T3 Attack →E2 Dies   TURN 3→ E1 Attack  T1 Attack T2 Attack  T3 Attack →E1 Dies The reason I didn't include moving is because it doesn't actually matter in combat. First, cost and benefit(distance) of the moving is fixed. Second, moving rarely affects to the attacks because it has fixed cost. Third, moving is not about strategic decision making in the field, rather about choosing whom I will attack on this turn, like a card game. If you want to hit enemyX, you can just go to X and hit X, and there're no limits or disengagements or anything. Forth, I've tried many combats by using several saving files, so I can assure you that the enemies are not that smart. There's nothing special you can strategically gain from moving. In conclusion, It's basically not different from typical card games.At first, I thought 'sacrificing stats to increase hit chance and damage' was a brilliant idea. However, since maintaining stats are not that hard, it doesn't actually matter that much, at least for now. There are some alternative options like intimidation, persuasion, or using numenera, but they're nothing but another type of attacks. Some could say it's inevitable cause it's based on the board game Numenera, but they were monotonous and tedious combats for me anyway.I simplified many things for the explanation, but it's not that different from the big picture. I don't think little tweaks could fix this matter.4. Voice Acting (?/10)I think voice acting is important in animation movies and games. Think about any animation movie and imagine that you have to watch it without any voices. I always couldn't understand why they don't put voices in RPG. Funny thing is, they always show us an advertisement with voice actors performing their breathtaking lines, but in actual games, we can't hear anything on 80~90% of the scripts. I don't know much about voice actors, but even Youtubers make videos of full voice version. When I heard they raised over 5,000k, first thing got in my mind was a little hope that devs could show us full voice version of Torment. But I couldn't hear any signs or promises yet.[Pros]1. Vast amounts of good stories, if you like reading novels. (10/10)[Cons]1. Vast amounts of good stories, if you don't like or are not familiar with reading. (5/10)2. Lack of animations on the important scenes. (6/10)3. Combats are too simple. fundamentally similar to a card game. (7/10)4. Lack of voice actors, at least for now. and couldn't see any promises. (?/10)(My first review was a horrible gibberish, and I understand why so many people were angry about my review. I admit everything you said. I'm a system breaking illogical dishonest faggXt hipster who is also  a stupid idiot. However, this time I've done my best to arrange my thoughts and to provide information. I don't expect everyone would agree with me or like my thoughts, but I wish this could help a person who comes next. )			"

												First game I'm reviewing on Steam.  My favorite all-time game is Baldur's Gate 2 and I loved Planescape Torment.  I was stoked for this game and backed it when it was first made public.I am not very happy with what I ended up with.  The ending (in particular) was very poorly done and felt incredibly rushed and disjointed.  A lot of times I felt like the designers challenged themselves to come up with as many outlandish characters and dialogue as they could without worrying about whether things would actually work.  And there was no depth.  The locations presented with shallow with barely any interactivity.Basically, this is a short, somewhat poorly written illustrated interactive fiction story.Connections between situations were tenuous and I barely cared about what was happening.  I thought there were some interesting points to the background story but the bit of good material was squandered in a rush to make the situations work.  And, again, the ending.  The ending was a mess.  And the antagonist!  I don't want to spoil anything but it would've worked better if it had stayed silent and menacing.  Instead, I felt like a kid at a cheap magic show:  excited at the idea until the table and poorly made boxes fall apart to reveal the trick.Not recommended.  The designers felt like they were trying to be too clever in order to replicate PT without any depth or satisfying conclusion.			"

												I backed this game on KS ... it was actually the reason I even got a Kickstarter account! I had extremely high hopes and that might be part of my problem with the game now.  Planescape was - for me - the best computer RPG ever. Memorable setting, characters, stories ... Torment tries to carry on that tradition and in my opinion fails. It's not about the graphics, it's not about some of the strange design decisions (combat ... amongst other things). It's about writing. Writing made Planescape such a great game and Torment is lacking in writing. It tries to reach Planescape, but it fails. A lot of overblown dialogue, trying to sound meaningful, hiding the fact that it is not under big words and extravagance.Memorable characters? Have not found many yet ...The setting? I could get into Planescape because despite the world being strange, I could relate to it.This one here? Too much ... trying to hard to be strange.Interface feels clunky in many ways, too. Granted, old RPGs had that problem, too. But it does not have to be that way. Why should I live with ""old"" graphics, ""old"" interface ... etc? It's 2017 now... "

								This game is in BETA still! This positive review reflects my opinion about the direction of the game knowing it's still going through beta iterations.The writing is nearly finished, and boy is the writing and story great so far! Unlike most Early Access games these days, this is not an EA release where you can play through the whole game right now. Your progress is gate to a specific point in the story so DO NOT buy this expecting to play a full length $44 game right now.The original Planescape: Torment's strengths were its amazing storytelling and loyalty to the pen & paper rules of AD&D/Planescape setting. So far my experience with Torment: Tides of Numenera shows that it will follow those same footsteps. I'm a HUGE fan of the pen & paper Numenera game and currently GM two different campaigns. I love that InXile has preserved the Tabletop rules and that they play very well in conversations and in-game combat.			"

												After a few hours of gameplay into TToN, I'm not sure I can bring myself to finish it. It is completely a choose your own adventure style of CRPG. The ONLY somewhat similarity to PST is the amnesiac character. Dialogue is tedious, combat is obviously lacking and when it happens its also tedious. Based on 34% likes, its obvious a good number of backers like me felt cheated. Using PST as a unique selling point of TToN was disgraceful & unethical. While most RPG players loved PST, TToN on the other hand has obvious alienation of lovers & haters. Based on this fact, we can conclude TToN failed to live up to its supposed promise. I wish kickstarter had a grading system so I could vote that this was not what I wanted. There won't be a next backing for me.			"

												Torment: Tides of Numenera is the long awaited spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment. After a successful kickstarter campaign, and several delays, the game is finally out. But how well does it hold up?What sets Torment apart from most other CRPGs is the amount of reading you have to do. There's not a whole lot of combat in this game, and what is in there can usually be avoided through dialogue or skillchecks.Graphics & soundTorment tries to emulate the look of the old infinity engine games, but with a more modern coat of paint. The result are some beautiful, and very imaginative looking environments, that look both familiar, and unlike anything I've seen in another game. The art style is consistently strong, and the environments are varied. From the sky docks of the city, that evokes a fantasy/steampunk feeling, to the fleshy interior of the Bloom, there's a lot to like about the environments.Sadly the character models don't fare as well. While they are not hideous, they do look dated, with a low polygon count, and relatively stiff poses. It's not something that really distracts from the game, but they could still have been done better. The humanoid models are also visually uninteresting, with little that really stands out about them. Where the game that inspired this had a large cast of very distinct looking characters, here they mostly look the same. Non-humanoid characters do fare better, and there are a couple of interesting looking creatures in this game, but once again, the quality of the character models do disappoint a bit.There's not a whole lot to say about the sound in Torment. The music works as background music, and often feels directly inspired by that of Planescape, but after having played the game, there are no tracks that really stick out in my mind. The voice acting is overall not bad, but not spectacular either. Most of the dialogue is not voiced, but what is voiced does the job well enough.Setting & storyThis is where Torment shines. The game is, as previously mentioned, set in the Numenera setting. The setting offers a mix between fantasy & sci-fi, but in a more coherent and logical way than games like Wizardry or Might & Magic. There are remains of ancient high-standing civilizations everywhere, with younger civilizations building on top of older. This means that during play, you run into both fantastical beasts, and robots, ancient constructs, and modern architecture. It's an interesting setting, one I wish to explore further after having played through the game. In terms of story, you start the game falling from the sky. You're not sure why, who you are, or where you've landed. Unlike classic amnesia stories, there's a reason for this that makes perfect sense in setting. You're the creation of a god, or are you the god reborn in a new body? You're not sure, but as you move through the world you find out more about this god, about the struggle it faces, and about its conflict with its children. I'm not going to spoil it further, but it's a mostly well told story, although it ends up feeling rushed towards the end. The main story also ends up feeling a bit too linear, and once you've left an area, you can never go back. The way the progression is structured, the game world actually ends up feeling really small.Like many other CRPGs of this type, there are also plenty of side quests to be done, many smaller stories that are being told around you, and that you can influence. There are no rats in the basement quests in this game, or go and deliver this box of cupcakes to that person, all the quests have their own stories, that are generally well written and interesting. There are also several different ways to solve most quests. You might talk your way through them, fight your way, use specific objects in the world, or a combination of the above. And they often have different outcomes that sometimes end up haunting you further into the game.Each of your companions also have their own quests, and a large amount of dialogue, that lets you learn more about them. This is against quite well written, but I do feel that some companions are far more interesting than others. None of the ones I've used have been boring, but some could have used a bit more work. Still, if you're the kind of person who loves to get to know your party members, Torment has you covered. Sadly Planescape does trounce Torment: Tides of Numenera quite soundly when it comes to party members. There are more of them, and they are also more interesting.GameplayThere's a lively debate surrounding this game's predecessor, about what counts as gameplay. Just the combat, or does the dialogue choices you make also count as gameplay? Depending on which side of the line you fall on, Torment either has very little gameplay, or still a fare amount of it. There are a lot of dialogue choices to be made in Torment, and they can have wide-ranging consequences. One system that I really liked from Torment is the ""efforts"" system. When you're performing a task that requires a skillcheck, you've got a base chance based on your skills & stats, and then you can spend ""efforts"" into improving your odds of success. These efforts are treated like a resource that replenishes  when you rest, and it's a really nice system, which allows you to be the judge of what skill checks you think it's important to succeed in. Efforts come in 3 categories, might, speed & intelligence, and each character has its own pool of efforts to spend from these categories. I did find intelligence to be the far superior category to build my character around though, as there are more skill checks that requires intelligence than there are from the other categories.As you level up you can also gain ""edge"" which gives you free efforts to spend in each skillcheck. So basically if you were to make an intelligence skill check and have 2 in edge for intelligence, you've already got 2 free efforts spent in each skill check  using intelligence. This is both a nice idea, allowing you to become noticeably better through the game, and almost gamebreaking, as you've got so much edge towards the late game that running out of efforts becomes a non-issue.Combat is the game's weakest point. It uses a turnbased system that feels like something out of a pen & paper RPG. The efforts/edge system is in use here as well, and it works well enough, but sadly none of the combat encounters feel very well designed, and the slow animation speed makes them drag on for longer than they should. You're also never given enough options for it to feel really tactical.Final thoughtsI'm a bit torn on Torment. On the one hand, the writing is great, the story is interesting, the setting hints at something amazing, I like the dialogue system and the effort system but on the other hand, the game feels too linear and towards the end rushed. The combat system also feels underdeveloped, though luckily you can easily avoid most combat. Despite numerous delays, the game still feels like it could have used some more time in development.Do I recommend Torment? Yes, I do, if you enjoy dialogue heavy CRPGs, but it's not a glowing recommendation. The game has some very strong point, but also some weaker points that holds it back from greatness. But if you've already played Planescape: Torment & Pillars of Eternity, and want to play another party-baed CRPG, Torment: Tides of Numenera is not a bad choice. Just don't expect it to be as good as Planescape: Torment.			"

												So after about 32 hours with the game and its Review build (release build) I feel confident to say that i absolutely love this game... so lets dive into why.Video:


YouTube™ Video: Torment: Tides of numenera - Logic Review 

			Views: 4,304		

			gameplay starts at: 4:05 Torment: Tides of numenera is a clasic style CRPG from developer inExile coming out of early access into full release. Review copy supplied free of charge.		

Text:There is one caveat regarding Torment... If you do not enjoy reading, you will almost certainly not like this game, because there is a LOT, and i mean a LOT of reading. Dialogue, Interactions, Descriptions, Activities, inner monologue - everything primarily communicated through text, and then - maybe - through visuals.Which means that the primary point of critique is the story... so is it any good?yes. Yes. YES. The combination of excellent writing, very well fleshed out characters, a unique and mind-bending universe and an endless parade of cool interactions with people and and objects make the setup for the story great... and the story, side-quests and objectives you have are all also VERY Good.But not only due to good story: Your choices are important, your actions are critical and choices made before, affect a lot of things later in major ways. Sometimes in ways you wouldn't imagine, but even minor changes will make massive differences. There is a just a LOT of things that you do to shape your gameplay, and that provides a lot of replay value and a lot of general gameplay value. VERY good.Now, having set that stage: There are a few issues. The game is still not as bug-free as I would like and is missing polish in certain areas: primarily the UI. So its not a perfect game, and would benefit form a good Quality of Life pass by the developers. Just small animations issues, minor bugs and UI inconsistencies that break immersion for no particularity good reason. The Visuals are also a bit of a mixed blessing - While the art design, direction and composition are all amazing and the sound design (including the limited Voice over work) are very good... the character customization and visuals are very restricted and not that great and the level of animation, effects and interactive elements that are more than text... are also not that great. It's not a major issue to me personally, but your mileage may vary.Combat is the last part and here i have a few issues with the way the game does a few cool things, but ultimately - it feels very limited. The various stats, items, usables and so on are often available in combat to perform cool actions and your characters can have a wide range of abilities, but because of the massive story / dialogue focus, the game doesn't reward ""working towards"" combat focus - so you end up with a character that can talk down a demi-god, but still needs to use a cudgel to fight a literal sentient nightmare.  While the combat requires thinking about actions, much like the rest of the game, it doesn't have the same effect where possible consequences are exiting - merely the end result of smacking something in the head.Thankfully - combat is infrequent unless you actively seek it out, which makes it very good indeed. Talking your way out of a sticky spot is a viable strategy and that is very much applauded.Overall Torment is a fantastic CRPG, and i wholly recommend the title for anyone that enjoys RPGS. Unless you don't like reading, because... yeah... tons of that. "

												The first two thirds of the game are perfect: one of the best RPG's I've ever played. However, the final areas are massively bugged or just rushed and it ruined my endings and my enjoyment of the game. The combat system is terrible as well.As it is now I can't recommend this game.			"

												Not a bad game, by any means, but nowhere near as good as its competition, and a mere shadow of its predecessor.I would consider it a worthwhile purchase at $25, assuming I had already beaten Tyranny, Divinity, and Pillars of Eternity and  still needed another Isometric fix.			"

												Q: What can change the nature of a man?A: Not this game.20 hours in and this game is not keeping my interest. This game so far is feeling like a poorly done reboot.  The sound design is lackluster and later becomes grating and repetitive.  The music is forgettable.  I find myself not caring about the protagonist or any of the potential party members.  The flavor text they have added to the vendor trash feels like a waste of time, rather than being interesting.  The dice roll / effort system is not fun.  Postives:  The graphics look nice.			"

												I can't reccomend this and I can't willingly motivate myself to keep playing this game. There is more than enough well written reviews of this game so I won't bother repeating a great deal of what has already been said about the short falls and issues. *Have since played another 3 hours on a friends account and its only reinforced my initial perspective...The main reason I'm dropping this game already, less than 5 hours of play in, is because it just doesn't hit the mark to stand with the legacy of Planescape Torment. The atmosphere and asthetic elements are just not right, too much flashy sci fi styles spilling into the gameworld of TTON (lasers, facial augmentation machines etc). The asthetics are just off; there are points in the city which will feel similar to the city of Sigil from Planescape Torment but there is too many other graphics and designs that just don't fit. The combat is horrible; slow, contrived and a constant feeling of playing through scripted battles (removing real rpg aspects we enjoy; grinding, leveling, stats, looting). The Tides/Skill interface is clanky and slow; bringing nothing really significant to the game that I felt validated a need for this system at all. From the start onwards the dialogue is just dull and fails to immerse me into this world. I found no vested interests in my characters plight or the party members who joined me, besides Rhin. The character creation system is interesting but felt like it makes next to no difference in general with how events and quests play out (and come on, no option to chose a potrait - stuck with some bland face that looks like it came from a 1970's Sci Fi novel cover). I think that by focussing on being a dialogue/text heavy game too much the developers have ultimately failed to incorporate typical RPG elements that made the original game so good - we've got this unbalanced result of a game that has turned into a very linear. almost point and click adventure game. Big dissapointment.There is moments, glimmers of good writing and creativity, where this game shows some potential I found in a few of the side quests. But these moments are over shadowed by the points I made above. Look forward to modders ripping this game apart and rebuilding it into something the Torment community wants. I feel for the backers who got screwed over here but hopefully update patches can fix some of these issues. Save your cash and buy the Enchanced Edition of Planescape Torment or check out many of the other recent RPG's like Tyranny, Pillars etc			"

												Objectively, this game is OK, at times even enjoyable. Not great, but I completed it, so it is engaging enough. Without the ""help us to recreate a Planescape: Torment experience"" I would give it a 70% rating and might have considered to get it in a steam sale. Yet, the story of this game is a different one, in every aspect a disappointing one.When I heard that a group of creators of the original P:T wanted to revive the spirit that so many modern cRPGs have lost, I was excited. Games with character, games that challenge players instead of just catering them, games that depart from the average and breathe life into unknown worlds, are being replaced by endless sequels without ambition or spirit. So here they are, promising to take a giant and build something on his shoulders, with enough funding for that shiny new Ferrari and free of the shackles of pleasing publishers and the market of ""casual gamers."" I hold the developers in high regard for their experience and achievements in the past, but in my opinion they have completely lost track here. If they really think that Tides of Numenera is fulfilling their own ambitions to live up to the sublime immersion and storytelling that is P:T, then they have lost much sense over the years. The game is neither ambitioned or bold, it is bland and tries to scrape by with the least effort required. It is not polished or rich in content; it feels more like an unwanted step child locked into the cellar than a love child.There are many thoughtful reviews out there that capture the good and bad to the game, I just want to add a few personal observations.- Numenera is a great choice for a Planescape setting replacement, it enables similar storytelling elements to P:T. I feel that it was worth the 35$ of backing just to discover this gem of pen and paper gaming. However the game mechanics adaptation is not good, once you reach three or four edge points there is no challenge in any task. I hardly used any of the 26(?!) intellect pool points for any of the tasks in the later game, and you can solve anything with intellect. The fighting mechanics are also unbalanced, and there is no room for developing combat tactics, you simply don't need them (health feels too low, though).- Seriously, where is the content?? I finished the game in 50 hours after reading every description and looking at every nook, but I was really expecting 200++ hours of gameplay. Only two major locations (which you cannot revisit)? About 10 fights in the whole game, 80% of which you can simply talk your way out of? Your ""mind labyrinth"" consists of four almost empty rooms connected by a bridge? 6 companions, half of them as dull as a rock? You can choose from exactly three character foci? You only have 3 item slots? Animations look horrible, only about 20 lines of text are narrated? The inventory implementation is buggy, I mean how hard can it be?  These are not design choices, it is simply laziness. Where did all the time go, where did all the money go? This game is 10~20% of P:T or BG2, and takes away the enjoyable parts without reason. Where other games have seven chapters, this feels like one and a half. When you are not inspired you should at least put some sweat in it.- There was supposed to be some personal stronghold that you can furnish and develop. I was hoping for a De'Arnise Keep on steroids, and got ... nothing. Is the mind labyrinth supposed to be it? That would be just pathetic. Just take the your pocket dimension from Throne of Baal and add more adventure to it, but no. - Fights. I can understand that people don't like random fights, and want to put some more meaning in them. However, I liked walking up to some random basher for XP and money in P:T, even when the combat mechanics were not great. I'm not even talking about the highly enjoyable fights in BG2. I did not expect this game to be Icewind Dale, but ... where is the combat? They are only a few completely scripted scenes you walk into with companions bumbling about, and with heavy-handed non-violent solutions that are always feel like the better choice. The turn-based system reduces the tactics to an absolute minimum, and most of the skills are useless or not required because of the unbalanced combat mechanics. I don't really care if the combat is turn-based or real-time, as long as it's enjoyable. Nothing was enjoyable here, so maybe the lack of fights is even a good thing.- Where is the promised impact to the world? I was looking for some effect of my choices, but the color of the tidal emblem seems to be the only thing that is changing. I was hoping for a system similar to KotoR, where you can alter the outlook of your companions, but this time with effects on the whole world. I did not feel anything to that effect.- The Meres are a great idea, but the execution is lackluster. The game hints that they can change the course of the story, even change other characters. However with a few exceptions there are no effects on the game world, and even then the effect are just dialogue options. I envisioned great replay value and interesting interactions between your choices, but got some inconsequential mini-stories that don't even yield XP. Still, whoever introduced this was up to something, way better potential than the similar narration element in Pillars of Eternity.In conclusion, I cannot help but notice that the game started out great, with lush background art and high ambitions, with the first Mere showing that your choices can matter, only to reveal a shack cobbled together behind the facade. It feels like all developers suddenly lost interest in extending their ideas beyond the beta contents or even completing the game. I would be very interested to learn why this breakdown happened, but it seems they want to focus on PR babble of a ""spiritual successor"" of P:T that fulfills all promises. Just admit that the money was still not enough to deliver what you envisioned, or that the creative spirit has left you. Looking at the stretch goals and seeing what you made of them just makes me sad. At least I am motivated again to replay the Icewind Dales, Baldurs Gates, and of course Planescape: Torment.			"

Early Access Review
								The beta is a bit rough, but it's the first beta build so that's just going to happen.  That said, it was still very playable and enjoyable.  What really struck me about the game was the sense of otherness that the main city oozed out of each and every one of its pores.  Even after investigation I don't know what half of the ancient machines that scatter the city do, but they're all beautiful and intriguing.Remember those question based character creation segments in a lot of older RPGs?  Well this game found a way to take that concept and make it not suck.  Basically how you solve the games initial set of problems determines your class and early stats in a way that feels organic.  You're literally discovering yourelf.  Don't worry, though, if you don't like the results, you get a chance to change them to what you want to play before jumping into the game world proper.I don't have a solid review of the game's combat, because I didn't really fight anyone per se.  I wanted to see if you could solve everything without dealing a single HP of damage, and for everything I stumbled upon that was an option!The strongest point of the beta is probably the writing.  It was a delight!			"

												I keep finding myself in disagreement with the ""majority"" of RPG fans, so maybe I'm not as much an RPG gamer as I thought to be.This game feels like that part of an RPG, for which the developers didn't get funding, but re-e-eally wanted to squeeze in. The obvious drawback here is that it doesn't contain any other compelling parts... The writers worked real hard trying to bind the storylines to one another and cross-reference everything with everything, but I feel that it cost them that much more effort for barely any benefits - looking back, I still would describe most of my time in the game as dull, even if I acknowledge the craftsmanship.The major ""plot twists"" were nothing but obvious, and the ending brings back memories of Mass Effect 3. I shiver at the thought of ever attempting a second playthrough, and from now on will be even more suspicious of any review hype-train that claims a game ""earned its place in the old-school pantheon""...P.S. The sporadic and therefore tediously long combat sequences regularly froze on enemy movements; exchanging items between your companions lead to duplicates, cyphers placed in inventory slots, inability to sell items etc. As is tradition, the closer I got to the ending, the more bugs surfaced when attempting anything but the ""most predictable path"". So, I guess if you're sensitive to that sort of thing, I'd probably hold off on the purchase.			"

												Its a shame modern true rpg focused games cant even give you a 40 hour play experience. In hinsight of planescape universe and 2d background graphics its hilarious, paired with a boring story and weak characters and even weaker story development its just a big pile of dissapointment. At one point in the game i thought, well thats a cool fight, the story gets a bit of a push and now the game starts for true right!? Wrong..the game ended shortly after and i was like, wtf thats it...i just started to get a feeling to the whole setting. That was around 35 hours in the game. So short its embarassing, especially for a 2d story driven rpg, come on are you serious. Can not recommend this game! Buy Divine Divinity, Arcanum, the first Planescape Torment or other classics and sink into their believable world with each of 100+ hours of gameplay. 35 hours for the planescape sequel..what a joke.

												I really wanted to love this game.But let me back up. I play games for stories, mostly CRPGs, PS:T is one of my favourite games of all time, and I read a lot. And yet, Tides bored me to death. It's harder to edit than to write, and Tides feel like a game not touched by an editor. This is not a rich narrative, this is logorrhea.I enjoyed many elements of the game, but when I finally reached the end, I didn't really care about the story and choices anymore, I just wanted it to be finally over.

Early Access Review
								As someone who has more than 300 hours into Pillars, I can say that I am not too excited for Tides. Pillars easily carries the most coheisve and dramatically presented narrative in a cRPG since Baldur's Gate 2, yet while Tides holds it's place in my library, I earnestly do not expect it to hold up as well. inXile games tend to carry a very unfinished and unpolished feel to them, which is often overlooked due to quality writing that propells the games from start to finish. Wasteland 2 is an excellent example of this: great story ... but incomplete ""product"" ... and the hours I've spent with the Early Access of Tides, I get the same impression. Recent changes have shown a clear trajectory towards simple delivery of a complex story, confirmed by developer responses on the forums to questions regarding removed features (such as a truncated introduction that has been stripped of any ingenuity and unique inspiration that it had during earlier versions). Many suspect this is due to it's concurrent console release, but I suspect there is more to it: as development has unfolded, I believe the inXile scrapped elements that weren't working, which has left visceral gaps in what remains.Still, inXile's writers are top notch and I will play this game through to the end, but I do not expect it to have much of the replayability that PlaneScape: Torment, Baldur's Gate/2, or Pillars of Eternity possess.

												I actualy had to take a several weeks break from the game before writing this review. Also I fell like I need to be honest, that I did NOT finish the game. The reasons will be described.I cant do the usual +/- scheme review because this game is... different. So I'll just write my thoughts down.First of all, I am a huge fan of PS:T and BG games. I also played all other games from Bioware but they didnt left such a deep mark like the first two.When they announced the successor (I know ''spiritual''...) to my all time favourite PS:T I was rejoiced. I remember spending my teenage years, not playing, but living the Nameless One's story in front of my computer screen. The feelings and emotions of despair and decay the game could invoke vere first and only I ever felt from a computer game. The writing was amazing, the design was perfect, the atmosphere cant be described, you, who played it know what I am talking about here.But I was sceptical. I knew that PS:T 2 is impossible to make, so I waited with backing and preorders until the very release. I gave it a try... and liked it. No in the hindsight, I regret buying it.- First of all as non native english speaker I had trouble with the VAST ammount of extremely long text that has NO purpose other than being long and to fill up the blank and boring gameplay. I dare to say that my english is on a good level, but I had trouble focusing and remembering all those vast lines of non-important text that was thrown at me at every step.Stick with me here, I am not by any chance some barbarian who doesnt like to read and just want to hack-and-slash through the game. I am a huge fan of all fluff and trivia in games and always read them. But this is just TOO MUCH. Also you may notice varying quality of texts, like if multiple authors were put together on one book- The atmosphere and setting is something I hated from the first minutes ingame. I couldnt get into the world and feel like a part of it even though I very much tried to. It is all just so flashy, shiny, colorful and bright compared to PS:T. Everyone in the world seem to be desperate and tortured to some degree, yet the world doesnt feel tortured and grim. It is all like a huge carnival, only the clowns were missing. - In comparison to games like Baldurs Gate 2 and PS:T the NPCs are absolutely boring, flat and if they dissapeared I wouldnt notice. You dont make any connection to them and few days after finishing the game you dont even remember their names. Jaheira, Morte, Dakkon, Minsc. Those childhood companions of mine, I'll never forget. I didnt play this game for several weeks and I recall only boring albino, some dark haired pirate and glowing imbecil.

Early Access Review
								Torment is a worthy successor to Planescape. A new universe to play around with keeps things fresh while some familiar RPG mechanics stay similar to other games, and the lore is expansive to say the least. With the option to complete pretty much any crisis (the battle scenes) peacefully given the right skills and lucky rolls, pacifist runs are possible. Using the environment to your benefit in these crises is very satisfying when it works, too. Be aware that as an early access game there are quite a few bugs, some that can break things to the extent that a reload is required, so save frequently!I can't wait to play the full game!Gameplay:

												Bland, unengaging, and ""meh"". It spent 4 years in development after it's kickstarter and came out feeling like a web based flash game. The story is ok, but for all the kickstarter goals being how they added more and more writers, I feel it should be better. The setting tries so hard to be alien there is nothing that really connects or grounds you, feeling like a lot of random and wierd for the sake of wierd.			"

Early Access Review
First some background:""Planescape: Torment"" has been my favorite CRPG of all time since I first played it at its release in 1999. It figuratively and literally turned the genre on its head. All the basic assumptions people take away from most CRPGs had been practically inverted wholesale. I was a fan of the source tabletop setting released in 1994, long before the game hit the shelves, so I had looked at the video game with a very critical eye, and found every moment of its game play engaging, and its story, theme and characters utterly unique.I was hesitant, and ultimately decided against supporting the kickstarter, mostly as I realize now due to my lack of understanding of the Numenera setting. Unlike Planescape, which had the underpinnings of D&D to start with, I was never able to wrap my head around how the Numenera setting worked. It just never clicked for me.Initial Impressions:I knew I’d pick this up when it released, even if it was just a chance of catching some of that old Planescape:Torment nostalgia.I also admit, I only have 3.0 hours, yes three, into this as I'm writing it. (I may update this review after I have more time with the actual release version).However, I've played the first 10-20 minutes of the game probably 6 times, each with completely different outcomes: In some I died prior to even getting into a fight In others I was able to talk down my foes I used environment objects to help me overcome my enemies  I’ve pretended to be someone I’m not In others I was painfully truthful to my own detriment.From what I've seen, which I completely admit is a small sliver of the whole, this not only matches my expectations of what a spiritual successor to P:T would be, it exceeds them.  The settings are equally fantastic in the truest sense of the word. The characters I’ve seen so far, are almost as good as the initial characters you meet in P:T. If the rest of this game matches the first 15 minutes, this will easily slide up to match Planescape:Torment as my favorite cRPG.Where Planescape: Torment asked: “What can change the nature of a man?” Torment: Tides of Numenera asks: “What does one life matter?”And as in P:T, I believe looking forward this just may help you answer that question in the same way,through game play, story, and character development.

												I'm so so torn.  I spent about 44 hours playing this game through to completion.   There were parts I really enjoyed...like wandering around Sagus Cliffs, the first main city of the game.   Exploring, talking (great writing BTW), etc.    But there was much more that I felt was rushed, not fully fleshed out, etc.  It's clear they spent a lot of time coming up with a weird, quirky story with lots of characters to talk to.  But the game just wasn't ""fun"".  What I enjoy about a CRPG is a great story, plus great exploration, plus a little strategy in a tough combat.  There's no point in leveling up if things aren't progressively difficult, require some strategy, planning, luck, etc.  Things were NEVER difficult or tense.  The while ""spend as many points as you want on a check, and just refill by sleeping"" was only annoying at the beginning before you found a place to sleep.  Leveling up is really kind of pointless...all you 'really' need is more points in your talent pool of choice.  I so so wanted this game to be great, and from a weird story perspective, it IS great....like a good pick a path book.  But everything else about it is lacking from leveling, to exploration to combat, to acquiring gear, etc. all felt like RPG lite lite.  I remember people complaining that the strategy and leveling of the Shadowrun Kickstarters as being a little ""RPG lite""....this is too.  Before anybody says ""well if you just want combat, this game isn't for you"", remember, I don't ""just want combat"".  I want good combat, challenges, leveling, story, companions, etc.......like you got in the original Torment, Baldur's gate, etc.   This got the story and companions right but missed on everything else.  This would have made a great book.   For those reasons, I can't recommend this game like I would PoE, Wasteland 2, Divinity Original Sin, etc.			"

												The zone ""The Bloom"" is well-designed with some very good content. This was the only place in the game where I got Torment vibes, and even Mask of the Betrayer vibes. Very well done by George Ziets, who I think saved this game from being utter garbage.But I cannot recommend the game for one zone alone, even if it makes up a good chunk of the game.Nothing outside of The Bloom grabbed me. I didn't like any of the companions I met and I didn't even really care for the fate of my own character. InXile did not manage to make Numenera as personal and intimate as Planescape: Torment.Add to that a slew of bugs, loads of slow loading screens, and weird performance issues (I run the game off an SSD on a high-end rig with a GTX 1080, good OC CPU and plenty of memory).I expected a lot more from a game that has been in development for 4 years, both content-wise and technology-wise.I have no idea why the gaming press loves it so. They are an enigma worthy of a Torment game.			"

												Backed this game, waited 4 years for it and now I'm uninstalling. Might come back to it later but for now I've lost patience with it. A few things that have annoyed me so far: - atrocious character running animation. People say the switch to turn based combat was due to catering for consoles but I strongly believe it was due to their technical incompetence. If they can't even get a running animation to look realistic and not detract from the immersion, I don't even want to think how real time combat would look. This is something that seems to plague Unity games for some reason.- trailer that spoils the game. I already knew much of the story from watching the movie that plays automatically when you land on the store page. ""Oh yeah the publisher paid for this and added it in"" - don't care, you're spoiling your own game! Speaking of - why the hell do you even have a publisher after we gave you 4 million dollars? - had to turn up the colour vibrancy for my monitor - only got to Sagus Cliffs but it's SO BLAND. Completely washed out colour scheme. Too dull.- lack of combat - I ended up hoping I'd run into some bandits in the city, something to fight, anything. Even though I knew from the encounter before that combat is just bad and not satysfying at all. Just something to punctuate the long reading sessions, as the writing is awesome but overwhelming.Needs some action and a bit of that character progression feeling - I did level up but I didn't get that feeling. Overall feels a bit unrelatable and I bet most of it comes from the limited combat. Feels more like Myst than a cRPG.So right now I'm reinstalling Pillars of Eternity. Just realised I never finished it, I had 210 hours on it but I lost the saves.			"

								Although the game is in early access, the developers have put notes in the game anytime a feature is not available yet, etc, but they tell you what to expect.  It's a nice touch to an early access game.  Other than that, the game is really polished and it even feels like the old Planescape Torment game, from the sounds to the character development. Buy this game and show that these kinds of games are what we want!			"

												SUMMARYGreat premise, awful execution. Do not buy.There are way too many things wrong with the game at this stage. I don't understand how inXile spent $4M+ and several years at this, yet managed to produce something that feels so incredibly rushed, and has one of the worst implementation of the first ~2 hours of gameplay of all RPGs I've played.If you're looking for a good CRPG buy Tyranny instead.FIRST IMPRESSIONSStart a new game, there's some voice acted intro text, and then all you see is greyscale hexes and black. You look at it for a moment and wonder if the game broke, until you realize there's a pretty gray character lying on the hexes too and that you can move. The game describes this pure black thing next to you - that on your screen looks like a deep hole with no detail at all distinguishable - as a bowl of sorts. The game describes how you can see the details of the bowl as a light source moves around. None of this you can see on your screen, just see a static black thing that sorta has a shape that could be a bowl, but it has no depth to it at all, just pure black. 5 minutes in the game looks rather dull and really unimpressive.You run around a bit in this very linear bit going through dialog trees where you're supposed to make ""choices"". The dialog is phrased as if you knew what you were supposed to be doing, and then you're given several options to choose from. Many of these options refer to game mechanics there is no way for you to understand at this point, and you just get frustrated and think the game could just as well throw dice as there is no way for you to even make an educated guess as to what happens from the options or how you're supposed to choose.Then it turns out these ""choises"" you made was the character creation, and the game just keeps dumping more and more references to game mechanics without providing any explanation to them. One option gives you ""+15% willpower"", but you have literally no way to figure out what ""willpower"" does. You have options to be, among other things, ""Clever"" or ""Intelligent"", each comes with bonuses suitable for a character of the type I wanted to build, but additionally really unintuitive negative points. It also feels like the game is misleading or lying to you about some effects, as I think I've heard it mention effects that then don't get shown in the details once you try to look at them. Tell me, do you want to be Clever, or Strong-willed? I have no idea, as there's no way to know what these mean in-game when you make the decisions.At worst the game throws ~5 consecutive tutorial ""Did you know"" -dialogs at you so you already forgot what the first one said before you even get to the last one or get to use any of this information.GAMEPLAY ISSUESThere's an ability to read people's thoughts or something. You get some rare insight into what people think mid-dialog, but after getting about 20 such insights the game gave me exactly 0 options to use the info.Lots of dialog and flavor text is shown mid-game in popup texts that pop up and vanish without any interaction from you. Unlike in other similar games there's no combat log or anything where you could go back to check what that text said. You can use a pause key, sometimes, but never when you'd really need it as during scripted sequences the pause key does nothing. Why would you implement a ""pause"" key that doesn't pause the game?All initial items for you and the first few party members are ""only usable by X"".Dialog options seem to arbitrarily vanish after activating them once, there doesn't seem to be any logic as to which options just change to ""tell me that thing again"" -type things, and which ones just vanish.It's possible to accidentally pick up items that give you a penalty if you have too many of them. You cannot drop them, you can only sell them, or swap them in the party, or use them, if you can. If you can't use them, don't have any empty slots in your party, and nobody to sell them to, you get a penalty and there's apparently no way around it except loading the game before you picked it up.The game incorrectly refers to the ground as ""Earth"", when they are clearly not on our planet.After the couple of hours the game has mentioned cyphers, tides, esoteries, etc. which I still don't understand the slightest bit.Party members seem to follow you with an annoying delay instead of in formations. This probably leads to unfortunate combat setups.UI/UX ISSUESCamera feels somehow wrong by default, it feels a little less annoying when disabling the autofollow.A blue dot is a bonus, two blue dots is more bonus, two red dots is a penalty. These are shown with some unclear text explanations, much before the game explains what these really mean.Applying attribute points is done in a screen where you have two arrows on the left and right of a number for the attribute, clicking the arrows changes the value, which changes the amount of space the number takes and moves the buttons from right under your mouse cursor, when you're trying to click them. Similar issues are all over.I'm playing on full HD resolution, with ""full"" anti-aliasing, yet there is not a single edge that doesn't look jagged. The inventory management screen has rough edges everywhere on the UI, your character is rendered with clear rough edges, as are all the items, and much of the text.There are some really random obviously wrongly positioned effects sometimes hovered *almost* on top of your character portrait that don't seem to make any sense and then just go away when there's a scene transition.In the inventory screen there are two places where your weapon is shown, right-clicking on one shows ""details"", right-clicking on the other does nothing. Why? Who knows. I sure don't.Right-clicking on things sometimes opens this ""detailed"" view, which describes stats and shows flavor text on items. However, this is quite unclearly structured and it still often fails to tell you what is going on, and doesn't clearly indicate with graphical design e.g. what part is flavor text. You can't further hover over/click on unclear concepts to find out more about them.Dialog trees look very boring compared to e.g. Tyranny. The colors are dull, there's nothing to hover over, there seems to be no extra information other than just the text for you to say and what the other people respond with.FINAL NOTESI was super excited to try the game out finally after all this time, and now I'm really heavily disappointed. I helped kickstart this years ago, I spent $135 (+S&H) thinking I'd help inXile create something amazing. In the first ~2 hours of gameplay I hated almost every moment, though I saw that under the incredibly rough surface there is probably something worth looking at. However, as the game simply pisses me off constantly, I don't want to play any more of it until inXile fixes at least some of these issues.Did inXile do exactly 0 internal testing before releasing this? Did nobody complain about these issues? How, after multiple years of development, can the first moments of the game be so incredibly weak?After playing games like Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, this game feels like garbage in way too many areas. The devs should play Tyranny, and then play their game from scratch, and then fix all the things they find were clearly better in Tyranny.Most of these issues should not be big things to fix, add information here and there, a few tooltips, fix a few UI decisions (fixed width vs. variable width, etc.), and so on, if inXile had any interest in it. However, with what I heard about some big quest-line issues with Wasteland 2 (which I also kickstarted) never being fixed, I doubt inXile has huge interest in fixing these issues.Unless inXile fixes these issues and they're sorry for messing up, I don't think I'll ever be able to support their kickstarters again, or buy their games for over $10.

Early Access Review
								You're sitting in a room, alone.  Before you hover images, passing in rapid sequence, but conveying a comforting sense of the entirety of a whole.  You sift through their details - an odd protuberance in an unexpected place, a comforting voice passing through the air behind you - and ponder.  While you draw no closer to these images physically, your mind and will are progressively and inexorably more deeply involved in the events you observe, these same events you even direct, to some extent.  You notice that, in reflections of reflections, you weigh heavy questions.  They pass through lesser used corridors in your mind, and prompt at once both introspection and alarm.  You realize then that you just spent the greater part of an afternoon, and the equivalent of the price of a quality meal for two, on a simulacrum, still in its fledgling state, of worlds only known to a glimmering few, and you yearn to know - to feel - more.If you've read this far, congratulations.  You'll see more like this, lots more, as you wade, wander, and weigh your options through this newest world of Torment.After starting over twice, and a good, what, 30 hours at this point?  I finally found an in-canon expositor who at least helped me, the human playing this game, understand that numenera is a plural noun indicating objects, not a singular proper noun indicating a place.  I know what two of the five tides regard, and my latest protagonist is happily balanced among all of them.[Edit] So, I am apparently a ponderously slow exploratory player, and I'm okay with that.  I do believe the reason the series is named Torment is because it's (almost) impossible to die.  That seems fitting, for someone who took almost 50 hours to get through the beta.  Pro tip: don't leave town.Having resolved 16-odd quests, and with 2 remaining, now I'm seriously jonesing to get on with the rest of this.  I can only guess that, as a secret-finder and prose-reader (I really LIKE the Meres!), I'll probably lose ~200 hours of my life in this game.  I can't wait for the hideous stench of the Bloom to fill my nostrils... ugh, wait, maybe I can? [/edit]Highly recommended for your Bartle's exploratory types!  Feel free to look elsewhere for bullet-time, spraying gibs, skimpy outfits, collisions, porridge, wanton violence or wontons.  You're on earth, a billion years in the future, and you've got all the time in the world to read through tomes of narrative, linking slender chains in your mind, piecing together yourself, and all the whys of all the voids, within and without.Grand. Fictional. Terrifying. Alluring. Fun. Interesting. Human.			"

												Just what Blackadar said. I'm a hardcore RPG player since 1996 and I have been waiting for this game with a great enthusiasm. I did not play a demo, I did not read any reviews, because I did't want this to spoil my experience. Planescape:Torment along Fallout 2 is in the top 5 RPGs I have ever played. What was so special about it? I would say everything, but the best was definately the story - deep and immerse. Well imo, Tides of Numenera is quite the oposite - shallow. The story and the characters were boring and the looks of the game, to my surprise were kinda ugly. Especially when I compare it to Tyranny that uses the same engine...way more beatiful game and also more intriguing story, with more interesting and engaging choices to be made. Also I didn't like the numenera universe, but I guess this is just my personal preference.I'm a real fan of Brian Fargo, I really like the way he does things and I will continue supporting him, but I sure hope that the next games he does, would be more like Planescape:Torment instead of Torment:Tides of Numenera, more like Fallout 2, than Wasteland 2.

												Haha did the dev team actually use its 4 million budget..?! Naahhh, don't think so... This game feels like a cheap Pillars of Eternity. No proper voice overs. No day-night cycle. Boring Story with no actual consequences. Especially the main plot is an absolute chore. I couldn't care less about the changing god and the first castoff. The fact that it doesn't have a lot of combat didn't bother me at all at first, but after playing 10 hours, the most fun I had in the game was during the 10 minutes of combat. All in all, wait for sale or buy Pillars of Eternity. This is just meh.			"

It's shame that Tyranny was a better game then the supposed succsessor.The enviroments feel bit stuffed. Some areas are full of relics. The world feels bit empty. It has flavor text and other but it seems quite forced.

Early Access Review
								In advance I will say that this game is still in beta and requires some polishing, but it promises incredible potential to pull you into its world.Torment: Tides of Numenera is intended to be the spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment, which has been said to be one of the best RPGs created and I am inclined to agree. The settings, writing and characters were all rich in detail.I am happy to say that, so far, TToN is shaping up to also be a masterpiece to be remembered.At first the settings will seem alien to you and you'll feel slightly confused, but gradually everything will make sense if you open your mind to concepts that would otherwise seem impossible to comprehend under normal circumstances.You'll end up wanting to explore every corner of every area, finding secrets, speaking to the locals or simply examining strange, otherwordly technology in the hopes to gain some sort of advantage through them.Many of the quests will not give you a sense of what is the right and what is the wrong decision, leaving it up to you to decide what the best course of action is based entirely on your personal interpretation and opinion and even then you might be wondering ""was that truly the best choice there was?""An example containing spoilers: At some stage you will find a creature in a bar, lamenting the fact that he lost contact to the rest of his civilization, whose purpose it was to guide others. The most obvious choice would be to use your powers to rid his mind of the sadness enveloping his thoughts. After you do so his sadness turns into cold determination as he sets out, not to guide people, but to dictate over their lives with an iron fist. (Or that is how I interpreted the turn of events. Correct me if I'm wrong.)Would I recommend the game as it is now? Yes, if you can accept the fact that it is not finished, but you want a glimpse of what is to come. Otherwise just wait until its full release.			"

												My issue with this game is as follows:1. Combat. Seriously, forget the turn based part of it, where the heck is it?  XP through kills = pretty much non existant. I can't say how the whole game is, but I'm pretty far into it, I've been in 4? 5? fights, and only 1 gave me any symblance of XP (You might say, well that's good cause it means you don't have to choose combat as an option! But I ---wanted--- to fight. I designed a glaive character, went out of my way to go into battle, and did everything I could to annoy people. Heck I ran into three thugs that were all ""Hand over the girl or else!"" I picked or else, and it just throws me a dialogue ""You did 20 damage fight ende dinstantly."" Like what?! WHERE IS MY BATTLE?! What happened to the axe wielding scar covered madman slaughtering innocents in the street that I played as on PST?)2. The illusion of choice, isn't as well casted as the previous PST (in the previous one I did playthroughs with 2 or 3 fights, and playthroughs with everyone in every town dead that you could kill. Lots of variety!). Each decision I make seems rather ""flat"" ? In a good choice RPG, decisions will keep piling up on top of each other, each quest you complete, each choice you make in dialogue, it all stacks up. This one? Not so much. There were a few quests that required some chaining behaviors, but mostly their ""choice"" system was just the occassional 'oh you could have gotten +1 str if you played it this way. Too bad, suckah!' Combined with the fact you don't really get a lot of fights, this can feel a lot like reading a book and having to roll dice every now and then to see if you're getting all the pages or an angry troll is going to rip a few out before you can read them and much less like you're shaping the RPG with your choices.3.  The plot is slow and drags into errand boy in several sections, and the characters were interesting, but I didn't get to feel I connected to any of them. I wanted more out of my Main Char Side Char relationships, I wanted to feel like my scruffy gang of 3 was really impacted by my existence. I didn't get that at all. Things that I really enjoyed about the game: 1. It wasn't a good hit for me, but I did like the skill point system stretch they did with effort. It was interesting and forced me to think about a lot of decisions I normally wouldn't have had to .2. The artwork was, as it was in the previous game, really good. The landscapes were constantly changing so much so that even in the same town I could feel the differences between area one and area two.3. The character backgrounds were interesting, which made point 3 of the cons that much more frustrating. Now these are all just personal opinions, and I would only not recommend the game because there are a lot better RPGs out there that do what T: ToN tried to do in terms of execution, but better, and they're cheaper. If you've played every RPG on the market though, consider my thumbs down a thumbs up.			"

												Torment is the long awaited ""brother"" to the original Torment that so many fans adore, yet it fails to deliver what most fans expected, which is a long and solid game with an captivating story and a world to experience and explore.It is graphically ok ( It uses the unity game engine ), the player get's rather little options to customize his own character besides genre and 3 different classes , and a lot of the promised content from the early kickstarter campaign is absent in the early version of the game which allready shows when you create your character.There's a lot of dialogue, but your own character is more on the listening side of the story and it seems your background and player type does little to change this ( which other older Interplay games did like Baldurs Gate , Fallout , Icewind dale and so on ) so the story is pretty straight forward and honestly seems to give little in the terms of replayability ( perhaps a couple of times at most).Combat is ludicrious bad and almost absent in the aspects of strategy, once you find a tactic that works you will probably use that for the rest of the game. You do get certain ""items"" that helps you in combat, but most of the game is so easy you can have a large surpluss of these items without ever the need to use them.The game did seem to have in the start certain ""consecuences"" of resting if you had a few quests active, as some of them had time limits ( to my knowledge only one ) , but strangely enough that part seems to dissapear completely from the game later on it seems. Again poor quest planning is probably behind that part of the game.Other aspects of the game is that the story is decently written, but again nothing really special that will make you think about the game again when you hit the bed after having completed it. There's really none of those cuestion other great games gave you like ""what if I had"" and then go back and try that other option to see what would happen to the world...Music and sounds where not bad, but to be honest I felt they could have been better , some areas certainly dont give you the feeling that the sound comes from there...And the game is ludicrious short... My first playthrough (and I tend to try to get every little quest and content ) was around 41 hours and honestly speaking it felt like there's rather few ""maps"" and things to explore. The dialogue makes up for most of those hours and youre going to spend a lot of time reading.It's not an outright bad game, but in terms of what it could have been since it's the spiritual successor to Planescape Torment it should have been so much more...After having crowd funded Inxile a couple of times I have lost faith in them and are going to wait for their games to be released before bothering considering buying them ( like the upcoming bards tale )...

												This is a tough one. tl;dr I *would* recommend the game, but it comes with a few caveats in particular: don't buy it at the present price. they're having a laugh.The details.The bad1. As a backer I was *really* disappointed with the difference between what was proposed in the kickstarter campaign and what actually ended up in the final product. I tried to keep an open mind when playing but it still did leave a sour taste.2. The companions are mostly... kinda uninspired. In PS:T you could choose 5 companions out of 7 and I always stuggled deciding who not to take in my party. Here you could choose 3 out of 6, so you think it would be harder, but I had no such trouble - especially since you can't have Aligern and Callistege in a party together so that rules out a bunch of party combinations.3. The character models are kinda... bad. In particular I often found the Last Castoff's running annimation pretty goofy looking.4. A lot of the character options seemed pretty cosmetic (backed up by some videos I've watched). Tides, foci, descriptors... just don't seem to have very much impact on how the game actually plays out.5. The UI felt incomplete to the point where I tried to avoid using it.6. It's simply not as good as PS:T although it's not a bad effort.7. It felt like there was a real lack of item progression in the game, and the effects that the various damage types did were never very clear to me. I think I changed my gear like... twice.8. The price, IMO it's well not worth what they are currently asking for it ($74.95NZD at the time of writing).The good----------1. The Mark Morgan music is on point again. Like that guy is fantastic. 2. The world is well imagined, I loved following through asking about everything and seeing the backstory piece together during the game.3. The companion Rhin is great, whoever wrote her (kidding I know it was Patrick Rothfuss) is a champion.4. The level backgrounds were bautiful.5. Did I say I really liked the Numenera setting? I hope they or other groups write games set using the system in the future.Now I know there's more bad than good but I honestly felt the good passed the bad in terms of my overall enjoyment of the game. However if you haven't played Wasteland II or Pillars of Eternity definitely go and play those first because they are both better games. If they haven't satisfied your itch then I would definitely say give Tides of Numenera a go after those, and the price coming down a tad.			"

												Ok. I've finally finished this game.What can i say about it? It's bad in almost everything. 1. Combat system is trash. Don't even dare to take any class except nano focused on conversations + invest all edges into intellect pool because it is used in most cases. Strengths pool is just a joke really. You'll never use it in combat.2. Character progression is quite new but it appears to be very stupid.3. Cyphers - well... you don't need them in 99% of cases. Remaining 1% is experiments and permament bonuses4. Abilities - most of battle-related are useless. As nano I used only 3 attacking abilities 1 of which had friendlyfire and was quite useless in most cases. Social are better. Pick mind reading one - it will help you skip most of texts and also there ate quite funny thought appear sometimes.5. Story is quite interesting but there are too many extra texts. You'll be bored after the 1st location. Well, I was trying to read them all at first but then I just skipped everuthing not related to main quest. It looks like most texts were written by people called ""copywriters"". They are experts to write empty texts around some simple plot so that search engines treat web site better. I was able to half-blindly end the game with the best ending for the worlds (IMHO). It looks like your choices does not affect the ending the way they should.6. Companions are quite different but most of them are empty. I liked only Rhin. Callestige is amost good too. Also she is quite useful in dialogs and fights7. Locations are mostly small. I'd say very small. Remember baldur's gates, neverwitnter nights, icewind dale - all had great variety of beautiful locations. And now forget about it. Not in this game. Funny thing: Necropolis has lots of chambes with some names on plates. As i saw most plates had different appearence. It seems that it took too much time to make that chambers and other locations were sacrificed...8. World is something that you'd like to know about but every important thing wrapped in tons of text. Well, I've surrendered and just rushed to the ending.If you're looking for a good RPG with good story - pass this one. It's short and mostly empty.If you're looking for a good RPG with interesting tactical fights - run away or you'll want to kill developersIf ou like to read tons of texts and not afraid of half-emptiness in text - you're welcome! Remember to pick Nano and increate intellect pool and edge. You'll have the story almost without fights.			"

												I'll keep this short.I'm a Kickstarter backer.  After we gave inXile $4million (more than 4x the original goal) and waiting 4 years (more than 2x the original proposal), we're left with something that's barely recognizable from what was initially promised.  Worse, we had to wait longer than Steam beta players to play the product we made possible.  Worse STILL, we got to watch inXile♥♥♥♥♥♥around and spend our money on their other projects for years on end, and then finally tell us they had to turn to Steam beta to finish funding their project.  The one that was funded for $4mil.As for the game itself, I'm utterly underwhelmed.  Graphics are bland, effects are unimpressive, writing is okay-ish but could've really used a decent editor to tighten things down (more is not always better), and story didn't really hook me.  Bizarrely, there's no way to customize character appearance beyond gender.  I realize they were going for a retro experience, but this is 2017.  In fact, all in all, there's very little that makes this game feel superior to anything released in 2007.  I wish I hadn't bought it.			"

												I'll keep this short and sweet and if you want more detailed reasons behind my decision simply check out the discussion page for this game including the post I made called ""Why am I playing this""?I am absolutely still a HUGE fan of the original Torment.This game is ok, subpar but I've put it on the shelf for now until inXile does a patch or two and ads a few things.I would give this game a 7/10 and I'm dissapointed to say the least that it doesn't hold a candle to the original. I was really hoping to finally play a game that would rival the 1999 gem but it fell short on many accounts and did quite poorly on others.Should you buy and play the game? If you haven't played the original and love to read...yes...if you did play the original and love it, you'll still like this one but it won't give you goose bumps or leave you feeling the way the original did.For some this is a good thing but for many we wanted to experience a similar euphoria that we did with ""The Nameless One"" and his journey.Overall a decent game but could have and should have been much much better.

												I was so excited when the there was a Kickstarter announcement that Numenera was being made into a computer game.  I liked the pen and paper version and wanted to learn more about the setting. I put money towards the Kickstarter day one.  When I finally got Torment I was overjoyed.  Then I started to play it and after a few hours, I was utterly board.The main issue I have with Torment is that it is not a game but more interactive fiction. There are reams of things to read but very little to do.  Occasionally there is a combat encounter or simple puzzle but most of the time you are going through dialog trees that do not give you enough context to make an interesting decision.For me I am going to pick up one of the Numenera Ebooks and uninstall this “game"".

TL;DR Tides of Numenera is a good game; it only seems bad when you put Torment: in front of the title.So - another game from the anointed messiahs of old-school CRPG development, and this one is supposedly the 'spiritual sequel' to the hallowed Planescape: Torment, no less!On its own merits, Numenera is good game. I backed it on Kickstarter at the lowest level (which was about £10-£15 if I remember right), and for that price I got great value for money and lots of enjoyment. I think I would wait for a sale rather than pay the release price though.The world is a weird and wonderful one, with lots of nooks and crannies to investigate, colourful characters to meet, and bizarre hightech powers and weapons to wield. Most of the inhabitants of the city of Sagus (where most of the game takes place) are ignorant of the technology behind all this, so all the fancypants electro-swords and brain-cooking zapper pistols are often seen as magic. The result is a pleasing steampunk scifi sort of vibe.Combat is unfortunately a rather dull, clunky, turn-based affair - but thankfully as I broke from my usual habit of playing a tanky sword and shield guy and went for a silver-tongued brainiac nano (the game's wizardish class) I often found that fights could be ended early (or more often avoided completely) thanks to my gifts of the gab. This also made my psychic powers stronger so the occasional fight I did get into wasn't too hard with some help.Companions are an amusing and varied mix of archetypes, if a bit shallow,(apart from my little buddy Rhin :) ) with good flavour voice acting on a small amount of their and other NPCs' conversations, which add a little richness to what is otherwise large amounts of silent text. Lots of reading to do in this game which I enjoyed - descriptions and speech are well-written but brief enough so as not to interfere with moving things along. Graphics are decent enough and quite pretty in places, although characters' faces do tend to look a bit like clothes mannequins.Overall the story and setting were engrossing enough to have me playing enthusiastically until the credits rolled. BUT WAIT - This game isn't being judged entirely on its own merits. Instead of just being called Tides of Numenera, this game is called Torment: Tides of Numenera. And that's the main reason lots of nostalgic people like me funded this game (and a real can of worms).What struck me most about the original was the main character - the Nameless One. Gravel voice, scars and tattoos, ghoulish looks. He begins as a fairly cliched amnesiac , but as the story develops we find that he has lived many lives - soldier, scholar, mystic and many more. He has been a terrible villain, but later a hero. Worshipped and feared, hated and loved - he has commited terrible atrocities, manipulated and sacrificed loved ones and friends, but he has done great deeds of heroism, kindness, and selflessness. I get that in Numenera the Last Castoff is intentionally a blank slate so that the choices players make shapes his character, but what was so clever about Planescape was that the Nameless one could be a fully rounded prewritten character by the end of the game, whilst still being shaped by the player's choices. And these choices still made sense within the larger context of the Nameless' character because they are drawn from aspects of all the various forgotten experiences he has had, as well as what the player has done. He could finally be redeemed, or be a villain far worse than the final boss, all because of the choices of the player. The Castoff on the other hand, is a non-character. Voice acting has a generic hero sound, and he has no experiences because he was literally someone else just before the game begins.The supporting cast of NPCs in Planescape was likewise so much more memorable than Numenera. Morte, Annah, Fall-from-Grace, Dak'kon, Ignus. That weird cube-man who had Homer Simpson's voice. The Lady of Pain, Deionarra, the Night Hag, the Silent King. That hive-mind of super-intelligent rats! I haven't played that game in years and I can still remember them all. I think the only character I will remember in any detail from Numenera is Rhin. Plus perhaps the Changing God only for his name, and the BigBad Sorrow mostly because of a huge expositional dump of information at the end of the game.Planescape had a grimy, grim, at times nightmarish atmosphere. Numenera approaches this later in the game (the Bloom is the best area by far), but never manages to reach those heights before or after.""What can change the nature of a man?"" - the thought-provoking question and motif that appears throughout the game and is relevant to so many of its facets, and to its main character in so many ways. There is no simple answer to it.Numenera's limp counterpart is ""What does one life matter?"" - the answer being ""it matters loads, because you are the Chosen One who must defeat the Big Bad.""Tides of Numenera is a good game; it only seems bad when you put Torment: in front of the title.

Early Access Review
								Put around 10 hours into the beta, it was seriously out of pure boredom because I would usually never go near games like these unless they were well and truly finished. I'm thinking, hey, they plan for a Q1 2017 release, how unfinished can it be? Very unfinished is the answer. No way in hell they're releasing in the first quarter of 2017.. but if they do, it's going to be quite the mess. 1. Interface is clunky, with text being cut off, even through character creation, you're picking abilites you don't know anything about because if you hover the ability the text shows up cut off! Infuriating. If you exit an area and hover over the exit, nothing happens, you have to view the map to see where you're actually going. Not to mention that your entire party freezes once you click on the exit, unless one of your dudes is stuck behind a bystander way back there somewhere..and then you're treated to an epic loading time, yes even on an ssd setup. 2. The first group fight in the game, had to savescum 4 times before I could pass it without a fight. Why? Because the fight always ended with either A. The enemy had the turn but didn't do anything. B. I had the turn but couldn't attack.3. The entire thing runs like poop. I turned off AA, magical clothing and it still ran like poop. This is not pretty enough to run terribly on my system. I blame Unity. 4. While I completed their inspirational game PS:T several times and yes, it did not have a strong focus on combat, it feels like this game has contempt for combat. It's all sluggish, uninspired and boring. In my 10 hours I had 3-4 real fights and they were all terrible(when they worked) Abilities feel meaningless, just point click and bash to get it over with. 5. Six times I had to exit the game and restart it because my group refused to move when entering a new area. Save, exit, reload and they moved again. I haven't even mentioned all the text bugs or the graphical bugs such as equipping a shield and your dude is wearing it through his stomach..To me this is an Alpha version of the game, isn't beta supposed to be working but with minor bugs? Would I suggest buying it? Yes, if you got in on the early backer discount and have a lot of patience.. otherwise no.			"

												I backed this a million years ago because I like cRPGs, and I particularly like TALKY cRPGs. In that sense, this is a well realized game, with a fairly good story and a system that seems geared towards providing non-combat solutions to most encounters. I've dumped all of my leveling up into being a good talker/thinker, and dug some of the non stabbing related solutions that afforded.That being said, holy hell this game is a buggy mess. If you ARE unfortunate enough to get into combat, there seems to be about a 1 in 5 chance every combat round for the game to hard lock, I've come out of combat encounters with my party completely frozen in place, and there is an incredibly annoying humming sound anytime you have a buff (which you will have permanently after a couple of hours of playing the game. that last isn't a bug per se, but I feel it speaks to a lack of outside eyes (ears?) on this product.What's here is pretty good, but I'd recommend you give these guys a couple months to finish their game up, and play it when it's more stable.

												I like this a lot more than public opinion seems to hold! It's probably overpriced, the combat is mostly terrible, and as an RPG it's not really as complete or as generous as Original Sin and will probably be handily outdone by Original Sin 2.BUT! I think this has been really underrated as a spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. The original game's visuals and combat (of which there is way too much, compared to this) have not aged well at all, and its writing, however beloved, is very ""90s D&D.""By comparison, the writing in this is very enjoyable in a broader SF context -- the biggest complaint I could leverage is that they occasionally run out of ways to describe Dune-like interactions with otherworldly devices -- and there's less conspicuous philosophizing, which is more to my tastes. The worldbuilding in general is very nice; the graphics are only good enough, but the visual design of every area is distinct and memorable (lots of great blues and purples), and it's really to the benefit of the game's narrative thrust. The scope is relatively narrow and linear, and the side quests are basically typical CRPG fare in that you can play for completion and try to get the best outcome from everyone, but the game stays interesting from start to finish and there's a lot of creativity from one minute to the next. Individual NPC's are regularly more interesting and three-dimensional than major characters in the average BioWare game. It's also pretty bug-free and polished on the whole, although the balancing is pretty weak by the end.Torment 2017 is also pretty affectionate towards the source material of Torment  1999 and manages to be thus without seeming derivative -- the bar in the first main hub town, the references to the ""endless battle,"" and so on are all distinctly P:T-esque.Definitely play any of the newer Divinity games first, but this is great and unique and deserves better than the response it's gotten.

Negatives: Very bad endings, your ""legacy"" is literally two sentences on a slide in the epilogue.  To achieve what you want you almost always have to use trial-and-error via reloading saves. This of course breaks any (small) immersion the game may have and is frustrating.  Does not feel like a complete game, it's clear that the developers did not have time to finish several of the main characters and story concepts.  There is a ridiculously large amount of text, but it's often not very interesting and some of it frankly does not make much sense (from a logical or philosophical perspective).  Furthermore, even with 1.2 million lines of text, several of the major story points/twists are pretty clear already in the first city you explore.  Almost all the story is told through text, it would be better if more was shown through the environment, interactions, animations, or even cut scenes. Instead, the game basically tells you what is going on instead of showing it or letting you play it out.  The ""Crisis"" mechanic does not work very well in that it's not exciting, does not feel like a crisis, can be failed based on unknowable factors (requiring more trial and error, save-scumming).Positives:Some of the areas, items, and characters give us an interesting look into this odd and unusual fantasy, sci-fi world. Some minor characters and item interactions are funny and surprising.  "

The implementation of Cypher System is very elegant, but the story is weak, and it is much more linear than I would have expected after the success of Pillars of Eternity's more open framework.

Early Access Review
								Beta review 26.1.2016Why all the hype? In short Torment is isometric cRPG. The game aims more for reactivity, choices, replayability and story telling than other RPGs. This game is successor to Planescape Torment which was released 1999. According to wikipedia, PST has been pretty frequently rewarded after year 2000. For example, 2008 IGN listed this as n. 8/10 franchises that should be resurrected, praising game for having ""best writing and characterization seen in gaming"". Planescape has also been frequently listed top xx all games ever done and to play, last of them being PC Gamer stating 2011 Planescape Torment being 19th greatest PC game ever done. Clearly, there's a huge demand for this successor.Background of Torment: Team behind the game is more or less ""all star"" group, having been part of creating following titles: The Bard's Tale series, Wasteland 1 & 2, Fallout 1 & 2, Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, IWD 1&2 and NWN2 expansions. (Well, Avellone left before change of year 2016 ) Also, creator of Numenera setting is involved with project as well. Mark Morgan (Fallout 1,2,NV, Planescape etc.) is composing music for Torment. The game raised 4 million USD in Kickstarter, later increrasing the amount to 5 million and it's still growing. As far as I know, this is currently a world record for a Kickstarter project related to games. The game has already delayed like one year and will be released this year, propably after summer? If I remember correct, Kickstarter was was chosen as a method to fund the game to get rid of some problems gaming industry does for developing of games.So, a lot of promises, expections, hopes and doubts. Lets see what first version of Beta seems to provide us so far and what kind of thoughts it delivers to me:- Torment is clearly closest to Planescape, just like developers have said. There's a lot of text to read and it is written really well and the use of words is colourful, really making your imagination running. The languange however is not anything simple, which might become problem for people who dont speak English as first languange or have fluent English otherwise. (For this, before buying, I would recommend to check Let's Play videos or something where you can see a bit of it). Dev has mentioned that this game will have about equal amount of words than Planescape had or possibly even more. (Devs have however stated that the game will be translated into: French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian and Spanish during early access.)- Reactivity seems to play big part of the quests and world in the game. Quests seem to have multiple solutions, starting from not even taking the quest, ignoring after taking it and other solutions where you do something. Naturally, you can't solve quests in all different ways in one playthrough. 5 dimensional tide system also seems to provide replayability as they do different things for the world. You even have different prologue parts before waking up in the world of Torment. Choices in game also shifts these tides as well and might cause NPC's in world to react in different ways etc. I havent investigated this  tide thing yet.- First version of beta is buggy: Developers ask for feedback in the forum or via the feedback system provided in the game. It's nice to see that developers are actually reading the forum and recommendations, suggestions and other ideas of people in the forum, also commenting them occasionally. (To make it clear they dont do what people tell them to do, they just take the best parts or ideas that suit for their vision of the game). Also, they havent developed f.e. stores, proper UI or many items for it. I'm sure that the combat system will get some tweaks as well.- Setting: Numenera is odd world for a person who is not familiar with the setting before playing this. That's why the lore might feel a bit crushing at the start, but if you look around and do things, you get more familiar with it in short time. In short it's scifi world but has a touch of more usual cRPG aspects, which makes you feel more like in home if you are familiar with genre. There's a lot of advanced technology, but knowledge and how odd devices and such are used is limited. I'm not explaining theme more here, but there's a lot to wonder and be curious about (like a fountain of purple fishes flowing instead of water?)Overall: I think the game seems really promising so far. I'm curious about what I will learn about Numenera, the story, characters etc and what kind of choices can I make. I hope the full game will show more strong philosophical aspects as well (like PST did), which, at least the question ""What does one life matter?"" seems to be hinting about. I also got now and then Point And Click feeling :D Also, I havent had problems with performance of the game (other than first area). If you would like to see all different outcomes of quests etc. I would say playing this beta could be like 40 hour thing to play. Otherwise it's about +10 hours.This game seems to be for: People who want to read (a lot) and think, diving into atmosphere and environment of Numenera with their imagination. People who enjoy cRPG titles, especially Planescape: Torment. People who don't mind that you can't archive everything in one playthrough. People who enjoy traditional, narrative roleplaying things, pnp and such. (However, dont expect and hope that this game is Planescape Torment 2 - Successor means that the heart of PST is there in terms of writing, reactivity etc. but the game's setting, rules etc have nothing to do with PST..)This game is not for: People who dont speak fluent English. People who expect more fast paced gaming and action. Also, people who find idea of reading a book horrible. People who think that fighting in RPG is mandatory rather than one possibility among others.Good thing is that this game will also be released DRM free.			"

												""All flavor, no meat"" is the best way to describe Torment 2 :ToN. I should point out that I am one of the original backers from 4 years ago and loved the Original Planescape Torment - having played it a dozen times at least. The original Torment was reviewed by the New York Times which felt that it should be elevated to the status of literature due to the depth, beauty and originality of the writing - and I completely agree - the writing was that good. http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/27/techn ... tions.htmlNot so much the sequel, Torment 2 - Tides of Numenera. I am not sure where to begin with all the problems this game has.1) Poor NPC introduction and character development. During this game I really reached a point of not really caring at all about my fellow companions. Mainly because there wasn't really anything compelling to care about. If you look at the original game, each companion is introduced to you from a space that matches who they are. Morte you meet in the beginning after you awaken in the dusties mortuary. Fall-from-Grace in the Brothel Of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, Anna-From the Shadows you meet in the Beggar Kings domain surrounded by shadows and thieves, Nordrom is found in a tainted Modron construct and so on... They are all incredible well-voiced and have distinct opinions and personalities as well as extensive backstories that you have to dig out. They also are linked to you through a unified theme - that of being broken and/or creatures that defy their own nature. In ToN I felt the companions were just kind of there - not much to the backstory nor are they all that important. 2) Way too much flavor without substance. There was just an exhaustive amount of shallow flavor interactions with this game that didn't have a whole lot to do with the main story. Although this feels like more a result of the universe - the Numenera - which is everywhere. The whole point of the Numenera is you never find out who made any of it or what its original purpose is/was - which can be fun in small doses but this game is lousy with that sort of thing. It just becomes one exhausting and unfulfilling interaction after another - wondering if this strange thing is important (usually not).3) Show don't tell - this has been said many times and it is spot on. This just doesn't feel like an RPG - more of a story we are being told and we have to click the screen a bunch to get to the next part. I lost count of the number of times the writing devolved into telling us what we should be experiencing and what we should know instead of showing us what is there to see and letting us figure it out. The original Planescape has been called literature - and I agree - it definitely hits that bar. ToN is barely bad storytelling - and at the juvenile level at best. The excuse I keep hearing from people is - ""Well the original had a lot of writing - maybe you just don't like that"" and my response is ""Please shut up if you can't tell the difference between good writing and bad""4) The combat is terrible, boring and confusing. It actually ends up being a blessing that combat is so rare in this game (although it shouldn't be if the game was well made), because it is really unsatisfying. Thankfully mostly you can skip it. 5) It is derivative in the worst kinds of ways. It felt like they just copy pasted aspects of the story from the original and pasted them onto this story. The overall feeling is a story that feels pieced-together and does not flow organically. So basically there is a lot more but it comes down to this -it's pretty clear that the real genius behind Planescape Torment was not present on this project. I am done with Brian Fargo and InExile Entertainment. Wasteland 2 was just as weak and tedious story-wise as this title and its clear they don't have the writing chops to offer anything worthy of the titles and legacies they are pilfering. This game will not do well. I hope you guys felt it was worth it to waste your resources on porting instead of making sure you had a solid product with great writing.			"

Early Access Review
								(Beta Review: 28Jan2016)Where to start?To be a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment is to fill some gargantuan boots- but the team behind this game is doing it.Fleshing out the weird that is the Numenera setting is no easy task, either, and still- this team is doing it.So. Should you buy this game?Yes. Abso♥♥♥♥inglutely. The creators involved in this game and the Numenera setting are *brilliant* and I want them to continue creating beautiful things. The more people I can convince to give them money the more likely they are going to continue to create more awesome. If you play this game, you will want this, too. If you are not into seeing things that are unfinished- if you can't handle bugs and rough edges, then maybe wait for a few patch passes- give a little time for the technical bits to have another coat of polish before investing. But if you're in it for the writing- and if you loved Planescape: Torment you *know* you are in it for the writing- then I've a feeling you'll be able to put the bugs behind you.Okay, okay, you want something besides feelings? If you love attention to detail and rolling your eyeballs across hundreds of thousands of words-Play this game.If you love thinking about how our choices make us the people we are-Play this game.If you have ever played a game and thought- ""Dyah- I wish there were more dialogue options""-Play this game.If you love your swords and sorcery with a side of petulant AI and brain-eating-amphetamine♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥worms-Play this game.What? You don't like any of those things?Play this game anyway, you might learn something. (Seriously? Not even one of those things? Really? Worms didn't do it for ya? Whatever.)Yeah. So stop reading, go buy it (or get your key if you were a kickstarter backer) and go play. It is an absolute delight.			"

Early Access Review
								Just played a bit of it, but I can already enumerate some points. First, I died before I could even start the game. How? In an awesome way, but I won't give you spoilers. I just say that I was too ""eager to throw myself away"". And that's one big lead to let you know how unpredictable is the scenario of this game. Since the first lines of the narration, you`re already choosing your destiny and changing whatever you don't know you're going to change, and that's simply terrifying and gratifying at the same time. About the ""Planescape: Torment premise"", well, I might say the whole package is all in it, even if many thing are not implemented and ""well developed"" yet, you can ""feel"" it`s all there.  I can give a couple of examples from what I`ve already experienced: alien-ish and complete freakish ambientation, great character development, ""things"" so bizarre simply apread all over places for you to interact and figure (what the hell) is it about, dense and metaphysical dialogues that give you the creeps and ""haunt"" your decision-making. Aside of that, you're simply thrown into the world without knowledge or making sense of anything. It's strange. The most common word not for the begining of the game but for the whole of it. I'm sincerely SUPER excited for what's coming next (patches and updates) and still exploring and understanding everything we already have. It's not something simple to make a game whose main premise is to continue the legacy of one of the greatest RPG's ever made. It's really a BOLD proposition, but I have to say, the guys in InXile are treading the right path towards this goal.			"

												Its a thumbs down for me eventually. Went into this game with optimism and hope for an involving story, bizarre and wierd enough to be interesting. But as time went by and I explored more and nore, its just not happening to me. The story is to fragmented and uninteresting to make up for the complete and utter poor combat system. I might play this for 30 min now and then, but its not a good game.			"

												Not sure what went wrong here, excellent storytelling and top-notch writing but the game just doesn't hold together - feels fragmented and then suddenly rushed at the end with the story themes all clashing at once. Although, it possesses many of the hallmarks of an excellent sci-fi novel, it's ultimately disappointing as an RPG. The sub-quests, sub-plots and mini-stories are interesting and feature thought-provoking themes whilst adding substance to the world, but they seem to overshadow the main storyline and sap away some of the game's momentum. Even the MacGuffin (resonance chamber) wasn't really interesting or urgent enough for me to feel like it motivated the main character or companions. After walking in the footsteps of the Changing God and meeting all the other Castoffs, well, I just wasn't sold that my ""one"" life really mattered as the protagonist in the game - maybe that answers the question of the game's premise.

												Game made by people who think high word count is an indicator of quality but don't know the dictionary definition for the word gameplay. Quite apart from all the unfulfilled kickstarter promises, the cargo-cult design, the barebones combat, the amateurish art direction, the laughable GUI and the atrocious writing (helpful hint for inXile: a good editor is worth more than ten popular writers), the game is incredibly boring and not worth your time or your money.

												A big dissapointment. I backed them in Kickstarter and was anxious to play it. The game is too short, too easy, linear and repetitive. And despite of some cool dialogues and stories, it was way to predictable and dull. An technically the game is clunky and not well polished. The sound effects and music are awful for a rpg, specially coming from the tradition that they want to follow. Would it be too hard to put narration and envolving music during the special ""game-book like"" shortstories? The community would have done it for pennies.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only played the first chapter, since that's all that Early Access provides access to. That said, Torment gets a HEAVY recommendation for anyone that either loves cRPGs or wanted a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment. The focus is purely on world building, character development, and choice and consequence. This means these features are prioritzed over interesting combat mechanics. Combat is the weakest point of this game (as it was similarly weak in Planescape); fortunately, In most cases, combat can be ignored through various plot devices.The world is fascinating. You'll love it.			"

												I played a few hours, I don't think I'll play more. This game left me totally unimpressed. Terrible, clumsy interface, below-average graphics (except maybe the backrgounds). Damn, look at that awful portraits and characters. Moving the character around carries an irritating heaviness that I could not stand any more after 20 minutes of play.The tutorial didn't help me at all grasping the game basics. I died at the first combat (and I'm not a newbie to CRPG). Not bad for a game advertised as ""not combat-based"".Overall, it left me with a feeling of a rushed, unfinished game. It completely lacks polishing.As a huge fan of the first Torment (and kickstater backer), I can't help but feeling completely disappointed.			"

												If you are a big fan of the Original game, then you wont be disappointed. Try and ignore the negative criticism centered around combat (and cut content, i'm just glad this got a sequel) - if you played the original PS:T, then you would know that the combat was not very good in that either (remember casting spells? omg.)This is a CRPG and I it plays how you might expect if Pillars of Eternity and Wasteland 2 had a baby, with a heavy frosting of super weird 'anything goes' scifi.The reason its predecessor was so well recieved was because of a fantasticly weird, enjoyable and throughly engrossing storyline. This still exists in this game as well. The story is handcrafted with care and packed full of wonderful characters with weird stories to tell. Some might say too many characters; and this is evidentally true in the first slow hours.BE PREPARED, for there is very little in the way of voice acting; and a lot of reading is required. Seriously the game is thick with prose, so much so that it is like reading a novel.PROS--------Deep storyInteresting charactersBeautiful pre-rendered backdropsInteresting 'good and evil' systemCONS-------Little voice actingCombat system lacking (no change for this series)Slightly weird UI "

												This game is extremely slow. NOTHING like the original Torment. I'm sixteen hours in, and there have been six fight sequences.. this thing is 95% dialogue, and it is repetitive, non-interesting dialogue which has absolutely nothing to do with the quests. In fact, you have to wade through all the useless bull just to get to the important bits. I can believe this game is $45. Also, the game has zero replayability value. It feels more like work than like playing a game. I'll probably finish it since I'm OCD, but save yourself the money and the time.. get something which you'll actually enjoy. TLDR: this isn't even a shadow of the original Torment. It is tedious, unrewarding.. absolute crap.			"

												I want to like this game but it's just not fun.  The writing is good (though way too verbose at times - especially when interacting with an object that you can plainly see on screen, but is written about anyway), the presentation isn't bad, but the game just lacks anything that makes me want to continue playing it.A shame, because I'd been waiting a long time for this and really want to like it, but it gets a resounding meh.Can't recommend this.Edit:  I need to say that I was a huge fan of Wasteland 2 and as such, I expected a certain amount of playability - or entertainment.  The (non) combat in this game, and how little of it there is leaves little fun to be had when actually ""playing"" the game.  I understand that it's meant to be more story heavy, and I get that this type of game just isn't for me.  But with the likes of WL2 aboard Inxile's roster, I expected something more playable and engaging, and less of an interactive thesaurus.			"

												Waited so many years for this suppose to be a continuation of the best games i have ever played. Planescape Torment had its charm. Little bit of magic that was so unique yet now acclaimed to be a continuation to the game turned out to be nothing like it. Do not judge me by the time i spent on that game but when you really want a continuation you are going to expect the same mechanics as the one you fell in love with and came back to so many times as the nostalgy kicked in (God it was beautiful!).  you simply cannot relate it to Planescape as the change to it is way to major (fallout and etc. creeps please do not go on a rage). Yes, I know the games tend to change, but do not ever call for continuation when you f____d anticipation for one of the titles that meant to bring our childchood/adulthood back on place to the realm of current♥♥♥♥♥♥__ess of adaptation to what you call continuity. Turn based combat (which yeah many will love but f__k it it supposeto be torment!!!) introduced have put me off big time. It just immediately takes away the torment effect from it. Unfortunately lads who spend a lot of time, stress and sleepless nights on development of this Torment somehow Based Game left judgemnet to number of people which makes me think... what percentage of the votes reflects future purchases for people that did not have a voice in the vote? In this title should be included a ""FAN VERSION"" attachment to dwelve those poor lads to be aware of the path they put Torment into :(			"

												Perfect world-building, good storyline, very interactive (but zero real player agency and probably not much replay value).Main problem: it's obviously rushed. It feels as if at some point they decided to stitch all the finished fragments and systems of a much larger game into something smaller and passable enough to sell. That, among other things, screwed up the pacing and rendered half of the systems obsolete.The end result has merits, but it is not very graceful.Too bad. Could've been an excellent game; instead it's merely decent (not a crime, but even if you disregard the hype the wasted potential is glaringly obvious).Clearly needed another year (or two). A large addon, maybe? Some sort of director's cut? Sadly, that's not likely to happen.			"

												I'm not sure that there is a word for the feeling of desperately wanting to recapture a pleasant feeling that you had once upon a time but because you and the world have changed that innocent feeling is no longer possible.  In any case, that is this game.  I know that, from a stand point of pure unbiased opinion that this game is probably pretty good.  But I cannot stand it.  It is like being trapped in a particularly annoying novel where you hate everything about it from the characters to the plot to the completely bizarre world.Game play is boring, controls are simple and simple and in a world of complex high end controls simple just doesn't work.  The isometric view sucks for control as about 90% of the time you are at least partially obscured on what you are doing and you have no means of telling what you are seeing.  This makes combat a chore and really irritating to boot.The plot is simple, and while that is not automatically a bad thing, its boring.  I find absolutely nothing interesting in the characters they've provided and the idea of trying to make a story out of these sad two dimensional cardboard cut-outs is just too annoying to work with.The game is a failure.  And that makes me sad.  So much potential and work squandered on so much lack luster nonsense.			"

												I really wanted to write a positive review for this game but I just cannot. I am an avid CRPG fan, with multiple completions of BG1, BG2, IWD, IWD2 as well as more recently, PoE, and Tyranny. While I did not play planescape torment, I believe my major criticisms are not due to the theme of the story, which is actually something I enjoy, but rather due to the major design and technical errors found in the game. I finished the ""First Chapter"" in about 12 hours. With that, here are some positive aspects to begin. Good writing if longwinded and obtuse about the actual consequences of what you read. There is a lot of magic jargon and special words to keep track of. It could use something like what Tyranny did where you can read the lore behind a word in a brief summary.  Good setting and artwork. It is strange; it is not dwarves, elves and humans in space. It is a weird sci-fi fantasy, cyberpunk blend with a ton of psychedelics thrown in. The environments are interesting to look at and are varied, but sometimes get in the way of actually accomplishing what you want to do. The systems have great potential for depth. For example not only do I get extra insight through text because I am a mind reader, but occasionally I will receive extra damage because I read peoples mind who do not like that.Now for the much longer negatives. Too many loading screens - they are not too long but dear god will you see a lot of them Too much backtracking which is tedious due to the screens. Consequences for having too many onetime use items, but not enough situations to actually use them A completely unfinished companion  Rhin  Clunky movement and control, which is not smooth. Fast travel must be unlocked through progress in the main story line - AND it does not even sometimes place you in the place where you can visit the rest of the area  Caravanserai I am looking at you!  No rest outside of two areas in the main city. Almost too many options for leveling up. Seriously. You have to choose between, like four things every time, and it is unclear what is important. Poor skill balance. A few skills are super useful and easy to progress with while others are challenging.  Little VO compared to PoE or BG2. Only a few of the companion conversations have it and it feels like it is difficult to know when you have new ones available. No indicator when you have no choices available to speak with NCPs. What I mean is the text does not just go gray or dark when you have already asked INSTEAD you get the version of it where the word AGAIN is inserted into the sentence. Which is difficult to notice. Sometimes that will yield more information but most of the time not. It’s stupid, because every cRPG to date has solved this problem. Gray out when it is the same make it blue to indicate you can ask again and get a new response.  The cypher look like they should interact and there is even dialogue in game that suggests that they do YET I have not seen any evidence of the sort. Many items called oddities SOME of which are critical to solving optional quests.  Like the starfish eyeball thing for the pyramid puzzle in order of truth section  Very unclear which ones are important. Chapter one is pretty short ~6 hours without side quests, 12 hours with a large amount of side quests (Can't say I did all of them but I tried to)  Unclear combat mechanics. Its turn based which is fine, but then there is a large of amount of information, which is unclear. How do I find out how much armor the enemy has for example? Boring skills and abilities that are not balanced. Okay I get it I can get a bunch of skills that can increase my chances at pass a specific check. Each increase is 15% - That is not exciting and seems too quickly turn into automatically passing the check automatically. Unbalanced rewards sometimes just hitting the right dialogue with one NPC without doing ANYTHING gives you free stats equivalent if not better then leveling up. In addition, sometimes a quest, which took 35 minutes to do because of how difficult it was to track down all the stuff, gives 40 xp. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid  The movement and interaction feels almost sluggish. Crashes occasionally has weird graphical glitches as NPC bodies sliding around and Steam overlay freezing over parts of the game. Unclear consequences of some actions. As I am not sure which tide I will get sometimes - which is fine... but I am also unsure how each tide effected the conversations I had.I really hope they improve the game in the next parts because while I enjoyed spending my weekend with it I am saddened that it is unfinished and has so many glaring problems. Some might say the obfuscation is what makes the game challenging and interesting. I tend to agree and I try to solve every puzzle myself beforehand. However, it cannot be expected that many people interested in the story are able to commit 30 minutes to solve a minor side quest, or know to look up the solution online (the latter might not even be possible in all cases)If you are a diehard cRPG fan like me, you will probably still enjoy it, if you are just getting your feet wet in cRPG's go play Pillars of Eternity or Baldurs Gate 2: Enhanced Edition.EDIT: Played the game for about 5 hours after the release to see what happen after the beta content. The vast majority of my criticism still stands. There is more voice acting later and new dialogue options that appear but still suffers from many of the same problems as before. I was most disappointed to find out that Rhin remains largely unviable in combat - although can be useful in completing objectives. I still dislike the combat even more so when there are literally 20 enemies that must take their turn. It feels very slow. Again. More loading screens - for example SPOILER in the valley section you must travel between different rooms of which I think ~15 are quest revelant but there is loading screen on each one. I think I must have spent a good hour today on loading screens. The writing remains strong if somewhat obtuse. Nearly every character speaks in riddles while lecturing on metaphyiscs which is not neccarily bad but may not be for everyone . Going to finish it during the week and will provide a full review.

												I was one of kickstarter backers for TTON.Haven't played through my copy yet - doesn't have time and mood to do so in near future.Beta demo was promising one.Now let's talk about cons:- Bugs. Demo was ok, but I regulary experiencing bugs and crashes. Strangely in places where beta been doing fine.- Russian localization. It's a horrible machine translation. I don't get why TTON was moved half a year to bring localisations on release. Russian one is so horrible and badly made, it'll be better there will be no localisation at all. And I must add that localisation of Pillars of Eternity was very descent. Why inXile haven't shared experience with Obsidian? Especially when there was big discussions of russian localisation for the game and how it's important to find right company to do so, since russian publishers are not trustworthy and known for bad traslations and support, including machine translations.- inXile developing VR game, locked exclusive for PC peripheral - VR headset Oculus Rift. That's like a stab in the back from PC gaming veterans who funding their games on kickstarter.https://uploadvr.com/the-mages-tale-oculus-touch-inxile/I don't recommend you to buy this game before bugs been fixed. If you want to play game with russian language - avoid game at all, and put your hopes for community to make translation.			"

												EDIT: After going through a second playthrough, I have some added thoughts. I stand by the original review and it have not changed it or removed anything, but have added some final thoughts.Alright... Let's start with the negatives. There are a few. There are quite a few bugs, most of them minor annoyances (EDIT: See the end for how these minor annoyances became a lot more major.). But I have through one complete playthrough and well into the second one encountered two quest bugs that make it impossible to finish those quests. In the first case it was annoying, but didn't really ruin anything for me. The second one, however is a pretty big deal and almost causes me to turn on this game. I have decided not to continue with that playthrough until this is fixed. I should note that I had no problems at all with the same qeust on the first playthrough. This is not acceptable in a game that has had such a long ( and open) development time. There are minor technical issues here and there but I have not experienced anything bad.With that out of the way - This in an incredible game when it comes to story, plot, characters, atmosphere, lore and worldbuilding. It is well worthy of its claim as successor to Planescape: Torment. The protagonist is slightly less interesting than in P:T but the progression and decisions make up for it. There is an army of characters and quests, mostly very well done and varied.If you're not ready to read, and lots of, then this is NOT the game for you. The sheer amount of written dialogue and descriptions is staggering and very well done.If you're expecting action then, again, this game is NOT for you. There are few combat situations and most potential combat situations can be avoided through conversations and skills. It's a plus in my eyes but some may disagree. As a matter of fact there is no actual combat situation - it's referred to as Crisis and can be resolved in many ways, including but not limited to combat. The combat system is turn based and old-school gamers will be very familiar with the good and bad of such. I like it but it can be on the tough side.The character progression is fairly traditional and easy to learn but may not be for everyone. It's the ol' fashioned 'get a bunch of XP and level up' but with the added wrinkle that there are four levels / tier. You can only do so much every level but gain new abilities at every tier. The characters are pretty weak to begin with and get more versatile and powerful with time - no big surprises there.Long story short, this is a very good game worth the wait (I kickstarted it back in 2013) but it sure as hell isn't for everyone. It's an incredible world and story with a lot of great content but it absolutely will not appeal to those seeking a fast pace and/or action. This is a game that takes its time and rewards patience and immersion. That's my thing, may not be yours.But is sure isn't perfect.Finally (this will be a personal gripe, by all means stop reading if you're satisfied so far) I cannot, for the life of me, understand a looooooot of the other reviews for this game. I see an awful lot of complaints about the lack of action and combat and complaints about the amount of text. I don't mean to be rude, but it has been purdy clear from day one that this would never be a game drowning in action nor lacking in reading and lore. So I stress, again, if you're looking for action this just isn't the game for you.EDIT: I went through and finished a second playthrough. Using some player knowledge of the quests, I managed to completely avoid any such bugs and could do (and finish) all the quests. I still think this is a very well written and thought out game, story, plot etc. I also still think it will never appeal to everyone, but then people forget that nobody bought Planescape: Torment on release and it took years for people to understand what a remarkable game that was. In my personal instance, I alone in my group of friends bought and/or thought it was special. That's the good news.There's just no way around it, this is a buggy mess. I've lost count of the number of issues I've experienced but they've ranged from tiny annoyances to game-breaking in a sense. I had to effectively restart a playthrough from scratch becuase of a quest bug. Late game I had to relaod the same encounter repeatedly because my character was knocked down for -1 round, which so completely baffled the program that I was stuck. I've had a situation almost at the end of the game where I was basically stuck because I was given a 110% chance at succeeding at a task. But the thing about bugs is that they can be fixed and I have a feeling inXile could have really used a few more months, but wouldn't have dared to delay once again. The positives of the game, as far as I'm concerned, still far outweigh the negatives. But I repeat once more that this game will never appeal to everyone.			"

												Admittedly I haven't got very far into TTON yet, but what I've seen so far hasn't impressed me a great deal.I am a huge fan of Planescape Torment, though I've never claimed it to be a perfect game. PST suffered from an overabundance of trash fights, but made up for it by having some of the best video game writing I've ever seen. As a successor to PST, TTON fails in many areas. Every character in PST, from party members to random NPCs on the streets of Sigil, were extremely memorable. In TTON, characters usually serve only as lore dispensers, lacking interesting personality or anything particuarly interesting to say. The issue of lore dumpy, boring characters is compounded by generally poor writing. There is an overabundance of ""purple prose"", that is text excessively extravagant, that often feels like it was just added to increase the length of a lore dump. PST was also fond of extravagant description, but Chris Avellone managed to work within the setting so that the rich descriptions of the crazy planes immersed you in the setting, rather than frustrating you with another long lore dump.The combat falls flat, much like its predecessor, though one improvement over PST is that there are far less ""trash"" fights, so in that at least, it is an improvement.  The combat is extremely slow, and the whole ""one move and one combat action"" system feels incredibly restricting. Divinity Original Sin had far better turn based combat than this (and most other recent TB games)The stat system feels like a system that works in a P&P, but not a CRPG. You see all skill/stat checks regardless of your stat levels, and ""spend"" your stats to increase the chance of a successful attempt. This removes replayability, as all you need to do is save before a stat/skill check and reload until you pass, compared to say Fallout 1/2 and PST where extra options appeared based on your current stats. A super smart character gets no extra options over a dumb one, just an easier time passing the checks.Overall, I am disappointed with this release. It might be salvageable, but it would take a lot of work.			"

												It breaks my heart, but I'm pretty disappointed. For all those years spent, this game is awfully short. Where are all the promised stretch goals: Numenera crafting, oasis of M'ra Jolios, ruins of Ossiphagan (real locations, not meres)? Why isn't leveling up tailored to the game, just stops abruptly? The whole new world created, then restricted to this painfully linear story. It feels like they pocketed the money and decided to take it easy. With over 4 million budget, they should've get more game designers on the team.			"

												Damn I wanted to like TToN so much, I didn't though.Pros:+Beautifull landscape art+Very interesting setting+Rhin (companion)Cons:-Ugly character art, made worse by ugly or nonexistent character portraits-Pointless character developement system: *Combat skills feel pointless because there's so little combat, of which most is avoidable anyway*All other skills feel pointless after few levels, because you end up automatically passing every single skill test with minimal effort / points used-Simplistic, unengaging combat (Crisis)-Uninteresting companion characters (most of them)-Bugs. I've found two bugs in vendor screen taking all my money, one side quest I couldn't complete, and one crisis in main quest line I had to load/save a dozen times to get through because of a crucial companion being unable to use his skills due to an UI bug.-Complete lack of anything that would make this an engaging computer game. It's more like a book with graphics you need to click on to read more, and couple of very simple puzzles to solve.I suppose it all boils down to the writing though, and how you like it. I'm a constant reader, and I mainly read science fiction and historical novels from a lot of authors, all of which usually contain a lot of world building and lengthy descriptions, and I loved PST. In TToN I still got completely exhausted by the amount of text one has to wade through. Sure the world *is* interesting, and some of the quests are too. However, there's just so much text explaining just how interesting and clever and filled with hidden meaning and lost secrets everything is, even when said item, NPC or concept is pointless and never mentioned again, I can't be bothered to read it all. I got tired of it. I mean, there's pointless stuff you can collect and sell, and those all have lengthy descriptions. Every NPC has a wall of text to wade through, just so you can be sure that the NPC in question is a pointless sidenote that doesn't even have a named sidequests tied to it. I mean, it took me like five hours to finish my first quest in the game, because I felt like I had to talk to all of the NPC's in Sagus' Cliffs (several of them twice), to be sure I was making an educated decision. Five hours is two movies worth of writing, or half a book, without any kind of conclusion or advancement of the plot. After being exhausted by this sort of gameplay, where the ""game"" was actually just me clicking my character between NPC's and reading their comments for hours, I really couldn't believe it that the game then even took the graphics away, and made me do text adventures (most of which seemed totally disconnected from the story.)I'm sorry about writing a review without finishing the game, but I suppose that speaks for itself. I'll maybe return to TToN in couple of months and try to struggle through it.			"

												I can't give this a thumbs up.  I backed it, I'd like to give it a thumbs up, but I can't. - Combat is tedious - I'm yet to see these ""hand-crafted encounters with changing objectives, and interactions"" that they spoke of in their backer emails.  Currently I'm in a location filled with nameless enemies with whom you can't negotiate, or avoid, with literally 0 terrain, just a flat gray path.  So, good work guys, I guess you can give 0 ♥♥♥♥♥ while handcrafting something too.""A New Take on Combat. With the Crisis system, combat is more than just bashing your enemies. Plan your way through hand-crafted set-pieces which combine battles with environmental puzzles, social interaction, stealth, and more."" - the Devs, I guess talking about some different game. - My character's current equipment is a mesh cloak and a skin coloured jumpsuit, they look like a loosely wrapped supermarket ham. - For all their record  backing, they sure did the minimal voice acting - it actually surprises me every time an NPC bothers to say a word.If you're feeling like an RPG, and haven't played Divinity yet, do that.  It is turn-based, actually strategic, with far more interesting interactions with NPCs.  Plus, they have this newfangle thing called 3D graphics, which were developed sometime between Baldur's Gate and now.  Turns out you can make pretty interesting environments, and when you have to do a combat encounter next to a wall, you can just turn the camera around.I'm giving this one more go, because I backed this and really want to like it.  But its is definitely circling the Vortex of Uninstalling.			"

												Now that the full version is out, some of my thoughts:Wonderful writing, great world design, gorgeous art design, great science fiction feel to the game and the atmosphere is well done.Can't wait to play more of this wonderful, engrossing rpg, if you want some wonderful writing or a beautifully crafted gameworld and a future science fiction setting then pick this up asap!I have played above 20 hours of the final version and I have only gotten in 1 fight so far. Like Planscape Torment before it, you can beat most of the game without fighting if you want. The game gives you alot of ways to play the game!Now excuse me as I get pulled back into this wonderfully crafted game that so far has reminded me of a cross between the setting and writing of Planscape Torment and the atmosphere and feel of HBO's Westworld with the science aspects this game brings to the table.The only negatives are that the first hour is slow and not the best (But boy does it get going after this!) and also that the combat is not that great (when compared to something like  Divinity Original Sin), decent but not super amazing. Thankfully you can play most the game without fighting if that is what you so desire. The combat is good enough but won't blow you away, this is how I felt about the combat for the Shadowrun crpgs.Well done Inexile! You made a guy like me very excited to be back in this universe again after all these years (1999 since Planscape Torment I think?).Now get reading and get ready for an adventure you might just not be ready for!Best writing of the crpg resurgence for me (Pillars and Wasteland 2 where the best writing previous of the insurgence of crpgs) but a bit behind Divinity, Wasteland 2 and Pillars in the combat department. Still, so far this is a wonderful game that has a very unique setting, amazing writing and a world that has been crafted with so much love and care.I am so glad crpgs are back, it is wonderful to have something to play that focuses on characters, writing and the game world, instead of just action, shooting or top of the line graphics like so many modern games these days.WRITING = 9.5/10WORLD DESIGN = 9/10SOUNDTRACK = 8.5/10COMBAT = 7/10NON-COMBAT GAMEPLAY = 9/10			"

Early Access Review
								I really loved Planescape Torment. It had a rich, creative world with a very grown up story that was ahead of its time. The graphics really added up to the game and created a rich atmosphere.Now to Torment: Tides of Numenera. To be honest, it is nothing like Planescape. I haven't really seen anything were I can say this is on par with its role model.Even if you do not judge it by that high standards, it is mediocre at best. For example the graphics. It just doesn't look good. And I am not talking from a technical standpoint, but from an artistic. In terms of colors it lacks harmonic environments, it looks dull. Compared with a newer game like Pillars of Eternity which manages to create something special with every map, it is weaker in every way. No atmospheric lightning, the maps are nowhere near that detailed.Also through other means like sound they do not manage to create the imagination of a living, breathing city.As for the combat, it is boring and slow. I don't know why they made the decision to go turn based. I see no reason, it isn't even very tactical.But remember, this is still Early Access and maybe the game has greatly improved in the past month - who knows. And that brings me to my last point:I am really disappointed by this Early Access. There is no real involvement of the buyers. No updates, no information. If anything, this is a good example on how you should NOT do an Early Access. I am sure I am not the only buyer that is disappointed how this is going. It really looks like they just wanted to grab some early money without any real responsibility towards the buyers.			"

												I don't recommend this game for now, it is too unpolished, unfinished and cut.The cut content is huge, like 3 cut companion for a total of 6 instead of 9, a city has been removed, more important, there is a game mechanic called focus, there were about 40 planed, and if I'm not mistaken, only 3 foci makes it in the final game.There is lot more cut content, check on google.I said unpolished because the game has a lot of bug and is not very stable, the dialogue are not fluid and sometime require time to display the next reply. A detail, that matters to me : the female character portrait doesn't match the 3d model (because the portrait has changed during beta, but not the 3d model), it's an immersion breaker for me.For the unfinished part, it's about Inxile saying that there will be patches with new content, to complete the game and add cut content. So a lot of people think there will be a Director's Cut, like for Wasteland 2. I hope so.I'll came back to play it and eventually change my review for the probable Director's Cut in a few month.			"

												I was really looking forward to this game.BUT..Still full of bugs and crash issues (i've a new endgame pc never experimented such issues with any other game...).And it is still partially developed and incomplete to my advice... ok. A Tiranny2 if u played Tiranny and know what i mean...For example: the game give ua lot of choices and no explanations for tides for example ( so far i didn't see any utility to that but still i get popped up about them every 2 minutes... so?) Or  also u can fight certain encounters or use dialogue options, dialogue skills to avoid them and still obtaining the same result BUT the game award you drops and exp for the fight.. and almost NOTHING for the talk options... then it's obvious u have to choose fight if u wanna develop your characters well.Those are just a few examples, right now i'm doing a quest against peerless robots and i can't go on because my game crashes every 5 minutes i'm in that tedious fight... also i don't understand because my main character is like losing all movements point if he has no cyphers or fetter that diminish them on him.. i can't substantially move him in a fight.. thank god i gave him a ranged weapon.. (which is impossible to know the range about tho..)			"

												I liked it. Not everyone are into this kind of game. Planescape: torment was a major AAA title in a time that was all about different genres than where it's at now; it won game of the year awards and etc. This one is on a very different, indie scale, and it shows at time. Still it has it's stellar moments and in my sense it lives up to my expectations. But it's good; people complain about two things: the combat system and that it did not live up to their nostalgia. Fact is that the combat is clearly not the star of the show here; we're dealing with different goals and intents. The Story's better than undertale's and a lot of other games'.			"

												I am a backer of this title and consider Planescape: Torment one of the greatest PC games of all time. It is with a heavy heart that I find myself writing a bad review for this game. The problems are numerous:1. The story is dull and uninteresting. I find myself pushing forward thinking it must surely get better soon.2. The characters are lacking in personality. Near the beginning of the game, you are introduced to two characters who eventually choose to split up and force you to choose which one to follow. It occurred to me at that point that I don't really care which I follow because the characters are so lacking in personality that it is impossible to distinguish one from the other without resorting to judging by looks and character class.3. The writing is bad. I don't mean ""writing"" as in ""the plot"" (though that's not good either); I mean the dialogue and other text you read throughout the game. This is a game that relies heavily on the writing. The prose needed to be good; it isn't. The writing should be at least good enough that you don't stop to think about whether it's good or not. Instead, it is so bad that you wonder if it was written by amateurs.4. This game feels less like a video game and more like a ""Choose your own adventure"" book. Quite often, things that deserve a cut-scene are merely described to you using that bland prose I complained about in #3 above. Why am I reading about a flash-back memory instead of seeing it as a cut-scene?5. I'm bored. Yes, I'm barely getting started, but I don't recall ever being bored of a game this quickly, especially one I had been looking forward to and eagerly anticipating for several years.Pretty much the only redeeming quality of this game is the setting. The setting is fantastic; I could imagine many great epic stories taking place in this world. Unfortunately, the story they tell in this title is just bland and boring.Having said that, I have to admit that I have barely put any time into the game yet and its possible it will get good soon. If it does I will update this review. In the meantime though, I am bored and don't really feel like playing it.If you do choose to get this game, just be aware of what you are getting into. This is not a classic RPG and doesn't actually resemble Planescape: Torment in any way. This is more along the lines of Sid Meyer's Sorcery! and other text driven games. You will spend most of your time reading descriptions of events that you are not actually seeing on screen and interacting with dialogue menus.			"

Early Access Review
								Tried to play an alpha. All I wanna say: I'm very impatient for the moment this game will be released. Whoever liked Planescape will be pleasantly surprised by the diversity of choises you can make. Also I'd like to tell that after 15+ years of wait...it was totally worth it. Pros:+The context dialogues consist of 10+ options and all your choises lead to some kind of consiquences that differ one from another! +A decent storyline, which kinda reminds of Planescape, when you dunno who are you, what happened to you and someone is after you.+Pleasant graphics which also remind of good old times spent in Planescape.+Soundtrack.+Atmosphere.+Easter eggs! (not spoiling, try to find them yourself :P)Cons:-Still in alpha.-Pretty slow development.-Decent english skills required to understand what is going on (they plan to make several localisations later though)P.S. The only reason I'm not playing it right now- is that the game is not finished yet. I want to wait till it's released, take a vacation, turn off the phones, tell everyone to leave me alone for 2 weeks, close myself in my house and pass this game non-stop :D			"

												So I was extremly exited about this game. Planscape: Torment was one of the best RPG's if not the best. Creators of the same game have been working on this spiritual successor and here where the problems start... The game gives you choices yes, the story is rich yes, the world... omg it is too much, the world is overcomplicated, the magic of Planscape was that some places looked normal but where not and then you could have visited intresting locations etc. here it's madhouse. Now coming to the choices almost every combat can be avoided... but what happens when you want to choose combat, basically don't the system it awefull. Combat in this RPG feels forced and is not enjoyable at all, the magic is so underwhelming that playing a mage is a huge dissapointment. Now coming to the story and the choices, is it really that interesting the truth be told no, in short this is the most expensive book you will ever buy.			"

												Torment: Tides of Numenera is a not a bad game, but the whole “spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment” is a lie. The only thing these two titles share is a horrible combat mechanics.On surface it looks like P:T — there is a lot of nicely written text. Sadly, it is mostly used for lore and certain interesting stories, when companions and main plot desperately needed more attention. Rich world lore conveys a false feeling that something deep is going on, but then illusion dissipates. Huge amount of text feels redundant, because it is rarely used for things that matter. Game fails to create a connection with the player, it is hard to become involved in the Last Castoff's story when everything feels so artificial and shallow. After Sagus Cliffs, locations are rushed, NPC have next to nothing to say, quests devolve into constant fetching off something from neighbouring location. Meres feels like something that should not even be in game, they are so primitive and unpolished it hurts. Companion-related quests are very short and simple, and in some cases (Rhin and Callistege) also disappointing. Story closure is the final spit in the face, it is one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ “here is your buttons, press one and receive corresponding enging” deals.In the end, game leaves a very bitter aftertaste, like a waste of time and, worst of all, hope.

												I've encountered a lot of bugs that cause the game to lock up and freeze, forcing you to play through parts of the game multiple times.  The combat mechanics are pretty simplistic.  Character development isn't very interesting.  The setting is interesting; the storyline is decent; the NPCs are imaginative in description if not in visual presentation.  It's not a good game, but it's a decent experience.  I wouldn't have paid full price for this game though if I had known then what I do now.			"

												I haven't finished the game and I'm writing this review now because I'm not sure that I will. It's a decent game, but when you set yourself up as the successor to Planescape: Torment, you have to live up to high expectations, and Tides of Numenera just doesn't. The concept and world are amazing, but the implementation is just unfinished, making the experience feel like you're just scratching the sruface. First, here's what the game does right. I really liked the original story. It's a bit of a slow burn, but most of the writing is good, and they included all the interesting and bizarre little details, side-stories, and dark humor that really nailed the same narrative feel as PS:T. Also, the promise of being able to take multiple approaches to situations has been delivered. They also definitely brought it with the art. The various game locations I've seen so far are varied and exciting, and in the era of 3D dominance, they still manage to make an isometric game look attractive and visually engaging.However, the flaws really prevent this game from coming together into an immersive experience. The idea of the tides affecting how everyone in the world reacts to you was barely there, really just adding up to a few throwaway dialogue lines of, ""I had heard you were that type of person..."" It never seemed to actually affect outcomes. Also, there are no real factions like the ones you could interact with and even join in Torment. I ""joined"" one of the groups in the game through dialogue, but it has had no effect at all as far as I can tell. No one treated me any differently, I got no stat bonuses or penalties, it didn't seem to help or hurt the group's standing in the world, and I later I even met people who were members of that same group and they had no idea who I even was. Again, there was a lame line about how the various branches of the group didn't have much contact with each other. The skills, abilities, and effort setup felt needlessly complex, and some of the mechanics were never fully explained. I never figured out how to tell the difference between a one-handed and a two-handed weapon except by equipping it, and I'm still not sure why weapons were divided up into heavy and light. I don't need a lot of hand-holding or a huge tutorial, but as far I can tell, this info wasn't available for me to see anywhere at all. It sucks having to buy a weapon just to see if my character can use it with his shield, then having to sell it back at a loss when it turns out it's two-handed. Maybe I missed something. Finally, I encountered a bug that would cause combat to freeze periodcially. It didn't happen every combat, but several of the bigger ones I had to keep reloading and replaying, which was really tedious. It's a known issue, but a fix doesn't seem to be forthcoming. I really, really, wish they had fleshed this game out a little more. There was so much promise and if they could have polished it a bit more and made sure that the player's choices had more of an impact on the game world, it would have equaled or even surpassed its ""spiritual"" predecessor.

												This is a difficult game to recommend or not recommend.  I'll start off by prefacing: don't buy the game if you expect something on the level of PS:T or BG1-2. It doesn't compare to those favorably at all.As for the actual review, there are a lot of good things going for the game. The world is extremely well developed and rich in lore. I greatly enjoyed just reading all the flavor text spread liberally throughout the game. The story, while nothing unique, is sufficient as a vehicle to get the player through the game. Best of all, the game actually means it when it says you can build any type of character and be successful at clearing the game. I fought a total of four times in the entire game. Then there are the characters, most of which have interesting back stories and designs.Unfortunately, there's a lot to dislike too. While the characters ARE interesting, they're also extremely flat. They never truly progress anywhere with the exception of one, and you only see that development at the very end for a brief moment. Then there's all the lore text: it's ♥♥♥♥ing massive, the equivalent of a hefty novel all on it's own. The combat system is hit or miss, as well, though credit is due to the game as it does allow you to talk your way through even combats. The ending is also unbelievably boring, just a brief conversation at the very end with a generic ""This is what happened after..."" slideshow for the epilogue.I think the worst of it all, however, is just how short the game is. I read through all the flavor text and took my time doing all the quests available and I still finished the game in less than 25 hours. Admittedly, I'm a quick reader, but that's pretty pathetic for a 45 dollar RPG. There's not much replay value to it either, as despite what it says your choices don't actually affect much throughout the game outside of maybe some flavor things.Overall, I'd recommend it if you can get it on sale for about 20 dollars. Otherwise, just wait for it to go on sale or see if inXile  is releasing some amazing DLC or a modding system or something.			"

												I enjoyed this game for about 10 hours before I realized that there was very little ""game"" to actually enjoy. I love reading. I read as much as I possibly can. I love RPG's. This game is incredibly, infuriatingly boring. In the 18 hours I played, there were *maybe* four battles? The world is deep and engrossing. The story? Not so much. I was too bored to even pay attention to what was supposed to be happening.I'm sad that I wasted so much money on this.			"

												I kept having this nagging suspicion that the game should have been twice as long. The pacing of content was tedious at times. The first city had dozens of quests, and thats basically why the ending areas probably felt lackluster. Whole areas were created with minimal quests, and almost no interaction between your decisions and the order of completion.This turned into a storyline where any single one of the quests could have been taken out, and you'd never of missed it.Even the core storyline felt discombobulated, all the way up to the end. Sure it had a ""loss of memory"" trope attached to it, but you could very easily see where it was all heading, even if your character avatar couldn't.In the end, the return of Isometric RPGs is a _great_ thing. This particularly isometric RPG, however, was not.I'd recommend a Pillars of Eternity or Tyrant over this title, any day of the week. Thats a shame too. I really ended up loving the universe they'd created, even if you were given only tiny glimpses of it, with limited ability to interact with it. The concept of this universe would have been better suited with an open world experience, and not constrained by the likes of an Isometric RPG. Worse, it seems as if they've set this up for a sequel or ""DLC"" content, with little if any point, story-wise, to return to this game.The big bad evil isn't a bad evil. The actual evil is dead. Buy it if you like really like RPGs; But only if you already own Pillars of Eternity or Tyrant.			"

Intro & Motivationsome people mistake the question steam reviews try to answer. it is: ""do you recommend this game?"" and while an objective recommendation -very much like an objective 'review'- is not reasonable to expect nor necessary to have anyway, i believe it's at least good sport to recommend or not based on what you have at hand, and not on what you expected.(long story short: i believe lots of people that're disappointed with their KS investment are blinded to what this game offers, making a disservice to both parties.)History of Me & T:ToNso here i am, recommending a game that i actually backed during KS and then didn't follow development progress at all. (i'm kind of busy anyway, no time to worry about games that are not out yet.) so i installed the game, a bit surprised that it's out already (turns out it was 2 years late. oh well), and curious to find out if they could convert me back to numenera (played some tabletop rpg of it, wasn't exactly our cup of tea) but wait! why did i even back it on KS in the first place, you should ask! was it because of my everlasting love for planescape torment? or did i want to go back to isometric cRPGs like it was 90's again? or did i simply buy into hype? (well, my complete disinterest in development tells otherwise) turns out there are more reasons: back then i was getting back into tabletop RPG scene, was curious to find out what monte cook was doing, hence my interest in numenera. i also might have been interested in a modern take in isometric RPGs, taken in by nostalgia of things that never was. you see, i was not much of a gamer when originals (baldur's gate's, planecape and others) shook the market. so i have secondhand memories of those times, and wanted to try it for myself, i suppose.Review/Recommendation ItselfEventhough I gave a ""thumbs up"", the most I can do is try to convey what this game offers (to the best of my understanding. keep in mind that i'm nowhere near close to completing the game, even with 23 hours played) and let you decide, since you alone know what you expect from any game.this game is some sort of a tour guide in a science-fantasy museum that we call the ninth world. visiting a museum makes you feel wonder towards the cultural excellence at display (and you can go deeper and marvel at technical excellence that makes it possible for such a collection to be available to you to admire) but once you visit every hall and some hidden corridors, ogle every painting and sculpture, and read their history, ponder what the artist tried to convey... then you leave, and museum does not stay with you. writing this review, i'm now fully expecting to not have a lasting impact once i'm done playing the game. (not impression. my impression will remain) of course this is a beautiful game the way i see it, and i expect to 'visit the museum' a couple of times in the future, to try and experience it from a different angle. but this is not a captivating novel. we don't follow story of some interesting character in interesting times, we won't turn the last page and say ""this will stay with me for a life time, and i'm different person for it"" (going back to museum analogy: yes, museums change people too, but not on a personal level)now, i will not try to make excuses for inXile. first, being a museum and not a novel is not a bad thing. second, they chose it and i'm just trying to show you what this game is offering. i will, however, try to offer explanations to as why this may be the case:1) cRPGs face a difficult dilemma: you have a singular software, but true to its name, you want every single player to ""role play"", and experience their own story. isometric cRPGs, where you control a party of 4 characters, have it even further: you now need your player to have emotional connection with every one of those 4 characters! unlikely, if not impossible2) developers could have had lots of stories to tell, so instead of making main character deeply connected to the setting, they could have chosen a more middle-ground approach.whatever the reason, that is the case: main character, the last castoff, is not a real character, but just our avatar walking through the museum. honestly, first explanation i offered is also why i didn't expect to get connected to the last castoff anyway (geralt from witcher, for example, also starts as a blank slate, but quickly gets filled as a character, hence is easier to connect to)in other words, this game is a walking simulator. if this term unnerves you, my guess is you wouldn't have liked it in the first place.Minor(?) Complaintsthese complaints are about numenera system than its implementation in the game.but the combat is simply not good. anyone familiar enough with D&D rules can get the general feeling: combat is good, because there are lots of options for player expression and creativity. hell, it's even possible to consider it as its own board game. this game, on the other hand, tries to change things a little bit, by giving you an expandable pool of resources that you choose to spend or not before the dice is rolled(traditional D&D method was this: roll the dice, add your [static] bonuses, check if you've crossed the boundary or not. modern numenera method is this: add your [variable] bonuses, roll the dice, check if you've crossed the boundary or not. however, this seemingly small change ends up frustrating, because a missed roll makes player regret his choice of not spending more resources, and a succesful roll  wondering if spending was necessary in the first place. and resource management gets more troublesome. well, at least T:ToN managed to implement a ""classical"" hit point system)still, not enough combat options. i'm curious to see how a more aggressive playstyle will play out, because from what i've seen so far it may end up disappointing.also, this is not my complaint but may be for others: combat is far and few between. told you, this is a walking (and more than that, reading) simulator. i am okay with it, considering how i'm not particularly happy with combat in the first place, but more because i love walking and talking and reading in this big museum.Concluding:overall, i am happy with this game and what it's trying to do. it presents a world full of wonders, interesting characters (just not the main character) and curious sidequests. surely a pleasent experience, with surely some room for improvement, but let's continue our analogy to say that it's like having terrible cafeteria in a otherwise great museum.

												Kickstarted the game since I really love Planescape: Torment.+ Interesting world: all those little stories, the atmosphere, immersion - it is there+ Combat can be skipped (suggest you do it until the bugs are fixed)- Buggy combat (and horrible UX)- Inventory and UI in general is a mess- Max lvl.. I really enjoyed the progression and wanted to see the epic abilities I will get with my new tier..aaand nothing.. you reached the lvl cap...no leveling up for you. :(- Seems like you are not encouraged to change your party members - only active party members gain exp. - Ugly character and no customization - Ending.. hard to describe..just ""meh"" I guess. If PLanescape:Torment is 10/10 then I feel like Tides of Numenera is 4/10. I would suggest waiting for a sale and some updates maybe.			"

												My thoughts on the game...I'm an original backer and somewhat of a casual gamer. This is my very first review here on steam. I'll try and keep it short.I had high expectations on this game back when it was first kickstarted because 1. it was a crpg (akin to old school crpg's) and 2. the world of Numenera they were trying to create seemed very very interesting to me. Sadly, the game dissapointed me. It's just a very boring game to play; the npc's are uniteresting, combat is awful, and the main quest inlcuding most side quests are unexciting and shallow. The biggest dissapointment for me however was that the world in- game was far far from what i'd imagined. The world of numenera was suppose to be this mysterious, cool and futuristic place full of wonder and awe. The only place that acheived that was the Bloom IMO.Now, i know this game was suppose to be a spiritual successor to Planescape Torment, however i've never played that game so i can't speak on how well it stacks up to it, but as it stands now T:ToN is a very below average game. Not great not horrible. If i had to give it a rating it would be a 6/10. It's not worth $45 so if you want to play it i would wait until its on sale.   "

												first of all, this is not planescape, and comparing numenera with planescape is simply stupid, they are two different games, but you can feel part of planescape in numenera, and that what devs promised us. so i dont get all this bad reviews based on comparison.i have finished game and it was great, story is major part of this game and it is fantastic. i really enjoyed each quest in numenera. it has a lot of text walls, imagine something on you own, kind of interactive books you know. always enjoyed it in Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale etc. and even now. but if you want to playe rpg with fast action, it is not for you. as i said game has great story, the 9th world is phenomenal, locations are designed by people who understand what numenera is or planescape was and you can find that feeling everywhere. about turn system. its not bad at all, it is quite nice, skills are well designed, i think that everything fit here. but what i want from this game and what i expected was a story. everything else is made well, they didnt break anything. sure that i wish devs didnt cut so many things from game, but if they made that for greater good of game, they made a good call. remember it is not placescape, and if you free your mind from that idea, you will start enjoy this game as you will focus on game itself and what it has, not what is missing. i would give 9/10 for Tides of Numenera.

												Unfortunately I have not played the original Torment: Planetscape. However, I do have limited insight into this game as a lover of RPG games and such. First, the most obvious problem was the lack of character customization, though there is a detailed description of your character, you can't change anything about it, no options for customization other than gender. The next thing I noticed is the writing, which is good, and too verbose, too wordy. Someone else mentioned that it is writing for writing's sake and that is apt. For excellent writing that conveys meaning and evokes a response I look to Pillars of Eternity. The writing in Torment: Tides feels too clunky, forced, as if it might be trying too hard to impress, whereas in Pillars of Eternity, the writing is crisp, concise, and utterly effective. Also, Baulder's Gate series is a good example of excellent writing.So, unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Frustrating. Can't compelte some quests, due to bugs. Go back, trey again. Still no luck. Sometimes it just ignores completed tasks, sometimes gameplay just freezes and I have to force quit the game to get out. I purchased this game on Nvidia Shield, and it was completely unplayable. It also came with PC key, so I tried that. Playable, but with the aforementioned issues. As far as I can tell, this thing should still be in alpha testing. Who does nobody seem to finish games anymore, but still figure they can still charge full price for them? I can tolerate a few bugs here and there, but this is rediculous. Wasted several hours retrying quests, relaunching the game, searching forums for solutions, verifying data integrity, etc. That's not the kind of game I like to play. I will be inquiriung about a refund.			"

												This game is just so incredibly boring. Some people have said this game is short with 40-70 hours in it. I played for 4 Hours and only fought twice. You run around so much with no indication of where to go, and you have to read everything to have an understanding. There are rarely any map markers, and no big map at all. So the best way to play this game is to get out of notepad and take notes in conversations so you can remember where things are and how to do them, as your quest log won't tell you, the map won't tell you and there are no visual indicators.Enjoy spending 3 hours getting to a fight, and when you are there realise that there was no indication of how to prepare for the fight, the level of the monster, and then get butt wrecked by the 15 on 3 fight, where everyone takes a very slow turn, and every fight can be and hour or more long.I can't immerse myself in watching paint dry. I played the entire of Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny and enjoyed both, same engine; better design.			"

Early Access Review
								This game, even though it's only Early Access at the moment and I've only logged about a dozen hours, has been the best buy and greatest gaming experience I've had in nearly twenty years. I was on the fence about it for many weeks. I played the original Torment twenty years ago *in fact I still have the game on CD-ROM in the original flip-out packaging* and was very impressed by it but it was never one of my all time favorites because it wasn't Turn-based combat. And so finally someone got it RIGHT! TToN is a delight for anyone who enjoys substance and depth over Gear scores and Tier-raiding. This wonderful masterpiece is NOT SUITABLE FOR ANYONE WHO:1.Hates to read2.Needs combat every eight minutes or they start licking the wallpaper3.PvP Nazi's; MMO-morons; Macro-blasting Multiboxing Gear-Geeks; Thinks FPS is the metric for joy and self worth.For the rest of us, this is one of those rare games that you lock yourself away with and wish the night was twelve hours longer so you could go even further, solve this newest quest, explore that new area that you just found the entrance. One of those games that you gasp out loud when you realize something or that sits on top of your imagination and sprinkles motes of introspective wonder on to you and leads you to extroverted gasps of surprise when a key plot point clicks into place and half a dozen things all make sense at once and the World gets a full shade richer.Bravo sirs and madams at InXile! And may I humbly ask you for more, more a thousand times More! I await launch day like few days before.			"

Early Access Review
								i picked it up right after it went on early access, even though i thougt it might have been a little overpriced but im a big fan of everything rpg, right from baldurs gate to planescape, so i thought why not?I was so disapointed, the story felt clunky and the game mechanics where just bad, same with the UI. But i gave it another spin recently because i was bored and the reviews where consistently good. And it felt like a new game, i was sucked in after 15 min.Many games either gives you black and white ways to play your characther or try to blur the lines to the extent that you dont really get to nuance you hero (or antihero) in the way you want. Tides of Numenera somehow manages to blur the lines on your choices to the point where you can really agonize over one decision for the longest time, while still giving you the ability too really feel like your making the protagonist yours. I haven't fully enyoed an rpg like this since dragon age origins, and i only tried the beta. I can't wait for the full relase.			"

												My only regret is that I tried to play this longer than I should so now I cannot refund it. After 4 hours in, I realized, I do not care about literally anything in it. The dialogues feel forced, all my companions are shallow and I cannot connect with the world. From what I read so far I feel that finishing this will not make me any happier. The combat seems to be nonexistent. Do not get me wrong I am great fan of dialogue based story rich things, but combat generates suspense and this one just lacks it. Reading through some reviews I also want to highlight that comparing this to torment is completely justfied as the creators themselves wanted to be compared to it. Well they must not be happy, because this one does not even remotely come close. Next time when they want to write an interesting story they should think about writing: interesing characters, a protagonist that you care about, a world that you can connect with, a nice atmosphere. This game lacks all of these. Instead it has forced philosophy in literally everything, a world that you cannot connect with, thousands of characters that you do not care and forget about.

Early Access Review
								To me, the Ninth World is the most fascinating setting in recent years. I can see that Inxile has made great efforts to introduce players to this wierd Science-Fantasy world but Inxile still have a long way to go before this game is compeltely playable. Even after several patches have been released, the game is still quite glitchy, frame rate is unsatisfactory comparing to PoE which was developed with the same engine and it's UI is relatively ugly too: (. What I said does not mean that this game is good-fo-nothing.Instead, i'm still confident about the quality of full-edition. In my 10+ hours of gameplay, I found this game extremely rich in content, even the first city worth 10 hours of exploring (Since I'm not a native speaker of English, others may spend less time than me). BGMs quite make sense and stirred up my memory of the classic PS:T, that made me thought ""WOW, this game is really the successor of Torment"". I hope inxile could keep their pace in later gameplay and put more emphasis on optimizing, hopefully it could be the rebirth of Torment.			"

												Tides of Numenera succeeds in capturing the elusive magic of its acknowledged predecessor, the excellent Planescape: Torment. It has that same mysterious feeling of being a stranger in a strange land, interacting with odd terrors and great wonders. I'd highly recommend it for any fan of Torment.If you're on the fence, I will say it isn't perfect. If you're a hardcore tactical combat afficionado, this game's unlikely to scratch your itch; this game's more of a story-telling experience than a tough combat challenge. In a lot of the crises (the game's term for 'key situations, often involving combat') there can be a lot of NPC creatures running about, and it can get dull waiting for each of them to take their turn while you sit there and whistle. I found the game did also slow a little in some of the encounters with very large numbers of combatants, which just made it all drag on a bit longer.  Finally, the game itself isn't incredibly long - I finished it in 20 hours and was scouring the locations for sidequests as I went. Some people might think that's 'too short' for an RPG, but I would contend that it's partly because there's no filler content at all, no random encounters of any kind. Everything you do, you do for a purpose, and that gives it a wonderful purity of intent. Overall I enjoyed this game more than any for years and I could barely put it down. It's a really great experience if you're looking for something a bit slower-paced, with excellent writing and an air of wonder.			"

												Though billed as a crpg, this game is no Divinity: Original Sin or Pillars of Eternity or even Wastelands 2. Combat is both shallow and heavily discouraged by the game which desperately wants you to find noncombat solutions to all fights. Character customization comes with dozens of abilites, most of which are useless (there are five weapons skills only used in combat) and others so useful it's a mistake not to take them (mind reading adds important insight throughout the entire game).Without combat or character choices, what is left is essentially a combination visual novel and CYOA.How much you enjoy this game will almost entirely depend on how much you enjoy reading the game's endless purple prose. What little story there is exists as an excuse to take a lengthy tour of the world of Numenera. A world where short descriptions do not exist and every adjective comes with three friends.The original Planescape:Torment found time to tell stories small and large about all its characters, explicitly subverting the themes of classic fantasy and creating a kind of fantasy noir. Numenera on the other hand finds itself hard pressed to tell a story about any character; npcs, villains, and the protagonist find themselves a distant second to the breathless delivery of endless *lore*.If you'd rather read a sourcebook than a story, this game is for you. Otherwise, go play one of the many other flawed but far more lovable CRPGs out there. "

												I would love to recommend the game but in it's current state I simply can't. Firstly the good points:+ Incredible world building and atmosphere+ Excellent writing+ Interesting storyline and companions (so far)+ Fairly nice graphics and soundHighly recommended, yes? Well it would be, if not for the bugs. The game crashes frequently. I 'died' during one quest battle, came back and completed it; spoke to the quest- giver and it forced me into the battle again - the game simply refused to acknowledge the completion of the quest.Multiple UI errors: occasionally dialogue text won't scroll correctly meaning it is impossible to click on any dialogue options or continue until you manually scroll the text box. Very annoying.After gaining a certain ability a sound plays whch signals the activation of that ability. The sound is supposed to be temporary. However, when an area is transitioned the sound plays constantly in the background, saving and re-loading doesn't fix this. This is incredibly off-putting and has caused me to stop playing for the short term.Luckily, the developers know about most, if not all of these bugs, so hopefully a patch is incoming. In short, great game with great potential, but could have done with a few more weeks in play-testing to iron out the issues.			"

Early Access Review
								As a big fan of the old Torment and also the Baldur's Gate & Icewind Dale franchise this game turned out exactly to be what I was looking for when I backed the kickstarter. It's lore- and story-rich, has enjoyable side-quest, an interesting setting, interesting mechanics (I don't know about the tides yet just after finishing the beta but I am looking forward to finding out more. I liked the ""Effort""-system quite a lot where you get to influence your surroundings and conversations by spending effort-points that refill after resting. Quite often I chose the option not to fight when viable but rather use cunning - although the combat system seems solid. So far, I haven't found anything I dislike about the game - maybe the party size of 4 persons. The (possible) companions I've encountered so far (6 if I have counted correctly) were all very intriguing and had interesting backstorys or quests hinted at. Oh, and, at least for beta, the rebinding of shortcuts did not really work for me, it kept the old shortcuts active and triggered the action (e.g. quick saving) when rebinding the key to the new key and also allowed for a key to be bound to multiple actions but maybe that is a bug still to be fixed in the final release. Looking very much forward to the 28th, only a few more days!			"

												The real problem with reviewing games that share aspects of the great games from the past, is that it is very difficult to judge them based on thier own merits. Its very easy to make comparisons and forget that ultimately, no matter how similar a game is to its forefathers it still has to stand on its. This is further compounded by the expectations and anticipations built up using a kickstarter.I helped fund this game via kickstarter 3 years ago. I read all of the updates, but didnt really play much of the beta. I ask myself a very simple question when I play these game. Am I having fun? For Torment, that answer is absolutely ""Yes"". Therefore I recommend that you play it. The environments, atmosphere, and story are all top notch. If reading isnt your thing, wait for it to go on sale before you buy it, but give it a chance. Would i have liked to see more NPC's? Yes. Is combat the weakest aspect of the game? Yes. Is it better than Planescape? No! (Dude, seriously, Planescape is amazing, looking back through the nostagia filter, Planescape shines brightest of all). But in no way is does Torment feel incomplete. rushed, or even inadequate. This is well crafted game, that runs smoothly on my 4 year old laptop  (GEFORCE 840M For the Win!).I truly enjoy playing this game. "

												What a wonderful story!I sincerely enjoyed every moment of this game and discovering a number of the mysteries it held.Interestingly enough, while I felt that Tyranny was too short at 36 hours, Torment was completely the opposite for me! The story, the discovery, and the resolution were of the perfect length and I am completely satisfied with my experience.If you liked the original Planescape: Torment, I suspect you will also really enjoy Torment: Tides of Numenera.

												Don't buy this game.The early access, while an overall poor experience, worked for me.  Now that the game has been fully released, it crashes whenever I try to play it.  Meanwhile, I have no problem playing any other games, on Steam or otherwise.  This game has been riddled with bugs since early access, and it doesn't seem to be any better now.The real-time-with-pause action that was promised was replaced with turn-based.  Why?  Because turn-based action works better for consoles, and the studio wanted to market the game to console players, rather than to the PC community alone.  Nevermind that its the PC community that originally played Planescape: Torment, and therefore its the PC community that they should have been working to please.  All that one need know is that the studio wanted more money, so they butchered their combat system in order to make it easier on themselves.I can't refund the game, so its cash down the drain for me.  That'll teach me to buy into an early access game - lesson learned.			"

												I had to weigh in on this when I saw inXile begging for positive reviews and cherrypicking their feedback. They are playing themselves up more than they have a right to. The game is unfinished. It never met its promised baseline goals despite getting the money they asked for and more. It is not a ""true CRPG,"" as they claim. It's a ""choose your own adventure"" / visual novel with most of what's going on existing only in words and not visuals... It just screams ""low budget"" and they had over $4M to do it. Seems like they spent it all on $10 words and purple prose. More kickstarter tripe... My full review is pending, because I still intend to finish this game. I'm a writer, so while I don't personally regret backing this game (some of the concepts they toy with are interesting enough), I just can't recommend it to people looking for a real CRPG. I'd send them over to Pillars of Eternity instead (by Obsidian). inXile has a history of releasing abandonware and half-baked games, like Wasteland 2, which still has lots of bugs, glaring balance issues, and just isn't fun to play, even after the Director's Cut was released. Over the past year, they haven't released any patches for it whatsoever... I'm not confident that this game will improve much with patches. By contrast, Pillars was refined and polished over a series of patches until it became quite an impressive addition to the CRPG legacy.			"

												Uhh... that's rather hard recommendation to give but I'm gonna recommend it despite the fact that this game is very much flawed - and that's recommendation only for people that already played Planescape: Torment. If you didn't - go play it now and if you like it and want more of it then consider Tides of Numenera.Why? Because Tides of Numenera is fundamentally an echo, imitation ... a castoff of true masterpiece. It has similar themes, similar structure, protagonist in similar situation and even some similar weaknesses (combat is weakest part of both games), but its just not as good. You can say that is what we wanted: another Torment, but at the same time I feel like this game could be quite a lot better if it would told its own story, something new, different and weird, something unique.So what worked and what didn't? Setting - both Planescape and Numenera are weird, but weird in very good way, both are colorful and exotic but also dark, twisted and cruel when they need to. So while I feel that Planescape with stronger focus on beliefs and philosophies is better of two, both settings are great.Cities - both games are very much city-centric and cities in Tides are just as great as Sigil. Definitely best part of this game is exploring Cliffs and Bloom (especially Bloom), talking to their inhabitants and solving their problems. Story - just as I wrote earlier  Tides of Numenera tries hard to tell similar story to PT instead of creating something unique. Effects are well... serviceable, but I doubt I will even remember it in few months. Thankfully side quests and conversations were well written and generally interesting.Companions - while I rather liked all companions i traveled with they are rather uninspired... I'mean you have that wonderfully weird settings and all of the companions are human? Why? PT gave us flying skull, succubus-turn-good, walking suit of armor and other just as unique personas... why in Tides we don't travel in company of mutants, sentient machines or otherworldy creatures with utterly alien perspectives on current events? Combat - combat was weak in PT... its actually even worse in Tides - at least  as mage in PT you have tons of interesting spells, most powerful of which even had their own pre-rendered cut-scenes. Here your abilities are boring, your opponents are boring and stupid, strategical depth is non-existent, everything is way too easy (and there is no difficulty setting) unless you are outnumbered and your opponents will be first in initiative and straight up murders half of your party before your first move. Its probably worst combat I've seen in any cRPG (with exception of some really low budget indie).Graphic - character models and effects (i.e. spells) are poor, backgrounds... some are quite good, some lack polish, few are weak. I don't want to compare Tides and PT because of age difference - so instead I'm going to say that Tides looks little worse than Pillars of Eternity or Tyranny, but still good enough.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is still in early access and but i can see potentilal in it. Torment: Tides of Numenera definetely captures the atmospehre and aestehtics of Torment: Panescape. At first i wasn't sure if the setting should be Earth in billion years of the future, but i can see that it allows creatures and npc-s that might not fit thematically in other setting. Like sentient robots instead of demons and flying skulls.I would definetely recommend anyone, who has played Torment:Planescape and  wants to play another an old 90-style RPG, to play Tides of numenera.

												This game is disappointing. It isn't bad, but every step seems like it was abandoned half-way. The tidal system, consequences, even combat all seem like there were great ideas that fall short. This is apart from the dozens of oversights that should've been caught during the years this was in pre-production and early access. There is no zoom except the mousewheel, there are constant effects on characters that cause both visual and audio distractions, including during conversations, and other things that were mentioned during early access and left unaddressed. After all the money and all the time, the project still seems, at best, half finished, and is clogged with great ideas that sputter out, forgotten. If the interface problems are repaired, it would be a good game. What's sad is how close it was to a great game, but as it stands, it was ambitious, but it failed to deliver. I can't recommend it in this state.			"

												I really wanted to love this game, I really, really did.  I backed the game way back when, I looked forward to and devoured all the developer updates, I genuinely was entrharalled to feel such a part of the creative process.  On release day, I dove in and...lost interest pretty quickly.  The world looks gorgeous, the setting is weird and cool, the characters are 'fairly' intertesting, the combat is wretched.  The lore is interesting, but word count is not indicative of quality.  I really do love InExile, and while they are one of the developers carrying the banner for my beloved CRPGs, I just cannot recommend a game that, like their two previous releases, lost my interestest  and lost my goodwill benefit-of-the-doubt within just a few hours.I'm still backing Wasteland 3, please please please deliver on that one.  I still love you guys, I hope you realize soon that rich lore can't outweigh sub-par gameplay anymore.			"

												Disappointingly short. You can spot the moment when the money ran out. Supposedly the game is all about choices and consequences, but in fact the player is constantly railroaded, probably because the devs didn't have the resources to make the game world as reactive as it should have been. Half the game's cool wierd items don't even *do* anything. Unrealized bits of the plot are patched over with lame Choose-Your-Own-Adventure interludes. ""Press X to climb over wall of text"". All the sophomoric fantasy blither would be excusable if Torment were a large game, but it feels a bit like a glorified demo. What a shame.			"

												Pros:* While I'm not personally familiar with the table-top implementation, the Numenera world is pretty captivating and unusual in its portrayal of life among magitech ruins. The very purposeful sci-fantasy is, to my knowledge, a bit of a neglected one in video games, and there's a lot of wonder to be had here.* Not only is there very minimal combat (an exceptionally bold move given what most people think of as a defining element of CRPGs), but its implemented via a slightly abstracted 'Crisis' system that is used to cover non-violent but time critical scenarios as well, ranging from intervention in a rapidly degenerating diplomatic situation to conducting a heist. I am delighted to see an attempt to include and mechanize these more unusual sorts of situations that come up so often in table-top, but have been so often neglected in digital formats.* The core mechanics work very well in the early game. The world appears to change a bit with each rest you take, and so there's some incentive to avoid the infamous Five Minute Adventuring Day, trying to push your limited daily Efforts as hard as they can go. The push-your-luck core mechanic works well here, and it was the most engaged I've ever been in CRPG gameplay outside of combat and story.Cons:* At the end of the day, the writing and main plot just didn't work for me. It felt frequently overwrought, extremely awkwardly paced, and I just failed to develop an emotional attachment to any of the characters or situations. I'm the target audience for very wordy games, and even I found myself pretty bored and just wanting to skim through a lot of it eventually. More than anything else, this is damning.* While the early Sagus areas are fantastic, past this point it feels like the game got punched in the gut with the ""ran out of money"" effect harder than I've seen in any other CRPG. A lot of what's left feels like it was cobbled together from disjoint cut content. The second Hub area feels so much more by rote than the curiosity filled playground that was the first.* The abstract Crisis system just isn't very *good*; the combat encounters, in particular, just feel awkward and obligatory more than they are tense, tactical, or fun. Half the time they don't even matter anyway, to the immortal protagonist; on several occasions I died, only to find myself waking up such that I'd somehow bypassed what the encounter was guarding!* The dynamism of the game world due to resting ultimately proves to be very minimal, and sensations of urgency quickly recede. This is made all the more the case that as characters progress and specialize, the Edge mechanic ensures that they need invest less and less into tasks, where by the last third of the game even the most challenging tasks can be trivially accomplished at no cost whatsoever. My characters felt like they'd pretty much broken the entire system over their knee.* Despite the above, the game is full of mechanical traps. The gameplay and story extremely heavily emphasize the intellectual and social, which makes the fighter-type character class a total misfire; they excel only at the *maybe* the 8-12 violent encounters throughout the game, and even the rogue-type is better for all other non-combat purposes. Within the classes, little thought seems to have gone into anything like balance, with some abilities clearly orders of magnitude more useful than others.* The game's ending is, unfortunately, in the Ending-O-Tron format. Hardly a damning sin by itself, but I apparently chose the wrong answer, and rather than getting anything like an epilogue or denounement... I got a game over screen. Not even an achievement. As the final taste of the game, it left me sour that apparently they included the wrong answer as an option.* I was a Kickstarter backer, and there was a lot of content slashed and stretch goals walked back. I work in software, I know how it goes and I understand how that happens, particularly with the marketing frenzy that are Kickstarters. What is significantly less cool to me is that these changes were announced to backers only a month prior to release, far far after such choices would have been committed to. Given that level of communication and transparency, I do not expect to back another inXile title.Unfortunately, despite initially being greatly enamored with the game and even recommending it to friends, by the end the holes had begun to show in force. Ultimately, despite some high hopes, this title is a disappointing and unsatisfying experience, that was managed in a manner that I find unpalatable.			"

												When i bought this game i was excited, i had waited for some time for it to be released.I remember the old planescape torment, and while it wasn't THE best game out there i did enjoy it and found the story to be intriguing.The same cannot be said for this game, while it seems a vast and lifelike game, i quickly realized that the game isn't actually that big, the areas are anything but lifelike, and it feels....""unfinished"".Like it was supposed to be something better, something  bigger  but they ran out of time.The companions you get in the game seem very interesting, but after exhausting their initial dialogue offer very little besides that, all the items in the game have interesting uses and history, but on the other hand you find hardly any variety in armors or weapons.In fact there are only 6 light armors in the game, and they look  incredibly, hideously   UGLY For me, wearing armor that suits the look of the main character is important, i don't want to run around in shiny silver spandex shooting energy bolts at enemies.I could use heavy armor on my nano, but the penalties for that are quite staggering.The combat is nice, although primitive, most fights can be won other ways than fighting, you can avoid some fights alltogether by talking your way out.I was expecting a diamond in the rough like pillars of eternity, but instead i'm left with a zirconia, it's nice to look at, but it's not the same thing.EDIT: Forgot to add about all the game breaking bugs in the game, a few times i've had to kill the game from the task manager because it went completely unresponsive during a crisis (combat) and a few other times when something was supposed to happen during a cutscene, but instead nothing happened and the game was stuck endlessly in that cutscene.EDIT:To be fair, after completing this game, the story is the stuff of legends, whoever made the dialogue and made up the story and the lore is a keeper, he or she made some really good stories.  Unlike some developers nowadays *cough* *Bioware!* *cough*The execution of the game fell short and the game felt like it was missing something, the story itself almost makes this a positive review.... almost.

												A game so steeped in it's own lore and import that it flows from wall of text to wall of text and disappears up it's own pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥.I bought this after Alec recommended it on Rock Paper Shotgun.Now I find myself hate-playing it just to try and get my money's worth from it.The combat is AWFUL. Just... AWFUL.Thankfully combat can be avoided at almost every turn.There are mechanics (like Tides) that the game vaguely references now and then, but 17 hours in, they haven't been actually used as far as I can tell.The inventory system just lumps everything together in one space, no ability to sort it by type, price, etc.The UI is funcitonal if not cluttered.A lot of the mod cons of questing icons and journals don't exist in this game. The quests are varied though, I'll give it that.And somewhat infuriatingly, every decision the player makes may as well be a random outcome generator for all the feedback you get. If you go to touch some slime on the ground it could either permanently boost your stats or kill you. But you won't know which until you give it a go!You character is a faceless gordon-freeman type with all the charisma and reason to care about as some gum stuck to a public bus stop.If you enjoy reading, get a book.If you're after a rewarding game, seriously consider playing anything else.I may append my review once I've finished hate-playing this drek. In the meantime though I'm going to make sure I ignore every recommendation Alec makes.			"

												This game doesn't fail on a mechanical level, it's competent and offers a paint by numbers isometric RPG experience identical to the Baldur's Gate 1 + 2, Icewind Dale 1 + 2, Pillars of Eternity, and Tyranny. What it is not, is an adequate imitation of Planescape: Torment.The superficials are there, with walls of text and colorful characters, and the sheer strangeness. But the strangeness is hollow, the intelligence behind the strangeness of Planescape is missing.Party members have their one obligatory side quest that places their fate in the player's hands, but there is nothing about them to discover. A high intellect will not unlock any new conversations, change one's outlook on a character, or change the nature of the game.There is no Circle of Zerthimon. There is a Bronze Sphere, but unlike the original, which carried with it untold lifetimes of experience, this one summons allies, and is bugged. The piles of strange items in the game will not have any use outside of being worth cash. The point I lost hope for the game getting better was when I sold off all the ""Oddities"" in my inventory because I needed cash to install Wolverine claws on my character.The main character, from the model to the equipment is ugly. It looks like a default Poser model. During the beta, I thought it was a placeholder. The fact that it's made it into the final product is indicative of the standards that TToN set for itself.The game is not broken, it will not induce rage or fury, it simply exists. We are all mortal however, and anyone who played  any two of the above mentioned games, or played Planescape: Torment, will find nothing new here, and will be ~20 hours of their life poorer.Anyone who has not played previous Obsidian or InXile games will find an inoffensive experience, but is better off waiting for a sale.

												Shallow game in every aspect: story, characters, quests, world, possible actions and interactions, locations, animations, backgrounds, leveling up and combat. Lacks almost everything that was promised and therefore expected. Too much text without meaning. Nothing stands behind a story, and nothing encourages you to explore the world. No depth. No great questions raised. Everything is simply flat, and you are constantly forced to basically do two things: read and take exacly the same actions against any NPC you encounter. Heavily bugged. Sometimes looks like it was not even beta-tested. It absolutely has nothing in common with the old Torment and among BG, BG2, IWD, IWD2, Torment and PoE, Tides of Numenera ""shines"" as a joke. Not to mention the amount of money (4.2 million USD) that was gathered, the time (4 years) for preparations and all the people out there in the world, who were simply and yet in a sophisticated way, deceived.This game disappoints tremendously.

												I have the advantage, that although a backer, I didn't follow Alpha and Beta. I'm about 4 hours in, and so far it feels more like the original Torment than any game I've played since.  There's a ton of lore, a really weird world (at least for me, having never played or even read Numenara) and quests seem to have multiple ways to do things.Maybe it's not the game it was supposed to be, but if you expect a spiritual successor for Torment Planescape, that is what you get. It's enjoyable as is and I don't miss stuff I didn't even know (or remember, the kickstarter being years ago) was ""supposed"" to be in it.So, if you liked Torment Planescape I'd buy it. If you didn't, I wouldn't. It's very very text heavy, not a lot of combat, it's not a typical isometric RPG.  If you're not sure, well, if you like games with tons of text, I'd say it's worth the launch price, otherwise I'd wait till it's on special.I'll add that I hated Wasteland 2 (InExile's previous game), could not get into it, but this I like. It's a different game and it really feels that way.			"

												Hardly an heir to Planescape Torment; and certainly no Baldur's Gate.  It doesn't get the gameplay basics right and its writing isn't enough to redeem that.Torment's writing is passable, though often much too long and complicated.  Few of the characters are compelling or memorable, and the setting doesn't in any way feel like a real place.  The issue here is that Torment's game mechanics are terrible, and the game has nothing but the writing to recommend it; that writing isn't good enough to do so.All of the game mechanics are BORING.  What difficulty exists largely comes from a lack of communication to the player about how certain systems work (what does this ability/skill do?  will it be useful?) and frankly antiquated and thoughtless design choices (you can't re-pick abilities; aren't you glad we didn't explain them very well?)It's 2017 and I'm really not very tolerant of long load times in order to read a paragraph of dialogue that should have been a sentence.

												This game is a fraud and I would recommend against buying it.I go back a long time with Planescape: Torment, so I was ecstatic when I learned about the kickstarter for Tides. Naturally, I became a backer of this game during the kickstarter and eagerly waited to start playing it. Having finished the first playthrough, I am sorely disappointed. Before I explain why, I'd like to point out that this game is extremely text-heavy and players who aren't prepared to spend about 80% of their time reading should avoid it regardless of the reviews being positive or negative.My main source of frustration is the fact that the devs cut the content that had been promised in the Kickstarter project. I understand that this isn't rare regarding crowdfunding, but it is a scummy, dishonest business policy and borderline fraud which would prevent me from recommending this game even were it good, and it isn't. To give credit where credit is due, the game mechanics are pretty solid. From character development to the item system,  Tides of Numenera is a streamlined, yet complex RPG. There are some improvements that could have been made, but the game is very satisfactory from a game mechanics perspective. Still, Planescape: Torment's best and most important attribute was the story, and Tides is pretty weak in that regard. Firstly, the game is very short. My playthrough was pretty thorough, yet I was finished about 30 hours in. For a game which spent so long a period in development and whose Kickstarter was considered a major success, I consider anything less than 50 hours a disappointment, and I was hoping for something like The Witcher 3, where you could easily spend 100 hours.*the rest of the review contains spoilers*Leaving behind game mechanics, I will comment on the story from the perspective of the plot, setting and the underlying philosophy.The setting is bizarre and interesting and has a proper tormentesque vibe. It is based on a tabletop roleplaying game by Monte Cook, and I will gladly take the game up if I ever return to pen and paper gaming. At times the game was a tad too bizarre for my taste, but this isn't a major minus and many people will probably like it. The plot is a good fit for the general style of the game and the setting. Although it is nothing near to being spectacular, the small amount of story this game has is pretty good. What makes the game intrinsically bad is the superficial philosophy behind it, despite several neat touches, such as the Lascar side-quests symbolizing religion. The primary question, ""What does one life matter?"", is tied to the primary story in a very loose way. One problem is the fact that this question is very wide, especially in comparison to the question posed by Planescape: Torment, ""What can change the nature of a man?"" PsT's question was interwoven in the storyline and by the time Ravel asks for your answer you have had plenty of time to seedifferent perspectives on this problem. In Numenera, the question feels forced. If we ignore wild interpretations and the places where such a wide question is inherently linked to the standard fantasy themes, it is hard to see how it relates to the primary story beyond the two times it is directly asked. Even when it is inherent in some problem which often appears in fantasy games, it doesn't seem to be significantly more developed than usual. What I felt was the main philosophical point of the story is a rather lame bioconservative eulogy of death. In very short and simple terms, The Changing God is fighting to prolong his life and The Sorrow tells you that prologing one's life inherently harms other people, so it should be stopped. I don't think that there is an ending which is further from this philosophy than the one I chose, and in my ending The Sorrow and the Last Castoff agreed not to kill any castoffs at that time, but The Sorrow forbade the creation of any further castoffs and also promised to slaughter them later on. This kind of ending is highly unsatisfying, especially as I wasn't very interested in the internal castoff-changing god issues since I perceived The Sorrow as the primary enemy. Although I could say that I am a quite radical transhuanist on the issue of death, I would be more than interested to see a nuanced bioconservative argument in this sort of a game. The problem is that the argumentation present in Numenera is quite flimsy and reductible to saying that simply living is harming other people. Even this argumentation lies on a very symbolic reading of the Tides, but without it I would be hard pressed to find one developed central philosophical argument in the entire game. In that respect, the philosophy of the game is quite under-developed even if my interpretation is lacking. Of course, I am open to the possibility that I missed something, but I feel that the philosophical background of the game is simply bad. The solid but short story and mecahincs don't compensate for this deficit in my books.tldr; Regardless of the story, I wouldn't recommend Tides of Numenera because of the dishonest business practice regarding its Kickstarter project. The setting is great and the story and mechanics of the game are reasonably sound, although the story is very short. But the philosophical background, which is crucial for a Torment game, is lacking and that makes the entire game unsatisfying. Despite the negative review, the story and especially the setting are interesting enough to potentially be of interest if you could get the game at a significant discount, for something like 10-15$.

												This game goes full retard. Its too much fantasy for me. This amount of fantasy, i lose my touch with reality. If anyone watched the movie tropic thunder there was an awesome dialogue there. Kirk Lazarus: Everybody knows you never go full retard.Tugg Speedman: What do you mean?Kirk Lazarus: Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, 'Rain Man,' look retard, act retard, not retard. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic, sho'. Not retard. You know Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump.' Slow, yes. Retard, maybe. Braces on his legs. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retard. Peter Sellers, ""Being There."" Infantile, yes. Retard, no. You went full retard, man. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty handed...I have the Numenera tabletop rpg and it made no sense at all too. I was very sceptic about the campaign world technology are there but makes no sense, mystery is over exegerrated. Sometimes when you go fishing should just catch a fish. Sometimes a bartender should be just a bartender. A bar stool a bar stool, a drink just a drink. I love the original Planescape: torment. It is my favorite game. I was very enthusiastic about this game. I backed it as soon as i could. I never backed so much to any other game. I checked back to original torment again to see if im getting old? NoIt is just this game is really disappointing. Also combats are boring, i find myself im trying to avoid combat, not for roleplaying reasons, but because combat is boring and buggy as hell. Speaking of bugs. This is not an early access game, but it behaves like one. I'd definitely refund if i could. Now its too late. Let this game be a monument of how not to make a crpg.			"

												[Edit: Finished game twice. Extra thoughts at end of Review]7 hours in to my first Post-release play through. I have only had one combat, but felt that it was avoidable, and that I may have narrowly missed getting in to a few scraps. The turn based combat is good; an 'all at once brawl like other games would not have allowed the Numenera rules to translate well.It cleaves closely to the source material put out  by Monte Cook games, so if you are looking for a good adaptation of the RPG you will find it here. I am unsure if I found the game easy to get into because it was well designed and the tutorial was clear, or if it was just that I have had experience running the table top version of this.It is early in the release, but I have encounter only a few glitches. Nothing game breaking. And ultimately very minor that I expect will be cleaned up in the weeks to come. No crashes, no Framerate issues, runs like a charm.The game has a great deal of depth. Lives up to the promise of many options and solutions to different problems. I have not felt forced in to a course of action - and if anything - was a bit overwhelmed by the freedom I have had in it. I am a huge fan of the Planescape setting, and of the forebearer to this game. The game took no time in bringing back the old feelings of the origional. Where I feel I need to search out every corner, carefully read clues, and am worried about even tossing away Oddities, incase they are useful later on.If you are a fan of Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, or the original Planescape: Torment you will enjoy this. Things are well written, characters are interesting, Numenera captures that sense of bizzare and wonder that players had the first time stepping in to Sigil. I imagine I will have a great deal of fun exploring the Cliffs and other regions for some time, and I expect fans of CRPG's will feel the same.Highly recommended.[New Info]As of 1.01, the game still has some bugs. Only one of them caused me any real problems during my second play through.Having logged 50 hours in the game between two plays I stand by my statment that the game was very well done. I recommend it and as a backer I feel the main draws to the game were met.My play as a kind hearted but excited scientist yielded a much different game than my cruel monster of a character who solved things with violence. My first play was around 30 hours, the second a little more than 20. I feel that the second play had 10 hours chopped off it because I knew some tricks for some crisis that I had not known my first time, so it saved some momments. Also, second play through I wound up skipping a lot of side quest, mostly because my character was an huge selfish jerk. But there were lots of interesting twist and changes to the game because of this different play style.I am currently doing my third play through, of an appeaseing coward, to see how much of the game can be beat if I am avoiding all fighting and violence.

The number of locations is tiny, and then most of them game involves running back and forth through the same 3 maps. Really disappointed.			"

												Hello internet travelers!The new torment is a wonderful game. But I expected much more and I don't recommend it! Why? Bellow.The end confrontation/fight was ... funny at its best. The end reminded me of Guardian of the galaxy the movie. Build up build up build up and *LETS DANCE* as end fight :D No epic ending totally turned the Tides (LOL) for me.Story is great. There are choices/consequences. Athmosphere is dark mature grotesque even. But that is it. Combat (to my humble opinion) is crap. I don't mind turn based combat but in Torment: Tides of Numenera there are no tactical choices no variety enemies or encounters. Yes you can talk with your enemies, but other than that blunt and repetative. For a RPG veteran like me (who loves a good fight) it was just lame. Torment 1 had bloody animiation and films for spells! And hell lot of weapons.  Here you get few skills IF you are lucky and Itemisation is terrible. Few weapons and armors. Tons of one time use items. The game's strenght is NOT combat or cisises. Companions are OKish, not too great not too bad. But nothing memorable (again personal opinion).The main antagonist or antagonists are almost until the end with no backstory and even when directly confronted the explanation for WHY and WHO are not not enough. *I am sorrow and I am ancient and I am bad but I am bad to prevent other bad people to make bad things*Almost no voiceover! I love reading but voiceover in 2017 is a must for a game. Especially one that much anticipated.Game is 40-45 hours of playing at best. For the price of tripple A title.That are just few of the things I didn't like about Torment: Tides of Numenera.Again a wonderful game BUT a terrible successor to the first game. 6/10			"

												It's finally out. After seeing where this game was heading in early access, I believe this game deserves a thumbs up and quick first impression of the more polished final product. Will update it later.First I'd like to point out the controller support. It works great! Of course, it's not the same as a game inherently designed for a console, but considered its PC roots, it's as good as it gets, and when you get to also move your character with the thumb-stick, instead of pointing him where to go, it adds even more immersion. I was also glad to find an option for even bigger fonts, so reading all that text won't be a trouble for anyone on any supported screen.The tutorial segment was reworked to be shorter, though I didn't find it's older version as overwhelming as other people claimed, I suppose that change is quite an improvement to the pacing.The loading times improved dramatically and the game feels way more lightweight and optimized than PoE or Tyranny. People with old/low-end machines have nothing to worry about, the game works like charm on my Core2Quad, 4GB RAM, 1GB Radeon card.As for the game itself, I think it's gorgeous so far, won't go into details yet, but from what I've seen in early access build and new game I just started, the only thing that might keep it from my personal GOTY rank is botched second half or the game, and if it gets better and better, it can easily become the game of the decade!

												Not happy with the devs' choices to make the game turn based, give no option for difficulty levels, spend a large portion of their Kickstarter resources to release the game on PS4 and XBOX1 (which also comes with the consolization of certain aspects of the game), and have a sloppy-looking UI. The game isn't bad by any means and if there was a ""one thumbs up one thumbs down"" option I'd choose that, but seeing as there are a ton of short-sighted fanboys who will praise this game, no matter its faults and false promises of a ""spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment"", I think it's wise to balance out the game's score by pushing it towards a mixed score so the devs get a big hint. The game is good and if you want a well written ""choose your own adventure"", then definitely pick it up. But if you were looking for a tactical crpg which also had a well written world and story, then you will be unfortunately let down and your trust in inXile will be at an all time low. It seems that inXile don't have many true fans of the charming, challenging crpg greats (Baldur's Gate 1+2+Planescape:Torment) working for them, because they have greatly missed the mark with both this game and after seeing Wasteland 2's overt faults.

												This is the only game I've ever had refunded on Steam. To call it an RPG is a stretch, at best. It's a choose your own adventure in graphical form. The combat, on the rare occasion that it happens, is flavorless and utterly unsatisfying. The story seemed decent enough, but one has to navigate endless walls of text to get to any of it. What could be said in two sentences is instead spread over three paragraphs in two different conversation branches. I get it, there's nostalgia for the old IE games, I loved them too, but part of what made those games great was there was story AND gameplay. I WANTED this game to be good so badly. Instead, I paid $45 for a poorly illustrated graphic novel that droned on and on about mundane details.			"

Not EVERY noun needs an adjective. - Graphics are about 12 years out of date. - Combat unsatisfying- Insulting price tag- Very low amount of character personalization.- In a nutshell: Clunky. awkward, annoying and ugly.

												After the mess that was Wasteland 2,  this is another very dissapointing game from these guys, and the price tag is ridiculous for what you actually get. After 7 hours, I've had 1 combat enounter, the rest was basically reading wall after wall of text, or very long dialogues. I am a fan for story rich games, and very much enjoy those aspects, but this is way over the top. Even after reading it all, and listening to the dialogues nothing really grabed my interest. At this point I have no interest in playing any more, shame as it had potential.			"

												Honestly, even setting aside that this game fell ridiculously short of being any kind of successor to Planescape: Torment, it's still just a bad game.  There's tons of half-written stories that don't go anywhere all around you.  Tons of characters, objects, areas, etc. that are described in somewhat interesting detail, but have bland 90s era graphics ""representing"" them.  Characters that either don't feel adequately explored, or have a bland, forced, linear exploration.  Areas with random obnoxious noises firing off in the background.  And topping it all off is a combat system that's an absolute wreck.I was somewhat wary of this game after playing Wasteland 2 and it was still a major disappointment, to the point that after several attempts I'm just giving up on playing it.  Considering the way InXile has handled their kickstarters (Here's a tip, if you claim to be making a successor to a game I'm going to assume you're using similar mechanics.  If you then have a ""vote"" and it's decided to change said mechanics to something a sizible portion of the fanbase obviously doesn't want you should offer the rest of us our money back) I won't be supporting any of their other products, and will be recommending others do the same.

												I wanted to like the game a lot. And while the story and environments are very interesting, the game is essentially an interactive novel. Most of your time will be spent simply reading and exhausting all the conversation options and then reading some more to just keep the quests ticking over. Combat is turn-based and can be a chore when fighting a lot of enemies at once as you wait for all the AI moves to complete. I've played as a Nano (wizard) and the abilities are so underwhelming. There's very little sense of progression with levelling up bar maybe some tasks becoming easier, if not much more interesting. The mechanics of spending points on certain tasks to ensure success doesn't offer much anticipation of levelling like other RPGs do with tangible increases to your character's stats and abilities. I was a huge fan of all the old-school isometric RPGs and thoroughly enjoyed the recent Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, but Torment Tides of Numenera is a hugely different experience. It's an experience I'm finding increasingly difficult to see through to the end.			"

They've given me a good number of quests, which are also solved by walking around and talking to the same NPCs over and over until you get new dialogue options.  Not to mention with skills linked to persuasion/deception you can simply talk your way out of any situation.			"

Early Access Review
								At their best, video games are interactive stories. They allow us to participate and meaningfully change things, not just observe the narrative. Some games rise above the rest in this regard.Torment: Tides of Numenera may be the best I've ever seen.Some of you like running and gunning FPS titles. This isn't one. If you're an MMO player who follows the map arrows and never reads why you're tasked to do what you're doing, this game may not be for you.If you love a well written story and want to immerse yourself - and immerse is the right word - in a mysterious world with exquisitely written, branching choices with real impact? You have come to the right place. Where careful reading of the text matters. Where there are no map arrows telling you where to go or what to do with a linear, chain of breadcrumbs quest. Instead, you're rewarded for paying attention. From logic puzzles to not even a single ""kill X, pick up Y"" quest to the stupendous writing that draws you further and further into the Ninth World, this game amazes.At time of writing, this is an Early Access beta title with only the first city playable. There are a few broken side quests and a couple bugs, which you're warned about up front. They're putting the final polish on the rest of the title over the next ~7 months. Take negative reviews mentioning performance or bugs with a heaping pile of salt, because those are disclosed up front and won't be there on release. Simply put, I can't wait.			"

												I wanted to love this game. I loved Planescape: Torment. I wasn't going in to this expecting it to BE Planescape: Torment, but I did hope to go in thinking it would be better than this. When I first found myself disliking parts of it, I thought it might be nostalgia, but upon careful consideration, it simply has a number of flaws I can't overlook.My first major problem? It feels like it cut off about 2/3 of the game. We were just starting to see things tie together, but the game suddenly just outright explains everything to you and begins the trek to the endingtron 3000. Thanks, Tides, I was getting interested there for a moment.Storywise, it's okay, if heavyhanded. I hate saying it's just okay: there are a few flashes of brilliance, where someone obviously took a lot of time and effort to craft something. But these are few and far between. There are only so many ways you can say, ""Look at this thing that was made by an ancient civilization. You don't understand it. You can interact with it a few times. Move along now."" That's a trick you can pull a few times, but if you're going to do it with every interaction, you need to at least do it in a different way. The underlying question is something strongly undercut by not seeing the outcomes of your choices.Companions. There's Rhin and there's everyone else. The others didn't engage me at all. Two are vaguely interesting conceptually, but so little is done with them that you might as well have had self-generated characters. Rhin, on the other hand, is well done. She's a little girl that got lost from another world, with only part of her memories, and is being treated as a slave when you arrive. By little girl, I mean, she's an 11-year-old with no character class. She's not some psychic powerhouse, she's the weakest character in the party. She essentially makes your 4-person party into 3 people. She's also the only character that feels like she has an arc at all. She has several different paths through the game, all of them are bittersweet, and if you don't think so, you are wrong, have a broken emotion machine and bad opinions, you emotionless husk.Mechanics: You'd best be here as a sightseer, because otherwise the game fails, hard. First, the good: the system itself seems interesting, something a better game could do a lot with. You can get past most of the game without combat, which is always nice when an RPG can accomplish. Combat is really a type of ""crisis"", which means that encounters works much the same way if you're sneaking through an area or swinging your sword.The bad: the balance is all over the place. After the first two hours, if you carry a balanced party, you will never fail at anything. Actually, even if you carry an UNBALANCED party, you'll probably never fail. I ignored one of the stats altogether. There was one combat near the very beginning that I had problems with, after that, I don't think I failed a single thing. You're encouraged to get rid of your cyphers, but since they're mostly one-shot and you never know what you'll need, I don't think I ever used one.There also didn't really feel like there were enough encounters. Maybe that's a function of the lack of difficulty, but there really felt like I should be in crisis mode more frequently, even when I wasn't in combat.tl;dr: I'd pick it up on sale. I don't regret kickstarting it, but it's too short to pay full price. My biggest fear is that this will ensure there's never another game. The idea is that there's an underlying philosophical question you, as the player, are answering by playing the game. I think that's a good concept. The fantastical setting helps by ensuring that we're not grounded on our normal ethical compass. If you come across elves and orcs in a game, you have a good idea of who the good guys are. In Torment, not so much. It lets the game designer ask more complex questions without tipping their hands, and you can see that they're attempting it during Tides.  If you come across a race of cannibals, are they evil? What if they don't kill anyone, but eat parts of them afterwards to ensure their memories survive? To bring closure to their families? To solve a murder spree? What if you come across a race that's lost their way home, and you have a clue that could help them? Seems good, right? What if their ethics said that privacy was too important, and that you'd have to break someone's privacy to answer it? What if, on top of that, they were better off not going home, anyway? What if you had to feed someone from the second race to the first one to help them get home?Planescape: Torment did a good job of this. This game tried, even succeeded at times, but the mechanics and story brought it down at the end.			"

												Overall I am very disapointed in the game.I haven't been able to even finish the game, because of a game breaking bug, where my all of my save files load with the game zoomed in and you are unable to move the character.  This happened twice.  I restarted after the first time, but not the second.There was a massive amount of content that was paid for by kickstarter backers (which I was one of) that was cut from the game.  The combat is mediocre.  The overall story and world are interesting, but the actual dialog seems lackluster.  The setting/background/visuals are amazing.  The music is well done and is enjoyable.  The character models and animations not so much.  The voice acting is terrible and seems random when it comes in.  Important characters you'd think would have their dialog voiced only sometimes have one line.  I do not recommend this game.  It has tons of bugs, a lot of them that break the game, making it unplayable.  Tons of cut content, mediocre gameplay, and lack luster dialog, along with a $45 price, make this game not worth buying.  If the developers fix the terrible bugs and the game goes on sale for a third of the price, then it might be okay to pick up.			"

								I tried the beta release and it was the best RPG I have ever played. It starts of slow and hard to understand and follow all the magical world but as you get into the game you feel more and more involved as you start to feel how much your choices matter unlike in other games where you just make raw decisions and they play out a little bit differently (mass effect). At first I wasnt reading all too much but later it really gets you so involved that it compels you to read all and it doesnt feel like a chore at all. The best thing about this game is that it is not like other rpg whatever mmo grindy things which just feel like a chore while you play because you really can enjoy it. Combat system is amazing, all new interesting ideas based on traditional solid d and d. Graphics are nice, story really interesting. Idk it is hard to find wrong things.			"

												So..uhm  I hope they're patching the issues with this game (mostly the lower xp for not being a violent jerk.  Seriously the talk your way out of fights should be just as rewarding! there's also a bit of a bug with the scroll bar very occasionally.)  but otherwise, I can understand the kickstarter frustration, I didn't back this because I wasn't sure if it would ever happen, but i'm glad it did.  The game itself is very interesting, and there isn't just a fight or no fight option for most quests.  There's a fight some ways, take too long and have this other crap happen, and so on.I do wish the strategy guide wasn't only available in the $90 version, as I'd love to see the path I don't take without having to replay the whole thing but overall this game is good, but not for people looking for like the next baldur's gate or pillars of eternity.  It also takes itself a bit more seriously than Planescape torment did.   I hope they release a demo so that everyone can try it out to see if it is for them before they buy it.			"

Early Access Review
								It's been several months since I've played the first act. What sticks with me is the variety of interesting ideas and quests with non-obvious answers. The adventure game / story part seems top notch. The combat is completely forgettable.			"

												An awesome game that has plenty of role-playing opportunities for your character. The world is jam packed full of lore that is well presented, with many memorable characters. If your not into reading text, it probably isn't the game for you. Those of you who have played it's spiritual predecessor ""Planescape: Torment"" will know what to expect. I've found it to be a fun and immersive experience, with an emphasis on choosing a path and dealing with the consequences.			"

												I'm at 12 hours in the game and I just left the first map. I played games like this decades ago and it does fill a nostalgic itch. I'm not 100% happy with it though.For a game that is supposed to be about a story I don't find the one that came with it great. The side quests are nice and interesting and I think they're interwoven with the main plot yet the primary quest doesn't pull me in, or perhaps it hasn't yet. It feels like the primary quest is there just to give the game progress. It's so uninteresting. After just finishing Tales of Berseria and having experienced a game story that makes you get in an eternal ""one more save point"" spiral just to see what happens next this one feels pointless in comparison.Again, 12 hours in and I still don't get why I should be searching for the McGuffin. The main character, the Last Castoff, is so mediocre. According to what I've seen already there are thousands, maybe millions, of castoffs. Aside from being ""the last"" what the heck makes the main character special? Why does it seem like the main character compelled to do the things she's doing when the other castoffs are just taking their sweet time living (or dying) normally. The answer cannot be ""because she's the main character"" because that's just silly.Overall it's not a bad game. Graphics are nice, sounds are fine, gameplay is good, etc. It's just that the main story didn't get enough attention from the developers. It's like everything else has been done lovingly but the main plot was just slapped in at the last minute to tie everything together.Maybe my opinion will change once I progress further but right now I'm dissappointed. I do not know how much the game will be improved by the developers (like some enhanced edition or something) but right now I cannot recommend this game. InXile marketed this game as the spriritual successor to Planescape: Torment and it shows that they really tried hard to emulate it but unfortunately they missed the mark in the story department.On a different note I would love a modern remake of Planescape: Torment.Update: After finishing the game, I really don't know why I pressed forward to finishing it. You could see most if not all of the endings simply by just playing from the last save point. That makes it have zero replayability. Perhaps one could play it with a different class but that would only change the way you go thru the crises and the small & inconsequential decisions you make, and those things are so dull. It's just a matter of getting 80% or more in the early parts. Around half of the game getting 100% with lots to spare without resting is so easy!I guess it's just not for me. Obviously others like it but if you're looking for a good and memorable story don't bother with this.			"

												Full disclosure: I backed this sucker on Kickstarter three years or so ago at an amount that puts me in the game under another name ($150+).I feel like I should correct a few misconceptions about this game. First, it isn't an action game--if you want tactical combat, or just a lot of combat period, this is NOT your game. This game is designed so that fighting is a distant second option to other methods for resolving conflict. There are very few necessary fights, and most moments of conflict are obviously intended to be resolved via other methods, including lying your face off or doing favors for NPCs. Second, it isn't a 'quick' game--if you dislike reading, or just want something that you can sit down, play for a few hours and not have to think about, remember, or otherwise engage in contemplation, this is NOT your game. This game is designed to be intensely story-rich, which requires a certain amount of effort from players. And in fact, this game almost predominantly balanced toward story and environment, over almost all other concerns. The story itself is extremely rich, thought provoking, and intricate, and in order to fully experience and enjoy it, players are going to have to do a ton of reading, thinking, and remembering. Think of it as a particular style of game, where on the one end we have games that are primarily about reflexes and short term memory, and on the other end we have games that are about long term memory and contemplation.Third, as a creative effort, it simply cannot be exactly as predicted for backers--stick with me here. This is something people generally wouldn't know, unless they work in a creative industry, but whenever you engage in a creative effort, there is always a degree to which the result will deviate from your original direction. The more artists you have working on something, in a general way, the more divergence you will tend to have. This game was the child of around twenty established and/or well known fantasy and science fiction authors, who tackled stories, characters, and ideas. As such, it was pretty much going to deviate. I've been following the development for three or so years now and been active on the backer's forum, suggesting story ideas, approaches, and soundtrack ideas, all of which are yet another source of deviation. The result is not exactly what they promised us. Instead, we got something really, really interesting that has many of the promised characteristics, and in several cases even more than was promised us. I'd be first up, yelling about those discrepancies if it wasn't PAINFULLY obvious that the game's writers, artists, directors, and coders worked their butts off getting us a product that is incredibly polished, if slightly different than promised. They very obviously used my money, and the money of other backers well, and if it took a long time... well.... * shrug * they delivered.Fourth, this is a direct heritor of PlaneScape: Torment. That was a request made so repeatedly on the backer's forums that I would have been surprised if it hadn't been. If you played the original game, this isn't set in the same universe, but the UI, the way characters react, the way scenery is pieced together, and the way you're expected to interact with the game is going to be very, very familiar. It's a top down, heavily story driven, philosophical, often bizarre little masterpiece, and this game, like its predecessor, is going to be a cult favorite. I'm just hoping it has enough success to encourage the publisher to do more like this.Fifth, and finally, not a few of the changes are a direct result of requests on the backer forums. My suggestions all made it into the final product, as well as a good chunk of the ideas I saw others contributing. If it is changed from their promise, that is at least partially due to the feedback of backers over the years the game was in development.Right, having said all this, I feel like I should be somewhat critical of the game......Hmmm.Uh, let's see. The combat is clunky, but I'm fairly sure that's intentional, since you aren't supposed to fight most of the time. The story can be a little bit obtuse, but if you read things closely, that shouldn't present a problem most of the time.  The top down view in a complex environment can be somewhat overwhelming, but holding down tab will highlight everything you can interact with in the environment (as in PlaneScape: Torment). The game script is, no♥♥♥♥♥♥ reams long, and you'll have to get comfortable with reading for tone and implication to really get the most out of it. The puzzles, for the most part, are set at knowledge you'd get in high school art or physics, but I feel like that's not a terribly high bar. The price is high, but not nearly as high as AAA developer games.Yeah, you know what? I don't really have a lot of bad things to say about the game. Just be aware, if you buy it, that you're going to need to think alot, read alot, and explore alot, and you should be fine.			"

												TLDR: While I really liked the story, I felt like I was not playing a game, but watching a tediously long movie where I had to manually move the protagonist between event locations and through dialogue.There is barely a ""game"" here. The choices the player makes don't really have an effect on the story and don't create any plot branches or alternate paths. It's an extremely linear story with the guise of choosing an end when you get there. To top it off, it's clear they spent too much effort on the story at the expense of gameplay. It's too easy to avoid almost every combat. While I appreciate alternate ways to solve situations, if I am not forced into conflict somewhere the game gets really boring fast. By the end of the game I was attacking people I wanted to help because I was tired of reading text and tired of not having much combat, just to break up the monotony.There are no difficulty levels and every combat was trivially easy so even if you do choose combat as a solution for various circumstances, it's not all that satisfying most of the time. Since combat is not necessary, I also found myself picking up loot thinking ""this is cool but when will I use it?"".There were a couple of interesting mechanics I want to call out. The first is the ""effort"" system where you have an effort pool for each of the three stats. You expend effort to increase your chance of success on skill tasks. Unfortunately, I found it trivially easy to succeed at every task in the game without ever worrying about my effort pools. It an interesting idea but not balanced well.The other cool feature are ""crisis"". Basically it's a ""combat or alternative solution"" mechanism. You enter a turn-based mode, but often times there are solutions beside just attacking. Sometimes you can talk to the enemy and try to negotiate a peaceful solution. Sometimes sneaking past is an option. There are also some other interesting combat-oriented ""crisis"" events with devices to activate to protect you or hurt the enemy.But, before I leave you to decide, I will reiterate that the story was very good. If that's all you care about, you may very well enjoy Tides of Numa Numa.			"

												Great successor to Planescape: Torment. Although it's not going to be ground breaking material, it's still an excellent game. I do really like the heavy focus on solving quest without fighting, with the many different approaches. Beautiful graphics, very good optimisation compared to Pillars of Eternity or Tyranny, almost instant loading on every scenes I have been through in Sargus Cliff at solid 90 FPS (my monitor refresh rate) 1440p.

												Another classic FRP / RPG piece, if you are a lover of these genres this is for you, but the turn based combat is NOT for everyone, I for one hated it and as a backer of this game I voted hybrid gameplay but somehow they managed to get the game to be made turn based only, it kills a lot of the fun for me but the story makes up for it. Definitely play it if you are a seasoned role playing game player, it takes a bit getting used to to get really into the story due to the original game system but after that its classic FRP / RPG for you. The problem is you cant customize your characters apperance, the shops in the game give you cancer, money is a big issue and you can simply talk you way out of every situation. Dont be fooled by the fact that they gave a lesser rating to Tyranny, that game is what we need, not this seriously not this.			"

												An amazing game and a true successor to ""Planescape: Torment"", I enjoyed using my character's skills or knowledge to solve problems far more than getting into a dozen similar fights. Hell, even if you do get into a fight you can still talk enemies down or use the environment to get rid of them. And there are so many ways to get upgrades for your Might, Speed and Intellect pools. Wether it is going through Meres, using items that may seem like vendor trash or completing quests in a certain way. So yeah, if you enjoy old-fashioned isometric RPGs (and especially the original Torment), you'd probably love this too. I only wish the game were longer...but in this case I feel like inXile did a good job with leaving me wanting more.			"

												The most important question, apart from expectations set or disappointments given, is: Is it a good game? Is this worth playing?Yes. It is both of those. Regardless of what was envisioned, but not delivered; was promised, but then changed; sounded cool, but didn't work out; was underdeveloped, over-cooked or simply not to ones liking.For what it went out to do (succeed Planescape: Torment), it is not only as close as we can get to it today, but a very good game, indeed. It has, however, inherited the very same problems: It is a complete game, but has unfinished parts.The combat is atrocious, maybe even worse than the original.The alignment system doesn't always result in what you would reasonably expect.The story can be highfalutin and narcissistic at times. (It's very good, overall, though.)For anyone waiting a long time for anything like Planescape: Torment.			"

												First, I'm a  big fan of cRPGs but I never played the original Torment Planescape. I also didn't really follow the kickstarter campaign, so was largely unaffected by the cut stretch goals which seems to have caused so much bellyaching and ranting online.So, do I recommend this game? I'd actually like to say ""maybe"" rather than yes or no.The short version of my review is: If you think of it as a visual novel, you'll probably enjoy it. If you want some action, look elsewhere. Tides of Numenera is a game that is brimming with creativity and interesting ideas. For example, the character that you play, The Last Castoff, is basically immortal. So in the vast majority of cases, ""dying"" isn't the end. In fact, dying can sometimes even be beneficial! This means that save scumming is never necessary, and you can just go with the flow. I don't want to get into too much detail (since that would be spoiling) but suffice to say that the companions are memorable, the places you visit scenic, and the overall story about the Changing God is well-crafted. However, despite the strong story aspects, I think that the weak combat system really holds this game back. First, there's actually very little combat overall. No random encounters, no trash mobs, nothing whatsoever outside of quest/boss fights. Wanna test out your new abilities? Sorry, you'll have to pick a fight during a quest. And even then, you can basically talk your way through almost ANY situation, so even boss fights are optional. I just think a little more action would have been a nice break between all the dialogue, and made the overall experience more balanced. As it stands, most of the gameplay is running between NPCs who want mcguffins and favors. And let's say you DO manage to get into a fight. It's a bit of a slow and clunky system. There are no formations, and you can't place your characters before combat. Really bad if you're playing a mage, because if all the bad guys happen to hit your PC on their first turn, you lose. And the game tends to throw enemies at you in large groups, so just waiting to cycle through everyone's turns takes really long. (For example, more your 4 characters, then you have to wait for 6-7 enemies to move). I finished it with 23 hours on record, so that should give you an idea of its length. I encountered one bug (a loading screen crash) which didn't stop be from finishing the game, but did prevent me from going to one area. Hopefully this will be fixed in a future patch.			"

Posted: March 9
												Where to begin. I backed this game on Kickstarter at the same time that I backed Pillars of Eternity (2012). PoE was released about three years later. Torment, meanwhile, was released two years after that. Given the millions of dollars it received from Kickstarter and the two extra years of development, I was expecting a game that not only matched its predecessor, Planescape: Torment, in depth and detail but exceeded it. Instead, I was left with a final product whose status as a worthy successor to Planescape was mostly illusory. The game also failed to measure up in most (but not all) ways to Pillars of Eternity and even some of the older but classic isometric RPGs such as Baldur's Gate. But let's break it down. The first ""act"" of the game, which composes about ⅓ of the total game, really impressed me. Sagus Cliffs was designed with such detail that it blew Defiance Bay (PoE) out of the water. Where Defiance Bay's design felt oddly inauthentic and lifeless due to its bizarrely clean, overly-perfect, wide avenues and promenades, lack of population, and total lack of anything unique or interesting, Sagus Cliffs felt alive and like there was something neat around every corner. And that's a big achievement, I think that should not be overlooked. This ⅓ of the game had me thinking of Sigil from Planescape, Amn from Baldur's Gate II, or even some of the wacky but fascinating cities of Final Fantasy IX or VII. It felt like a homecoming in a way; back to the cities of the games I played as kid. The characters and party members also seemed pretty promising at this point, as there was a fair amount of dialogue and intrigue involving them.  I thought it would be fascinating to watch their characters develop (with perhaps a romance even?). I thought the city would be a neat place to return to late-game. I thought there would be further, late-game quests to do with the people and organizations I met early on that would yield powerful artifacts, abilities, and new insight into the lore and history of the Ninth World. I wanted to explore the area outside the city, and generally delve deeper into the story of it, it's inhabitants, and history later on. But none of it happens. Once I caught that airship out of the city I could never return, and all the quests I failed to complete would be forever lost, along with the most interesting part of the game. That was the first bad feeling I had. Then, not long after my abrupt departure from Sagus Cliffs, I was met with my second disappointment: the second act. Where the first act arrived with detail, history, intriguing characters, stories, quests, items, beautiful scenery, the second act more or less just showed up. Or phoned it in, rather. It was essentially a glorified checkpoint with little to do or see that was actually interesting. A few things here and there advanced the stories of my party members, but they were mostly silent through this act, their personal dialogue trees exhausted, and their commentary on the overall story virtually nonexistent. Thankfully, this act was also pretty short and quick, aside from the agonizing combat, which I'll get to later. So I didn't focus too much on its flaws and foibles and eagerly moved on to act three. Thankfully, the third act came close to matching the first in quality. There's a lot to do here, but mostly in terms of minor side quests that yield relatively underwhelming rewards. Did I like taking a portal to a space station? Sure. Did I get anything useful or interesting out of it? Was it tied to the rest of the story in any meaningful way? No, and aside from an inert ball I got to take with me that serves to tell me where I am at any given moment, I had nothing to show for the quest, which seemed exceedingly promising when it started. In addition, my party members hadn't seemed to recover from whatever torpor the second act placed on them. They remained mostly silent, aside from a few comments and quips here and there. I was able to complete a few more dialogue options, but they didn't really have anything interesting to say or do, and if they had anything for me to do it was relatively trivial and boring. Admittedly, I was happy with how Rhin's story played out in this act, but I can't say the same for the others. Despite the gorgeously rendered landscapes and artwork, and despite the fascinating setting, I was once again left wanting more. Once again, I left the setting of the third act without the ability to return. The game was pushing me in a relatively linear path. I was essentially playing a book, one that left you feeling like it wasn't quite finished yet. And after the third act, there was a quickly wrap up and conclusion that at least answered some of the outstanding questions, but did little else. And that's the real problem with Torment: the world, the setting, and parts of the story, are fascinating. The game inside that setting is significantly less so. It's unpolished. Unfinished even. It gives you a taste of a fascinating, fantastical world, and then the curtain falls and you realize there's nothing more beyond that taste. I mean, some of the most interesting events of the game essentially happen in your imagination thanks to the whole Mere system. Not in the game, your imagination. You don't actually get to see them, and your ability to interact with them and control them is incredibly limited. I don't want to complain too much, because the art was beautiful and it's a neat idea for these types of isometric RPGs, but it just felt like certain events warranted more attention. So what of the effect of your choices on the game? Pretty minimal. There are a few obvious ones that affect your companions, but pretty much everything else didn't matter. Even when certain characters died in the third act's final crisis, there they were in the concluding fourth act, still breathing and without so much as a mention of their death a mere minutes before. The combat was pretty lackluster. I think some people prefer turn-based combat to the real time combat of PoE or Baldur's Gate, but I'm not one of them. It's just too slow. The whole system is painstakingly dragged out. I had issues with the combat in Shadowrun: Returns, but at least the combat there had more to it than being essentially just a game of numbers. What's more, there seems to be a lack of interesting abilities or opportunities to use them. I more or less used the same tactics in the beginning of the game as in the end of the game. My equipment was virtually irrelevant too, aside from the damage and resistance modifiers on weapons and armor. I bought one set of armor the entire game, and couldn't really identify a moment where I received an item I was really impressed with. There is no lore or history to the items you find, and most of them are useless trinkets only good for selling. Finally, the graphics. Wow. Ok, I've already said several times the backgrounds and scenery are mostly really well done and gorgeous. But the characters and some of the companion portraits? The actual moving pieces? Kind of horrible. Almost like they were designed with the same technology as Planescape: Torment back in 1999. What's more, most of the characters have very little detail. Really, there is only ONE character in the entire game whose level of detail impressed me, and she only shows up at the end of the third act, and is not the main character or a compassion. What a waste. Additionally, the voice acting may as well have been nonexistent, there was so little of it. So what did it all leave me with? A question of where that $4.3 million in Kickstarter funds actually went. Apparently it created a 20 hour game with an admittedly fascinating world and gorgeous artwork, but with a very limited and linear story, underdeveloped characters, uninteresting combat, and relatively limited replayability, especially if you're someone who puts in the effort to turn over every rock and stone in an RPG.

												People have basically said it all, so I won't say much except that were there many disappointments and some shady business/model advertisments....including early videos of neat things like portraits for ALL characters involved in dialogue, and more voice over work than ended up in the game...much revealed to only be in early ""test"" versions of the game which were not revealed as only test versions till a good time after official launch?  Yes to all of that....unfortunately, BUT...is the game still worthwhile, entertaining as all hell, and unqiue with an existential, Søren Kierkegaard, and even Kabalistic/Flower of Life...ish...kinda philosophical mash up/theme?  Hell yeah, and done well and not corny...imho.  A lot of negative reviews could possibly be butt-hurt kickstarter backers and people with legimate gripes like...promised Italian localization which was never implemented...etc, but all n all...great game that is somewhat light on combat, but if you WANT to engage in more combat the option is definately there.  For example, people might state that there are only 5-6 possible combat situations in Sagus (the first area in the game), but during my play through of Sagus, with determination of finding all the combat I possibly could, found well over or around about 12-15 combat scenarios.  Do you have to take a certain dialogue path to reach some combat?  Yes.  Can you avoid much of the combat in the game?  Apparently, according the the devs...noted post launch mind you, you are ABLE to avoid ALL combat if you try hard...they stated it would not be easy to do so, but that they intentionally designed the game so that this is a possibility.I have over 40 hours post launch in the game right now and am only in the second area of the game, but I am slow and enjoy taking my time exploring every nook and conversation.  Even clicking the NPC's without branching dialogues has some reward to it, so I do so.  Also, future updates will apparently clean up combat in some unidentified respects, AND add a kickstarter promised companion called something like ""The Toy,"" or some such that tinkers more with the whole ""Tides"" aspect of the game which sounds interesting.  I know I said I wouldn't ramble, but there you have it, hard not to praise what IS present and good about this game.Sid			"

												As a Plainscape: Torment fan and a Torment: Tides of Numenera backer, I will try to assess how Tides of Numenera measure up to their spiritual predecessor. Please note that I did not finish the game. The gameplay consists of exploration, dialogues, and battles: - Exploration is the standard fare. I feel that the Pillars of Eternity engine was well-chosen and the game is visually appealing, propelling you to explore every nook and cranny of the bizzare game world. - Dialogues are more engaging compared to a traditional cRPG, since having a certain skill is not enough for you to activate special dialogue options.  Instead, you and your companions will need to spend Effort. Effort is spent from a set of three pools (Might, Speed, and Intellect) that are replentished on-rest or via items. The amount of Effort you need to spend depends on your skills and on the chance of failure you are willing to accept. Overall, this mechanic makes dialogues feel fresh. Since writing was the cornerstone of Planescape: Torment, rest assured that no corners were cut here and the (numerous) writers that were involved with the game did a marvellous  job. - Battles (called “Crises”) are turn-based and heavily scripted. You may either use items and a wide array of battle abilities, gained as a part of character progression, to attack your enemies, or you may interact with the enemies and the environment instead. Actions undertaken during crises require Effort to be spent in a fashion similar to the dialogue system.  A minor complaint is that you may not control your characters individually outside crises, only the whole party; as a result, there is no way to position your characters strategically before a crisis begins. Otherwise, the battles are engaging and will certainly bring joy to the players who prefer turn-based over real-time-with-pause combat.As outlined above, I am fairly pleased with the individual aspects of the game.  However, a game is more than a sum of its parts and I feel that there is something essential missing here; something that made Planescape: Torment the exceptional game it is.Planescape: Torment (PT) was built on Infinity engine – the engine that powers the cRPG classics of Baldur's Gate (BG) and Icewind Dale (ID). However, whereas BG and ID feature complex character sheets, combat logs with dice rolls, and tactical combat controls, the user interface of PT is bare and all the dice rolling is happening behind the scenes without the player's knowledge. As a matter of fact, you would not know that Planescape: Torment is an RPG unless you knew its lineage, since it plays very much like a point'n'click adventure game; this is further supported by the easy combat (compared to BG and especially ID), heavy emphasis on exploration and lengthy (visual novel tier) dialogue over combat, and by the fact that the main character cannot die. The magic of PT is that you start the game thinking that it is a point'n'click adventure game, but during the course of the game you discover that there is real-time combat, choice and consequence, faction affiliation, alignment, character abilities, and more. Combine this with the fact that both the Planescape setting and the story of PT are weird and highly unpredictable, and you end up with a game that has you questioning its every aspect including the game mechanics – a feat successfully pulled off by few other games.Looking at Torment: Tides of Numenera (TToN), this aspect of PT is virtually lost. The complex character progression is in full sight and you are expected to spend a fair amount of time studying it. Combat is carefully separated from the exploration gameplay and turned into a heavily scripted minigame. As a result, there is no intrigue in the game mechanics, as all is laid out before you at the beginning of the game, and the exploration gameplay, which along with dialogues is where you will spend most of your playing time, is a plain point-and-click adventure game with no passage of time and with no danger to the characters.TToN is not a bad game. It is lovingly-crafted, ticks all the boxes for a good point'n'click adventure game, and the tactical combat sets it apart from the rest of the genre. Unlike PT, however, it spends too much Effort on polishing the individual parts rather than making sure that they combine into something truly exceptional. A classic example of missing the forest for the trees in my eyes. Still a solid game, though.EDIT: I will certainly update this review after I play the non-early-access content and finish the game.

												I love RPG's and I'm not too picky. This however is really difficult for me to get into and I cannot recommend it uless it goes on sale. Usually the story grips me, so when the prospect of playing a meat bag of a god through use of technological wonders presented itself, then I grabbed it up.The reason I can't get into this title, and hopefully that will change, is because this just isn't a fun game. My interest in it also corroded when I began reading bad dialogue. People complain about the voice actors, but I liked most of the voices when they were in Tyranny, The problem is that there are some stupid dialogues in this game; at least in the very beginning.So this company makes good titles and I'm glad they put their foot forward, even if it didn't seem like it was their best foot. Therefore, I will try and rank current RPG titles and if you have the same taste as I do then hopefully this will help you better understand if you should wait for a 50% sale.1) Tyranny2) Wasteland 23) Pillars of Eternity4) (insert a RPG here)5) (insert a RPG here)6) (insert a RPG here)7) (insert a RPG here)8) (insert a RPG here)9) South Park Stick of Truth10) Planescape: Tides of Numenera			"

Posted: March 8
												I kickstarted this game as soon as I found out about it after having kickstarted Wasteland 2 from the same developer. Numenera was a big name at the time and I was excited to play in that world.I just finished my first playthrough of this game, having completed every quest I found (except one, which I completed and which did not, for some reason, complete in my journal). While I do have some complaints about the title, I give this game two thumbs up. Pillars of Eternity did not set my character in the game world. Tyranny tried, but soon became boring. This game, on the other hand, drew me into the story right away.Before I go on, please note: This game is not Planescape: Torment. The developers touted that name in order to get people excited, and blowhards never figured out what ""spiritual successor"" really means, so there are a lot of people disappointed that this game is not Planescape. If you are expecting Planescape.. well, move on. This game will never be Planescape.Pros:+ Fantastic story with good pacing. At over 50 hours, I read everything, explored every item description, journeyed through every mere, and absorbed all the lore I could find. It was never a slog to read like Witcher 3 or Mass Effect 1.+ Weird setting. Numenera is all about the Weird. The tabletop RPG has a ho-hum system with some serious flaws, but most people enjoy the setting enough to put up with the system. Tides of Numenera rips the setting free and spares us the flaws of critical failures being as common as critical successes or average success. I don't want to spoil anything - if you're familiar with the Numenera setting, I think you will be happy with this game's use of it.+ Choice. Many conflicts can be solved in multiple interesting ways. A lot of games give you a 'choice' but it tends to revolve around cardboard morality, black hat/white hat tripe. Here is a game where you can speed through using the standard Bioware-type actions, or put some thought into your actions and discover really cool solutions that add to the story and setting.+ No meaningless combat encounters. Remember Baldur's Gate and having to fight wolf after wolf forever, regardless of your power level? The endless slog of going through dungeons without challenge, knowing you're going to annihilate everything in your path? All of the fights in this game make logical sense and none feel they were placed just to prop up playtime.+ Inventory that's part of the world. This intersects with setting a bit, but I can't stress how much I wish other games would take a lesson. Don't just give me a shiny new sword and leave the story up to my imagination. Tons of oddities and artifacts can be used and will present anything from puzzles, filler stories, meaningful narrative, to useful rewards. Quest items in most games are used once and forgotten, but many quest items can be used multiple times and often in interesting ways. Again, this makes sense if you know the Numenera setting. If you're only familiar with the old Infinity Engine games, make sure you're reading your item descriptions and checking what can be used.Cons:- Awful character customization. You are given no choice over how your character looks despite your gender. Devs tried to say it was because you are learning to live in a copy, but let's be honest here - if you pick a female, you're still interacting with a Changing God who is a male. There's no compelling reason I see that they would not allow you to customize your appearance except that they didn't want to take the time/resources to allow it. There is literally no part of your character's appearance that could not be customized and still remain plot-relevant.- Awful use of Descriptors. Descriptors are probably the coolest part of character creation in the Numenera tabletop RPG and this game does the absolute worst job it possibly could at picking fun ones for you to try. They could explain this away by giving you a flat Descriptor like the one Rhin uses, to explain the various powers you have from your progenitor. But they don't. They shoehorn in 3 boring descriptors that give you no awesome powers whatsoever. It's a travesty. - Sparse combat. If you love these games because you love tactical RPGs, I would stay far away. If you love min-maxing, I don't think this will scratch your itch, either. Combat is fleeting and you can play for hours without coming into a battle unless you push to instigate the few you find, especially early on in the game. What this means, really, is that you gain levels and are forced to choose several powers *before you ever really understand how combat works in the game.* Don't get me wrong, I appreciate not having random encounters with 15 wolves around every corner I turn - at the same time, exploring ""dangerous"" areas of the cities you explore feels exactly the same as exploring the safe areas. Also, combat in the tabletop RPG is fun, for the most part, especially because of Descriptors (see above). They could have done SO MUCH MORE.- Frustrating camera controls. While not a dealbreaker, because this game's combat becomes extremely easy later on... the isometric view combined with the way they use triggers means that sometimes you have the ability to walk further on a map, but you can't, because your pathing ends too close to a door or something else and you can't prioritize your walk action over interacting with whatever object is in the way. Related: some rooms that *look* symmetrical are not, as you cannot properly walk behind all walls equally, and sometimes one or two characters can block a hallway that looks wide enough for three or four.- Grammar errors. I can't remember seeing any typographical errors, but at times it felt like the entire script was run through a spellchecker and autocorrected rather than having humans read and correct sentences that don't make sense. It wasn't a huge deal, but when 98% of your game is reading, the reading should probably be polished, yeah?- Disappointing ending. I remember the first time I beat Rygar on the NES. The ending screen was just a short blurb of text. Fine for an NES game. When I beat this, I got to make a choice, but I was treated to the same - a short blurb of text. It was super vague and I learned nothing of anyone I had grown to care about while playing. I wanted to know if Zebb and Nym's father turned his life around and made their family happy again, for example. I wanted to see what happened to.. well, ANY of the playable NPCs. Granted, I only beat the game once as of writing this; maybe there are better endings if you choose a different option. I hope so, for your sake. But this game's ending made Mass Effect 3 seem like War and Peace by comparison, while this would be Cliff Notes for Green Eggs and Ham.- Lackluster companions. Okay, they weren't bad, and I loved Rhin to death. But they weren't anything close to, say, Baldur's Gate 2's chatty, loveable NPCs. And there aren't even enough to play a few times using different rosters (I think there should be at least 2-3 more companion choices). Meanwhile, they almost never interact with each other the way we've come to love (and expect) in our RPGs. They also very rarely comment on choices you make compared to other games. They are definitely a part of the scenery compared to the numenera and non-playable NPCs you'll meet, at least 90% of the time.I could probably come up with more pros and cons, but at this point you might ask, with such heavy cons, why would you still recommend this? Well, because I had fun. A lot of fun. And if you can live with the cons, and the pros sound good to you, I think you'll like it too. Happy playing!			"

												As a Plainscape: Torment fan and a Torment: Tides of Numenera backer, I will try to assess how Tides of Numenera measure up to their spiritual predecessor. Please note that I did not finish the game. The gameplay consists of exploration, dialogues, and battles: - Exploration is the standard fare. I feel that the Pillars of Eternity engine was well-chosen and the game is visually appealing, propelling you to explore every nook and cranny of the bizzare game world. - Dialogues are more engaging compared to a traditional cRPG, since having a certain skill is not enough for you to activate special dialogue options.  Instead, you and your companions will need to spend Effort. Effort is spent from a set of three pools (Might, Speed, and Intellect) that are replentished on-rest or via items. The amount of Effort you need to spend depends on your skills and on the chance of failure you are willing to accept. Overall, this mechanic makes dialogues feel fresh. Since writing was the cornerstone of Planescape: Torment, rest assured that no corners were cut here and the (numerous) writers that were involved with the game did a marvellous  job. - Battles (called “Crises”) are turn-based and heavily scripted. You may either use items and a wide array of battle abilities, gained as a part of character progression, to attack your enemies, or you may interact with the enemies and the environment instead. Actions undertaken during crises require Effort to be spent in a fashion similar to the dialogue system.  A minor complaint is that you may not control your characters individually outside crises, only the whole party; as a result, there is no way to position your characters strategically before a crisis begins. Otherwise, the battles are engaging and will certainly bring joy to the players who prefer turn-based over real-time-with-pause combat.As outlined above, I am fairly pleased with the individual aspects of the game.  However, a game is more than a sum of its parts and I feel that there is something essential missing here; something that made Planescape: Torment the exceptional game it is.Planescape: Torment (PT) was built on Infinity engine – the engine that powers the cRPG classics of Baldur's Gate (BG) and Icewind Dale (ID). However, whereas BG and ID feature complex character sheets, combat logs with dice rolls, and tactical combat controls, the user interface of PT is bare and all the dice rolling is happening behind the scenes without the player's knowledge. As a matter of fact, you would not know that Planescape: Torment is an RPG unless you knew its lineage, since it plays very much like a point'n'click adventure game; this is further supported by the easy combat (compared to BG and especially ID), heavy emphasis on exploration and lengthy (visual novel tier) dialogue over combat, and by the fact that the main character cannot die. The magic of PT is that you start the game thinking that it is a point'n'click adventure game, but during the course of the game you discover that there is real-time combat, choice and consequence, faction affiliation, alignment, character abilities, and more. Combine this with the fact that both the Planescape setting and the story of PT are weird and highly unpredictable, and you end up with a game that has you questioning its every aspect including the game mechanics – a feat successfully pulled off by few other games.Looking at Torment: Tides of Numenera (TToN), this aspect of PT is virtually lost.

As a result, there is no intrigue in the game mechanics, as all is laid out before you at the beginning of the game, and the exploration gameplay, which along with dialogues is where you will spend most of your playing time, is a plain point-and-click adventure game with no passage of time and with no danger to the characters.TToN is not a bad game.

												Hey Folks,First of all I would like to give a shoutout to all the wonderful developers over at InXile who made a bold attempt at bringing a true spiritual successor to one of the best RPGs of all time - Planescape Torment. The road to hell is paved by good intentions...I have been psyching myself up to do this review for some time now, it's been around a week or so since I finished Torment. Also, I would like to note that I have not been an original backer, though I did pledge around mid 2015 directly on the site. I am highlighting this to mark that I have not been emotionally involved in the Kickstarter process and have no idea about the stretch goals and the subsequent delivery on those. I have thoroughly enjoyed PS:T back in the days and loved Wasteland 2 even before the directors cut came out, which made all the better. Pre-game:I know it sounds a bit stupid, but the Main Menu screen looks like it has been done by High School student. It threw me off whenever I booted up the game. I very much enjoyed the way the game preselected a character type for you based on a series of answers and I actually ended up playing the proposed one. But the lack of appearance customization just plain killed me. I couldn't even choose a portrait!!!Graphics:I played on my work laptop with built-in Intel Graphics so I definitely did not have the chance to experience the full power of T:ToN. The backgrounds and environment looked gorgeous, though all of the characters - much less so. And for some strange reason the vast majority of NPCs are actually missing any kind of portrait. Combine this with poorly detailed models, zoomed out screen and literally walls of text you end up feeling like reading a book rather than playing a game. Imagination has to run wild, otherwise there is simply no connection. General Gameplay:I actually very much enjoyed the stat pool mechanic, it felt like an interesting and fresh approach. That said the balance is completely off, nanos rule supreme, majority of stat checks are Intelligence and you can actually brute force the rest just by having enough stat pool points available. I made my playthrough opting for a non violent route and I could I mostly got away with it safe for a few hard coded battles where I could actually resolve them in a nonviolent matter within the Crisis itself. But make no mistake, I did not like those moments or solutions as they felt forced and breaking the pace of the game. Combat:Speaking about the pace - any combat is just horribly slow. Every enemy turn took at least 4-5 seconds just to get them moving!!! Having a mage-like characters I never felt underpowered but I was dissapointed with the variety of spells and weapons at my disposal. And the cyphers were just plain dumb - I haven't used a single one during the game. Overall the combat felt like a last minute add-on on top of the game just for the sale of having it without any proper mechanic or item support. Story:The overall plot while not a revelation by any stretch of the imagination is decent with a nice twist or two. The companions however are a complete disgrace. There is no romantic interest, the dialogues do not get further than 2 levels down. There is only 1 quest per companion and even those are just solved almost automatically as you clear out the game areas. The dying mechanic - a cornerstone of PS:T is completely tagged on just for show. It's a struggle even just to get killed, but when you do - it's a small Labyrinth area with nothing to do there safe for a couple of 10min sidequests of kill/stun them allThe overarching plot itself is far too short, progressing in leaps as you move from one area to the other. I absolutely loved the depth of the world hinted at but T:ToN failed miserably in exploring it. All information is given in walls and walls of text. And don't even get me started on the Meres. They are just lazy game development. On one hand they require you to do tons of reading and tough choices, without hinting on what is a better/worse one and absolutely NO RETURN. That's right, you need to spend up to half-hour reading, hoping the stat pool check pan out, etc just to have zero impact back in the game. No perks or loot or anything. Initially I thought that after  you finish a mere the respective castoff would appear in the labyrinth. Nope. Interface:Is just plain horrible. The text is prevalent up to occupying almost half of the screen when in dialog. The inventory screen is dominated by the cypher section, which almost is useless. The amount of equippable slots on the characters is akin to an action/rpg and the inventory itself is showing no more than 2 rows at a time. Also, during the game you come upon a lot of items, called oddities, which are very confusing as what to do with them. Some you are able to use and even get a permanent bonus, others you can transform to artifacts, some you can actually use in quests.  So it's difficult to tell what you can safely sell. Which in the end is not that much of a problem since anyway there is little interesting to buy. Summary:However much I wanted to love it I was very much dissapointed with T:ToN. And it was made even worse because I saw that with just a few shifts in priorities in presentation and story it could've been so much better. The sheer amount of writing has come before everything else. Walls and walls of text meet you everywhere. If some of that effort was spent on expanding the item list, the skills and abilities, the companion quests, the portraits and overall locations  - it would have been a much more enjoyable experience. Queue: rotten tomatoes.  "

												This game is getting way more sh*t than it deserves. Some complaints are baffling: poor UI, bad portraits, too much text... Jesus, even the criticisms about combat, which is objectively kinda bare bones, are negated by the fact that fights are extremely rare and almost always avoidable, since the game - FOR ONCE - tries to focus on other kinds of interactions.Sure, there are some problems, and the niche nature of the game is bound to trigger a physiological reaction by people who genuinely didn't expect such a wierd and text-heavy game, but I feel like the bulk of the critics are KS backers who waited the release day to unleash their frustration about ""cut content"", the devilish console port and the absence of RTwP combat without even realising the fact that it represented one of the main problems of the original Torment or acknowledging that it was chosen through a backer poll.But yeah, thumb the game down, I'm sure we will get many opportunities to experience a game of this nature in the future thanks to such juvenile reaction about ""oh so serious"" and totally relevant issues.

Early Access Review
								Just a few thoughtsIt's better then PoE (Pillars of Eternity YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!). It's more interesting. I don't say PoE is bad, but PoE texts were often sooooooo booooooring I wanted to skip them.TToN instead has incredibly interesting story and lore. I realy love every sentence of it and it has A LOT of them :)And I can't compare it with DOS, they are very different. But I can compare it with Tyranny which also has interesting story and very good voice acting. Comparing to it TToN has less voice acted lines. At least in this demo part of the game until it's released. One of the strong gameplay features of TToN which levates it over the rest is variativeness of your walkthrough. You can achieve your goal in many ways.And the story is the main and ultimate benefit here. Last time I was so interested in studying the game world was playing Planescape Torment. One billion years in future is coolest idea in a long time. Also games role mechanics feels fresh and not so dull as all those old classic ones. I strongly recommend this game, despite I REALLY HATE some of it's animations and idle poses (which are really poorly done) and lack of sound efffects, TToN is deffinetly worth of attention.			"

												I highly recommend this game!  The world is very interesting, with very acute attention to even little details.  The environemnts are beautifully designed, every character you encounter has unique details about their appearance and personality, and the music is very well produced.  That does lead to a lot of text to read and does make the game seem to move at a slow pace, however.  I think some people may have had some expectations that this game would be ""Planescape: Torment 2"" and I'm not sure that the developers gave this impression when they claimed it to be a ""spiritual successor.""  I do believe their game does continue the philosophical themes of it's spiritual namesake.  If you are the kind of player that likes to investigate all the intricate details of a world or a story, this game is for you!			"

												You can read minds, but can not act on or talk about what you learnt that way. To me it sums up how the game is designed. There's a lot of things to read, but not a lot the writers will allow you to do. Push to the first ""social"" encounter, namely the public trial in the fist city, to get a good feeling of why I asked for a refund: it tries (too) hard but it is generic, eveything feels out of place, and it manages to be visually less interesting than PT.I'll wait for a discount and some updates to give it another shot.

												3.7/5. Not recommended at full price. It's still a decent and enjoyable game, just disappointing because it was supposed to be a successor to Planescape: Torment, and I am sad to say that I do not find it worthy. I backed Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, and Tides of Numenera. This product has made me change my mind about backing this studio's future products.The setting and mood of this Torment is good and on par with Planescape: Torment, but the plot, writing, character development, and scale of this game pales in comparison. The crisis system of dealing with combat and other crises is quite innovative and enjoyable, but I don't recall having too many crises in my playthrough. My first playthrough took about 20 hours, which feels rather short, and companions did not seem to have hung around me long enough for me to get attached to them, and their development is also very stunted and abrupt. Also, they also seemed very one-dimensional yeah including *gasp* Callistege.A major part of the lore of this universe is the tides, which comes in different colors, and seem to be similar to alignments in other universes. I didn't notice if having a particular alignment impacted my first playthrough at all.The part I disliked the most was the epilogue. It's very abrupt and felt as if they couldn't get things done in time and just cut it out, cauterized the stump and sent it out.It's very ironic that calling this a pale spectre of its predecessor is perhaps the best way I can find to describe this game.

												I've not finished yet, but I have to make a review now. I'm kinda motivated by my feels.Tides of Numenera delivers what I expected a good main story with rich interactions, deep characters. We are about to play Mass Effect: Andromeda and spend most of the game shooting at poorly designed aliens (it's supposed to be in another galaxy but yet it's full of biped humanoid races :')) with tumblr-written companions in a manichean plot self-centered on ""MAH HUMANITY"".Guys... Why would you ask for combats in this game ? I bled enough from the♥♥♥♥♥during the Eb fight in PoTD difficulty in Tyranny. I will do endless battle in Andromeda for fetch quests.Do I need to whine about the lack of challenging/reward combat system ? Hell no.""Huehue. This isn not Planescape: Torment, huehue"" Oh ? Really. Let me remind you my very first game of Planescape back in the days:>Be me.>Be 13 yo>Starts Planescape: Torment>Too lazy to read everying>Ends up in Sewer>♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by rats, starts fighting, get gangraped>Dies in 99% of the fight I started.>Uninstall this, blame the world for this♥♥♥♥♥♥tier rpg. Why was my first Planescape experience this bad ? Because I didn't read carefuly. I went full retard and tried to fight everything. Combat system was not elaborate, it was punitive as ♥♥♥♥ the only way I could enjoy Planescape was growing up and take my time to READ about Sigil and those characters.Tides of Numenera is exactly the same.This game is about a big story into a multiverse full of details and awesome discoveries (also cheesy ones :p). Don't cry because it's focused on the story. If you are a RPG lover, you can balance this with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story-written game with c00l graphics and a lot of battle like Dragon Age: Inquisition ?You may be mad at inExhile because they didn't deliver what we all expected THE GOTY-MOUNTAINDEW-ACCLAIMED-REWARDSWINNING Gamu. But don't bash this game, it's a very good moment.I'm currently playing a deceptive/persuasive jack strongly golden in tides. It's a pure selfless kind-hearted cast-off and I encoutered an event in the game which makes me very proud of my choice. You can recruit a little girl, Rhin. She's held by a slave-master who is a cast-off. She uses Rhin as a ♥♥♥♥ing punchingball for her tides surges (which is cruel).If you get Rhin with you and free her from this sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥, you can leave Rhin at her fate, you can't leave her to some kind of orphenage (House of Empty Time), you can keep her with you till the very end... Or send her back to her home.During my adventure, I gave the Love she needed, I showed the importance of being selfless and helping people in needs. (Golden tides). I helped her to get back to her home. She hugged me and said me farewell.I was sad... I left the little girl I cared. She wasn't the greatest asset with her ""stupid"" god-rock and her unability to use weapons but she was a birght spark into this savage multiverse.And later... From a portal, gues who's back ? Rhin, as an adult. In an armor, coming to help me and telling me she has become something. Because of me, because of the bound of love. It may sounds lame & gay, quite stereotypical. But come on... She's the exact consequences of what I played with her.I feel like my choices with her, reward me... I regret nothing. Having her in my group instead of this dumb Erritis (who hit like a truck), trying to confort her under the pragmatical sight of Callistege etc...Thanks you inExhile for this moment. That was a great experience. And I've not finished the game yet.I have to say for the very first time I've played a CRPG in my mother tongue (which is french) because the translation is quite good. Really. Nothing looked awkward when I read ton of texts from npcs across the 9th world. Don't bother with the tones of negative reviews... If you are curious, you like reading and you want to live a story where your choices matter. Just go, enjoy. ♥♥♥♥ the rest.Other RPGs will balance the ""lack of"" you'll find in Tides of Numenera. "

Pros+ Sceneries are great+ Story has a lot of potential+ Music is quite goodCons- Dialogues are bloated with lengthy descriptions of banalities (clothing, mannerisms, etc.)- Lots of pointless lore and jargon- Neglected sound design (e.g. no reverb/echo when people talk in a cavern)- The scarce voice acting is sometimes decent, sometimes ridiculous- Most companions are clichés or downright boring- Overall UI is poorly designedMy wordThe writers are focusing on world-building, yet they don’t seem to comprehend that no matter how intricate their imaginary world becomes, it will appear meaningless if the story is poorly executed. Instead of letting the writers overdo lore and descriptions, the producers should have put more resources into the audio-visual presentation, which accounts for most of the immersion in a video game.

												Although it doesn't live up to the expecations which PST or BG fan would have and despite some of its mechanical quirks it is an overall good game with nice writing and deserves to be played at least once by anyone who loved the style and atmosphere of the old Inifity Engine games. Only major downside for me is that TToN is a bit shorter than I hoped for.One more major hub similar in size and scope to the the last major hub spoiler] Bloom [/spoiler] would have been awesome.Hopefully this release will be successfull and give them chance to expand on it in future as Numenera is great setting.

I found myself trying to push through the game to see if i would change my mind the longer i went into game but it didnt happen.I cant recommend this game when you got legendary games like BG series and ID, i also find PoE better and tyrannt.  And if you want the best game of them all which is planscape torment, go buy that instead.			"

								Great game! I really look forward to play the full version. It is so complex and unique that it makes every previous classic RPG titles feel ashamed. Its sci-fantasy setting, its story and character develpoment are marvelous.The only problems are purely technical issues I think. The loading time is annoying and I met several issues related to saving/loading my game and camera movement. I hope they could fix these issues and the further sotry and levels after Sagus Cliff will be as amazing as the beta-testing.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW PURCHASED THROUGH KICKSTARTER.Ah this takes me back to Planescape Torment, running around as the Nameless One with buddy skull Morte at your side...Having played through the Early Access area a couple times (not fully mind you) I can easily say I'd recommend this game. Excellent visuals, voice acting and ambient audio are lovely, and the detail in the story as well as minor characters and descriptions is just unparalleled. If you're a fan of the older Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, and the like you will certainly enjoy this.			"

												So Ive played for about a day and half. messed up a couple quest and found way to bug out the first enconter with a sorrow shard. Game beat..... This is like reading one of those books that chose this option flip to this page and so on. Its a great concept and has lot of fun stuff and good stories buts its beyond short. shorter then anything ive played. this is becoming more and more common in games here is a cool story with this whole cool world and characters but its only around 20 hours of play. seriously..... what happend to the 100 plus to 300 hour plus games. that had great stories lots quest and bunch of stuff to do to keep you occuped.  I personally wouldnt recomend this game for its price at all. It seems it fits into the 19-30 dollar game range with what content it gives. I loved the first one it took me and my brother forever to do everything and enjoy the world and story. To me this fell so short of living up to the memory and stature of the first one that I feel bad for all those who backed it.			"

												Disappointed in this one...the setting is really interesting but the actual gameplay is really barebones and pretty boring. The writing is good but too often devolved into heavy handed philosophy. After getting about 2/3 of the way through I realized I didn't really care about the main story and wasn't having fun with the gameplay mechanics and gave up on it. It's definitely different - but somehow the setting just ends up being so off the wall that nothing really sticks, and the actual gameplay just plods. Bummer.All in all I think you'd get more out of a good sci fi novel than this game, sadly.			"

												Wow. So, as is usual with things like this, it seems people went into the game with vastly different expectations than what was being developed. If you look at the majority of negative reviews, you will noticed two things: First, an average time played of 1-2 hours which makes any opinions they have on it laughable. Second, the most frequent complaint seems to whining about the combat system. The game isn't about combat, in fact every single combat situation in the game can be resolved in an alternate way.Anyway, enough about Steam reviews being mindless dogpiling. How is the game itself? It's a worthy successor to Planescape: Torment I feel. There are lengthy conversations with interesting characters to be had, nearly all of the companions have their own quirks and peculiar 'things' about them, and the world itself is based on the setting of one of the best Tabletop RPGs in the past few years. Seriously, I can't really explain just how much the world itself is a character in this game, full of weird, mysterious and wonderful things.I'm also not sure what people are talking about when they're complaining about the game being too short, I'm still in the first city, am 7-8 or so hours in, and still haven't explored two entire districts of the city. I feel the people complaining about there only being a few areas must have rushed through the game and completed zero sidequests, talked to people, or explored.So yeah. If you're a fan of old school CRPGs, if you enjoy reading, and you're interested in one of the most unique game worlds in recent memory, you should pick this up.			"

												i didn't know what to expect from this game. i followed it a few months ago, read the updates , jumped on the hype wagon . and brought it as soon as it came out. i should have waited, The much talked about tides system (where nearly everytime you have a convosation your tides shift to match your answers ) had no effect what-so ever on the game that i could tell. Your fellow group members back stories and games stories where non eventsThe combat made very little sence at all. the level up system was quite bazzar as well. towards the end of the game i got what i thought was some very good combat skills. that i got to use about 4 times the whole gameI actually had to force myself to finish the game as i lost interest towards the endthis game feels like at points its going to be amazing. but just didn't do it for me.

												So, I backed this game on Kickstarter, but didn't actually pay much attention to the development, other than to check out the beta and then wait for the full release. So, while I empathize with the people who followed development closely and got disappointed by things that were cut/downsized, I really enjoy the finished product that I got.This is a game where it really feels like your choices matter. I was stunned to see references in the ending sequence to choices I made that I had assumed wouldn't really matter. The story felt really well paced in the end, if a bit front heavy. If the setting interests you, and you like replaying games to see what other choices you could have made, this is definitely a game for you. That being said, if you're only planning on playing it once, you may be disappointed in the overall length. I wouldn't call it short, but there's so much depth and promise in the setting that theres room for a lot more story than what we got.			"

												What is the worth of a single life?My very first boxed PC game was Baldurs Gate. Then over the years I played every great Crpg. Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, Arcanum, Pillars of Eternity and the most recent Tyranny. I have played and replayed these games and IM happy to say that Torment: Tides of Numenera is amongst the best of them.The Story is deep as the worlds lore. You have to leave some of your preconceptions behind and embrace the alien nature and laws of this world. Where aliens, otherworldly beings and mutants walk under the red Sun. If you are afraid of walls of text and lore then this game will not be for you. If you enjoy reading and learning about a brand new world you will adore Numenera.Gameplay is the weak point of the title. Combat can be fun and engaging, with varied party setups, builds and interesting weapons and items but the way its system works can be a drag slowing the pace greatly. I have to admire a game where I can end a combat scenario without killing a single enemy, where I can avoid combat altogether. During my entire playthrough I didn't even have 10 battles. There are some technical bugs, but nothing game breaking. (Lets not forget that Planescape Torments combat wasn't great...).As a last word Rhin is now atop one of my favorite npc's of all time. (If you think she is weak I can only laugh at you.)Cheers			"

												Pros:- Well written. A story focused RPG that can't fulfill this criteria isn't worth playing, just as a roguelike with terrible gameplay mechanics wouldn't be worth anyone's time. So. The story is interesting, the story is personal and it carries the game from start to finish as it should.- Good sidequests with multiple solutions. I can't stress how important this is.- Reactive companions with their own opinions and comments.Cons:- Main plot lacks narrative focus and sometimes you lose sense of what you're supposed to be doing there until you remind yourself with the journal. - NPCs, followers and even the game world itself can sometimes feel like it's missing character. Sure it's well written, a lot of it feels a little flat. The world itself seems *small* and very localized to a linear path, broken into small locations, rather than the more open exploration of Pillars of Eternity or Baldur's Gate II. - Combat isn't that well thought out.- Skill checks don't scale, so eventually you'll pass everything with ease.Conclusion:Looking at the list of cons you'd think I would not recommend the game, but I do. It's not a masterpiece, and perhaps that is why it is receiving so many negative reviews from old Planescape: Torment fans, but it is a decent and original RPG game well worth your time, despite its flaws.

												This is not your derivative of a derivative game. Seek elsewhere. It is about  immersing thyself into an intriguing and alluring lore and weaving the protagonist's path according to the narrative. Torment:ToN is far from being perfect, personally I believe the story is beyond the 10/10 scale. The game has only one predecessor, Planescape Torment, which is in a sense a cult-classic.As for the price, it did not deter me. Speaking from the main stream's eye, then patiently wait for a price reduction.I recommend it even with its short comings. YES you have to read more than three sentences and will need a pair of reading glasses - so whippersnappers beware. Old school veterans of the trade will appreciate ToN!			"

And before you thinking ""but Planescape was a book too! it's just what the fans wanted!"" - no it's not like Planescape.It's a huge stepback from Planescape: Torment already primitive RPG system, at least there you couldn't save-scam to pass dialogue checks, so it makes all your stats completely redundant. Also it lacks original characters like Morte.Better check out ""Age of Decadence"" which is more Torment and Numenera than Torment Numenera.			"

Wonderful writing that just keeps me coming for more, the setting is wonderfully quirky, original, and interesting, just like Planescape used to be. Also clearly inspired by the Dying Earth book series, and very good at that!This is not a combat-focused RPG, like all seem to be about nowadays; this is a traditional isometric, story-focused, true roleplaying game.Also a very nice update on the Pillars of Eternity engine, which I was not particularly fond of, this looks very nice!

												I'm writing an early review, breaking a personal rule, for a specific reason. This game has already given me more time and enjoyment than a number of Triple-A retail price games do, and some people are making really stupid arguments.The positive reviews hold, but I'm going to throw my hat in the ring just to make sure that genuine reviews are sticking to the top.The biggest complaint I see is this: ""http://imgur.com/a/Cwyig Everything struck through in red﻿ has been cut!""And, this is my short, effectual response: From the list, it looks like they primarily cut additional followers, 'factions', and non-essential material.The followers may be in game, and included in plot, but aren't companions. They stated in some of the Dev diaries early on that they needed to work in the vast amount of scripting it would take in an effective time period of about three years. Combine that with efforts to go back and redo things that alpha / beta testers suggested, and that ate up a lot of time. I'm willing to say that a lot of this content may very well be in the game, just not in its originally conceived form.I personally wasn't concerned with Numenera Crafting to be honest, especially since its a really niche position even in the tabletop material, which I DM from. And, I say this as an alpha tester, who got 26 hours from the early betas, and stopped so I'd be more refreshed for the final release. 26 Hours of straight narrative content is no small feat, especially for a closed beta intro.If we lost a location like the water city, it's disappointing but within reason. Though, the ""Live Orchestra"" promise doesn't have to come out with the release of the game. And, putting a question mark next to the unachieved stretch-goal smells of salty tears to me.﻿BUT, let's continue with the positive review!This game is a narrative experience which few even attempt to rival in and of themselves. Most games today sell a highly-detailed world-space that you can run around in to explore, with bits of flavor text interspersed to highlight the narrative, and signal-boost the dialogue. That method is not a poor one, but it has its own distinct quality. This game provides the rich narrative in full bulk, with perhaps reduced graphical and 3D flare, but rich with genuine experience.You make real choices, not just the illusion of choice, where two paths diverge only to immediately come back together with some characters resolving differently. Almost immediatley in the game, your two starter followers feud irredeemably, and you have to choose to take one of them with you. You 'can' reverse this decision, but once you start building out and equipping that follower, and siding with them in their story, it becomes quite troubling to attempt to go back and find the other again. Even more so, there are diverging paths with decisions that directly affect how your experience forward will go.It's not a particularly challenging game, unless you're dramatically unsuited for a task and attempting to save-scum it. But, it IS a game that will make you question yourself! Do I really want to do this? Is this what's going to help me int he long run?It's even better when the game SURPRISES YOU WITH CONTENT. I mean, random flashbacks after a scene that you feel should just be another shameless transition. With minimal exposition, and very little ability to save-scum, it really puts the pressure on you, as the player, to make these decisions with the direct autonomy that you have. It's the only thing you have, sometimes.And man, does it make this game feel good.But yes, the game is a bit antiquated mechanically. If you don't like the idea of a visible dice roll, or RNG at all, you may not entirely enjoy this game. Similarly so if you can't handle the old-school feel of an isometric RPG. Again, it's not an RPG for everyone, but it was never intended to be. This was what it was touted as from the very beginning, and in my opinion, it does it excellently.Now, I'm going to shut up, try and find some time in my schedule to actually finish the game. My current estimate is that I will probably rack up about 100 hours playing, so I'll probably end up with approximately 130 hours played with my beta testing. Not even including the alpha client.

In a game, that is all about making choices, I regularly run out of choices because my ""intellect points"" are gone. This is absurd, its self-contradictory. To have to take a nap after every stupid action? What a pitty, what terrible choises were made by the game designers here...			"

												I haven't put a lot of time into this game to be honest but I am probably not going to put any more into it.  While I understood from the reviews that all of this game was harkening back to the days before most of the conversations were voice acted and I was ready for it what I wasn't ready for was writing that really just turned me off.  This is probably a personal preference thing but as a person who also enjoys reading this genre of literature I expected a little more.  If you know in advance that you are going to create a game in this manner you really should have someone put a lot of extra time into the writing.  The concept seemed ok but again the writing turned me off so much in the little time that I was playing that I just couldn't do it anymore.I want to reiterate that my criticisms are mostly personal preference, I think that someone who enjoys a different style of writing than what I prefer probably would find this game a blast but it just isn't there for me sadly.  I wish Steam would give me the ability to do something other than just say yes or no to the recommendations for this game but sadly no.  If you can find it at a discount, which you can even this early after release then it's worth a shot.  If you have to pay full price, hold out for a sale just in case you fall into the same situation as me.			"

								I honetsly did not expect the game (after the recent December update) to be THAT good. I mean, of course Planescape in itself was quite a big pair of shoes to fill. But literally, the guys completelely blew the roof off of all my expectations regarding this game. The graphics are STUNNING, the designers fantasy goes totally wild in a very good sense. The philosophical depth of the plot and writing gives you enough food for thought for months. Forget the annoying cliche's and familiar tropes. It's fresh, it's original, it's very engaging.  And yes the TURN-BASED COMBAT! Yes, yes, YES!This game is OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD in every respect, totally worth it's price. It's a thinking person's RPG of the decade.			"

												Summary: If the concept of the game draws you, you'l almost certainly enjoy it. If it doesnt, stay far and far away! Torment is a great game that is absolutely not for everyone.Pros:- One of the best stories and writing I've ever seen.- Plays with new ideas and concepts all the time.- A game where violence is rarely ever the only option.- When it happens, combat is very challenging.Cons:- A very short game for it's genre with very few zones. Only 3 main zones and 1 ""mini-zone"".- Companions seem interesting, but have very little to offer or say except one.- Character creation is non-existant, you can decide the gender and that's it.Review: Torment is, for me, an amazing game, one of the best I've played this year that absolutely blew my mind away. If you like the setting and like long reams of well-written dialogue, this game is absolutely for you. But if you are looking for a more traditional RPG, it is absolutely not, because Torment is *not* that kind of game.The game's zones are very rich and fleshed out (sometimes literally). Every NPC has a story to tell and each and every one is worth listening to and fascinating reading. The story is rich and will keep you interested all throughout. Even when the main quest falls into obscurity, the sidequests make up for it, and then some. There are always multiple ways to resolve a quest, and the game's writing and the situations it thrusts you in can leave you on the verge of tears sometimes. I know it did for me.I was disappointed by the lack of zones - Why only 3? And the game's length was very short. By the time you finished the story many things are left unanswered.As always, the lack of possible romance options is a pity. For games that put so much emphasis on the player's ability to choose, it's oddly restrictive in this manner. I can sell a young girl to a slave trader, but I can't choose to kiss someone I like?There's not much more to say. Cons aside, if you read some reviews and read the concept and feel it's for you, it probably is!On the other hand, if you're a little put off by the game's unusual theme and design, it probably isn't.This is one of those games where you can go with your gut.

												For this price at this point of time i would not recomend the game.the playtime you see is the time you require to finish the game if you bother reading all the dialogs and do all side quests. As such I argue that the game is rather small and since its not what i call replayable if you feel thats adequate the game is for you.pros of the game:interesting story, allien environment.innovating puzzles.a world on itsown.innovated combat system (or just buying the rights to use an existing one was too expensive)negatives:-walls of text. at points the game is more of a novel than an actual game and has no naration.-very few encounters. The encounters are well made but quite few, I dont think i remember more than 10 of them but certinly less than 30 in total to finish the game and thats if you choose to take all the fights on an optional quest.-very few classes all with the same gameplay-instances from mereartifacts coud had easily been made actual game stages. instead you get a wall of text and some choises which are no choices really.- linear gameplay. Even compared to baldours gate2 and the original planescape, the gameplay is even more linear.- combat system is poorly designed, with very few options and an early cap. In fact there is almost minimal amount of weapons and weapon selection. as well as skills and spells. x-com has more weapon options and spells and classes than this game but the combat is not comparable to x- coms tactical requirements and most of the time combat can be completely skippsd.... which literally makes the game a novel.-character customization? bad command or file name.-character potraits for the npcs? too lazy to  make those? I mean you spend like 20 or 25 hours of the game talking to npcs.. at least you could see who you are talking to?-grafics are subpar-game intro is rediculously poorly made. The whole falling thing could had been made a cinematic. but I guess its cheaper to write a wall of text than actually draw anything. You supposely fall from the moon to the planet and the only thing you  see is a black screen and a wall of text. ITs definetly an anamnesis... Dos is back.- I seriously tried to fight the last boss... well guess what you cant.-very few maps. I think in total you get less than 30 map screens to explore and thats being generous by supposing there were hidden map screens.easy things that could be done to improve the gameallow a boss fight in the end.skip stupit introremove level capallow the players to participate in the endless war.use  multimedia some more and less wall of texting, or at least use both.add some class variety and allow a different approach for each class in the game. the tides could had been an extra type of magic. Like the shouts in skyrim... nope they are restricted as a deus ex machina for a couple of dialog options. Not even sure why they bothered to make it a skillIn either case the company that made this is blacklisted for me. Especially since they received so much backing from the users.They definetly failed to absorve the founds that were given to them in an effective way. "

								A highly anticipated  uccessor to the Planescape: Torment, it does indeed capture the true spirit of the classic RPG in its best traditions. Even as of its current early development state, Torment: Tides of Numenera promises to become something great. The writing is superb, art style and gameplay are good, and although unfinished at the moment, feel very compelling to the 'wild' nature of the setting itself. What can I say, like with Planescape, I got sucked into the Ninth World, eagerly awaiting to continue.I am not very long into the game yet, but I would add more as I progress.			"

												In short: 6/10.Don't get me wrong tho it is a good game. But it's like that time when two friends of yours invited you to a party. They promised you a lot of good booze, fine classy food, bunch of interesting people to meet with. But when you came to the party there were only two friends of yours with a bucket of chicken wings, a bottle of cola and no other people. I've enjoyed the game but it's too short and pace of the story is not that great. Plus the cut content.  Wait for the sale guys.			"

												In Numenera the only focus is on the story. The class and combat system could have been romoved completely for the game to really shine in its story part. It would be the perfect point-and-click-adventure. Still, in its current form it cannot even slightly compete with Torment 1, because it is basically a point-and-click-adventure with lacking RPG elements.If it were sold as such I would recommend it if not for the name 'Torment' that absolutely requires solid RPG elements. Planescape Torment features, in addition to the perfect story driven focus, a unique and appealing class and combat system. Remember the video for the Mechanus Cannon! This is why Torment is still superior to alike games by far. You could grind for hours in Torment and still have fun. I come to the conclusion that this game is worse than Torment 1 and because of this I would recommend the player to instead buy Planescape Torment.Undeserved, the original Planescape Torment has received worse scores on many game magazines than this game.

								A lot of praise has been given to this title for the writing, and rightfully so. The vocabulary and structure are an elegant delight to read and makes the intimidating undertaking of reading millions of words on a monitor before completion something to actually look forward to.But TTON's strength also lies in the quality of the encounters. They are surprisingly imaginative when taken separately. As you'll gather enough pieces to form a story, it only gets better.All of this is spiced up by interaction with alien tools and skills that get you through strange situations, refreshingly different than typical RPG mythos.

												For all I wanted to love the game, I can't recommend it to people that aren't already invested.No decisions have any meaning outside of a few tiny alterations and a change in the end sequence. The excellent quality of the writing, for the most part, just hints at things that *could* have been, and aren't.You're pushed forwards from one locale to another, and while you can see their histories, their connections feel like pieces are missing between them. You're only shown pieces. While this might be excused in that you're being hunted, it just feels off, as if there were more once, and it got cut. The main theme of the worth of a single life is in no way tied to anything solid. There are many things that could have tied into it and made it an actual theme, but they aren't connected. It's a dialog choice that reappears later and has no real effect. To get any meaning out of it you'll have to dig into this like a first year psych student and make it up yourself. The main reveals throughout are powerful, but muted. You're shown the motivations of the major players and the bit cast, but they come hot and heavy back to back near the end. It feels incredibly rushed. The answers to the origin of the Sorrow are meaningless, as your actions towards it simply push you back into another meaningless choice that only affects the ending, and in a way that is basically identical to another. Gameplay and story are both rushed incredibly as you progress. You get enough experience in the last hour to go up almost 2 tiers (8 levels), which is utterly ridiculous. Speaking of gameplay, the battle system is incredibly sluggish. Pathing and interacting with objects normally is also a bit off. Dialogs will not initiate, you'll talk to companions repeatedly instead of interacting with the object you clicked. You'll bump into geometry. These things aren't rampant and constant, but they occur enough for it to be a regular irritation. Some items refuse to be used in any of the ways they are accessible until you shuffle them in your inventory. Some items simply disappear on use with no effect. These last two are probably for the same reasons, something to do with combat flags sticking around or multiple checks being made and confusing the system.  There's a tiny bit more depth here. A twisted Caster I didn't bother with. I'll eventually do another playthrough, just to poke around, update this if I missed some kind of major gem, but I'm just not feeling it at the moment.*Edit* review written prior to the QoL update. I'll rewrite this if I get around to playing through again.			"

												So how did they manage to ♥♥♥♥ this game up?I waited almost 20 years for this, the game is missing functionality that a game 20 years ago had. Is this real life?The game needs a walk option, running everywhere gives a fake and constant sense of urgency and stress to the character and feel of the game. The Numenera ""point system"" for special actions didn't translate well at all from tabletop to CRPG, especially in form of conversation function. I ran out of intellect? Really? I am stupid now? Oh look, the other characters have some points i can those instead, i guess they are as persuasive  as me.What is the point in this exactly? It completely destroys the whole immersion, in PS:T You could let your companions speak instead, the camera zoomed on them and they spoke, you didn't use their points to convery your intellect.I have played PS:T about 5 times along with FO1,FO2,IWD,IWD2,BG and some other games made by Fargo / Black Isle / Bioware and the story , the charm , the characters and combat made you come back for more. After 4 hours here the only thing making me come back is to make sure this is not really such a bad game because i really don't want to believe it is. It's just sad. After 4 hours of Numenera i feel like i could have finished one of my books in my backlog instead. I chose to play a video game over the books because i expect to play, not run around an interactive book with graphics to go with it , ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat and a crappy interface that would feel ""deep"" to consoles players.To cut the review/rant short:If i haven't had fun or experienced anything special in 4 hours so why should i continue.I am maybe too old for this♥♥♥♥♥♥but i am almost confident that if i launch Torment i will still enjoy it today.So many people hate on the combat in Torment but i don't remember anyone saying it was too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ back in the day. I think it was completely acceptable and a bit refreshing compared to IWD and BG as combat was not the focus of the game anyway.It was realtime with paus function and supplied the main thing a game needs to do: Entertainment.inExile after a mediocre Wasteland 2 and now mediocre Torment are never getting another dime from me, Their games are just not worth my money. PS: I am beyond the ""sit on my♥♥♥♥♥and play games all day and all night"" phase in my life and don't have time for anything but good games. I value my time and will not give this game more than a second chance.Sorry inExile, you messed up and it seems like you sold out based on broken kickstarter promises that i funded.			"

												Literally makes me ill.When you make a dialogue choice there is a half second delay and then scrolls to the next page rather than immediately switching. Either this is a system limitation and they need that time to load (which would be sad since contemporary games like tyranny dont need it and v old games like bg2 didnt either) or its some stupid asthetic choice to make it look more mechanical, which would be fine but there is no option to remove it (and considering there are options like increasing text size this seems a massive oversight). There is a time delay scrollbar for tooltips but not for this. Ive tried a bunch of things and looked online but cant find a fix, if i can then this opion will change somewhat.This delay and movement is making me motion sick (less than 2 hours in) to such a degree im needing to close my eyes whenever i click, and avoiding checking every option.Had to stop playing til i find a fix, and if there isnt one will have to get a refund.The character models are also very ugly and clunky and seem too large to fir the world, and for a story driven game the fact you cant modify the appearance of your character to make it your own is very disappointing, just little tweaks to make it feel more personal and less railroaded.Sure they want you to play a stock character but to compare it to the Baldur's Gate series, you were a child of Bhaal whether you looked like a gnome or a half-orc.

												Just for context I am one of the post kickstarter backers who pledged on the site for 75$. Do I regret buying the game? No, not really. Do I regret backing for extras? Yeah kinda. Torment is devisive game at the moment and I feel that the game is simply not worth it at this time. I may reccomend it at a price drop but there are a number of reasons I cannot reccomend it at the time. So lets break down why I feel this game just isnt what I had hoped for.The Good:-2D backgrounds are really well drawn-Story is good (not great just good) and setting is very unique -Lots of choice and consequence The Bad:-The writing is bloated and a slog to read (they need an editor seriously)-If you play peacefully 99% of the game is reading and going back and forth between NPC's-The crisis have a novel idea but feel rather dull and uninteresting. -Lacks any meaningfull mechanical RPG mechanics outside of conversations-Lots of cut content-Feels like a visual choose your own adventure vs an actual isometric CRPG-Console versions are completely pointless as no regular console player is gonna buy this-exploration is pointless if you dont do any of the combatIf you want a proper CRPG with good writing/conversations AND fun gameplay buy Wasteland 2 and/or Pillars of Eternity. If you liked Planescape Torment and want a game with a kinda similar feel (although Planescape felt more like a game tbh) then sure buy it. But if you want a proper CRPG look elsewhere.			"

												TL:DR: Summary: Get an e-reader instead.First, let’s acknowledge the elephant in the room. It’s quite big. Probably bigger than any land mammal that ever existed. Definitely bigger than the blue whale or even King Kong. Is it bigger than the Bloom? I think so.This elephant is called Planescape Torment and it you have never played it, exit after reading this review. Visit GOG and invest some coppers to play the best RPG OF ALL TIME. Apparently a billion years from now, it still remains the best.Tides is the ‘Spiritual Successor’ to Planescape Torment and I won’t mention it again in this review.On its own merits then…Tides is a top down isometric RPG where there is a lot of reading to be done and hardly one drop of combat to be found. It uses the Pillars of Eternity Engine, a game I enjoyed immensely. You travel the world, recruit members of your gang and collectively adventure through some of the best stories ever told. That is the theory at least.The developers collect a bravery award for designing the most unusual intro and character creation in gaming history. You are falling from the sky. You only see wind and clouds and you have to choose your actions. I died in the first five minutes of the game and had to start again.Wow - I thought. These guys are really pushing the boundaries of gaming. Fantastic! The gaming boundaries are never pushed again.You get trapped in this strange silicon/ translucent Giant's Causeway space where you confirm what action you took in certain (short and not quite of moderate interest) text based adventures and at the end your character is defined. They call it Glaives, Jacks or Nanos. Your stats are Might, Speed and Intellect. You define your skills and abilities, with certain restrictions such as Nanos (mages) cannot choose weapon skills.This beginning section counts as tutorial because you get introduced to some of the game concepts such as using effort and a little combat. That happens in an area (in your mind) called The Labyrinth which should be cool but comes across as one of the lamest ‘main character home’ in history.Crash, BANG! You land on the Ninth World or Earth not as we know it. We have moved on a billion years from now and eight mighty civilisations have risen and fallen. Some of the technology left behind by the previous civilisations is inexplicable and seen as 'magical'. These items and phenomena are collectively known as Numenera.The game world is almost stupendous. It is bright and shiny in the right areas and an upgrade to the moody PoE universe. Things whirl around and make weird sounds. It’s like visiting the best circus in the world. Early on you are able to take advantage of its weirdness and interact with the numenera in your first combat encounter. Imagine being able to take advantage of your environment in combat. You could set rocks to fall. Acidic pipes to burst. Turns out there is little combat and even less opportunities to do this.One of the strangest things in the game is that although you don’t know who you are, for some reason a large number of people do. You are the Last Cast Off. Apparently our little group has been causing havoc amongst the rest of the population and are heavily distrusted.An entity known as The Changing God has lived for a long time moving from person to person to further his own ambitions. Each time he leaves a body behind it gets reborn as it is cast off. As the Last Cast Off you have some powers and can recall memories. Cue about enough text to read as in 30 bibles. Hence, the key question is not does one life matter.  It’s whether computer screens are the right medium to read 30x774,000 words (King James version) approx. ??There are some strange and wondrous things to see. A strange creature trapped in a cage and you meet a crazed cult that worships your father, The Changing God. You could come across a spaceship and a great interstellar beast so big, people live inside it. There is a murder to solve involving a strange group of cannibals that want you on their menu.It’s not enough though. A lot of these adventures are solved easily as all stat checks can be achieved by having a balanced party. The words overwhelm you and there is not enough mindless combat to change the pace. The combat in this game has traditionally been in Real Time with the ability to Pause and use an item or skill. Here we have turn-based combat and it is hideously broken. I suspect this style was introduced for the console crowd. It’s broken and bugged. My game crashed only in combat. It was tedious and slow and poor enemy AI. In one encounter one of my party members that had fallen remained untouched for three rounds or so even as ten enemies could not decide whether to open a door. I kid you not.As you progress through the game and venture forth into new areas the overall story does unfold. There are a few twists and turns and maybe the odd ‘oh’ moment. The Bloom, the final area, is the best section in the game because it is where all the various strands to the game all appear logical and come together. I suspect the choices and consequences are probably the best I have ever seen in a RPG. Actions you take lead to consequences but I think another playthrough with a different style and choices would confirm that. The developers have stated that sometimes there are moree interesting consequences when you fail but how many players would do that when it is so easy to succeed?Ultimately, you may come to the same conclusion as I did.Infinite goodwill plus a crack team of professional and highly experienced games developers plus one of the most successful Kickstarters ever will not deliver a good game.I close my eyes and remove a certain word from this title. I think the game is short, bugged and not of sufficient interest to be worthy of my hard worked for. Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity were pretty awesome though. It's a good attempt though and VERY BRAVE. There is a lot of innovation here and I could be swayed to back Tides 2. Sometimes we buckle under the pressure instead of succeeding.  "

Graphics are DULL, combat is cataclysmically bad, sound is annoying, every time conversation is initiated you're greeted with a loud CLANK!!!! and believe me you'll initiate conversation near constantly. Parting shots: The music was good. I look forward to further releases from these guys, if they put this story exactly in a pillers style universe with pillers combat, it could be a real joy.TLDR: Son, I'm not angry, I'm just dissapointed			"

												Torment is not a ""bad"" game - but it is not a ""good"" Inxile game either. The world building, storyline, characters and lore are all fantastic - at the very least the game has introduced more people to the Numenera universe, which is just a fun world. The problem (as I see it) is that I don't feel that the game systems of Numenera translate themselves that well to a computer based role-playing game.In games of similar context (such as Planescape Torment which this is a spiritual successor to) I would argue that better concessions were made to make the game fun as well as interesting with a storyline. As it stands Torment is basically a choose your own adventure novel in electronic format, which isn't good enough for me.Given the opportunity, I would purchase it again just to support Inxile and the hope that maybe they'll do another game in the Torment universe - its too rich a background not to explore, but I can't recommend that other people buy it.

												I loved the original Torment and liked Pillars of Eternity well enough, which you would think would bode well for this game. Well, no, unfortunatly. I find myself just not being drawn into the story. I cannot make myself care about these charecters. I just can't quite sink my teeth in. I think part of this issue is how much the lore is slapping you in the face right out of the gate and you really have no way of learning more right away. It feels like I picked up the 3rd book in Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones and I have no frame of reference. I wanted to love this game, but if I can come home and choose Netflix over it without batting an eye, that isn't a good sign.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm just a few hours into the beta (which is really more of a long demo) and I'm already sold on this game. It's really everything I was looking for in a sequel to Planescape: Torment, one of my favourite games of all time. I love it when an RPG is more dialogue-focused than combat-focused, it's one of the reasons the original Torment made such a huge impact on me. I felt like I was exploring and discovering a bizarre world, not just hacking through legions of generic thugs (although there was a bit where you could hack through legions of generic thugs). This game is the same, you're not some crazy butcher but a person trying to understand what the hell is going on. I'd like to give you an example of some of the dialogue focus on this game and how everything is custom made for each encounter rather than being very systematic (e.g. when you flee from battle in a Final Fantasy game, it's the same mechanic in every battle, it's not a different thing each time).Early on you're ambushed in a plot-related way. In the initial dialogue sequence you can lie with a speech check and avoid combat.If combat does start, you can take your character to the enemy leader and initiate dialogue with him in battle. You can then pass a speech check to scare him - this gives him a debuff. It's not a generic action, it's based on the events that have just happened and is unique to this encounter.Alternatively a female NPC you're with who has some history with this man can initiate dialogue and reason with him, convincing him to leave you alone.Additionally, maybe you've made a more technically minded character. If so you could activate a nearby gadget. I assume this would damage the enemies but I can't confirm it since I didn't go through with it.There's another party member with you now - I didn't check, but he'll have something to say in battle as well. I wonder what effect that has?You could actually have told your party members to leave you by now. That would have changed this fight in another way.How you deal with this is referenced later and makes a difference.I feel that in other games this would just be a generic fight. You'd battle, they'd die, you'd proceed. Here it becomes an involved, narrative experience where the way you've built your character and the way you want to play the game open it up to different possibilities. Remember, this is just the *combat* - a place where normally dialogue and speech-based characters don't get a chance to shine.There are other great touches, again enchancing the character or plot side of things, like if you tell a party member to leave you, they don't just stand around or vanish, they return to their normal life. One such example is a person who runs a shop in a certain part of town. Everything I have encountered so far has had a lot of effort put into it to convey a strong sense of personality, story, coherency and sense of place. Time and time again I'm pleasantly surprised and impressed.That said, don't buy this now if you're expecting the full game or if you're expecting a totally polished experience.			"

												I'll try to be as on point and brief as possible about my main gripes:Skill system.In conversations you often have the option to use intellect, speed and might to get whichever result you find most appealing.This is a good thing. The problem occurs when your companions can help you with this, because the overall difficulty is below meaningless.It's like it's designed to not let you fail. Even if you do fail one skillcheck, you'll be provided with a second chance or simply getting what you wanted either way by some other conversation option.Add to this that you have more than enough chances to Rest and replenish your stat pools, or simply using ""heal potions"" for any given stat pool. The money to buy any of this is also very abundant.Combat/Crisis:The difficulty here depends a bit on how you build your character and choice of companions, but it's never come off as very challenging in any way.The system itself feels sluggish and slow as I spend 99% of the time in a crisis looking at the enemy go through it's movement/attack animations.Story:Decent? I don't know.. I haven't finished the game, nor am I likely to.I've been a fan of all the infinity engine games (IWD,BG,PS:T) since their first release and always loved a game rich on lore and dialogue/interaction.. but ToN is just disappointing and bland.The writing is so try-hard that it's actually tedious and it feels like the writers sat down with the intention of writing something that is really just difficult to get through.For all the fancy words, phrases and variety of vocabulary it transfers very little meaning.I guess some like that though, to be swimming in a sea of words and phrases just to describe a wooden spoon.Conclusion:It just feels like a missed chance at making something great, it's mediocre at best.. and I wish I hadn't paid for it.

												The strange world provided by both torment games is the thing that attracts me most. The first game was based on planescape which was wonderful, but this of course is different. This is set in Numenra a mix of scifi and fantasy. That may not attract some, but the strangeness of the world attracted me. I only wish there was more. That is probably a good thing, I don't feel like anything is missing altough I do feel that the ending was rushed. I had no idea I was about to finish the game when it happened.Combat was actually pretty fun, but I never got around to trying it out as I played a charming jack that could get out of any situation. I am replaying as a nano now who can read minds, and my that is interesting. I'll do a glaive after that to test out combat some more.			"

												If you are looking for an awesome RPG game like the Planetscape: Torment was, prepare for disappointment. The game just feels boring, the story isn't interesting at all and the narrative isnt ""rich, personal narrative"".Secondly, The graphics in the game aren't stunning - It feels like there hasn't been any development in 18 years?Thirdly, the fight mechanics are just disappointing, If you are looking for nice fight mechanics one should just go back to play Baldur's gate - game series.The game isn't just worth the current price (45 EUR). If this game would have been released 10 years ago, with a price of 15-20 EUR then I wouldn't be so mad. Can't recommend. Asked steam to refund....			"

												I highly recommend this game. It has great storytelling, a wonderfully detailed world, great character building and optimization options, and the ability to actually do roleplaying by playing through the story in a variety of different ways. At the end of the game, it actually wraps up the story of all of the major NPCs as well as for many of the minor NPCs that you interact with in the game, which is more than you can say for Mass Effect 3. If you like text-heavy, deep and interesting roleplaying games, like the original Planescape Torment or Age of Decadence, you will love this game. I don't understand the hate that it's getting - it took me 28 hours to play it from start to finish, exploring every nook and cranny I could, and I regret absolutely none of it. It was a great ride.			"

												So there IS a lot of problems with this game. In particular depending on why you like CRPGs you might hate this. I did not back this on Kickstarter, so can't speak to that. I can say that it feels like a complete game.However, I loved it.If you like tactical combat, and that is what draws you to CRPS, avoid this. The combat is ""eh"" (mainly because I feel like everything is so slow). Depending on how you play, there also is not a lot of it.For example, you can talk or think your way around most combat. I think I only had 5 or 6 combats in my playthrough, and they were ""crisis"" where the victory was not ""kill everyone"" (or at least the only victory), but instead had alternate win conditions. Honestly, I found it super refreshing. You don't often see that in a game.It has an interesting world with an interesting plot. Some of the interactions were really good. One of the party members is up there as favorite party member in any game.Time wise you can probably get through the main quest pretty quickly. However, playing through and exploring and taking your time will probably give you 30-40 hours.HOWEVER,The game does kinda look not so great. If you zoom in the graphics actually look much better (not the character models though. They are aweful). But I like to play more zoomed out, and it just does not look great.I would have also loved to have character portriates while talking to NPCs.I did not run into a lot of bugs, at least until the end. I experienced some loading problems that made it hard to complete the game.TL;DRIf you like character development and exploration, don't mind a lack of combat, and don't mind reading, I highly recomend this game.

												As others have said, ""Meh"" is kind of what this game left me feeling. The overarching story is decent, but the entire package didn't work. I would recommend solely for the story, which is interesting and takes place in an interesting world.Game length - Kind of short for this style of game. I would have liked perhaps a side quest or two for each companion, and at least one more story arc. Overall there are basically 3 open maps to explore, locked from one another. In a single playthrough of Wasteland 2, I had 5x the playtime. Camera - Locked in viewing angle makes precise movement very difficult/impossible in some areas, especially during combat. You had a great system in Wasteland 2, why change it?Replayability - Very few options impact the greater story, only minor plotlines and the end-of-game summary slides. I can tell they put alot of effort in this, but they seemed to lose the forest for the trees. I will say it definitely makes your experience ""technically"" unique, but not disguisably so.			"

												I do like story and dialog heavy RPGs, not so much writing a long stories for a review. But I feel that many reviews bring down the game for reasons not related to its quality (hell, the top review mostly complains about not getting his way with the combat system as a backer).So here we are. I'm enjoying this game quite a bit. Just like the original Torment it's the story that counts. And there's a lot of reading. If that's your cup of tea, you'll probably have a blast. Not quite sure yet if it matches the quality of PS:T in the end, but I am fairly sure it's worth playing, esp. since it is one of a kind these days.Edit: After nearly 40 hours, I can say it's one of my favorite games. Don't buy it if you are looking for a combat heavy RPG like Divinity:OS for example as you'll be disappointed. Do buy it if you are in for the atomosphere, exploration and story.			"

												VERY short for it's price.Honestly, it's not even a RPG, looks more like interactive novel, because it's ALL about dialogues. Why implement all these skills, abilities and items, if you won't need it EVER?Combat is absolutely awful, real pain. Companions are dull (except, maybe Matkina).Massive disappointment after all this waiting. I can't really imagine what inXile did with that $4M of backers money...			"

												Recommend with reservations. I am glad I bought it, but I would read some reviews first if I was on the fence, as it might not be exactly what you are expecting.Pros:- A well done story and interesting locales and writing.- Something different.- Nice to see a different RPG ruleset (even if not faithfully implemented)Cons:-I really wanted to see a computer version of the Pen and Paper rules of Numenera.Unfortunately, this is not that faithful of an adaptation. They added hitpoints, rather than having the damage taken from  your stat pools. This seems like something that could have easily been kept, simply by balancing the game differently (or even keeping everything the same, and altering the pool totals a little)- I don't see why this really needed to be changed.Some other things, like the decision to not interrupt combat for pool spends on defense (in real rules players roll and spend points when attacking and defending) I can understand..but I still think it could have worked.  -I'm ok with it being a dialogue heavy game, I just wish there were more opportunities to actually use all of the abilities you accrue in the game. Let's face it, despite being a game about ""exploration"" and ""discovery"" and only offering XP for discoveries and solving problems, not kills--the pen and paper rules are very tilted torwards a combat focused game. Most of the Focii and abilities are combat related. The same with this PC game, but there just isn't enough combat to justify any of it. Also, most of the cyphers in the game are combat items, but you'll never find a reason to use them.-Game is way too easy and linear, I feel like some kind of wilderness area connecting the three main hubs of the game should have been included. As it is now, you are railroaded through a few small areas where the goal of a quest is often only 50 feet or so away from the various quest givers.  Also, spending points is never reallly something to worry about. I've never had a test in the game where there wasn't someone available in my party with enough points to ensure success on any challenge (even without abusing the local inn to regain points.)-I played this as someone who is very familiar with the source material. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it as much if I wasn't familiar with all of the lore namedropping that the game employs. Not sure how all of the lingo from such a unique setting works when it's not always explained.------I know there are a lot of cons here, I just think this could have been something so much greater. I probably won't feel the need to play it more than once. yet...still was enjoyable the first time. ------Caves of Qud, despite being an altogether different setting, is probably what I'll return to when I feel like playing something Numenera-ish in the future. Check it out if you want to scavenge the remains of long lost civilizations in a science-fantasy type setting.			"

												TL:DR: Like it’s predecessor, Tides of Numenera is both deep and unique. If you’re expecting something more superficial and action-packed, move on.  If, however, you’re willing to play and read a captivating story that seemingly takes place across myriad volumes of sci-fi novelettes, play on!Like Planescape: Torment, Tides of Numenera gives back what you bring in to it.  It is rich in story, and never lacking in intrigue.  The combat and graphics may not be what some people seem to have wanted, but if that's what you were looking for then you picked the wrong class of game. This is more of a tome of philosophy and diversity than your typical cRPG: it brings both familiar and alien perspective to life with a brilliantly creative writing style that is sure to captivate any willing imagination.  To that end, it is a perfect spiritual successor to PS:T.When I think back to PS:T, I think of all amazing stories that seemingly random NPCs would have to share about their travels across the planes and how their lives were irrevocable altered--for better or worse.  I wonder about the relationship of the protagonist and the antagonist, about the circumstances of the very mufti-faceted reality that governed the story’s landscape, and what can really change the nature of man. It has been nearly two decades and those stories and philosophies still resonate with me to this day.  I can confidently say that after my first play-through, clocking in at nearly 48 hours, T:ToN will be apart of my future in much the same way, and in some ways, maybe even more so.I’ve only played through once, but I know for certain that choices *do* matter in this game.  Not every NPC needs closure, and might not get it, so some choices my seem ‘empty’ because you don’t see your various cookie-cutter meta-moral status bars adjust.  You have to remember though, this game has stories within stories. And as I said, it gives back what you bring in. While it *may* not always find fruition in the game, I can well imagine the fate of someone who’s life I impacted, and how they may one-day tell their story to another pilgrim of the Ninth World (assuming of course, they are around to tell it) and I sure as hell would be quick to pick up a book that comes out related to *any* of the characters I came across in this game.  However, there are many quests, dialogue options, and interactions that I could have done *very* differently, or in a different sequence that would have made real changes to the story and future in a variety of ways.  Let’s just say I have *big* plans for experimentation on my second play-though.. admittedly I *will* need some time to let this play-through sink in before I dive in again.I have read other reviewers claim that the game is too short, or warn that it cuts off in a manner similar to Tyranny, and nearly every negative review has something to say about combat To those issues I can only expound upon the aforementioned: my first play-though was almost 50 hours, and I definitely missed stuff. I didn’t find the ending to be abrupt at all. I thought each act had perfectly adequate pacing for both the story and character stat progression—I had to measure out my actions carefully in act one, but by the last act I was confident I could handle whatever came my way.. except maybe the weight of my own choices.  While I loved Tyranny’s emphasis on choice and dialogue, I would feel remiss to lump these two games into the same category, T:ToN is far more story-intensive, and you can see that story through to the end. Like PS:T this is not an item-based game.  If you’ve played any turn-based cRPGs before then you know the drill: you’re going to have to wait a bit during a ‘crisis.’ I really only actually fought in probably half of the crises, but considering the crises make up about .01% of the game, I think the combat was challenging enough to warrant the circumstances leading up to them, and rewarding no matter how they ultimately played out..It is hard for me to review a game like this because, like a good book, it is really more of an intimate experience that begs lengthy discourse.  All I can really say is if you *do* decide to play this one, accept it for what it is--rather than how it’s *not* whatever else is out there--and really play it.  Get to *know* everyone, explore every nook and plunder every cranny.. interact with everything you can.. it will be worth it. Find out just how much you believe one life matters.			"

												I loved Choose your own adventure books when I was a kid. But I'm not a kid anymore, the world and lore is really cool, the story is... alright I guess. They don't really use the setting in any weird and interesting way. Also it's way too easy...It reminded me a lot of wasteland 2, a wasted opportunity with the illusion of choice and impact on the world. It is as verbose as Planescape, but nowhere as weird or fun.Maybe it'll get better with expansions ?			"

												This game is AWESOME. If you want a good story and reactivity, I can't recommend it enough. It has great writing, an interesting setting, the locations look amazing, soundtrack is good and I had no problems or bugs at release. It has a lot of text and very little combat - the focus here is on story and exploration, not tactics. Combat is not only rare but always avoidable - every problem has multiple possible solutions, and combat is just one of those. The game if somewhat short, but very involved: every dialogue is full of options, and even straight up failure often opens new and interesting paths (sometimes failure gets the most interesting outcome). There is a lot of interconnected options, with subtle consequences for most of your choices (even the seemingly unimportant ones). There is also a lot of explore, items to discover, things to meddle with and find out what they do... even if it sometimes kills you. Especially if sometimes it kills you - finding ways to die is actually kind of important for some quests.The setting is very weird, but in a good way. Places and people and items are unique and fun to learn about, instead of another old story about the lost dwarven kingdom or the millistaristic alien society. Instead you have veterans of a psychic war, a whole city inside a huge blobby creature and ancient... candy dispensers. It is sometimes grandious, sometimes creepy, sometimes philosophical, sometimes gruesome, sometimes silly.Now, this game was crowdfunded, and in this aspect the game was a huge disappointment. The developers made super ambitious promises that they weren't able to fulfill, made some big changes and didn't communicate well. But if you are planning to buy this after release, this doesn't really matter for you... it's just us backers being bitter.			"

												I only have one problem with this game:You know that one level in every RPG? The one where you enter the ""dreamscape"" or the extra-planar pocket, the memory realm or go ""inside the computer?"" That one level that's full of a bunch of random nonesense, with all kinds of crazy art, and literally every single NPC you meet says stuff like, ""I'm the one who sees, but is unseen,"" or ""this is the nexus of all places, where anything is possible, all futures exist... or is it? Maybe, maybe not. Is it reality? What is reality? If a tree falls in the forest..."" You know, *that* chapter of the game that makes no sense but you can tell the developers thought they were being philosophical, edgy, and avant garde?EVERY SINGLE PART OF THIS GAME IS *THAT* PART. Every map is full of crazy nonsense. Every single character, from your companions and major antagonists to lowly shopkeepers and random street NPCs, is a red herring enigma rubik's cube that vomits a never-ending stream of sphinx riddles at you if you so much as introduce yourself. ""I'm the last of the first, doomed to walk the ever-dream of the nightmare labyrinth for all eternity. Want to buy some weapons or armor?"" The item descriptions go even further: ""This thing is unlike anything you've ever seen. It defies classification. It's made from something you don't recognize and it does something wildly unpredictable. You have no idea what this is or what it's for. It's worth 120 space bucks.""All that being said, I'm recommending this game for every other part they got right. The art is amazing, the sound and voice acting are great, the game system is clever, and I never encountered a single bug.			"

It's a mishmash of mostly unrelated stories interwoven with setting as the common thread, and most--or perhaps  exclusively--rewarding to the sort of gamer who is comfortable with experiencing those stories by proxy and through dialogue.

												Unlike most RPG's character creation is limited. You don't get to name your character or customize their appearance. You're either a man or a woman with ""smooth, light brown skin"" and ""good muscles - strong, but not bulky - and slim hips."" The games stats, skills and abilities are not exactly the same as those found in Planescape: Torment nor do they have the breadth of a hardcore D&D ruleset but there is enough to be found to create a unique build. The game will add much more depth as you begin leveling up. Your character will be named The Last Castoff for the entirety of the game.The game has elements of time travel, segments that take place within your own mind (The Calm), and often pivots around interactive memories. At first the game is more than a little overwhelming with all the strange naming conventions and world building elements. It takes some time to get your footing.If you don't like reading this game is not for you. It's basically one huge choose your own adventure novel. You'll spend 90% of your time reading.The writing is superb throughout, with just enough humour and wonder to keep the games dark tone from becoming suffocating. The writing can feel a bit disjointed at first. However that disjointed feeling is INTENTIONAL. Every strange, semi-nonsensical conversation is a layer to the story. The more layers you add, the more the story grows and the deeper, more understandable narrative emerges.The brilliance of Torment: Tides of Numenera's writing really hits home during the games final hours when a whole host of smaller story threads, characters and decisions finally bare fruit. It took me 47 hours to complete my first playthrough. That is reading everything, thoroughly searching every area and completing every side quest (which are all great and interesting). Things do play out differently depending on the choices you make so there is incentive to replay the game again.Torment: Tides of Numenera put together a solid group of companions to explore the Ninth World with and I know I will think about Tybir and Rhin in particular for years to come.What will put some people off is the combat. There just is not very much of it to speak of. I had played for almost 8 hours before I had a single fight. Every fight is a set piece that affects the story. All told I probably had to fight less than 20 times in the entire game. Now that number will vary a lot player to player because you can talk your way out of (or into) a lot of the fights. Even so I doubt there is even 50 fights to be had even if you went looking for them. It would have been nice to have some more combat to help break up the extraordinary amount of text you'll read during the course of completing the game.Because you so rarely fight it can be hard to really get a handle on the games combat system. With Torment: Tides of Numenera you don't really feel like you have a firm grasp on everything until the end of the game. Not that the combat is all that tough even when you take inexperience into account. Other than the first few fights most of the difficulty during combat comes from the unique elements of that set piece encounter. Are you trying to escape? Are you trying to interact with objects? Are you trying to just stay alive against waves of enemies? From the mid-point onward your party is pretty damn powerful.When you are fighting you'll often also be given the option to speak with enemies, convincing them to flee, change sides and more. If you do die, most of the time, you won't have to reload a save. That's because death is a core gameplay and story mechanic in Torment: Tides of Numenera. When you die you'll awaken in The Calm, the labyrinth within your own mind. There may be times when you'll find it expedient to die on purpose. Once you are done you simply enter a portal and awaken again in the real world.Which could leave you feeling like the game is now too easy or has no consequence but Torment: Tides of Numenera still finds ways to make you fight hard to live most of the time.The game is beautiful to look at. Equal parts gorgeous and horrifying (in a good way). Assets are not reused and each location is unique. The game is only semi-open, meaning once you leave a major location you cannot backtrack. However the games two main hubs (the rustic but also futuristic Sagus Cliffs and the monstrous, nightmarish Bloom) are vast and full of characters to interact with and quests to complete. It's unfortunate the fast travel system in Sagus Cliffs is poorly implemented and there isn't one at all in The Bloom.The music is great but not as memorable as that found in some other recent RPGs. There is very little voice work.There are relatively few bugs though I did have the game freeze on me once, and I encountered a few instances where I had to reload a save when NPC's, companions or the main character got stuck in an animation or failed to move like they should, preventing the game from progressing. There were also a few instances where dialogue referenced the wrong gender for my main character. I must point out I completed my first playthrough on a review build I received on February 9th so it is likely patches and changes will be present in the final build players will experience.			"

												Finished playthrough at around 55 hours.Although it fell short of its ultimate potential, Torment: Tides of Numenera is still an excellent RPG set in an unforgettable world. Seamlessly blending fantasy and science fiction, the setting and writing are by far its strongest points. That being said, the game is almost entirely dialogue. If you don't like reading - and I mean REALLY reading - this game is definitely not for you. The combat is few and far-between, and is mostly avoidable entirely except in a few plot instances. Now, I was not a Kickstarter backer, so I can't comment on what they did not include in the game, what they said they would, etc. I'm just going to review what made it to the final product.PROS:- Amazing writing, memorable characters, fun companions (the first two you encounter are honestly the most boring), a treasure trove of lore and exploration.- Fast and easy leveling and skill system (a little TOO easy, some might say...)- Death is an important part of the game - you'll actually gain bonuses by exploring things in the Labyrinth inside your head whenever you kick the bucket. Finding new methods of suicide is always fun.CONS:- Combat sucks. There, I said it. You can easily overpower almost any enemy from an early point in the game, even without using cyphers. The combat itself is painfully slow, and just plain boring.- Your character becomes far too powerful too quickly. I played a Nano, and after selecting the stealth trait tree, all I had to do in combat is hide for the crit/damage bonus and then and cast Maelstrom. Boom, combat over. Skill check? I've got 3-4 Edge in whatever. Instant success. I never even really used any ciphers except the perma-boost ones.- The Tides don't do much of anything. It has a tiny effect on people's first impressions (I only noticed this 2, maybe 3 times in the entire game). They're supposed to be what makes castoffs so special, but aside from the rare Surge opportunity, they're utterly pointless.- Little to no replayability once you know all the twists and turns of the plot. The most meaningful choice in the game happens...yep, at the very end. Just reload your final save if you want to change the world.All things considered, it's worth the money. Just don't expect a genre-breaking epic saga like the old Infinity games and you'll have a good time.			"

												A fine RPG in the tradition of Planescape. Decent characterization that is a little thin at times - exposition-heavy dialogue does that - and a story that comes full circle (it's not surprising, and you'll probably figure it all out well before it's explained). The graphics are servicable, with nice touches of special effects here and there, as is the sound. The music isn't particularly memorable but fittingly ambient. A good and relatively short story with some limited replayability. I found myself somewhat curious about the nature of the game's main ""Antagonist"" but it not so much I'd pick this up again for a long while, hoping to read something I already haven't. Recommended, especially on sale below twenty dollars.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is shaping up incredible so far.Interesting Dialogues, a wierd awesome world, choices that do matter, interesting characters and companions.there is not much else to say about his game. if you like deep and intelligent narrative spiced with tactical Turn based combat this is the game for you.be aware though its still early to chip in. The game will be buggy, the combat currently is the worst offender in that regard. So please make sure you do realise this is an early access.if that didnt stop you from buying the game, welcome to the Ninth world (you Sexy Person)			"

												My god...this game is so boring. I can't even play it. Its so boring...just talk which is alot of crap that has no real meaning.  Oh but now i can help someone fix a clock after 20 mins of dialog that means nothing. I am not even bothering to read the crap people say now because its so intensely boring. I played repeat runs of Baldurs Gate 2 and Planescape Tomorment but i never had issues with any game having so much pointless dialog.If there is a plot in this game you won't see if for at least the first 45 mins and if its as good as the conversations people have with you then it will be aweful.

												For the game being an interactive novel, the intro didn't grab me enough to get me invested in the story. I tried giving it a chance, and I do love to read, but I didn't feel compelled to go past the 2 hour refund time limit.I hope other poeple can enjoy it.			"

												I would like to recommend this game, but in its current state I simply can't.I've played it thoroughly. I really tried to like it. But given the amount of time and money inXile had for the development it leaves me with mixed feelings.I'll revise this review over time as gain more insight.What follows are not 100% dispassionate observations, but mostly my personal opinions.What I liked in the end:+ Choices, many different choices: Morally difficult choices. Even though some of the choices you make might be just an illusion of freedom since the outcome will be the same, you still choose your own path.+ Character with unique abilities.+ Very good overall writing: Solid story. The plot... see below.+ Soundtrack: It's varied. It contains Armenian duduk piece (which I personally like).+ Stable game: At least in my case I have had only a single crash in over 70 hours of playing. The experiences of other players may differ.Here what I didn't like:- Annoying bugs: The game doesn't accept certain or all inputs after an loading screen and so forth. On my first play-through, close to the end of the game, the loading screen got stuck at 49% when I tried to enter one of the fathoms where my party members were trapped. I had to reload older savegames and tried many variations of entering and leaving zones until being able to get through to the Oasis Fathom.- The general plot of the game is very derivative: If you played the original Planescape: Torment, you'll probably notice far too many parallels. You can smell the plot twists, if you want to call it that, from a mile a way due to blatant foreshadowing. Although the story and the writing itself isn't bad.- The combat system is awkward: I'm not sure how the tabletop handles these things, but in the computerized version it simply lacks tactics. The concept of the combat is solid, but I feel the environments in which the combat happens could have been designed better in many cases. The developers should have taken a closer look at Divinity: Original Sin, a game that does excellent turn based combat (although with its own balance issues)- Balancing: Nanos are way too strong compared to other classes. Especially when you go down a path where you avoid combat when possible, where you probably invest a lot into intellect and intellect edge, the Nano becomes far too devastating with its offensive spells in the few forced combat situations.Especially when you have a nano heavy group, many of the cyphers become pretty much useless. Unless you have Rhin in your group, get her to tier 3 and make use of her Cypher Adept ability, which kind of turns here into a 2nd Callistege or Nano Last Castoff in destruction capabilities, it's often better to just sell most of them. For the money you get from selling your cyphers, you can buy plenty of 'sleep' in order to refill your pools and hitpoints.If you're playing a Glaive of Jack they're more useful.- Graphics can be crude: In many areas if you don't zoom out as far as possible game game is not a pretty sight. Although some areas have beautiful renderings. Sure, graphics are not such an important factor for a game that lives off a textual narrative, but since the game insists on zooming in all the way every time you die and come back from the labyrinth or the first time you load a safe after you started the game, it's still another one of those (fixable) little annoyances.Maybe in a couple of months, when things get patches and perhaps the community adds additional content (some of which was cut and original ones) I could recommend the game. But not like this.			"

								Just like the first Torment game, Brilliant.Some tech bugs being ironed out as is normal for early access.  Story rich.  If you like to sit down with a coffee and immerse yourself in an intrigueing game with fantastic story threads and think before you leap then this game is for you.  Torment was one of the best RPG games I ever played and this one is already a worthy sequel.			"

								It's hard for me to recommend this game in the state it is in. I should not of purchased this in early access as it is buggy and frustrating. The main thing is I should not of purchased early access for a heavy story driven RPG, as it will spoil the story. So for ME, in MY opinion its better to wait this out until this is a polished and complete game. That way I can be fully immersed in the story and not be side tracked by the bugs.			"

												This is initial thoughts/impressions.  I will post a proper review when I have spent more time with the game but I just want to get my thoughts in writing.  First things First: this is easily my most anticipated game of the last couple years (I am literally playing this the day Zelda Breath of the Wild came out, that level of anticipation).  I played Planescape: Torment around 2011 and absolutley adored it, but was unable to finish it because of several game breaking glitches that I couldn't find my way around.  Still loved the game enough to be stupidly hyped for this.I have good and bad first impressions: The good is it captures the feel of the original with a world that is nearly (but not quite) as imaginitive and alien.  The combat system is INSTANTLY better and is no longer the mindless chaos that a lot of old CRPG battle systems tend to be.  The interface is deep but also accessible, Im pretty sure with time I'll be able to fully get into it.The Bad: The soundtrack is kinda dull, for the follow up to a game that had such a rich and memorable score its kind of upsetting we ended up getting generic background music. The intro to the game is very cool with you falling out of the sky and all, but I'm not a fan of how blunt the tutorial section is; in Planescape Torment you wake up on a chopping block, completely unaware of your surroundings, and are then given the opportunity to immediately to go explore and learn about this bizarre world around you; here you end up fuddling around with screens a bit too much.  I'll post an updated review when I have one but I'm having fun so far.			"

												Edit: I've now finished the game and I should edit this review. The original post is at the bottom. Also, I was a backer on kickstarter for the game.Since my original review was more a warning about bugs, I can say all totaled I ran into six bugs that caused either a freeze, a crash or logic bug that hurt gameplay. The last being a shop bug where I managed to lose all my money. There are other bugs, including pathing issues, but they were easy to work around. In fact, I managed a work around on all the issues I found.I'm a fan of this genre of computer game and I was really anticipating this title based on the talent involved and the description of the product. As an exploration game, it's very interesting and I did get lost in the world at times. By the time of release, I knew what I was getting in terms of art and music and I found it appealing.I wish there was more to do with the companions as I didn't feel a particularly strong connection with most of them. And for a story that explored so many ideas, it feels like the ending could have been stronger.Ultimately, the gameplay is weak. I played the pen and paper Numenera rpg over the course of a year and I don't think any of the strengths of that game made it into the computer game. The whole purpose of the multiple stat pools is to make encounters were each character has different responsibilites, and each action has consequences for the characters performing that duty and the overall encounter.Instead, the crisis feel like your standard crpg encounter but hobbled by a thin out-of-place conflict resolution system. It's great that almost every problem can be solved without combat but why are all the advancement options centered on combat? Why not give the characters spells and abilites to improve their non-combat interactions and then make the social encounter more complex and interesting?And if you're not going to make social, mental or dexterity encounters more complex, why use the Numenera system over something like the Pillars of Eternity combat system? It would have been better to stick to what works in the genre until someone really wanted to make a Numenera computer game. You don't need Numenera to tell a science fantasy story and, here, the story is underserved by the mechanics.I'm sure there's good answers to all these questions but I cannot divine them. In terms of a recommendation, I would say that if you like the graphic novel style of storytelling, this has a lot of good moments. In terms of style and imagination, it's a good vision of the science fantasy setting of Numenera. It is not, however, a good interpretation of Numenera mechanically nor is it strong as a modern crpg.original review:Bugs, there's just too many. I can overlook a lot of them but after sitting through a ton of bad poetry and have the following major crisis fail so that I have to go through the same dialogs over and over, that is just too much.The story is interesting and I'll try to play through it but I can't tell firends to buy this until there's a bug patch or two.

												As a Kickstarter backer for this game I can only say that the final product is a disappointment.The highlight of the game is the main story and maybe the back-story for 1 or 2 companions. The main story is good.However, everything else ranges from bad to mediocre:- Combat is bad and using “unintuitive mess” to describe it could be considered a euphemism. I would not call it a complete fiasco cause it's “functional” but there is no tactical layer and it's not fun.- Skill system is not far from combat: stat pools, edges, ability or skills, extra effort, resistances and fettles are words used to describe all the useless abilities of your character.- Lore dump surprise attacks. Now this depends on the person but I feel that my time is wasted when I read about a memory and then I realize that the entire exposition was pointless.- Uninspired quest design. The game doesn't bring anything new to the table in terms of choices and consequences. There is nothing innovative or surprising for someone who played Fallout or Arcanum. In fact the game fails to replicate the intricacies of the original game.- Bloated UI. It seems inXile cannot into UIs cause this one is worse than the one from Wasteland 2.I reserve the right to change my review in case the rest of the game is stellar but I don't think it will happen.I wanted to like the game, I gave it a fair chance but I cannot recommend it.Edit: The ending is really bad cause the main story unravels in something simply incomprehensible. The villain of the game reveals to be lame and uninteresting - a quality shared by many characters involved in it. It's shocking to know that such a story and companions were written by writters well known in the game industry.Ending slides were incomplete and wrong (I got the ending slides for a companion which I've left at the start of the game while no ending slides appeared for a character which accompanied me for the entire game !?) By the way, all companions have very shallow back-stories.While there are a couple of good moments to be found, this game rarely shines in any department. As such the no recommandation rating remains.			"

												What can change the nature of a man?Torment: Tides of Numenera might not be able to meassure itself with our beloved Planescape: Torment and its not a true successor albeit it does try to be a spiritual one. TToN offers a good story, interesting companions/npcs, and great visuals.This game is not for those that expect a CRPG with action/fighting being the main part, this game is for those that wants to ponder about philosophical topics and the very question about life itself. Every action you take will have a consequence you wont foresee. Instead of the usual type of combat, we instead have a ""Crisis"" Its turn based combat where you are also able to solve the crisis with persuasion etc. This means that you don't really have to think to much about combat, but rather have to think about solutions. If you don't like reading, thinking and explorer your companions, then this is not what you look for! most of the critics will tell you they don't wanna read a book, but this is the very reason TToN succeds for so many of us! I felt attached to my companion and the protaganist (The last castoff) story and felt wanting more and more! It does have a few techical problems, but nothing beyond what is normal for released games now a days.I don't think there is any reason to make a huge review, because this game will be a love/hate relation for most the try/have it. So if you like to ponder about life and philosophical matters and expirience a rich story that can develop very differently for each of us! The this is the game for you.If you are still uncertain if you want the game or not, do consult the god in your pocket for advice.			"

												I'm about 10 hours into the game and I will say the story is fantastic! Characters are great, dialogue is very well written and entertaining. This is a text heavy game, and you can't skip over it without missing out on the fantastic story lines. YES there is LOTS of reading. It's not very combat heavy at least during the 10 hours I've played, and the game is designed so that you can avoid combat through dialogue if you build your character to do so. I'll add more to this review as I play more, but for the first day of play through, I give this a BIG thumbs up.			"

								At this point, I can't honestly recommend this game.  The concept is great and I like where it is going, but in it's current state... Wait until it is further along unless you are seriously looking to provide feedback.  Here are my biggest gripes so far:-The horrendously long beginning sequence just needs to be dropped alltogether.  I understand what the devs where going for here, but it falls flat, and made me almost not even give the game a chance.  Far too heavy on expostion, that even now (about 15  hours into the game) has not ONCE been referenced in any way.  In essence, it all feels like meaningless filler, all the while, I'm like, ""When the hell do I finish creating my character and START the damn game already?!""  It really seems more like the devs mean to wow people with how outlandish the lifeforms and ideas in the world are, which is great, I'm all about weird and different, but it doesn't seem relevant and throws WAY too much info at the player too fast.  Two hours or so later and I'm talking to the first two companions and I was wondering why they didn't start the game at that point.  It would be, IHMO, ten times more expedient and exciting that way.-Bugs and lack of optimization galore; my new gaming rig is less than two months old and is getting playstation-era loadtimes... Several times, the map extended beyond the GUI boundaries, sometimes menus can't be opened at all or the character stops responding to mouse clicks, requiring a re-load, sometimes even a complete reboot of the game.  NPCs keep telling me to do quests that have already been finished.  Like, after freeing a man from exectution, one of my companions warns me every time I sleep that the man will be killed soon.  Or, after completing another quest, the journal tells me to report to the person I already reported to.  Or, being told that there is a NEW murder that happened this night, then being told the details of an earlier murder which we already discussed in detail.  Ugh...-Your character receives negative buffs (fettles) when you pick up cyphers, but since you cannot (yet) sell items, the ""quest rewards"" actually gimp your character as they keep stacking and making your character LESS able to perform skills.  Granted, this will be fixed to a degree as the vendors are incorporated into the game, but for now, it means I just have a desire to junk all of the cyphers I pick up.Don't get me wrong, I think there is insane POTENTIAL for this game.  I loved Planescape: Torment and the previous work of this team and have a lot of faith in them.  The game just isn't there YET.  I'm sure that a few months down the line, I'll be able to give a more polished game the thumbs up.			"

												Let me preface this first by saying that Planescape Torment is my 1# favorite game of all time and that I value story above everything in else in games.With that said I will write Pro/Cons first and finish off with my overall thoughts on the game.Pro: - Great story- Well written characters & party members- Unique world(s) and setting- Good OST that feels very reminiscent of PS:T- Dialogue heavy- Can avoid 90% of combat through dialog- Choice & consequence- Unique alignment system- Multiple endingsCons- Interface Bugs- Clunky combat system (Turn based combat)- Short- Cut contentConclusion: I really enjoyed it after my 35 hours of playing it even though I expected this game to be longer given it's long development time (4-5 years).The party members were very varied and unique and I'm really happy about one specifically that I won't mention here due to spoilers that I'm glad to have ""stuck"" through to the end with him/her. (Pat Rotfuss's character that he wrote is the one I'm referring to..if you really wanna know who it is look it up).inXile managed to turn Monte Cook's Numenera world into something that should be experienced by anyone who is not afraid of CRPG's that are very wordy/dialogue heavy and are interested in playing something unique that has never been done in terms of setting.""It's a Torment game alright"" is a phrase you will hear/read a lot about this game. What that entails is a lot of text to read, bad-mediocre combat and the ultimate question that must be you must find an answer to just like it's predecessor: ""What does one life matter""?Do I recommend Torment: Tides of Numenera? YES! "

												I backed this Kickstarter because they promised that their game would be a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment. What I got was a game with a pretty forgettable story, in an interesting setting, with really bad, slow combat, and a completely pointless skill system. It's not terrible by any means, but it's not worth the asking price of $45. I've been thinking about Planescape: Torment my whole adult life, but I thought the story in Torment: Tides of Numenera was pretty dull and I mostly didn't care at all about what was happening aside from the world lore, minor NPC characterization, and side quests. The plot is basically just going from scene to scene doing fetch quests around fixing a MacGuffin, which had me irritated. but I'm probably not going to remember anything distinct about playing this game 6 months from now. Still, few games keep me playing long enough to see them to the ending, so I'm going to give this a conditional recommendation if you can get it on sale. It has elements of a good story that I feel are worthy of experiencing for yourself, but it's pretty blah otherwise.Side Note: I'm playing Final Fantasy 5 now and after the second boss when Syldra sacrifices herself to the whirlpool to save the main characters, I felt more emotion in that moment over a 16 bit JRPG dragon dying than the entirety of T:ToN.

												TToN nowhere near classics rpgs!1. It's short. Two main locations only: Sagus Cliffs (beta) and Bloom. Other areas are tiny2. They (inXile) lied about almost everything in Kickstarter campaign. Where is big city in the desert? underwater market? numenera crafting? 7th companion? stronghold? etc.3. Six boring companions. All humans. Warriors, mage, assasin, little girl (she is interesting character. but her story is pretty short, as well, as the whole game.) Talking skull Morte much interesting and funny alone than 6 bots in TToN.4. 80% of quests are boring. I liked some quests in Sagus Cliffs (crazy AI was good one for exmpl, red circles..). But most dialogs was abstract texts of nothing.5. Simplistic gameplay. Talk -> [trigger-answer] -> intellect points check -> XP.6. There are not many battles in game (somewhat like 5 necessary and 10 unnecessary). you don't need combat abilities, ciphers, armor, weapons and other stuff. No XP for battles.7. performance drops in the end of game. crashes during battle (infirmary). sometimes turn stuck on enemy so you need to reload.dont be fooled by positive reviews. TToN looks like lovely classic rpgs. in fact it is SHALLOW, SHORT (I have a lot hours counted because game was minimized to tray most of my playing time) and UNFINISHEDsry for bat english. piece			"

												This game is not for me. I loved Divinity Sin, the Shadowrun games, Pillars of Eternity and recently, Tyranny.  All of these games had a great balance of role playing and combat.  The combat in this game is horrible and t otry to disguise it by ""focusing on role playing"" is a disgrace to the term role playing.  I am a dungeon master for tabletop games including Numenera. Yes, avoiding combat using clever ideas is awesome, but it's not always going to happen as such and shouldn't.  In this game it just feels heavy handed.  This game does not feel like a 45 dollar steam game, 20 maybe 30 but nowhere near a AAA title.			"

												TLTR: 11/10 when judged as an indie-RPG focusing on script and interactive environment. I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for a combat-RPG. Torment: Tides of Numenera v1.01Torment is an amazing game for several reasons.The development focus and priorities have been fantastic! The script, the interactive environment, the maturity, the story, the character-building, and the gear are amazingly well done.RPG-FocusFirst of all this RPG is about your character. For reference most other RPGs are about all the other characters you meet, while your character is a shell with combat abilities. In Torment your past is the red line throughout the story, and it's one of the elements that make this game one of the best RPG ever made (if not THE best).ScriptThe script, affording the game more than a million words (more than twice that of the Lord of the Rings triology), is pure quality! I don't know if I'm even able to convey the totality of that statement. Every character I've met have been interesting. Everything in the story – the place itself, what happened, the people, the powers that be, the technology, your role in it all – it all fits and is interesting. There is intentional confusion and it works, unlike stories that just try to make it work. In fact the script containst the whole spectrum of literary techniques, in just the right amount and in the right places. It's inventive and original in content. The personalities I've met made sense psycologically. I never once got the feeling that there was some novice writer trying to sell me a poorly re-written classic. Everything I've seen in Torment: ToN has been a new experience. It is a new classic, through and through.StoryI haven't completed the game yet so I don't know exactly how good it will turn out to be. But I have enough pre-knowledge of the Ninth World and of the development of Torment to recognize that it all fits perfectly together so far. With a bit of thought I'm able to see some of what's between the lines of what I'm experiencing directly in game, and see that it fits. The elements that are forseeable are that way because I pay attention to the characters and the plot, not because it repeats old cliches. The story is original and fits this setting perfectly. So far the story has been stellar. It's also mature.InteractionBeyond the story, the gameplay revolve around interacting with the environment. Both people, objects and phenomenons. There are events you can participate in like a quest, but some of them will also unfold if you choose to not involve yourself. Time lapses when you choose to sleep, and how often you need to sleep depend upon your ability to manage your resources.Interaction happens through a dialogue-interface. Character-skills, items, past choices and how you have affected the environment around you already, can all affect how you can conduct said interaction and what you can get out of it. Some interactions just let you get to know the setting better or affords you knowledge you needed for something. Other revolve around something you want to achieve, and they are resolved through weighted luck influenced by your character-build and how much resources you're willing to put into the task to improve your odds at succeding. Many interactions starts out as one of the two, then turns into the other. There are often several ways to go about a task, and you can often choose your approach. They aren't equal however. An example is a certain encounter where you may be tempted to kill a certain character. Doing so will enable you to loot her, but not doing so will afford you a unique skill. You can't do both.The resolution is based on what your character is trying to achieve. It's not a given that succeeding affords you the best outcome. An example is one of the times I fiddeled with some old tech to scrounge valuables from it. I failed but instead found something far more valuable.The interactions are perhaps the best I've seen in any game. They convey the people and setting extremely well while affording you great gameplay. I love it!Character-BuildThe charater building is great within the frame of the game as a whole. You wont find any customization of your looks (beyond sex), nor of your background. This is actually really good because it allows the game to revolve around who your character was before you started playing.You select between a group of descriptors and roles, ending up with a combination of 3 of these. The role you pick further gives you some options to choose from in the form of stats, skills and abilities. These will have a bigger impact on how you play the game than any RPGs since the 1999 classic Planescape: Torment. The range of skills and abilities are great, and you have to make some hard choices. The game accomodates a flexible character very well, as opposed to the min/max dogma of traditional RPGs.Some Examples of Notable Skills & AbilitiesScan Thought. With this ability you will read the thoughts of most NPCs most of the time. For reference other games with mind-reading abilities affords you an effect once in a while. It lifts a veil between you and their intentions and what's going on behind the sceenes. The drawback is that it can only rarely be used to resolve an interaction, although sometimes it does unlock new dialogues.Perception is a skill that expand alot of interactions. It's used often and thus quite valuable to have, but the tradeoff is that it's the most redundant skill amongst your party-members. They can use it instead when resolving interactions, reducing it's value for your character (in a good way).Anamnesis is similar in function to perception and Scan Thoughts, only focused inwards on yourself. It's your aptitude to summon flashbacks from your forgotten past. These flashbacks lifts the veil between you as a player and the past of your character.There are otherwise 3 social skills, 3 knowledge skills, 3 agility skills, 3 strength skills, 5 combat skills and 3 skills that only afford your character out-of-interaction properties. A couple of the skills see little use, but most of them are used frequently.Note, according to some backers the developers failed on delivering on all the options for character customization they promised. Another perspective is that they reprioritized their funds towards game-content. This because the majority of the backers wanted them to. Personally I find their decision well worth the tradeoff. The content is so tightly bound to customization-choises that the game has to go through several new passes for every single new option added. And the options are already formidable.Your Sh*tBeyond character-building, the artifacts you find have a big inpact on how well you're able to resolve interactions. Some also unlock new ones. You will find no sword +1 in Torment, rather a sword that allow you to do something you can't do without it or which affords you an advantage of some kind. There are mundane generic items around, but you'll soon have plenty of ancient technological wonders you'd rather use, and all of them unique and «hand-crafted».My review was too long to fit here. It will continue in the comments-section. But I'll include the conclusion here.Conclusion 11/10For me this game is one of the greatest of all time. For the target audience it's fantastic and a must-have. If you don't belong to the target audience I'd recommend not getting it, rather admire it from afar for being the best at what it sat out to become.:)			"

												EDIT 2: Ok now I hate this game. The combat is absolutely bugged. I'm in a fight towards the end (trying to avoid spoilers) and I've RESTARTED THIS STUPID FIGHT 5 TIMES NOW because the AI keeps locking up and is unable to complete their turn. This is totally game breaking. I'm no longer recommending this game until they fix the freaking combat and make it not buggy.If they fix the combat bugs, I'll go back to giving this game a thumbs up and removing my combat edits/rants.EDIT 1 : OK I'm amending my review. I would give it somewhere in between yes/no. Why? The combat is absolutely horrible. I've been able to avoid most of it via dialog, but the times when you do have to do it just aren't fun. I won't spoil anything, so basically in any of the longer fights, or the unavoidable fights, the NPCs take FOREVER to act. It gets really really really tedious. Also sometimes the combat locks up and you can't end your turn (or the AI can't end its turn) and you have to once again RELOAD AND RETRY. I had this happen 4 times in a row on a quest in the Bloom. Took me ONE HOUR to beat the easy fight because of it. Ugh. It's also really freaking annoying when you have to fight but the build up to the fight involves a ton of dialog options/trees and so when you inevetiably have to reload (due to a bug or otherwise) you once again have to replay that entire sequence.Original review left below unmodified to help balance my dueline emotions about this game.I'm really liking this game. Great style, great music. Lots of text, so if you don't like reading you might not want to play it. I loved Planescape: Torment. Beat it many times. So far this game seems like a worthy successor. I also really like that you can avoid most combat if you want and play it via dialog. If you liked PST you'll dig this. There's some nice cameos too (I won't spoil them).Side note, unlike most RPGs where dying means you reload your game, in this one dying oftentimes unlocks side quests and advances the story. It's hard to find a situation where dying results in you needing to reload.This game is more like playing a novel. There's a ton of story and information and history behind the characters. While yes, it's a video game that has graphics that represent a world/theme (and does it well) the real strength lies in the text. Just like reading a book, the text in the game helps you visualize things in ways that graphics alone couldn't. Like the conveyance of emotion. It's more about learning who you are, what the world is about, and who your companions are than it is a typical RPG where you're fighting for vengence (or some ideal or whatever), leveling up, and becoming some uber-badas. The fact that you can avoid almost all combat in the game via dialog may put some people off. In fact, you don't even get forced into combat much at all. For those of you looking for a more combat oriented game, sadly this isn't it. For those of you that want to immerse yourself in the story of the universe in which the game is set, its companions, and yourself, and are prepared to spend a lot of time reading, then you'll enjoy this game.TLDR; This is a very cerebral game. A lot of reading, not so much in the way of combat (unless you seek it out). It's very binary. Either you'll love reading the voluminous text, or you'll hate it.			"

												Successor to planescape torment. YAY! Good start on the early acess so far. My opion list so far, 1. Needs MUCH better UI2. Needs serious  upgrade on the graphics. Its little better than the original so far. 3. The story looks great. A little too much book based choose your own adventure. The choices consequences are far to estoeric. As the world is earth 1 billion years in the future I am hopping to see some recognisible cameos from our time. Selfish I know but there it is. 4. Charcter devolopment is simplistic at best and trying far too hard to be different. 5. I love the mind reading skill. Fantastic twist. More 'psysic' would be great. All in all a good start. I am looking forward to the final product.Update after full release. 15/03/17Apparently full public release. Total crap. Cant save, crashes constantly. This rubbish is exactly an example of over promise and no delivery. NOT READY FOR RELEASE!			"

												Well, having now finished the full game, I wish Steam had a ""meh"" option for reviews. Sagus Cliffs and Valley of the Dead Heroes are great, and the rest of the game is eeeehhh. It's clear how much more work and care went into the first half than the second half. The pacing gets extremely rushed and the writing sort of goes all over the place. Several threads of the plot are resolved in very unsatisfying ways. It just feels extremely rushed.It's also a whole lot shorter than expected! I restarted after 4 hours or so to make some changes, and finishing the game only took me 25 hours, and that was with finishing every single side quest I could find and exhausting all the dialogue on every character I could talk to.Overall, it's an okay game, but frankly disappointing given the money and hype raised in the Kickstarter, and quality definitely takes a nosedive after you leave the content that was available early. Also the combat mechanics are utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												(editerd after more hours of play)I'm one of those people that believe Planescape: Torment, TToNumenera's predecessor, was a good game but a poor RPG. Unfortunately, TToN follows the same steps. It is not as linear, but the RPG elements are even more scarce. For example, I was level 3 when I had my first combat (aka ""crisis""), that originated from choosing the ""wrong"" interaction with an item. In the subsequent battle, my party was wiped, All that seems like poor RPG design choices one after the other.The combat system (if you're lucky to see it) seems to be based on Pillars of Eternity, and slightly simplified. I understand combat is not the main attraction in any Torment game, but still something more could have been done.On the positive side, combat events are originally named as ""crisis"" as you can have non-violent solutions to them. Also the characters are interesting, the world is original, if a bit dark and gloomy, and the usage of stats to solve issues is quite interesting as well.I wouldn't recommend TToN it at full price and I wouldn't recommend it if you're expecting a RPG, but otherwise, it's a pleasant adventure game with some (very small) hints of RPG. Edit: Somewhere halfway the game, a choice I picked while chatting with a NPC, killed me instantly. This is unacceptable on a RPG and barely acceptable on an adventure. The game has just too many bad design choices, so I'm changing the review to ""Not Recommended""			"

												Ideally, a review should be an objective evaluation of the merits and flaws of a game...but we all know that these days that's often not what happens.  Sites like Steam and Metacritic are littered with ""reviews"" that are expressions of agenda rather than honest appraisals.  ""I'm mad that there's no crafting - 1 out of 10!""  Or ""I'm counteracting the 1's with my 10!""  T:TON has attracted more than its share of such sentiments, mostly because of two reasons: angst about what some see as a betrayal of promises made during the development process, and secondly, a misunderstanding of what this game set out to do and what it is.  I'm not going to go into the former at all... I'm just going to say that if you're going to pick a cause to champion, railing against developers for normal development processes is not a very good one.  But I will talk some about the second because this game is very much worth playing for what it is, and all of the whining about what is is not, (or worse, what it ""should be"" in some entitled fan's imagination) is just noise.T:TON is a heavily story/dialogue based game.  The core of its gameplay is talking to NPCs, exploring the environment, and expressing your character in the way you desire to.  This game allows you to do that to an almost unprecedented degree.  Most quests have real weight to them, with different ways to accomplish them (not all of which are immediatley obvious), real ethical decisions, and ramifications that may come much later in the game.  The NPCs are imaginative, and plentiful, and the writing is fantastic.  I would count it among the top 5 or so games I've ever played in terms of writing quality.  The environments are full of things to interact with in interesting ways.  If you are a lover of story and writing, this game is absolutely worth playing. The systems of the game are more polarizing, though I would argue that they have considerable merit as well.  Combat IS not a focus.  It was never going to be, from the Kickstarter onwards, and it isn't.  However, those who say that you fight ""once in 20 hours"" or whatver are not correct.  There are many opportunities for combat if you desire it; it's just never going to be a random encounter with a trash mob.  As far as how the combat actually operates, that's a matter of taste, but the turn based system is a fit with how the game is played in general in a way that real time could never be.  In Crisis encounters (which is what the game calls combat, which should be a clue), you do not necessarily just fight, or in some cases, fight at all.  You can sometimes activate devices, or speak to your opponents.  In some cases, a Crisis is a moment of heightened drama, not a fight.  If you love constant, context-free combat, and feel that an RPG without it is boring, then you will be bored by this game.  That is not a fault of the game, or of you.  It is simply a sign that you two don't match.I could say a lot more about this game.  The environments, especially in The Bloom, are fantastic.  I enjoy the soundtrack.  There are a wide variety of interesting items to find (loot in most games is extremely boring after you've played for a few hours and seen most of what it can be mechanically; not so here).  And again, the story, characters, writing, and breadth of choice in your interactions is non pareil.  Bottom line, if you aren't the sort to get hung up on a less than perfect running animation, or the lack of a system proposed 4 years ago that didn't end up fitting into the game, and you ARE the sort who loves to explore a unique and vibrant world, love reactivity and choice, love story and an ability to write your own unique tale, then you owe it to yourself to ignore the folks with agendas and play this game.

Early Access Review
								Updating this review after playing the full release, I originally gave this a thumbs up a year ago because I thought there were planning on improving the game by a whole lot, not go the other way around. First of all they cut a lot of content out of the game, that alone is enough for a thumbs down, then they didn't bother improving the character models or allowing even a simple character customization menu. The main story writing is excellent but the companions who are suppose to be a big part of the game are bland as hell, all in all this game feels like it wasn't worth the buy. Heck games that were less funded and took less time to develop like Pillars of Eternity and Wasteland 2 feel way more complete than this game. I dunno what the devs were doing or where the money went but this was a huge disappointment and unless they do a full revamp/enhanced edition, I wouldn't recommend buying this game.			"

												TORMENT (ed metaphors) and flowery adjectives:""The drops of rain were like a symphony of warbling snow geese inside your soul, if your soul was...""ARGGGHH! SHUDUP!  Get to the story if you've got one. The writing is mediocre, and that's judging it by the typical B-grade pre-teen fantasy novel standard that video games generally need to be judged by.On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting. Most are just insane circus freaks that don't really add anything to the big picture. They just tell you their tangential life stories, spouting exposition out of their text boxes.  We'll skip the combat. The devs did. I wish I had waited for reveiws. Planescape was much better in terms of gameplay and story.			"

Early Access Review
								Planescape: Torment was an incredible game. One of my favorites, and one of the best of all time in my opinion. So far, this game is shaping up to be a worthy successor to that incredible adventure. If you're new to Torment, or old-school RPGs from the golden age of gaming in general, please don't deprive yourself of this game. It's a different experience than anything else out there at the moment. Don't expect crazy awesome gameplay and combat. Do expect a philosophical mind♥♥♥♥ of a story that is incredibly well written wherein your actions have extreme weight and meaning. Expect to be suprised. Expect your intelligence to be tested. This game will not hold your hand or shy away from big words that are not in your vocabulary, but it will paint a picture so vivid in your mind that no amount of cuda cores could ever hope to match it. If this game turns out to be as good (which is certainly seems to be)as it's predecessor,  trust me when I say that this game will HANDSOMELY reward you for finishing it. Not in fictional money, or loot, no; but in an altered perception that will carry into the real world. What does one life matter?			"

												It's a strange and gorgeous world torn right out of a good sci-fi or fantasy novel and the game's mechanics complement the story and setting quite nicely.Obviously not an action title and the turn based combat is enjoyable enough in small doses here and there. I would put the writing up there with just about anything I've ever played before.Combat is mediocre but enjoyable enough if you like turn-based rpgs. Really you are here for the story and the intersting tidal pool system of progressing through challenges (won't go into detail here).It's good. Really good. Not sure if it's great yet but I have high hopes. I would say it's already been worth the price of admission and I am only about 10 hours in (maybe 1/4- 1/3 of the way through I am guessing).Update....erghhh. Changing my recommendation. It's pretty clear the first 1/3 of the game was done with level of production and the middle third or so a good step down in quality from that with the end of it feeling like a rushed mess.The main story (and it's very linear game if you were curious) in a vacum is just good enough to get a nod of approval. However it needed to be eleveated by other aspects of gameplay and writing in order to resonate and fails to do so mainly because the main character winds up being a half-user choice created personality (you pick'em) with the other half of that personality being a block of wood. Some games/stories get passed this hurdle by providing strong supporting characters with a ton of personality or a really good antagonist whom drives the plot forward. Well here the story of your side characters fails to evolve into anything of much interest past the first 1/3 and the antagonist was nothign to write home about. The bad guy I found to be somewhat interesting in concept but again just not good enough without any character to draw the player. Overall the lore is great and stays pretty strong up until the last hour or so of the game. The prose is gold standard other games should reach for but ultimatley the story falls well short of the mark it would need to completely carry the game. The turn-based battles become more tedious and harder to avoid towards the end of the game. It really hurts the experience and it felt unbalanced and poorly planned out by the end of the game. The skills system is pretty easy to overpower once you reach the half way point of the story with a decent amoutn of time spent on sidequest which sees it's early potential squandered.  Tactical considerations are not terrible important to your success as long as you have a decent character setup.Artwise it's a mixed bag here. The enviornments are well thought out and put together. Only a few maps (particularly towards the end) fail to impress. On the other hand the character models are pretty vanilla imo. The style of the armor/clothing on some of the major models are fairly well done but alot of the others are barely distinguishable from one another and while never terrible failed to impress and became a let down compared to the background/map artwork.So in the end we have a lore-rich interesting sci-fi shell and intro that is cause for alot of excitement and then the game just kind of slumps along without direction until it devolves into a really huge disappointment in the last few hours. This is the biggest implosion after a promising start to a game since...well Wasteland 2 probably. Not a good trend for this developer and I'm really sad to have to give this a thumbs down.4.5/10			"

												It is amazing how a game like this can see the light of day when most major releases are the same chewed-out spoonfed concepts and gigantic overhyped disappointments full of repetitive elements such as leveled loot and fetch quests. Games which are usually filled with bloatware and microtransactions. I don't need to name any examples. You know what I am talking about.This game is a big '♥♥♥♥ you' to that. It is also a big '♥♥♥♥ you' to the culture of fast, flashy graphics, ""carrot on a stick"" playstyles, and excessive player guidance. Is it an archaic game? Sure. That's the whole point - the entire world of Numenera is archaic. It solely exists as parts of an infinity of other worlds, so it cannot be anything other than archaic. That is one of its strong suits - it does not simplify the complexities of an infinite world.Is this a game with poor combat? No. If you think so, you are missing the entire point of the game. Visit the Fifth Eye in Cliff's Edge and talk to the veterans. The world of Numenera is largely beyond simple combat. It is so vast and complex that wars are fought as folds between time, as complexities in a universe that is perceived entirely differently by its inhabitants - many of whom you'll meet in the game. The combat in this game is interwoven in its story.But are the actual combat mechanics poor? Not at all. They are not on par with Shadowrun, but Shadowrun's immersion pales in comparison to what this game has on offer. The combat in this game is about as good as the stories of Shadowrun.But is the game an interactive book, then? This term has a negative connotation that is not necessary. The world is incredibly rich, so rich that it would simply be impossible to animate everything. By relying on intricate conversations that are highly interwoven, a level of complexity is achieved that would normally not be possible. Granted, if you do not enjoy reading, you should not play this game. You should also stop reading my review, and install Call of Duty. "

I played for over 20 hours, despite what the record says, and only saw combat twice. When I did finally experience combat it turned out to be a rather poor affair. To me this feel like the game is missing the essential gameplay part. The world building is pretty great and I found the characters interesting. Shame theres so little actual gameplay.			"

												I would agree with others, in that the game suffers by comparison to PS:T.  Taken on its own, I'd give it a solid B+.  With reference to PS:T, probably not higher than a B-.  I thought there were a lot of missed opportunities.  With the companions, I didn't like the arbitrary limits on how many and who could be in your party, when combat is so minimal.  And even if they're not ""in"" your party for combat/skill purposes, they could have been hovering unseen for social interaction purposes.  There was rarely any point to talking to them regularly, and they did not evolve for better or for worse during the game (sometimes the text implied they did, but not in a mechanical sense, with a few exceptions).  As others have said, they were all pretty boring, despite hints of intrigue.I didn't understand the character development options being so limited and combat-focused when the game is so combat-light.  Likewise the inventory management, especially the cyphers, which were almost all combat-oriented.  The few non-combat cyphers generally weren't needed, because skill checks in conversation got very trivial very fast.  The Last Castoff's character options were especially bland.I thought they handwaved away the most interesting locales, like the Necropolis.  When I think of Curst Gone/Carceri in PS:T, and how you could literally sway the fabric of the setting through interesting interactions ... there was nothing like that in T:ToN.  For that matter, the Tides didn't even matter, they should have been fundamentally reshaping the world by the end of the game.Is it worth playing?  I think so.  I didn't have problems with bugs or glitches and found the game pleasant.  The Numenera setting is beautiful and compelling.  But it would have been better to plan a trilogy and done the first part of the game in more depth.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was everything I was looking for and more, it scratches the CRPG itch and I can't wait for the full release next month. I played Planescape Torment last year and wasn't able to finish it because of how bad the combat and UI is because of its age, but the story and characters are great which is something Tides of Numenera continues. This game doesn't have the best combat in my opinion but it allows you to both use the environment and talk your way out of almost any situation, which is something a lot of games like this boast but don't follow through on. The game world is so dense too, every few feet you either have someone to talk to or something to interact with which keeps each area interesting. The companions can be interesting but I hope that when the game is finished they're completely fleshed out, right now there's only one or two that have real quests attached to them. Overall I really enjoyed my experience and so far this is shaping up to be better than Pillars of Eternity if the story continues to intrigue me.			"

												I played Planescape: Torment up to the release of Torment: Tides of Numenera. It felt like a fluent transition. Besides the 90's feel of planescape, they feel like brother, made from the same mind. I was a bit surprised at how similar they felt. Very surprised.Maybe its the way I'm looking at it, as these people are looking at it as a game, I'm looking at it as a planescape torment in a new setting.And to be fair, planescape torment was not a criticaly sucessful game, many hated it, many felt it was boring. It was only with those who admired and loved what it was made for that allowed it to be seen as a classic. As such I have a feeling the game will be the same way, not loved by every person, but with the crowd it intends to reach it will succeed.If you currently fire up planescape: torment and like it, you WILL like this game. I am sure of that.  "

												It's a little too Planescape Torment, than inspired by Planescape Torment, imo. How much yearning one has for nostalgia vs wanting something new will weigh heavily on how much you enjoy the game. I haven't finished yet, but that's largely because I keep taking large breaks. Why do I keep taking breaks? Because the game crashes often enough to be annoying. So far, the crashes fall into the following categories:1) Everything appears alright, but you're no longer able to interact with anything. Alt-tabbing out and back in and out again and you'll find the Torment Window is now unresponsive. Must kill the process and restart. 2) Audio starts to stutter, then the game crashes to desktop.3) Audio starts to stutter, then the game causes Windows to crash to the BSOD with a kernal error.#2 has been the most common crash. Sometimes the last manual/auto save was right before a crash. Sometimes not. I find myself quite lethargic when it isn't, knowing I have to repeat everything between my last save and the crash. Hence the breaks. I suspect that says something about how I feel about the game, though I do enjoy the story.Anyway, if games like Planescape Torment, the BG series, Pillars of Eternity, etc, are your cup of tea, this is more of the same. The effort system is the game's unique twist to the tried and true formula (though I swear I've seen it before in other games, I just can't remember what games exactly), and your best bet is to ensure you and your Companions all master a different stat, and maybe double up on either Speed or Intelligence (3 stats, 4 party members-including yourself). So far, it doesn't appear you can change the armor for your Companions, which makes them increasingly fragile as the game has progressed so far, so even though I'm not playing a front line fighter, I still...play a front line fighter, because I have much better defenses than any of my Companions. One Companion I'm keeping is basically useless, but I'm hoping there's some traditional RPGness to this Companion where if I stick with it for the long haul, there'll be a reward of some sort. Though, as a developer, I would definitely enjoy skewing convetions on that front. Outside of the crashes, there are a few other bugs I've encountered:1) One of the early quests didn't trigger completion. After searching the internet, it's obvious it should have triggered to another step and then completed, but it didn't. Sadly, the NPC thought it had, and no longer exists. It went undone, then was forcibly removed as I progressed to the next area. 2) Buff icons sometimes vanish while still being in effect, but will sometimes come back after zoning. You can still see the effects if you hover over a character icon when this occurs. 3) Lots of minor pathing issues where you or your Companions get stuck on an object on the map or a person. Clicking around the stuck point has, so far, caused them to repath and get unstuck. Lastly, there's an ommision I always find very puzzling whenever it is omitted by a developer: A complete lack of Windowed, Borderless mode. I have never understood the point of a Windowed mode set to the monitor's resolution that isn't borderless, as such a Window never fits correctly. Considering one can write a few lines in Autohotkey to make a window borderless, it just doesn't seem like such a mammoth undertaking for a developer to make this a graphical option, and I am completely bewildered how anyone who's played more than a few hours of games on a PC doesn't consider this a basic function for a PC game. Certainly, the developers pertrude the aura of gamers, which makes this lack incredibly puzzling. In conclusion, the game probably needs an in-depth bug pass. It definitely could use voice acting (I'm sure it was beyond their budget, but I'd probably have made that the very first stretch goal; it's all about priorities). It's too much of the same old same old for me to get too blubbery about it, but I am not hating it. I just find it a little exhausting, due to the combination of sameness and crashes. If you know another game that's very similar to Planescape Torment, BG 2, etc, is going to wow and amaze you, then I heartily recommend it. If you're looking for something with similar written depth as Planescape Torment, but in a fresh and different package...well, this isn't really it (the second part). I do wish Steam gave you the option for a neutral thumb, but for now, I'll go with a thumb down, just to potentially move the aggregate needle enough that perhaps the technical issues might get a patch or two in response.

												I... I don't understand...It's boring...15 hours in and I'm bored...I played Arcanum, Torment, most of the Infinity Engine games for hundreds of hours when I was younger.  I just don't understand what happened.   The setting is interesting, the characters are decent, the writing and quests are good, it feels like Torment, but I just can't get into it.  I finished the first major hub, landed in the desert, and an overwhelming loss of interest hit me like a freight train.  I just don't want to go any further.  It could be me, it could be the game... probably a combination of both, but I'm just not feeling the desire to continue.  Which sucks because I have been excited for this since I backed it nearly 4 years ago.Well... here is hoping Pillars 2 is more entertaining.			"

												A brilliant game. I was a day 1 backer for this project, and have been a big PS:T fan since its release. And I'm surprised and excited that somehow, despite my apprehensions, TTON has turned out to be a really enjoyable game and a worthy successor to the original Torment. I've already played through it once and I'm sure I'll return to it many more times in the future. It is easily one of the best-written games in recent years, with a unique setting, some great characters and some interesting role-playing opportunities. Loved the art design too. Generally a fascinating universe to explore and an intriguing plot to unravel. The much-criticised combat was actually fine as far as I am concerned, and the fights I chose to get involved in were fun to play. It does run a bit slow when there are many opponents, but I really don't see what is a big problem. Especially since this is not Dark Souls where combat is a major selling point. It is sad that some of the kickstarter goals were cut or changed, but the game did not obviously suffer for it.  The developers choosing to expand Bloom as a hub at the cost of the planned Oasis was clearly the right call. Bloom is by far the more interesting setting and created opportunities for some unique cool art and writing.  It is a shame to lose a couple of planned companions, as they sounded interesting, but I was very happy with the six companions the game did provide and enjoyed their personal quests, ad-hoc interjections and so on.  If the trade-off was between more companions and more fleshing out, I am glad InExile chose the latter.			"

												Tides of Numenera was an instant backing choice for me, when the Kickstarter campaign happened. Fond memories of Planescape: Torment, excitement about the new juicy Numenera setting. It has been a long 4 year wait. Did the game meet my expectations? Abso-effing-lutely.In a weird post-scifi world, filled with intriguing stories, characters, factions, locations, items ..I feel at home. This game is such a joy to experience, there's a huge amount of reading to do, and oh how well it is written. The reactivity of it all, leaves me dumbfounded on many occasions. Between devouring the awesome stories and enjoying the cool Effort system, Tide system, Esoteries, Bonded Artifacts, Cyphers, and Oddities, I stop often to listen to the amazing atmosphere-building music pieces and sound design, and to gawk at the majestic & weird visuals and environments.The Crisis system for dangerous situations or combat is great, I feel like the abilities and items of my party members give me perfect personal ways to deal with things, and I feel like I have gotten into combat when I wanted to fight, and could evade fighting when I felt my party should do so.I know there would be too much to write about, and it's all too personal anyway, I've touched upon most aspects of the game, and I love it all. I can't put to words how much I like experiencing this game.Highly recommended for fans of deep RPGs, fans of great writing, fans of oldschool reactive CRPGs.			"

												All ""Early Access"" reviews of this game should be ignored due to that being the intentionally in a REAL beta test state. Also, the area that was playable is the least representative of the full game. The full game is amazing and a true spritual sequel to the original Planescape: Torment.  And just like the original, you'll end up reading a full novel's worth of text by the end. It's not for everyone, but if you were a fan of the original, or just a fan of the Infinity Engine RPGs, then you owe it to yourself to play this. It blows Pillars of Eternity out of the water in every aspect except for battle system depth. But if you're playing Torment for the battles, you've missed the point			"

												Okay, this is easy.  This is a traditional crpg following the traditional crpg formula.  All the systems and content crpg fans expect are included.  No system is different enough or lite enough (or too heavy) to be a deal breaker from what I've seen.  It is reading heavy and story heavy as would be expected from a PST inspired game.Fans of traditional formula and content crpgs will like this game unless you really hate TB as the combat and any opposing action is TB mode (called conflict, it is a decent system with decent combat).If you are new to crpgs if you liked Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, WL2, Divinity: OS, Underrail, I can easily recommend this.  If what draws you to these games is a particular system or subsystem instead of the tried and true and loved traditional crpg formula			"

												This game is amazing.I always loved the old isometric CRPGs: Fallout, Planescape, etc. and I was super pumped when the genre's renaissance began with Shadowrun Returns, and Wasteland 2. Back in the 90s, Planescape Torment was the reigning champion of the CRPG world. A 100,000 word heavyweight of literary themes and innovative storytelling.Torment tries, and largely succeeds, at recapturing that magic.  The world is incredibly inventive. A science fantasy wonderland with a semi-medieval society built on the ruins of multiple post-Singularity civilizations.  A world of mysterious machines, half buried and half working, of mysterious and malevolent biomechanical creatures, and a world of technology so advanced it's indistinguishable from magic.  Also, the combat is terrible.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Yes!I found the setting to be fresh and fascinating. This isn't just a testament to the world of Numenera, but the excellent work of the writers and artists who made the essence of that world fill my screen. While the settings were wildly different, all of it screamed Planescape and Baldur's Gate to me - in a way that Pillars of Eternity frequently did not. Torment's environments were perfectly foreign, which made my comfort in them even more surprising. Benjamin has an essay on translation where he likens the task of translation to the construction of tangent circles -- Torment feels like that to me. Beautifully connected to, and reminiscent of, a game that I love, while complete on its own terms.--Mechanically, the game was sound. It felt like I had multiple avenues to resolve each of the vignettes that I participated in. I reloaded many times throughout my playthrough to experience some of the alternate ways of solving and creating problems.I encountered a few annoyances, but no bugs. The combat was fine. There were a few times when I became frustrated while trying to activate an ability 'behind' someone, but the perspective made that impossible. Hopefully that will be patched out.--While I'll give the game some time to breathe now, I am planning on a second run where I push entirely different Tides to the forefront. My limited exploration of alternate paths satisfied my curiosity as to whether the game handled them effectively.--I would say that it took me around 45 hours to finish this game, for those of you worried about time to completion. I did all of the sidequests that I could find, although I almost certainly missed a few.			"

												I would recommend it but only if you know what you are getting in to. Even if you said ISO revival RPG , this is nothing like what you would expect. That is either a good or bad thing depending on your own taste. But for me....... Quite disappointed overall to be honest but Story was really awesome, I was gripped by it. Lots of nice dialogue, the world i was imagining was so cool, the Endless Battle etc the Bar with the veteran psyciks one of the highlights that made me really immersed etc.BUT,  Everything else was aweful, the male avatar looks like he has been hobbled and has a stick up his bum (female is better animated) no real gear for companions bar ""set and forget stuff"" ,less than a handful of (useful) weapons handful of useful armors/items. Cyphers a waste of time, money/economy balancing a complete mess. Class mechanics and character scaling pointless to be honest.  Combat is attrocious, systems are exploitable and again pointless for the most part, length of the game is very small as are the maps, Concept art was about 1million miles away from the in game art which was not good at all, and most disppointing was the companions, bar Rin, compeletly forgettable with few dialogue layers.  I would recommend Pillars of Eternity far above this. Sorry lads. I hate to say it but I don't think it needs the Torment name except to bring in Nostalgia backers because Ill forget this title in a few weeks and definately will never replay it. It brought back no fond memories nor created new ones either. A good rpg game that entertained me in places. nothing more nothing less. Its not bad at all.6/10			"

												Wonderful storytelling with in-depth dialogue options. Feels more like a novel (with a large number of branching paths) than a game, which is a positive for me but may be a pacing issue for some. Combat is largely avoidable, but seems very very difficult when it does come to pass (enemies just seem way stronger and you're spending critical time trying to keep people alive while getting beaten down, instead of leveraging more interesting abilities). Could simply be a learning curve, but it's easy enough to negotiate rather than fight.			"

												I like the game. It does not fullfil all kickstarter promises and inXile has ruined their reputation(in my opinion) for making lots of dubious decisions and cuts based on reasosn that - after playing through the game - are cleary nothing but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I don't even want to know the reasons and why they stayed so silent on all that. Maybe its greed, maybe they are just dumb or think their fans are. Whatever. I'm here to rate the game, not some selfish and awful choices of a few dudes leading the company creating it or the publisher. Because if you get over this you have a very well written visual novella with a very fresh setting, and a enormous depth. A story with many choices and consequences, that is still rewarding if you don't save scam to get the perfect result out of every situation. Sometimes even fails are victories. If you take the time to take all those philosophic thoughts in, the game will make you stop from time to time to think about what just happened. This happened not often to me in the last years.The game is not especially hard in terms of tactics or combat. You get through it without being stuck by a difficult riddle or a challenging fight. So it has a nice flow that is about telling a story and not about super-complex RPG-rulesets and tactical combat. Remembers me in terms of this flow a little bit to a game like loom(even if TToN is 10 times longer) where you just wander around, talk to people and feel the wonders of a strange but atmospheric and well presented world.It took me about 40hours to get through the game while doing all the quests i could find. When i consider that nearly all combat is quickly over and compare this to pillars of eternity - where you wade through piles and piles of enemies -  and also end up with 30-40 hours play time, i come to the conclusion that torment is packed with 3-4 times as much story as PoE. Maybe even more. You have to consider for yourself what you like more.Note: If you are german: I recommend to play the game in english. The german translation is really bad.			"

												Let me start by saying this: there are a lot of Steam reviews that give the game a thumbs down because it doesn't live up to the venerable Planescape: Torment. This is true, but the game can still easily be recommended. It's by no means a bad game. If recommending a game hinges on whether it lives up to one of the greatest games ever made, then you might be setting too high a bar.So no, this is not Planescape: Torment. On that note, let's get the negatives out of the way first. The plot is not as interesting, nor as personal as Planescape. The characters are not as fascinating and deeply wrought. The dialogue isn't as clever or as unique. It's also not as funny. On top of that, the animations are often janky, there aren't that many party members, the game isn't all that long (in cRPG terms), combat is a bit of a mess, character abilities and progression feel limited, you can't return to major hubs after you leave them, and the oft-mentioned Tides system has almost no impact on anything. All that would make the game sound pretty awful out of context. However, here is what you do get:  gorgeous and fascinating areas to explore, an interesting and well-written story, deep and satisfying conversation options with interesting NPCs, difficult moral judgments, lots of branching choices, and numerous fascinating little side quests and miniature stories to experience. Ultimately, it's the discovery in this game that makes everything worthwhile. While I never felt pushed forward by the plot, I was always interested in the characters and the world around me. Numenera is a great and fantastic world with tons of variety and wierdness. The developers have really explored this and used it to its fullest. The numenera you get, and even the useless oddities you acquire for sale all have their own little stories or quirks. Exploring a city inside the body of a living transdimensional monster is awesome, as are the wonderful people that live there. I wanted to keep playing because I wanted to know what was up with this immortal dimension-hopping guy over here, or what would happen if I told this kid he was adopted from a family in another time. So no, it doesn't do everything we might want from a Torment game, but it does enough to recommend it. I enjoyed my playthrough of it. I think, if you like cRPGs, you will too.			"

												I finished my first playthrough yesterday. I did it in two approaches, without actual pause to anything but a two-hours sleep, and game storyline (including save scumming) takes around 35 hours for me (and it's 23 on game timer). I believe it's means something, at least for me.So, I love a game. My primary complain is that in 4 years you can expect more content. PS:T takes 47 hours (in game-timer, I believe - can't really say) on main+extra completions, and I think I tried to be completionist there, it's 60 hours; but for first Deus Ex, that I take as another Great RPG, it would be 28 hours. I missed at least one merecaster though (couldn't say how to fix it and is it even possible), and I played as social+lore Nano, and it's definitly easiest way. Just in case, I hate current approach to ""remake classical way to gaming"". I've never managed to complete Pillars of Eternity, just dropped... on castle at most. But T:ToN I completed on one approach and not regret a second.Also I should admit, I pleged game on kickstarter 4 years ago, first day I believe (it was, well, 4 years ago, so I'm not sure), and dropped to follow development. I knew about cut features only, well, four days ago, and truth to said I don't mind. So, what's bad for me here.1. Foci. Only three foci, and only one of them is actually fits my game playstyle somehow - I mean that about charisma. I can't say I like it much (I played sage, not charismatic, with Lores, Concentration and Anamnesis maxed), but at least it's better then Breath Shadows or Masters Defence. Also it had nice bonus with Inspired (that works bad for my main character - I believe to get Inspired fettle you must actually ENTER aura, and when you never do it - after your character dies, for example - it just don't renew itself), other bonuses are meh. Putting one more effort to social tasks seems nice, in the beginning, but can't say I recall any moment I needed it. And last tier boni for social focus is ridiculus - when you get that fourth tier, playing around social playstyle, you will supposedly have at least one dot in Persuasion and a lot of Edge to have 100% to social rolls without spending anything. You just won't spend your Int pool to make this ability useful. With actually quite bland abilities foci, I believe, it was possible to put some more. I mean, not as foci was something play-defining for me. I felt more impact from Tides.2. Bugs. Sure, I've take my toll. First, I had scary bug that make every Crisis a chance game - sometimes it just stuck in the middle of somebody action, and only way is quit game by terminate process and replay last save. The worst issue was when it happens in combat with Sorrow in Bloom - it's actually not nice with all that pre-fight cutscenes and dialogs. Also I had a bug with Avina (girl in a quest about five women), when I find her, but didn't rid her from artifact she had, and restored Seria with tidal surge. Well, that was strange, because I don't actually *restored* her, I made her to speak, and she burst in the end; then I entered her fantom, loaded, and voila, Seria was stand there as it should be. Avina spirit never appears, even as quest says I found her.3. Equipment. Well, that's not actual issue, but I really want to have more armor choices.What's bad for other players, but kinda ok for me.1. Companions. Well, there is six characters for selection, and just three slots for them. Normally you'll get Rinn, so it's 2 characters. In that six characters we have one glaive (one-and-half, if you count Aligern), three Jacks (if you include Rinn), and two Nanos. But game definitly build into Int playthrough, not bashing your way, so that's ok at least for me. By the way, official wiki says Callistege is Red+Silver Tide-wise, and that's strange - for me, she is totally Blue. Maybe I don't get Tides at all?.. Anyway, I like Rinn, I like Callistege and I like Erritis. I find them deep and nice, even with ""Callistege personal quest"" I felt blurred from all over the game until last choice in underwater phantom. Hell. Because I felt it blurred.2. Intelligence playstyle. Yes, I definitly can feel how game builded with this way in mind. But, well, Planescape: Torment definitly was build into high Int/Wis character, even if you could play another style. So it's ok for me.3. Rinn. I get it there is a lot of hate about Rinn. Yeah, you would feel yourself as a real♥♥♥♥♥♥when you leave her alone - but, sorry, how do you should feel yourself, getting a homeless girl, protecting her from slavers and then dropping? Yes, that's a♥♥♥♥♥♥move, so it's nice to see that game writing don't let you miss it. Also she actually wasn't useless for me. With high stealth, armed with light shooting weapon and carrying a lot of healing items around, she became a dedicated healer, and then she got Innervate. So until you don't forget to put her in stealth after each cast, she is amazing. Also take in head I don't play with a lot of actual combat.4. Turn-based combat. Actually, that's ok for me. Combat is something that I hated in PoE (with all that timed sword strikes). Tyranny was little better, but still. Hell, I hated that even in Arcanum, and it wasn't something I loved in PS:T. 5. Mechanic simplification. Yes, in tabletop game hit points don't exist, and pools used as three types of hits. Actually, in rules it's said that Might pool is ""damage by default"", but neverless. I recalling early betas where there was not dedicated hit points (and interface was HORRIBLE in my option), maybe I'm imagining things, but I even thought ""it's a quite bad idea, because in short game without stable recovery I would save points, as they're my hit points"". Actually I don't like Cypher system, I found it too limited and class-based, but, well... it's nice for CRPG.What's good?1. Setting. Not as much inXile effort, but, I believe, it's nice implementation for Numenera, as Planescape: Torment was nice for Planescape. It actually made me to read Numenera, as PS:T made me to read Planescape.2. System. Well... I feel that it don't realised in full potential. But it's quite nicer that trendy bleak ""generic classical RPG system based on d20"", that seems to be so appearing to modern game design.2. Story. It IS great. Actually I don't believe in ""classical narrative ways"", I believe Mass Effect with video cuts and good (even with all my problems with 1st) graphics model is better for computer game. But in T:ToN I actually read all that text (PoE couldn't get me such way, and every time I starts I played for 2-3 hours only!). I believe it could be great if it was full-sounded and realistic graphics, and more gameplay options but text ones, but story is good enough to suppress gameplay and development limitations. There are things I never saw (Eternal Battle for example), and some things I would make another way or tone, but it is great. And it haven't obvious plot holes I can actually argue, and that's nice again.It's not just interactive book, it'a a game. And it's the best RPG I played for years, maybe sharing the honor with Tyranny first act. Second and third was kinda crap, but first act was great. And T:ToN is fully as good as Tyranny first act.

												While the story RPG elements and Other aspects of the game are solid, not great but solid, The COMBAT is an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥show. one of the worst implementation i've seen. It's a turn base combat system that has you fighting NUMEROUS enemies. Just to get a Turn in you have to wait at least 30 seconds, And That just for 1 of your characters. Movement in combat is innaccurate and There's not enough feedback on what you're doing. There are no tool tips or 'Codex' to inform you of anything. If you can avoid combat, do so At ALL COST Not for any role play reason, just simply for the fact that the combat is absolute garbage. Cannot recommend this game while there are far better games like Tyranny and POE out there.			"

												Combat aside this is one of the best RPGs I have played in a long time. Interesting and well written dialogue, amazing characters, and a strange and unique world which we haven't seen since the planescape setting. If you enjoy combat focused RPGs then this game isn’t for you. Overall it is hard to say anything negative about the writing. Inxile truly has some of the best writers in the industry and these guys really created a great product. After having to slog through games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 this has been the game I have been waiting for for years, and boy was the wait worth it.			"

												A brief look at the negative reviews of this game should be more than enough to compel you to play it. The people who are drowning this game in negativity are doing so, almost without exception, with the caveat that they've enjoyed the game. However, they're angry, potentially rightfully, that things were cut that were promised in the Kickstarter. However, these omissions do not take away from what is an exceptional game, and it is an injustice to dissuade people from playing in a misguided lashing out at missed promises. I strongly recommend you give Tides of Numenera a try, if you like narratively driven RPGs. If you don't, look elsewhere.			"

												To start with, let me explain that I haven't finish the game yet and that most of my playtime (~50h) came from early access. However I have seen this game evolve since it started early access always, in my opinion, in a positive manner. So far, I already created the character I want to be (having experimented with character creation in early access) and I'm having lots of fun.Pros: Character Creation is different and interesting, keeping you immersed in the world from the beggining. I also think it has a good (short) length when compared with other games that have done similar things (like Oblivion). The game is focused on your character story, not the world's. I loved the choices you make about how to react and what to tell other characters from the beggining (will you lie? or tell the truth and face the consequences).  For the first time in a long history of gaming ( I started playing in the late 80's and yes, I played the original Torment) I found myself interested to see what would happen instead of reloading when things didn't go my way.  The use of the stats pool (foci, I think its called) is very interesting. I don't know the rules of Numenera RPG but the way  they are used in this game (like currency) is interesting and different. I found myself sometimes risking the throw of the dice with a 70%/75% to try and save points to a more important choice and (as mencioned before) actually accepting when it fails :) The obvious care in creating the similarities between this game and Planescape Torment: the nameless and, although not amnesiac, totally clueless character; the death mecanic as a feature; the strange world, characters and laws. Planescape Torment is one of my favourite games. In my opinion, this IS a spiritual successor to that game. You can avoid conflict (called Crysis) by choosing another path. You can even try and persuade the other NPC's in the middle of combat, which I found very interesting. Besides that, you can use the enviromnent to your advantage in the fight. As I rather like to avoid fights, all this choices are refreshing. The many ways you can finish a quest. I like quests and feel almost obligated to find every single one and finish it. The amount of ways you can finish the side quests actually begs for another playthrough to find out what would happen if I did it some other way. Cons: I like the graphics. BUT, I agree with some other reviewers that the main character portrait is somewhat ugly (I always play as a female). However, as I said before, I played the original Torment and nobody can call the Nameless One character as pretty :D  Another nitpick is that I miss the other character portraits when talking to someone. I have no problem with reading lots of text but I  like ""seing"" who I am talking to when it comes to dialogs. This game is too serious sometimes. I miss the humour from Planescape (mostly delivered by Morte) that gave a much needed escape from all the drama.I may change my review when I finish the game, but I highly recomend this to anyone that enjoys good writing, a very original and interesting world, interesting characters and a good story.

												I recommend this game, because overall I did like it, but there is no escaping the fact that it was a big let-down.  Planescape: Torment was one of my favorite games of all time, so when I learned that it was getting a sort of sequel-in-spirit, made by many of the same people, I was very excited.  Then came the waiting.  I have no information about what was going on behind the scenes, but it seems obvious that there must have been serious development troubles, because this game was announced in March 2013 with a scheduled release date of December 2014, but didn't come out until February 2017.  I started and finished law school, passed the bar exam, and started working at a law firm in that same interval.  If I had not had to wait so long, I would not have been so disappointed.The other problem is that this game is inferior to Planescape: Torment in most respects.  P:T had a more interesting story with more interesting characters.  I really cared about my companions in P:T.  They were traveling with me for a reason.  My companions in T:ToN were just sort of there.  With the exception of Matkina, none of them had particularly good reasons to follow me around.  And none of them, except Rhin, had interesting stories or personal quests.  I also found the main character's story to be much less interesting.  In P:T, TNO had this gripping personal saga, and it was just that: personal.  TNO was confronting his own mortality.  He had to learn from his past mistakes.  In T:ToN, the LCO was just being chased by this poorly thought-out monster for not much reason (once you find out what it is and where it came from, it becomes clear that the Sorrow is little more than a weak imitation of a Mass Effect Reaper).  Again, though, what hurt this game for me was the high expectations I had for it.  I was expecting another experience like P:T, and I didn't get it.Why then, if I was so disappointed, am I giving this game a thumbs-up?  Because it was actually a fairly solid journeyman effort.  As long as you go into it with moderate expectations, this is a reasonably enjoyable game.  Far from greatness, but still decent.  It has an interesting setting and competent storytelling.  It is definitely on the easy side, although there are a few serious challenges.  I had hoped for a lot more, but it's still an enjoyable game.			"

												Engaging and well written with an emphasis on exploration I ahve not seen in other CRPGs. The maps are gorgeous (although the 3d models can be kinda low-res by comparison). The combat system is challenging enough although I've noticed a few bugs with the AI that will probably be quickly patched over. All in all an amazing successor to Planescape: Torment allowing a multitude of paths to completing objectives and getting the feeling that you are following your own path with the story.			"

												Torment is a niche game for a niche category of gamers. And in this niche it does very well: story and dialogs are great, the world is interesting to explore, failure does not mean autoload of a previous save, etc. If you knew what you are getting, it hits the spot.Most of negative reviews either mention dialog focus or limited combat (not a lot of encounters and combat system being pretty rudimentary). While both of those are true, this is exactly what the game was offering and joke is on the people who expected anything else. I like good combat and would like to see it improved a bit in Torment, but the game does not deserve a negative review because of it.There are also complaints about cut content - I am a day 1 backer and I was backing the core of the game, which I am satisfied with, not the extras. I believe the game was made with a lot of care and attention to detail and I do not think Inxile just drank the extra money away (not all of it, at least). This is an issue with too many promisses which inxile didnt manage to keep fully and too much emotion from the backers who seemingly would not back the game if they knew from the start it is going to be turn-based or have only 6 companions.In conclusion, it is a fun game unless you had some unreasonable expectations or not a fan of reading alot.

												In its present state, Numenera shamelessly usurps Torment's name and legacy and does not even scratch the surface of the majesty, glory, importance and damn it, plain old good fun that it's ""spiritual father"" provided. The feeling of a hastily released and under-developed game pervades every second of Numenera and will be the subject of a myriad RPG post-mortems in 2017. Something obviously tragically derailed between the Kickstarter campaign and its actual release and the game was released ""as it was"" in order to recoup development costs. inXile's Wasteland 2, whilst not creation's greatest RPG, stands as a towering and eternal masterpiece compared to Numenera.Shame on you inXile, you have failed us.

Holy heck, the roleplaying. Finally a game with weight and background to it's characters that you WANT to read.- Every fight is avoidable. You can talk your way out of it if you're smart enough! ;)Con:- Background 'noises' like machines wirring or alarms blaring or... aarghh  make it stooop plz!! :(- Animation of the characters, just doesn't look good.- Combat is pretty boring, slow and tedious.So far, my experience was just great and I want to give this a 9/10 at the  moment. (I don't really care about the animations and I avoid combat so those points don't detract rom my enjoyment of the game, that's why I still give it a 9/10)			"

There are a few flaws but I like this game, it's another old style PC-RPG experience.If you're used to the Bethesda style action RPG,s and that's all you think a RPG should be then you probably won't like it.It doesn't follow the Numenera rules and mechanics exactly and misses a few things out, but then again previous RPGs never followed the D&D rules and mechanics exactly.

												I am not a huge fan of this game. I have played all of the Pillars of Eternity engine games and play almost all crpg that have been released. This game was made worse by the fact it was made to port to PS$ and XBOX. Its essentially a choose your own story adventure. CONS1. You do not choose your character. You are assigned a very strange looking fellow and told how your narrow hips are just right.(I joke not that's fricking weird) The character creation system is usually one of my favorite parts of this type of game and gives games like this replay value. This has none of that. You play the same little story to pick your abilites of the last cast off and then you get to change a little at the end. 2. If you like combat like I do this is probably not the game for you.  So far I have managed to get in one fight, the combat system isn't clarified very well and the system of ciphers basically mean they are your power base for the game. 3. Very limited tactical choices. Spells bah who needs them, spend your might and intellect to make sure you hit......strange system that so far is not fun.4. Slow Load time of choices on text.5. Bad charcater models for having zero choice in appearance. Tyranny was far better and you could make your charcater look like what ever you wanted. 6. I spent 44 bucks and find myself going, I really don't want to play this, its really boring. (Its honestly a boring game)PRO's1. Interesting quests and good story with mutliple ways to finish quests.			"

												-Really entertaining, unique, yet troubled lore-centric RPG-fodder-The game is essentially a reimagining of the original Planescape Torment in another world and with a slighty different story. Though the new companions aren't quite as lifelike as Dakkon, Morte and Annah, think Pillars of Eternity quality.Again it features a compelling fantastic environment with lots of weirdo characters and items to figure out.There's not much combat and it can usually be overcome by dialogue challenge also.ProDeep backstory, fascinating world. I like how the narrative fits together and you slowly unlock what has happened.You never know whether things and choices are important, you can't easily game the game as you do all others.ConBland, disappointing graphics just do the job, look like my old Planescape at times. 95k backers it says when the game starts, where did the money go?  The colorfully imagined fantasy landscape as observed in the preview/designer artwork could have been better served with a say ""Original Sin""-modern look instead of returning to good old Baldur's Gate.Lack of character portraits esp. for the lead NPCs you have to use your imagination. Recently found out one has a disfigured face and a mask by reading about it later.Has no codex of NPCs and races like PS:T had (including artwork) -very lazy. Maybe their graphic artist was on sick leave all these years of developement.Other-You read a whole lot of dialogue text, might not appeal to everyone.-All builds and approaches are viable but therefore gameplay's not very challenging at all. [edit: some difficulty spikes - that's why you hoarded those one-use items]27 hours of play +5 if you read exactly every word.Hint-Make a spreadsheet on paper, note all names esp. the castoffs and their connection, you'll thank me later. Also a changing god timeline would be great to have.			"

												Delays beyond count, features cut from the stretch goals, ported to consoles instead of delivering what was promised in the kickstarter, poor communication to backers. This is the last inXile game that I'll ever Kickstart, and any future purchases won't be until there's a steep discount.  I cannot in good faith recommend this game at this time.UPDATE.I'm updating this review, as the game is out now, and I have played the content that is available, and I am sticking to my original  negative impression.  The game that has been released, doesn't come close to the game that was described in the original Kickstarter.  It draws heavily from other games, even anamnesis 'memory recall' skill is basically soul reading from Pillars of Eternity.  The game mechanics are very basic, combat is virtually nonexistant, so there's no real need to do any shopping at vendors, it's really quite ugly, and the narrative doesn't make up for any of the flaws.  The story is a rehashed, linear novel with boring characters, who give the player no reason to care about having them in their party or completing their sidequests.For as long as this game was delayed, and how much of it was cut, it's obvious now that getting this game to console was and is a cash grab to make up for the underwhelming experience that inXile has delivered.

Early Access Review
								Fantastic!   The current build is far more stable then previous.  Really enjoyable game that is heavy on the role-playing and story elements.  Every character you meet is intriguing/bizarre/funny, every location begs to be explored.  A real treat and huge difference from the ""high fantasy"" settings filled with Tolkein-esqe characters that blur together after a few games.  Many of the battles (called a ""Crisis"" in game) play out as puzzle-like situations where you have to rely on manipulating the environment and character skills rather than tactical combat. Note: Previously reviewed as ""Not Recommended"" due to unplayable levels of instability.  Current build is FAR more stable.  One CTD in many hours of play, didn't notice any bugs other than a graphics glitch that resolved on reload.			"

 Instant Classic	I just finished this game, I wrote an early access review a long time ago but didn't want to write a real review until I beat the game after final release. First off I must say the people complaining about this game aren't really rpg fans, they can't be. I have read some of the ridiculous reviews bad mouthing this game over the dumbest stuff like the developer making changes to the combat system. Who cares, they changed it to turn based combat(it plays great this way) and I see no issue with it affecting the game. The combat doesn't have to be a big part of the game anyway if you don't like the system don't get into combat, you don't lose out on XP either as most of the large gains are from the text options you choose. This lets you play anyway you want and you still can enjoy the story which is fantastic. Now to get to the actual review. To me it is one of the best rpgs I have ever played and an instant classic, to be honest it is better than Planescape and I loved that game. This game to me hangs with all the classic rpgs from the late 90s and early 2000s like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dales, Arcanum and the REAL Fallout games. The story is great and a breath of fresh air  because it is new and original enough to make it so you want to see what is going to happen next and don't mind reading all the dialog(this coming from someone who hates to read). I can't recommend this game enough to not only rpg fans but to any person who loves a good story and having their choices that affect the game world, their choices  actually changing what happens in the end game. Not really a spoiler but your choices do show up in the ending of the game, and unlike a game like Mass Effect(which I also loved) which promised to make your choices count and didn't come through, this game does.I also loved how this game lets you play any way you want. As I stated above, you don't have to fight more than a few times if you don't want too, you can talk your way through 90% of this game easily and get everything with dialog and abilities you could gain with a blade. This game really doesn't punish for roleplaying any type of character, not all rpgs can say that. The XP gains also feel well paced but depending how you play, you can exploit some of the game with abilities at higher levels and make the last parts of the game pretty easy but it doesn't take anything away from the overall experience imo.So to sum up this review if you skipped my novel above:Buy this game, it is well worth full price and a steal if you buy it on a sale. This game is for real rpg fans and gamers looking for a very story rich/text heavy game with the freedom to make choices that affect the end game and let you play any style you like with out punishment. I give this game a 9.5/10. "

												Before I get to the review, I have to say that I am NOT a Kickstarter backer. I bought the game a few days after release (about 3 days later).Torment: Tides of Numenera is a CRPG very much in the veins of the old Planescape: Torment game, which is regarded as one of the pinnacles of the genre (the other being Baldur's Gate 2). Expect to read a lot of story and dialogue in this game, and DON'T expect an emphasis on combat (if that prospect bores you, this *isn't* a game for you). The game took me nearly 40 hours to beat, which makes it one of the shorter CRPGs out there, but at the same time it felt enough. There are a total of 3 classes to play (a warrior, mage and a ""jack of all trades"" - I played the mage, in order to get most of the dialogue options).The visuals consist of pre-rendered still backgrounds (like in the case of all Infinity Engine games, and more recently in the case of Pillars of Eternity) with animated and intertactive elements. The backgrounds are, in my humble opinion, beautiful. The GUI does it's job well (even if it's a bit too ""futuristic"" for my taste) and the font used works well and you can play with it's size (which is important, because you'll be doing a lot of reading). The visual effects on spells and weapons during combat are okay, some of the early spells look kinda generic, but some of the later ones have cool effects and animations. Character and clothing animations are well done. There is voice acting, but only for key lines. I feel like there could have been more, especially on plot relevent characters. If you have played Pillars of Eternity, then know that this game has less voice acting than that game.The soundtrack to this game (which I got on a separate CD as a bonus) is okay and pleasing, albeit not exactly memorable (I can recall only the battle theme). That isn't that big of a deal for me, because I don't mind a soundtrack that ""blends in"" and doesn't interrupt reading.The story is well made, I didn't notice any glaring problems like abundant plot-holes. It kept me interested and invested in the game and it's characters 'till the end. The end itself is competent, imho, and takes into consideration a lot of the player's behavior during the game. The party members are quite good and interesting, and none of them follow any particular clichés (also, I didn't find any of them annoying, which is a big plus). There is very little combat, even for a game inspired by Planescape: Torment. You can skip a lot if you play a talkative and persuasive character (which is good), but the total number of potential (and unskippable) combat encounters (called ""crises"" in this game) can becounted on the fingers your hands (only one hand when it comes to those that you can't skip through dialogue - including the tutorial fight)It needs to bew said, however, that the game has a few bugs and glitches (at least at the time of writing this review). The most annoying I ran into was a bug that kept messing up the volume of voices and general sfx, making them very quiet and hard to hear. This bug occured when transiting between maps and messing around in the inventory and character screen. The game never crashed, however, and I didn't encounter any broken quests or dialogues. As far as framerate goes, my GTX 970, I7 CPU and 16 GB of RAM kept it at solid 60fps the entire time. Loading times were reasonably fast on my Samsung EVO SSD (500GB).So, let us summarize:Pros:- beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds- competent, mature and interesting story- interesting characters and party members- seamless, if not memorable, soundtrackCons:- short overall game time for a cRPG (cca 40 hrs)- buggy sound fx and a handful of other, smaller bugs- very little combat (Planescape: Torment had more potential encounters)While not perfect, Torment: Tides of Numenera is a competently written cRPG that plays fine, and I still count it among games worth playing and endorsing. Be prepared to read a lot, though.+++The Emperor protects.+++ "

Early Access Review
								22 hours into the beta so far.  13-jun-2016They opened the game up to all backer's as BETA.  BETA is a good word for it.  I like the game very much.  What they offer in the beta is the first ""city"" and so far there is plenty to do.But BETA is a good name for what they are offering at the moment, and if this BETA piece is the most polished part of what they have so far (and one would expect they would put the best they have on display), then it will be at least another year before they get all the bugs worked out of it.  I suspect they realize this given their newest comment about 2017 Q1 release.  Personally I am glad they made the beta available, and hope they offer up more pieces in beta as they get completed.This has a chace to be a great game, maybe better than the original Torment, but they clearly need our help.  So if you guys are backers, claim the Steam Beta and start finding bugs.  The bug report facility is built right into the game so it is pretty easy to report something wrong.  My list so far includes things like:1. minor gramatical errors in descriptions and dialog.2. dialog choices out of step with the game (options you get even when you don't have the prerequisite knowledge).3. two bugged side quests I cannot complete.4. characters getting stuck on one particular map.5. characters walking through a door on one particular map.6. interface getting bugged and in one place completely blank or lost altogether.All so far have been fixable with either a restart of the game, or a reload of previous save.Once these bugs get fixed, this will be one of the great ones.

												Torment: Tides of Numenera might not be at the level of Planescape Torment, but it still is an enjoyable ride. At about 36h of gameplay (incl. some reloads), I would still consider it to fall on the short side, a feeling reinforced by the fairly linear nature of the main story arc revolving at different levels around individual choices. That coupled with the text-heavy content makes it sometimes feels more like a visual novel than a true RPG (not a bad thing per se but probably disconcerting for most new players).The universe is still rich and somehow reminded me of ""the book of the New Sun"". It remains largely underexploited, even with side quests, a gap that will hopefully be filled by DLCs. "

												I've put about seven hours into Torment so far.  I was really looking forward to the game but I was a bit disappointed to see the reviews weren't as positive as I had hoped.  I didn't play the game right after it released but I took a day off work recently and decided I'd dig into this.  I took the day off work yesterday and spent six hours playing this and got extremely hooked.  I played a bit more today and in about seven hours of gameplay I've hardly fought anyone, rather I've spent my time talking to everyone I can, milking each conversation for as much lore as I possibly can.  So many people have rich, well thought out backgrounds, interesting stories, whole sub-plots that you could miss if you simply ignore them and walk by.  The story telling in this game has fully captivated me and I can't wait to play more.  I'll be sure to update this review as I get more experience with the game.  For the time being, I heavily suggest playing this game if you love a lore-rich world and you don't mind reading most of the time.  If you're looking for a ton of tactical combat then this probably isn't your game.			"

												I loved the original Planescape: Torment. I replayed it many many times because I hoped that I can learn more about the characters and their moving stories. After I finished the early access area of TToN in 17 hours and I liked it but it didn't give the intesive vibes the original game gave me. The game was less colorful than the original, the characters and the conversations felt a bit shallow and I hoped it will change later on but it didn't. I finished the second half of the game in 14 hours most of which i was fighting with the annoying and slow turn based combat (I was quite pleased with the fact that I could solve like 95% percent of quest without violence, but that turn based combat was horribly clunky) and most of the conversations revolved around the same thing... I will revisit the game when a translation in my native language appears, maybe I will change my mind. The game is not bad but don't expect the qualities of Planescape: Torment.			"

												I love the game so far, it has issues, but the history and the world are awesome, the combat is his weaker part but i love the narration. Like Plane Scape Torment is a game of lots of weight in the choices you make and the world and it people evolve with you. The game is definitely not for everyone. I loved Torment, Baldurs Gate...., Pillars, ETC and i love this game so far, if you like very heavy narration thi game is for you, if you like the combat ones like Divinity O.S, i think you will fin the combat in this game very basic and boring.Ps.

								As far as I know there's currently no other game out there quite like this, and while it still has some bugs and glitches in it to work out it's very enjoyable. The pace is slow and laid back, and if you enjoy games where you have time to think about how to approach a situation you'll probably enjoy this.			"

												You open your eyes. You are falling through the sky. You are the new conscience, birthed when your creator left the body you now possess. Alone, abandoned in a world you don’t know, you ask yourself: who will I become? What will be my mark on the world?Torment: Tides of Numenera is a narrative-focused, text heavy RPG. Even though it doesn’t continue the story of Planescape: Torment, ergo accessible to new players, it touches some of the same themes and builds on the formula of its antecessor. There is a lot of text. A LOT of text…The game adopts and adapts the tabletop RPG setting of Numenera by Monte Cook that takes place on a future Earth in which countless civilizations have risen and fell, leaving behind pieces of technology. These are the Numenera, that constitute riddles to be solved or devices to be feared by the new inhabitants of the planet. This gives the writing a pretty long leash to explore whatever it wants, with each sci-fi/fantasy vignette providing an opportunity to make you question what you thing about identity, legacy, morality. What do you say to a hideous mutant that everybody hates for its appearance that is considering a pretty invasive equivalent of plastic surgery? Do you think it’s better to be truthful to what he is, potentially subjecting him to a lifetime of poverty and exclusion? Is it better for him to change completely? Does he have someone that loves him for what he is and should that have weight on his decision? Should you, a stranger, even get involved with his choice? This is only a 5 minute episode in a journey that has taken me close to 50 hours to complete. You will walk on a transdimensional predator that also happens to be a city, meet an ancient warmonger condemn to an eternity of peace, a religious leader enslaved by the adoration of his followers, learn of an endless conflict between two sides who can rewind events to get different outcomes, and an alien creature that is fascinated by our mating habits. Some of your companions have some great depth. Continuing the cliché-braking of Fall-from-Grace from Planescape: Torment, Erritis is, at first glance, the heroic, reckless warrior, but with time (or the ability “Scan Thoughts”) you start to see there is something more to him and a interesting deconstruction of the Hero trope. Rhin, is a controversial companion. She is a child you can choose to take in, and once you choose to, you have to stick by that decision and keep her in the party or lose her forever. This worked well for me, because it made sense that a lost child, with a talent for hiding and who had been betrayed several times before, would not stick around once you had abandoned her. However, this is controversial because she isn’t the most useful in combat and some people feel frustrated by having to keep her in the party to see her storyline unfold. To me, she was a character I had to be a father-figure to, and would try to shield from harm, not because she was bad in combat, but because I didn’t want her getting hurt. Some call it emotional manipulation, I say I have no problem with a character that wants you to see her as more than a chess piece. There have also been some complaints about the use of less common words that, to me, English not being my first language, don’t seem prevalent enough to be distracting or unintelligible and, when they come up, add to some of the strangeness of the world.Presentation could be better, with very little in terms of narration and voice-acting and the beauty of the 2D back-drops contrasts with the blurry character models. It is evident that you are supposed to do most of the work with your imagination, often too much, but if you have the habit of reading, you probably can get passed this hurdle.The combat is relatively limited. Much of it can be avoid by having the right skills and choosing the right option in dialogue, but when you can’t or choose not to you enter a Crisis. A Crisis puts you in a turn-based battle with your party, where you can use your weapons, abilities, items do defeat your enemies. The way it stands out, however, is that in some cases you can resort to dialogue to make some opponents surrender or even turn to your side. Sometimes, even the order in which your foes fall have different consequences, although I can’t really tell to which extent with only one playthrough. These sequences were occasionally fiddly to interact with (sometimes not being clear if a character is blocking the way do something, for example) and buggy in some areas (namely in Anechoic Lazaret). That being said, I played in the first week and I’m sure there will be patches to fix a great deal of it. You can see some crisis shine with their intricacies in a way where you wished there were more of them. One of them in The Bloom is a good example: when you enter one of the areas, you are put into a Crisis that hasn’t yet turned violent, but must decide in the time-span of a couple of turns which side of the battle to take or if you can even defuse the situation. It was a welcomed change of pace that I feel could have been integrated and adapted to other quests.Having played Planescape: Torment for the first time in about a year or so, and still not having nostalgia settled in, playing Torment: Tides of Numenera felt very much like playing Planescape. Just as with latter, I couldn’t put it down for more than a day, always wishing to tie some loose thread or see what was waiting in that unexplored corner of the map. All this without bats and thugs coming out of nowhere for an arbitrary battle.For those looking for a comparison, I still cannot decide if Torment is better than its antecessor. It would take second playthroughs (which I haven’t taken off the table) of both of them to say for sure. What I can say is that Torment: Tides of Numenera is an acquired taste, but a modern masterpiece in interactive narrative nevertheless. A little polish here and there and it can stand tall and proud in my top 5 (or even maybe 3) games of all time.			"

												This game is surely not for everybody, which might explain the many negative reviews in steam, but it also offers a depth in storytelling and world building that most games do not.Presentation: The drawn backgrounds look at least good and sometimes awesome and some even made me stop and admire them in awe. Also the locations are packed with details and always look promising. The character models are not that detailed and their animations are rather rudimentary.The music and sound effects are rather reserved but do their job well.Game design: A big plus are the various solutions the game offers to solve a problem, mostly considering various positions and make choices that are both reflecting the attitude of the character and have understandable consequences for the game world. In other words: It really makes sense to role-play and get involved into the world. A minus point is the rather thin combat system as it does not allow much strategic thinking and is more a means to an end than a complex system.Balance: As already mentioned, it is often possible to solve problems in multiple ways and even failures can lead to new paths. There is also a good mixture of dialogues, exploration and riddles. Some combats seemed a bit unfair, also due to the limited range of actions available.Story/Atmosphere: Here it is where the game shines the most. From what I have seen so far, the texts (there are a lot of them) are excellent and do not only make up for the missing voice overs or lack of visualization, but enabled me to create an even more dense world inside my head. This is both true for the dialogues, the descriptions of the environment and the interactions with the objects in the world. I really care for the fate of my character and want to know more about him and his origins and how he will develop.I have not backed  this game and only played very little of Planescape Torment but so far it has been a really unique experience and it makes me sad to see that the game receives rather mixed reviews on steam.I hope this review sheds some better light on the game which it definitely deserves.

Early Access Review
								So far I've clocked in just over 4 hours of Tides and I have to say it's just whizzed by. I've been waiting for this game to be released for what seems like an eternity (my own personal torment) and although this is just a Beta it still gives a great indication of what the finished game will be like. I was a big, big fan of Planescape Torment and this game so far is matching (and surpassing) my expectations. Great story telling, interesting characters, beautiful scenery and a multitude of choices/ options. A few other niggly things i expect to get fixed before final release - maps aren't clickable; bugs exist on UI and inventory screen (which is to be expected); the skill system does take a bit of time getting used to and it can be a tad confusing at the start; and no Morte :-(Overall a bright start and it makes me excited for the 2017 release (which seems like agesss away!)

												This is my first review so, you know, sorryIMHO this is a greate game - but not necesseraly necessarily for everyone.The rule of thumb (once again, IMHO) is simple - if you like challenging story and characters, gameplay based on desisions, investigation and character development, settings based on bizzare and slightly over-the top sci-fi/almost fantasy (think Moorcock and Vernor Vinge), and yes - a lots of text - you will love itIf you are here for the fast combat, mini-maxing strategies and difficult bosses, level-grinding etc. - skip this game.The real problem of the game is that we have the same genre-tag for games like this and, lets say, Mass-Effect or FF. Frankly speaking - they are not related.I personaly liked this game very much (based on just one playthrough finished yesterday) - and very much recommend it as true and rightful heir to PT.			"

												This is my first review, I felt compelled to write it after seeing the ""mostly positive"" score.  This game is not for everyone.  It requires a lot of patience Ultimately, likely whether or not you will enjoy this game comes down to what you look for in a game, specifically an rpg.  If you are looking for a game that's fast paced with a lot of combat or a sword and sorcery type of rpg this will dissapoint you.  If on the other hand you are looking to lose yourself in a strange eccentric world and enjoy deep storytelling this game is a marvel.  If, like me, Planescape Torment was among your favorite games of all time then this game will satisfy like no other has since.			"

												The best of the 'new wave' of RPGs. I've not lost myself in a story so much since Baldur's Gate 2. THere is a LOT of reading. But you have to read it. It is not an action game. Try to skip bits and the whole point disapears. But when you do read it it is utterly joyous.A truly beautiful game.			"

												The writing is excellent, the setting mesmerizing, I look forward to many hours spent exploring the world.That being said, the user interface is a cluttered, ugly, kitschy mess I would expect from a Chinese phone game, not what aspires to be an AAA RPG.			"

												Torment: Tides of Numenera is a overall neat Science Fantasy RPG, a lackluster spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment in some regards, and a better one in others. Mind you, I find the pseudo-intellectuality, inherently, stronger in the PnP RPG Planescape setting than the Numenera one, even if the creativity is stronger in the former ... Christianity is Platonism for the people... Thematically I think that they nailed Abandonment--it's beautifully woven into the setting, the narrative and the overall ambience-- and to a lesser degree Mystery where I am a bit mixed, whereas Legacy especially in the form of the ending is lacking and lackluster. Which brings me to philosophy, this speaks of high culture, even if the Planescape setting and Planescape: Torment of course was a mix of pop culture and high culture, and so is obviously Numenera and this game. Regardless I don't know if the developers  ran out of time or had unrealistic ambitions, or I had unrealistic expectations... Do the new companions live up to their heritage? No sadly not though I still find them fairly interesting. For my first play-through I had Callistege, Rhin and Matkina along with me. Also they seemed to be bugged so I had no inter-party banter between them :/. But on a strictly conceptual level I didn't find them as compelling as say Morte, Fall-From-Grace or Dak'kon - some of the more fleshed out companions from Planescape: Torment. The emotional journey I went through with them seemed impactless concerning their predicaments, though it probably would have helped quite a bit with party banter. As their comments on quests and NPCs were interesting and helped developing them. The companions partially had it easier in Planescape: Torment, in virtue of the fact that The Nameless One / The Player-Character had a history with, some of, them before the game began, making the player more emotionally invested in them. I didn't really care about any of the three companions from Numenera when the game was done, though there was some cool things no doubt and potential for greatness! Another minus is the bland and deliberately limited Voice Acting, I'd wish they'd use resources on other parts of the game when it wasn't of better quality.    Combat is sadly lackluster while it was a noble ideal to get rid of filler encounters, the mandatory combat /Crisis encounters weren't interesting in my combat-avoiding-Playthrough. It strikes me as a bit peculiar to use this many resources on this aspect of the game without using enough to make combat truly compelling. The occasional bugs in one mandatory fight made it especially tedious to go through several times. Overall I think the game is a glorious and worthy spiritual successor even if it's a bit bland and lacking in certain aspects, it's shining in others even if it never quite reaches or surpass its predecessor concerning its artistic and narrative vision - though it's most likely stronger in the choice and consequence department for instance. Hope that InXile Entertainment will be more upfront, transparent and honest with their backers in the future or I'll lose trust in them.  "

												10 hours in the game and it's simply amazing. I was a big fan of Planescape and this game is a good successor. Pros:- Good Story- Deep Characters- Text/Dialogue heavy gameCons:- Honestly I don't know Right now game has mixed reviews on Steam, but after reading several of them, I can't help but feel that many people had some kind of dream of what this game might be (several of this people didn't even play Planescape based on their replies) and therefore were disappointed. Please, don't trust them. If you're a fan of reading, good story and interesting choices, give this game a try. That game is nowhere near Pillar of Eternity or Divinity: OS and thank god for that. Both these games had a lackluster story, grindy battles and TBH were a disappointment compared to P:T or BG. Unlike them Numenera HAS a story, deep interesting compnions and amazing setting.Updated my journal.			"

												This is my first review, I felt compelled to write it after seeing the ""mostly positive"" score.  This game is not for everyone.  It requires a lot of patience Ultimately, likely whether or not you will enjoy this game comes down to what you look for in a game, specifically an rpg.  If you are looking for a game that's fast paced with a lot of combat or a sword and sorcery type of rpg this will dissapoint you.  If on the other hand you are looking to lose yourself in a strange eccentric world and enjoy deep storytelling this game is a marvel.  If, like me, Planescape Torment was among your favorite games of all time then this game will satisfy like no other has since.			"

												25 hours of gameplay? Either i`m that good or this game is totally not worth it. Don`t get me wrong, I really do apprieciate the story, feeling, dialogs and so. I really love the system with tree base stats and pools to use during combat/checks. But hell i`ve seen bigger demos than this game (ok i admit here i exaggerate a bit but just a bit). The general feeling after finishing this game is that i paid for greate, epic, long journey with loads of adventures. Game filled with quests, npcs that i can interact with, faction that i can join or fight with and so on. And all I was give is just a sample of this story, first act of many. That`s the general feeling. The only problem is that with all these problems i would still recomend this game if you liked BG and P:T.Now let me tell you what i really like and dislike about this game: +Stat system - you have 3 main stats with pools that you use during gameplay. Excelent idea. Simple, elegant, flexible yet this aproach force you to make decisions, to think, to tinker with points. Every lvl up means sth. There is no such thing as waiting x lvls to improve some skill in orther to get synergy etc. etc. Simplicyty is the key. Quests - quests are simply awesome. There are of course simple things such as go and retrieve, but man, there are some really good quests. Story - is absoloutly fantastic. Plot twists are superb. There would be good book out of this game. Pity book would have only like 50 pages. -Character development - c`mon 1 skill per tier? I was playing as nano, in hope of some awesome high lvl spells (remember Planescape?). Nothing even close to this. Fight - I admit, there was like 6 of total fights during my game. But UI during fight is a catastrophe. From not being able to cast a spell bcs screen freezes and i can`t scroll it, to strange lags during skipping turns with outcome that i skipped turn for my next char as well. Quests - or rather missing some big sidequests, or even big main quest. There are no faction that you can join or fight with. Each side quest is a one step quest. Minor bugs - there is one quest when you are up for retrieving a battle standar. I retrieved it three times. First i persuaded guy, then i intimidated and last but not least i did what guy asked for (i showed him what it means to fly). Gladly quest giver didn`t say a word when i brought him his unique item three times. "

												I will recommend this game for now and from what I've experienced so far and do an update of this review as I progress or finish the game.Now, first a little bit of criticism. The intro or character creation part is a hassle, after you've done it five times or so atleast. It's just too bad because it takes a bit away from the replayability imo. I have no idea why the developers didn't use the Story Trailer as an intro and setup to the game(rather than just a marketing tool) and with a quick character creation sheet then just start as you wake at the Chamber with Callistege and Aligern. Too much info dropping with the specter  character and the whole segment feels off. This is actually my main complaint so far and it feels unneccesary and could have easily been cut off from the game. Btw quality of the content comes first in my world atleast.Since the actual game started though I've really been enjoying the conversations, quests, environments and characters. I always feel like I'm ready to explore and find out more about the world when I play Tides of Numenera. It is easy to get sucked into this game. In a good way. I mean the writing is good, not perfect but heck nor was the writing in Planescape: Torment.Hold your horses, I actually LIKED the combat. It's still a bit messy but enjoyable and for once the combat music is quite good aswell.So I'll definetly keep playing to find out more of this game. Will it live up to the legacy? I'm not sure, probably not entirely but atleast it seems like a worthy addition to Planescape: Torment so far.			"

												It's like playing Fallout 2 for the first time. A lot of people complaning have their nostalgia set to 11, old CRPGs were not fast past until Dragon Age Origins.The setting, tones , dialouge, and depth of the world in this game is consistently blowing me away. This game has lore/conversations/minor investigations just for the sake of having them. I can't put this game down, meanwhile I rack up hour after hour in Pilliars unable to get past the first act because NOTHING IN THAT GAME IS ENGAGNGING IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.If you enjoyed combat in fallout more than in Baldurs gate, and find marvel strangeworld comics awesome, get this game.

Early Access Review
								So far, so good. Not quite that into it yet, but I can tell I'm going to like it. Can't wait to be able to sink into it a little bit more when I find time. The game needs to be optimized quite a bit more. I'm running a 980 ti on 4790k @ 4.4 ghz with a samsung ssd evo and 16gb of ram and my computer's load kicks into high gear, not to mention the frames are poor. I have dual 980 ti's, but didn't have sli enabled so not sure how it runs when I have both of them going, but I would imagine not any better in the the game's current state. Needless to say - I'm sure it will be much improved upon by release, but for now optimization is lacking.Going to update this once I have some more hours into it, but so far it's been pretty engaging. The writing is great and the voice acting I have heard thus far is pretty decent. "

Minor bugs - there is one quest when you are up for retrieving a battle standar. I retrieved it three times. First i persuaded guy, then i intimidated and last but not least i did what guy asked for (i showed him what it means to fly). Gladly quest giver didn`t say a word when i brought him his unique item three times. "

												I will recommend this game for now and from what I've experienced so far and do an update of this review as I progress or finish the game.Now, first a little bit of criticism. The intro or character creation part is a hassle, after you've done it five times or so atleast. It's just too bad because it takes a bit away from the replayability imo. I have no idea why the developers didn't use the Story Trailer as an intro and setup to the game(rather than just a marketing tool) and with a quick character creation sheet then just start as you wake at the Chamber with Callistege and Aligern. Too much info dropping with the specter  character and the whole segment feels off. This is actually my main complaint so far and it feels unneccesary and could have easily been cut off from the game. Btw quality of the content comes first in my world atleast.Since the actual game started though I've really been enjoying the conversations, quests, environments and characters. I always feel like I'm ready to explore and find out more about the world when I play Tides of Numenera. It is easy to get sucked into this game. In a good way. I mean the writing is good, not perfect but heck nor was the writing in Planescape: Torment.Hold your horses, I actually LIKED the combat. It's still a bit messy but enjoyable and for once the combat music is quite good aswell.So I'll definetly keep playing to find out more of this game. Will it live up to the legacy? I'm not sure, probably not entirely but atleast it seems like a worthy addition to Planescape: Torment so far.			"

												Tides of Numenera feels like a true successor to planescape:Torment, both are set in wildly creative universes with the players choices changing the world around them. However like planescape it's a little buggy and sometimes a little sloppy around the edges.It feels a little short and on rails for an computer RPG espesially one touted as a sucsessor for Planscape torment.I reccomend tis if you are looking for the strange and fantastical and don't mind reading walls and walls of text. if you are neither of these than this game is not for you.

												For all of those who are planning to buy the game i will give you a short ater 15 hours of Torment - ToN (Alpha Access).""BUY IT!Because i was more than entertained since my first hours of the game, and i am still now!The coolest thing on Torment for me is certainly the Numenera setting! The designers have taken full advantage of Numenera's possibilities to create a game that is more than various in it's appearance in the first few hours. It took my hours to step through the first departments of the first city just for talking to every person i can find. I felt every second person in the game has something to tell, that is a holarious amount of occupying content....for me!ATTENTION:I like this alot, but if you want to find more drive in a story, Torment may not be the right thing for you. The mass of text has almost Baldur's Gate 2 level! But the dialogues are all interesting - without exception!Gameplay itself has actually only 2 things to say:1. Depending on your response in the dialogs, you collect skillpoints in the so-called tides. There is a whole bunch of these tides (gold, silver, blue ...) and the tide with the  most collected skill points defines how the character is perceived by its environment. 2. You can determine to make skill checks easier by using points from one of the pools (strength, speed and intelligence). However, these pools are limited!			"

												3.3 hrs into the game and I really gotta say: It's not as good as Planescape: Torment, but also there's no other game that gets this close to the perfection and epicness of P: T.

Early Access Review
								I have played the first bits of the game and so far, I am very much impressed. The writing is top-notch, and it really brought back those times when an RPG game really puts you in the shoes of your character. The amount of lore, the presence of literary power, and philosophical queries places this game in my list of video games as gesamntkunstwerk (total art), as an experience. Truly, the developers are one of those legendary people who are sent to this world to create these type of games.The game has its performance issues, of course, since it is still on Early Access. A load of bugs, optimization issues, and in my case, I experience tons of lag especially in the beginning of the game. Hopefully, the developers will do work on these issues and I wish them luck on that.To sum up, this is the type of game you should buy and play because it immerses you into a world that is merely a reflection of our own. The decisions of the Last Castoff are refractions of your decisions in your own life. I think video games (open-ended/open-world RPG's in particular [tho T:ToN is more open-ended]) are an existential commodity that serves as a prism to our own experiences in life. And with the emergence of games like Torment: Tides of Numenera, I think its players will get to answer questions about individuality, the weight of their choices in this tapestry of life, and most importantly, they will get a glimpse of the essence of their existence.

												I am one of the exceptions here in that I enjoyed the lengthy dialogue, despite its sometimes tedious verbosity. I enjoyed my experience, although, as other reviewers have mentioned, this game is not without its flaws. Predominantly, I didn't find myself particularly drawn to any party members, as their characterization seemed a bit tepid and lacked that distinctive allure that party members in similar game offerings feature.The conclusion was disappointingly, but expectedly, abrupt. I was pleased, however, that my dominant tides were at least referenced at the end, even if I didn't feel that they had a significant impact. The later sections in the game felt somewhat rushed in comparison to earlier sections.Again, I'll place myself in the minority by stating that the dearth of combat options didn't irk me. Plenty of alternatives exist, new and old, in terms of other RPGs if combat is a must. I enjoyed actually being able to think outside of the box to some extent, even if sometimes the presented options seemed a bit contrived or unimpactful. I really thought the ""Tides"" system, while admittedly simply another version of various RPG attribute systems, was nonetheless interesting in its own right, and characters throughout the game commonly remark on your dominant tides or when you behave in a manner inconsistent with previous choices.This game does take place in a futuristic setting riddled with anachronisms, and it feels like a setting straight out of a Jules Verne or H.G. Wells novel. The soundtrack is pleasant but largely forgettable, and voiceovers are sparse, which is probably a good thing since the quality of the voices, when present, leaves something to be desired.Ultimately, if you're looking for an epic that keeps you on the edge of the seat, I advise you to look elsewhere. This isn't Star Wars or Mass Effect (and I have a great admiration for these), but I can appreciate it for what it is: an enigmatic, intruiguingly bizarre, and beautifully rendered creation with sometimes engaging and sometimes tedious prose that will wholly absorb you if you allow it. It's not going to be in my top five RPGs, but it was an enjoyably unique experience nonetheless.			"

												Good game but not one of the best CRPGs of the last few years. I really enjoyed the world and some of the characters, but a lot of mechanics could have used more work. It´s way too easy to 100% every skill check since you can use your companions skills as well and leveling up only gives you boring choices - I actually never thought I was stronger or any different from level one all the way to maximum level. I still recommend it since it was a fun game overall - some interesting quests and npcs (not your companions, they are pretty bland) - but there are more interesting CRPGs out there, like Divinity, Tyranny and even Wasteland 2, also made by inXile. 7/10.

Early Access Review
								It breaks my heart that I didn't get completely hooked on this game. If I hadn't kickstarted it (what like... four years ago?) I'd probably return it like I did with Tyranny and wait for it to be polished.On the pro side, they really delivered with the diaglouge and depth of conversations. Most of my playtime has been spent just talking to all the NPCs in the first town, learning their backstories, and doing some side quests. I obviously didn't get all that far but it seems like there is going to be a hell of a lot of content. The graphics for this type of game are top notch and more interesting that Pillars of Eternity, and I also appreciated the very generous zoom levels.What's killing it for me is a design decision that they can't at all back away from at this point: Combat. Whereas Planescape Torment has a tremendous amount of combat that is fast paced (for CRPG), viseral, and fun, Tides has... almost none. In four hours I've literally been in two fights that lasted all of a minute. There is so little conflict/action that I'm not even going to bother complaining about the mechanics of combat- why bother? So with that said, whats the point of having so many skills, abilities, and equipment if you almost never get to use them? its at the point where I think if I ever pick this game up again I'm going to go out of my way to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pick fights with everyone possible.Lastly, and I'll admit this might be premature given my playtime, but the five recruitable NPCs I've met so far are all human and are all boring.  A far cry from PS:T, where all I wanted to do was just talk with Dakkon all day about everything and anything Zerth related.			"

												Torment: Tides of Numenera nails the old Fallout 1&2 / Baldurs Gate / Planescape Torment CRPG format.It's what I hoped Pillars of Eternity would be.There is SO much to read and learn about the world, the game ozes with history, lore, personal stories, mystical beings  and throws these at you at a overwhelming pace at first. But then you are able to set in and understand that this world is strange and complex and you are supposed to feel overwhelmed by all the quirky weird billion years old tech gadgets and multidimensional hivemind wizards. The quality of writing is magnificent and the quantity of it is simply immense (as can be expected for a Planescape Torment ""sequel"").While the engine is dated, and graphics are not the focal point of a game that is so rich in story, the graphical design is really beautiful. The Numenera ruleset is quirky and different from what Im used to but I think that sits well with the quirky and different from what Im used to world that the game takes place in.Combat so far has been a bit boring, but that part honestly is the least of my worries in a story driven game like this.I made a promise to my self to never pre-order / kickstart / indiegogo another product if this one falls flat on its face, but it doesnt. It delivers on what I wanted and more. Now I gotta get back to playing the damn thing.			"

												Very enjoyable/memorable experience. Not recommended for anyone without patience. Dialogue options feel strategic. Failing a dialogue is the same as succeeding a dialogue which prevents save scumming for these kind of games. It allowed me to move forward without ""buyers remorse"" feeling. To say the story took me out of my comfort zone would be a strong understatement. This game is weird. Not the kind of acidtrip everyone's head is a unicorn type of weird either. Nothing felt traditional which made this a very worthwhile experience for me. The writing is astounding. I got my family together and read some of the mini stories to them and they helped pick some of the decisions.			"

												Firstly, it's not Planescape torment, but it's a worthwhile game to play if only because they obviously had so much respect for the original game.I personally don't get the aversion to 'trash mobs' and would have appreciated more comabt within the game because to me it felt unrealistic that you didn't actually fight much when you are going through the game world. You can't talk yourself out of every situation, especially when you are infiltrating places and pursuing your own objectives and ignoring everything else.The main quest storyline isn't anything amazing, however there is a lot of cool ideas and backstories and 'flavour' within the game that is well worth uncovering.However if you can't handle reading anything longer than this review, this is not the game for you, you are expected to read and absorb what is going on around you and what you are meant to do next.The ending felt slightly disappointing as well, but overall it was an enjoyable game that I'll probably play again once they add back the stuff that was left out due to time constraints.

												First quick about me, I am a veteran RPG & CRPG player, the old Planescape Torment is still my favourite RPG game.--- What I liked ---I really liked the locations in the game. Both main locations are brimming with flavour, nicely presented through images, dialogues, quests, companions ... It sometimes feels over the top, but that's exactly what the world of Numenera should be like, and it makes it very interesting to interact with and explore. Especially Bloom rocks!Overall experience of playing is also quite good, pacing is OK, there is always another interesting quest or location round the corner. --- Issues --- -- Main Soryline -- I found the main storyline very unbelievable, and also the main protagonists of it very wooden. (Minor Spoiler) There is a war between the Changing God and the First Castoff, called the ""Endless War"" at least 100 years old. But ... although it is such a central point of the story, it is never explained what is it for? It doesn't seem to have any objective, it is never explained what they want to acomplish. And if you spend centuries slugging at each other, with vast armies of men and machines, in what seems to be a middle of nowhere, shouldn't there be some point to it? At least a city/laboratory/important huge artifact to attack or defend, that should feature in the story in some way? The leaders of both sides don't even take part in it, they hide somewhere entirely else.I feel that a ""Secret Cults"" type of Endless War, 2 organizations slugging at each other wherever they can discover each other's laboratories, safe havens et, and then disappearing in the shadows would fit the theme much better.I assume it was supposed to reflect the ""Endless War"" in Planescape, between Devils and Deamons. That one made much more sense, was firmly rooted in the cosmology.Also the main 2 protagonists of this conflict. Bot hare so utterly uninteresting! The Changing God is a lying dork. First Castoff is an angry teenager. One of the facets of Planescape: Torment I really liked was the centrality of ideas, different characters embodying different views and ways of seeing life. This made that game very interesting, whereas here the main characters are just flat. -- The Ending --Very anticlimatic. No final showdown of any appreciable sort. I recently finished Shadowrun:Dragonfall, so much more interesting Ending there ...-- Companion Stories --If you're doing only 6, you could have made them better. I did like the story of Erritis, but all others felt bland, especially Tybir. Again, the issue here is that I couldn't really empathize with any of the characters.-- Tides --What's the point of them? It is nice to see and manage your ""colour"", but it doesn't seem to influence anything. For a feature that made to the Title of the game, pretty disappointing. -- Smaller stuff --Portraits! Why are there no portraits of people you talk to? CGiving a face to a person really helps.Besides, the only existing portraits, of companions (and Last Castoff) are horrible. Only 3 Foci, all of them bland ... wastes such a nice Numenera mechanic.--- So So ---Fighting system is OK, although unbalanced. That's OK tohugh, it is not a war game, and yo ucan always use some Cyphers to help you out.--- Overall ---  It is a good game, strongly inspired by Planescape: Torment. Immortal protagonist, who did some bad things in previous lives and doesn't rememeber it, lots of interesting encounters and general interesting weirdness ... But Planescape Torment it ain't. What I liked a lot in Planescape, was the exploration of ideas and attitudes. Here, you can see that from time to time, but it all feels flat. Only exception for me were the Memoralists faction, but even them, they were hard to empathize with. So enjoy the atmosphere and all the side quests, and don't mind too much the main quest :-) . "

												It's a very tough one to review in a short space so I will keep it brief. ToN preserves the sense of alien-ness you got with the original Torment without trying to link itself TOO directly. To me this is a smart move because to do so would only invite all the nerd-ranger (rager?) fans from crucifying it for minor reasons. I like that this game also adds a much needed extra element to conversation options because although there is no way out of the basic mechanic of that it was becoming very stale and, whilst not everyone will appreciate the change, I find the solution quite elegant as well as more realistic. It's not for anyone who isnt into descriptive text and is even more of a slow starter than others of its kind but that is because it builds atmosphere through that text so well that I would venture to suggest no other game handles that side of things better. Much like Tyranny it offers subtle but important innovations in the genre and is a brilliant and utterly absorbing game that wont be for everyone due to some significant flaws. If it's straight combat action you are looking for then don't even think about it. It has actually been made with those fussy purists in mind - how else CAN you follow a legend? I just feel the low combat model is a mistake.*edit*I have noticed that a lot of people are randomly downvoting this game across the board as well as randomly downvoting all positive reviews. Bare in mind that the achievements show that less than 15% of all players have even looked at the game in any sufficient depth. I am in that 15% and yet after 24 hrs play I have barely scratched the surface. You may be asking ""but WHY have so few played it more extensively?"". The answer to this is simply the way the game starts out. As I already mentioned, it's a very slow starter in terms of actual action. Expect to play for a good 10 hours and more before any meaningful combat. There ARE encounters you can enforce but there doesn't seem to be any benifit to doing so.			"

												If you liked Planescape: Torment for it's writing, odds are pretty good you'll like Torment: Tides of Numenera. I cannot stress that enough. The world of Numenera works quite well as a backdrop for a story that is reminiscent of PS:T's. My playthrough clocked in at a little over 30 hours and I was not bored once during that time. It's been a long time since I've delved this deeply into all the flavor text and NPC conversations that didn't even result in quests, but it was all just that interesting. I wish I could say the same of other recent cRPGs, but I cannot. Neither Pillars nor Divinity Original Sin came even close to being this engrossing for me. Both of those games have other strengths, Pillars looks slightly better and is closer to the old infinity engine games in terms of 'feel', Divinity has a more in-depth combat engine, but neither of those things are my #1 priority when it comes to RPGs. I'm here for the story primiarly and everything else is secondary to that.One thing that perhaps deserves special note is that in Tides of Numenera, when combat starts you don't necessarily have to kill everyone to end it. There are often other ways, even including talking to your ""enemies"" to resolve conflict. Most encounters can be overcome without entering combat, should you chose to do so. You can probably count the times you really *have* to kill people on one hand. I wouldn't let the negative reviews that focus on some of the things that were planned at some point and ended up not being in the game at the end ruin that for me. None of the great games in the past shipped with everything that was planned, those cuts just weren't quite as visible as developement was less transparant back then. Overall I would heartily recommend this game. It isn't perfect, but neither was the original. I was lucky enough to play PS:T when it first came out and funny enough, the reaction Tides of Numenera gets from some people is really similar to the reaction PS:T got back then. ""The world is so weird"", ""Combat isn't that great"", ""The protagonist is kinda ugly"". All of those might be true, but none of those things detract from the experience for me. If you liked the original PS:T I would strongly recommend checking this one out, and hey, if you don't enjoy it, Steam refunds games if you've played less than two hours. Maybe that's just me, but you'd have had to pry this game from my cold dead hands after one hour.			"

												Just finished the game. Overall impressions are very postive, mostly thanks to the Numenera setting and pretty good writing. The world of the game is pretty bizzare to say the least and in some parts feels like it came straight out from the creepiest pages of some P.K. D i c k novel. Of course while some quests are great, the others are pretty generic, but I wouldn't call any of them dull. The main questline is pretty good too, I found it involving and interesting with all its transhumanistic ideas and moral issues being the highlights. Now that I think about it, the game's plot also has some pretty depressing and would-be shocking moments, but unfurtunetely they are obscured by the overall otherworldliness of the setting.On a bad side, the story is somewhat unevenly paced with the Sagus Cliffs and Bloom parts being intense and content heavy while the middle and the final parts of the game feel mostly like linear fillers or story propellers.Character writing is okay, it's not stellar, but definetely not a failure as many reviewers on Steam suggest. But I must admit I felt the characters to be more of a gateway to understanding the Ninth World rather than some ""very interesting"" personalities you're supposed to run around and pester for the duration of the whole game.Now let's talk about the GAMEPLAY itself. That's where Numenera actually fails in a pretty bad way. While I like the Cypher System and think that it has been implemented pretty well within the game, I can't help but admit that the balance between stat pools is clearly off with Intellect being by far the most superior stat and Might being by far the most inferior, especially considering that the game is short on combat sequences.Another downside is that apart from the game's early stages you never feel threatened to run out of your stats resources, the pools are simply too big and, even more importantly, there's way too much possibilities for resting and refilling those pools. Most of the tasks are also too easy to complete, rendering the whole Effort system almost useless.Cyphers are another interesting part of the game, but just as with the stat pools you rarely feel any need for them because of how easy the game is how rare the fights are.Same goes for the abilities, there's simply too many of them for the absolutely tiny amout of combat within the game. That makes them feel unimpactful and redundant. But that's kind of a problem for the absolute majority of RPGs out there, too much useless and meaningless  junk, especially when it comes to skills and abilities.Tides are a good moral (viewpoint) indicator, but the problem with it again is that they change so slowly that no one decision feel very impactful when it comes to the Tides. It kind of makes sense when you think about it from the ideological point of view, but absolutely fails as a gameplay element.Overall I can recommend this game to anyone who isn't afraid of reading and is looking for an RPG that can offer you more than 10 romance options and 100 craftable items out of 1000 types of resources. It's a rough gem that could benifit a lot from proper play testing and tuning, but even as it is now, it can give you a lot if you bother to read and reflect.			"

												Very, very short.I like the skill/ combat system, which is different and seems to work well. I like the content as far as it goes.  With the exception of the starting city however the content seems very sparse, and the game, after all the buildup, is very short.So I'd have to say that after all the time and buildup it didn't live up to expectations.

Early Access Review
								I have played the first bits of the game and so far, I am very much impressed. The writing is top-notch, and it really brought back those times when an RPG game really puts you in the shoes of your character. The amount of lore, the presence of literary power, and philosophical queries places this game in my list of video games as gesamntkunstwerk (total art), as an experience. Truly, the developers are one of those legendary people who are sent to this world to create these type of games.The game has its performance issues, of course, since it is still on Early Access. A load of bugs, optimization issues, and in my case, I experience tons of lag especially in the beginning of the game. Hopefully, the developers will do work on these issues and I wish them luck on that.To sum up, this is the type of game you should buy and play because it immerses you into a world that is merely a reflection of our own. The decisions of the Last Castoff are refractions of your decisions in your own life. I think video games (open-ended/open-world RPG's in particular [tho T:ToN is more open-ended]) are an existential commodity that serves as a prism to our own experiences in life. And with the emergence of games like Torment: Tides of Numenera, I think its players will get to answer questions about individuality, the weight of their choices in this tapestry of life, and most importantly, they will get a glimpse of the essence of their existence.

So yes, it's absolutely brilliant so far. If you like story-driven RPGs, want to use your own imagination and your decisions to REALLY matter - get this game! The writing is just breathtaking.			"

												Tides of Numenera feels like a true successor to planescape:Torment, both are set in wildly creative universes with the players choices changing the world around them. However like planescape it's a little buggy and sometimes a little sloppy around the edges.It feels a little short and on rails for an computer RPG espesially one touted as a sucsessor for Planscape torment.I reccomend tis if you are looking for the strange and fantastical and don't mind reading walls and walls of text. if you are neither of these than this game is not for you.

												I am one of the exceptions here in that I enjoyed the lengthy dialogue, despite its sometimes tedious verbosity. I enjoyed my experience, although, as other reviewers have mentioned, this game is not without its flaws. Predominantly, I didn't find myself particularly drawn to any party members, as their characterization seemed a bit tepid and lacked that distinctive allure that party members in similar game offerings feature.The conclusion was disappointingly, but expectedly, abrupt. I was pleased, however, that my dominant tides were at least referenced at the end, even if I didn't feel that they had a significant impact. The later sections in the game felt somewhat rushed in comparison to earlier sections.Again, I'll place myself in the minority by stating that the dearth of combat options didn't irk me. Plenty of alternatives exist, new and old, in terms of other RPGs if combat is a must. I enjoyed actually being able to think outside of the box to some extent, even if sometimes the presented options seemed a bit contrived or unimpactful. I really thought the ""Tides"" system, while admittedly simply another version of various RPG attribute systems, was nonetheless interesting in its own right, and characters throughout the game commonly remark on your dominant tides or when you behave in a manner inconsistent with previous choices.This game does take place in a futuristic setting riddled with anachronisms, and it feels like a setting straight out of a Jules Verne or H.G. Wells novel. The soundtrack is pleasant but largely forgettable, and voiceovers are sparse, which is probably a good thing since the quality of the voices, when present, leaves something to be desired.Ultimately, if you're looking for an epic that keeps you on the edge of the seat, I advise you to look elsewhere. This isn't Star Wars or Mass Effect (and I have a great admiration for these), but I can appreciate it for what it is: an enigmatic, intruiguingly bizarre, and beautifully rendered creation with sometimes engaging and sometimes tedious prose that will wholly absorb you if you allow it. It's not going to be in my top five RPGs, but it was an enjoyably unique experience nonetheless.			"

												Absolutely love it. The environments are fantastic, the writing is completely on point, and it's not skewed towards  an aggressive/combat-oriented playstyle. There is a lot of reading to be done, which is really a subjective thing (I personally love it). The gameplay itself does feel somewhat linear (not necessarily a bad thing, mind you), but the amount of worldbuilding they do really mitigates that point.Pick this up if you want a well thought out game with one of the most bizzare settings you'll ever see.

												Torment Tides of Numenera, as the spiritual successor to Planescape Torment, had big shoes to fill.Which it did (unexpectedly). I was happy to back it but always thought the game would be serviceable but not exceptional. I was wrong about that. The world building is fantastic (a great world to learn about and travel in), good music, no combat every 5 seconds (i am looking at you pillars of eternity). Weird characters, places, dimensions. A good storyline that finishes satisfactory and wildly divergent questlines. All in all one of the best isometric rpg's of the last few years and although having liked wasteland 2 before this game definitely turned me into a fan of Inxile. Meaty timewise (about 35 hours) without overstaying its welcome. Would definitely recommend at any price.  "

												The idea of a spiritual successor to PS:T created a ton of hype.Some of this hype was warranted, some of it was not.I didn't follow the Kickstarter campaign and I didn't contribute (I often don't due to past KS dissapointments that I managed to sidestep with my general laziness towards contributing). My perspective comes from not having time to develop ridiculous amounts of hope only to be slapped with disappointment in the end (which is what I've taken away from a bunch of the reviews here).All I know - being a HUGE, HUGE fan of PS:T - is that when T:ToN was announced, I got a warm, fuzzy feeling.With that said, the game ain't perfect. It took 15 hours of slow enjoyment for it to grow on me. That's where I am now, roughly, but instead of coming home from work tonight and going ""Let's see if this gets any better,"" I came home going, ""Let's see how much better it can get from here."" A small shift, but a notable one.On the Writing:I'm the kind of CRPG player that devours lore. I've gotta be in the mood for it, but when I am, I inhale as much of it as possible. I've seen complaints that a lot of the writing in T:ToN was unnecessary and didn't serve the plot... this is true, but I don't see a problem with it. They're building a complex atmosphere that goes far beyond the plot. I have no prior familiarity with the whole Numenera setting, but every paragraph I read, I like it a little more. It's a slow, steady build-up. A large undertaking for a setting with such a massive background. As of right now, the main plot (as it's revealed itself to me so far) is not terribly interesting and frankly feels kinda tropey (""Ooo look at me, son of <POWERFUL♥♥♥♥♥KING/DEITY/ETC> and I'm all confused and have to learn about my powers and my place in the world - blah blah blah""), but it works for what it is. It was way less interesting 12 hours in. More so 9 hours in. Even more so 5 hours in. At hour 3, I was basically calling the game a disappointment. Give it all time to grow on you and try to actually read and visualize the sometimes-long-winded descriptions. Yeah, it's wordy. Yeah, it feels like they went a little too hard after writing, but it's ultimately pretty decent.On the Choice of the Numenera Tabletop System:Again, no background with the setting or the tabletop system but they seriously could've done without it. I absolutely hate the Might/Speed/Intellect stat pool concept. It's kind of cool in certain scenarios, but it feels weak in general. I haven't had any issues with running my stat pools empty before I can safely rest up to regain the points like I've read in some reviews, but stat pools make the game feel a bit more like a chore. Somewhere out there was a more graceful way to handle stuff like this... but that would involve dumping the Numenera system and I guess they married themselves to it.On the Combat:The combat is pretty terrible (hey, just like in PS:T!), but not wholly unenjoyable. It takes a bit of getting used to and there isn't much of it, so I suppose that's a plus. The concept of cyphers is virtually useless. So far I've acquired plenty more than I've been able, or had the need, to use and every time I get a new one, I groan because my main PC gets it and he immediately gets cypher sickness, so I have to figure out who I can give it to avoid the penalties... what's worse is that combat is rare enough that I don't want to put points into cypher-related skills because I'd rather dump them into stuff like Persuasion and Perception to allow me to further dialogue in more interesting ways.On Character Progression:Leveling characters was so-so. In other CRPGs, distributing points and choosing skills was always  something that made the pleasure center in my brain go off everytime my party members flashed on a level up. In T:ToN, it just felt incredibly limited. Starting with only 3 classes and kind of ending up pigeonholed into 4 party members sharing 3 roles, trying to divvy up dialogue-related skills among them while also trying to keep them combat ready with more useful skills feels a bit tedious.On Available Party Members:The size of the cast of party members is pretty standard fare for a CRPG. Party size is 4 (including the main character) and you have a choice of 6 different characters you can use to make up your Last Castoff's team. The characters themselves are interesting in their own ways, but ultimately underwhelming. My current party makeup consists of Aligern, Erritis, and Matkina. Mainly because I wanted to hava decent spread and 2 jacks, a nano with decent combat abilities, and a glaive have been a good mix for me so far (I recently traded Tybir out for Matkina because I liker her backstory more and my Last Castoff is built with Intellect/dialogue checks in mind so Tybir was kind of redundant).Some of the people who have managed to scale this far down this wall of text might be thinking, ""Man, this guy is not making this game seem like it's worth much,"" but I have to say that at this point, T:ToN's whole is actually much greater than the sum of it's parts. At some point, the feeling I was chasing after from PS:T clicked in and I realized that this really IS a spiritual successor to PS:T.For all of it's faults, my initial disappointment turned to disinterest which has now ultimately turned into a simmering appreciation. I'm now hoping that it'll turn at least to a low boil before I see the credits roll.Pesonally, I would have much preferred a PS:T successor that took place in the original game's setting with a much wider scope than just running around Sigil and getting a peek at a a few alternate dimensions. Hell, I would have accepted just another romp through Sigil (the city is constantly changing - they could have done a LOT with that concept, frankly).What we got instead was T:ToN and you know what? I'll take it.-----TL;DRThis♥♥♥♥♥♥ain't your granddaddy's CRPG - Numenera flies in the face of everything you know from D&D-based CRPGs... you'll have to be open-minded and allow for the paradigm shift if you want to actually enjoy it.For PS:T Fans - It's definitely worth playing. The art and general weirdness are actually quite reminiscent of PS:T if you allow yourself to see it. It takes its sweet♥♥♥♥♥time getting good, but eventually you'll start to get those flashes of PS:T that you're looking for. Don't let the completely different setting and system fool you into writing it off immediately.For general CRPG Fans -  If you like dialogue/lore/reading heavy games with incredibly weird settings, you might wanna look T:ToN up and give it an honest spin.For combat-heavy CRPG fans - Move along. Nothing to see here.			"

YouTube™ Video: Is it worth it? Torment: Tides of Numenera 

			Views: 23,143		

			***DISCLOSURE REMINDER: THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY SIDALPHA ON KICKSTARTER*** Torment: Tides of Numenera is a CRPG developed by inXile Entertainment.		

I showcased Torment: Tides of Numenera on my FIrst Impressions Series Is it worth it? And I can honestly say that I am exceptionally impressed with the game's story arc and it's mechanics so far. It definitely shows off the Numenera TTRPG system and that it can indeed adapt well to a PC Gaming experience.A true CRPG by every definition that I can think of, I found nothing to fault with the game.. and as a Reviewer I was actively looking for issues. If I were to claim a fault it would be some of the walls of text can get a touch tedious and could potentially turn away those that are new to the genre, but fans of CRPGswill eat it up as much as I did.9/10 This game has been outstanding so far and I look forward to exploring everything it has to offer!

												Welcome to T:TON, the show where everything's made up and the points don't matter. That's right, the points are just like a hat in an orgy.My only gripe in this game is irrelevance of character building, and oh boy is it a big gripe.You'll make a talky guy and you'll 250% all conversations and the companions faceroll all combat content.You make a combat guy and you faceroll all combat content and 150% all conversations without breaking even a sweat.If you have the foreknowledge to know what permanent stat boosts to hit in the beginning of the game you'll hit all the knowledge/perception/anamnesia checkpoint rolls flawlessly straight out of the gate even as an inept monkey without even his signature wrench.Its... all... fluff! Like storyline to Diablo 3, T:TON treats character building decisions as the crusty cream over the doughnut. Wether or not its there, you're going to scarf down on that doughnut like it was made out of angel dust aint'cha?I can understand that it gives everyone a chance to finish the game and enjoy it like a book.But I wanted an choose-your-own-adventure novella with meaningful choises!I wanted it to -hurt- that my character is a learned nano and every talky conversation with npcs would be like pulling a teeth in toothfairy cringefest watching a horribly socially inept parrot try to woo a lady. But nope, inability in conversation skills isnt even a hinderance! At the direst of moments just cram down some juice to boost your intellect straight up after dumping it in a check, no biggie! Waaaay enough intellect angel dust to just blow it all on conversation checks.I wanted to feel like a big dumb brute as a strong glaive and mercilessly eviscrate all my foes for I would be unable to peacefully talk them down! Wellp... nope. I'm actually about equal to the bonafida learned nano despite the huge int malus. So the big dumb brute just forces his flowery words into everyones proverbial listen-box and walks off scott free.Okay, but what about their unique skills, wont those make the game feel different when you're playing on other classes?.... aaaahahahahahaha! Good effing luck! You can get the Jack's signature move by buying an item and using it to sweet talk another from a second guy right after you get to Sagus Cliffs.Whoa, oh boy that really ought to make a Jack player feel dumb, but atleast he could give the item to an npc! How about the Nano's mindreading, surely thats atleast unique in so- nopenopenope.You'll miss out on a bit of mindreading content in the beginning. Thats all there is. But sooner rather than later, you'll get Scan Thoughts from an item. Oops.Well... then... surely there are some unique special abilities only the Last Castoff can learn that'll atleast make you feel special in combat?! ... not... really. What you can do, companions can do more than adequately and some even stupendously better.The only -real- choise is how pretty do you want to paint yourself with pixels in wether you get enough armor use to wear heavy armor, or mill it out in light armor. And even then you can wear heavy armor just to spite everyone since its only -6 to str and dex plus a paltry -30 to esotery attacks. Nothing some appropriate edge cant overcome.The only truly unique thing for your mc is anamnesia. Which I suppose everyone is going to max anyhow since whynot. And even then one point is enough to unlock all the hidden past reading content. Hnnnngh.I DIDNT COME HERE TO ROLEPLAY AN ERO NOVEL I CAME HERE TO MAKE HARD CHOISES BETWEEN PRETTIER BOOM OR AN UGLIER BOOM DAMMIT!()""/!=(&!&¤=/()(?%¤/&=)""!&¤(/!#Crumpbisquits.To a compulsive minmaxer this is horror come true. I've began to think that the only real ending to the game is the one which scores you the Terminal Velocity achievement. It... it leaves me satisfied. He went the way of the dodo without ever even putting one stat point into a stat pool - a true 'Murican hero.			"

It is a very story driven game. Many choices . Many dialouge option. Very rich game. interesting locations. Feel very old school and this should tell you its going to be amazing .if you played BG 1 , 2 , fallout 1,2 it is in the same style. IMO it can only get better . So far i love the game i actually read every single thing . I dont do it in other game . strange how good writing can make you read .			"

												Like many people who got this game, I'm a fan of Planescape: Torment and every other Black Isle game. Even though I missed the opportunity to back the game on Kickstarter, I bought it on release. Currently on my first playthrough and loving every moment of it. It captures the feel of PS:T well with the very weird setting and focus on story and dialogues instead of combat. The Last Castoff (protagonist) has a fantastic hook with an obvious nod towards the Nameless One, without it being a rip-off. People who are giving this game a negative review need to remove their rose-tinted glasses. Of course it won't be as good as PS:T after seventeen years of nostalgia.			"

												Captain's Personal Log, Stardate 42552.6.. Wait, that's from an other game isn't it? Where was i, oh yes..Ahem, Torment: Tides of Numenera. (That's the one..) Okay, here goes.Well, this game is a bit of a tricky one to review if you ask me personally.I've been slowly trying to piece things together with this one because the game has tons of choice based answers and quests, and there are three types (might, speed, intellect) of checks to be made, and then there are additional outcomes depending on availabe/invested skills etc. (still interested,...? Well, continue reading then!)All your choices will determine how the rest of the world sees you (tbh, i haven't really noticed much difference between how your choices affect the way the story goes) so it's all up to you if you want to be a good or a bad guy..So yeah, it's easily to say that this game runs deep. However, once you figure out how this system works it makes things a lot clearer and also a lot easier to accept when or how to use them accordingly. The story is not as rich compared to recent games, but it's still good (well to me anyways) and so are most characters you'll encounter throughout the game. (there's plenty of backtracking tho, but i guess that comes with this type of game, yet it shouldn't be a problem for those who love them like myself)The combat was a bit different in the beginning and it took some time getting used to because you will need to make choices on how to fight your opponents, while often interacting with objects located in your surroundings. Then you need to invest in your character's skills and make checks ranging between Might, Speed or Intellect. The same thing you need to do with investigating/negotiating/manipulating/tinkering checks or simply trying to learn more about what's going on while gaining knowledge about who you are and where this knowledge will take you.. Your character/party uses cyphers which are magically based artifacts (so you won't actually be casting or crafting your own spells this time) so to speak. You can also equip gear and substances that aid you in or out of battle. You don't need to run around half naked, waving a stick while shouting something about the world being as flat as a pancake.. (they won't believe you even if you did, trust me..)Graphic and soundwise the game is good without really causing any woooooow effects etc. It's good, or at par with the rest so let's leave it at that shall we?To conclude: Would i recommend this game (yes) But, please make sure you are going at it with an open mind, or else you might not like what you get in return or if you're expecting anything less than absolute greatness you'll likely get disappointed (or if you 'really' hate reading, because you'll be doing that for at least 75% of the time..).I bought the game at 50% off from an online games site because i'm not that confident with preordering stuff or spending too much money for a game that's still in development etc. So, keep that in mind if you want to keep your ""losses"" expenses at a minimum alright?

												Can't really put how much I like it to words. If people ever wanted a lovesong to the first Torment (Planescape: Torment) this delivers in a good way. Mindblowing concepts and art with a nostalgic RPG feel. Worth every penny (and I backed it for for way more than you can get it now). No regrets. Easter Eggs to the Nth power. Story decisions matter. Fun party companions. If Dragon Age or Baldurs Gate was your Avengers, this is your Guardians of the Galaxy. Go buy it already.			"

												Full review pending. A lighter faire than I was expecting. The introduciton of hitpoints ... is odd. It's very. Odd. I think what may stick out at the end of a play through is the lack of a version of the adventures/story-arcs, as a novel? I know that sounds odd.			"

												+Rhin, but other companions suck.+Music, although feels like Planescape's remix.+Art, however portraits and while zoomed ugly.+Game world, unfortunately doesn't feel alive.+Above average story, yet lacking and disappointing in some places.+Playable, without combat, which sucks if you want it.+Lot of interesting dialogues, on the other hand in most cases choices without dire consequences.+Interesting conception for protagonist, who is nevertheless boring and forgettable.+Good read, just sometimes feels overdone.+Somewhat satisfying, somewhat not.Recommended, but can be disappointing. Cut content, unused potential, unpolished translation, too much aspiration for being second Planescape, too little own soul. Like father, like son - bad as a game, shinning as read, just not shinning enough be able to see reflection. The father is kind of displeased. Shame that Steam doesn't give a third option between ""yes"" or ""no"", but I'll give a credit of trust, that they are going to make a huge update with new companions and content.			"

												2 hours in and Im uninstalling and throwing this pile crap in the garbage. The most boring game I have played in my life. The script is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥terrible. Using big words doesn't make it more interesting. And the so called ""choices"" in conversations are often forced to one answer. Guessing your way through the 20 options of dialog unil the correct one is selected. Long winded descriptions of what you are actually seeing. The whole point of playing a game is to see the world and not have to read 500 pages of a description about it. The NPCs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well and the game is very linear. There is no real choice. Go fix a clock by mapping your memories to some equipment so you can get the person who can fix the crystal, only to find out that they tell you who to go speak to and this person can only be found by doing tasks for a guy who knows where he is but on the way you have to help this guy and this guy...and kill me. I still haven't fought anyone. Choose your own adventure book scripted out into a game.			"

												The fact that Numenera is 1.2 million words is both its greatest strength and weakness. I struggle to think of games more generous in ideas, and also struggle to think of a game that needs more of a trim. It's easy to get a little bewildered by the strangeness of the world that lies in every interaction. It's easy to lose sight of the humanity among all of the ideas vying for attention.  I love it though, I really do. This is the kind of game where the world-threatening Cthulu space-cosm is relegated to the side-quest of some dingy bar. It's the kind of game where you're just some guy or gal looking out for their own hide, and getting to define what exactly ""your own hide"" is, while dragging some people along with you for the ride. It's the kind of game where a tesseractal cube tells you the secret of the universe - through inscrutable similies. If you're interested in ideas and concepts more than execution, and like I bounced off of Tyranny and Divinity like as if it was made of cement rubber, I think you'll find a lot to enjoy here. Just for gods sake ditch those losers at the start and find Rhin and Erritis. My advice.			"

												Torment has both a long history across iterations and rosy glasses syndrome for the predecessor.  Although Planescape:  Torment has been universally lauded in hindsight, it's initial release didn't do well enough for the notoriously money-hungry TSR at the time to greenlight a successor.  After decades we receive a new setting and original story by a new studio, some of whom worked on the original game.  I would like to say to every reviewer that spent 30 hours or less and declared it a feeble attempt that you didn't spend enough time with it.  Sure, you can gulp down a rare vintage French wine as easily as Mad Dog 20/20 and opine that you don't see the big deal and question why you had to wait a dozen years for the French bottle.  You can do that and you will be an idiot.  Torment:  Tides of Numenera grants instant nostalgia, but it isn't the same game.  You aren't playing a continuation of the Nameless One's adventures (that story concluded) and the setting and interactions are different.  Some people simply can't get past that.  I would not say that this is a gripping tale that needs to be debated in the halls of academia, but it is a well-crafted thought exercise that considers many of the finer points of philosophy, chief among them what constitutes self.  So, for those on the fence:  the vast number of negative reviews seem to be from people who either don't understand this type of reading heavy title (""this looked like a neat RPG, but I had to read"") or desperately wanted Planescape:  Torment 2 (""why didn't I get Morte!"").  Both types can be ignored.			"

												The game has been getting some weird and in my opinion undeserved flak here on the Steam reviews. For once the critics have done a better job og giving this game fair reviews than the players, could be because of the fact they actually PLAYED the game instead of just listening to others trashtalking?Either way, T:ToN is a fantastic homage to PS:T, although the setting is a completely different one the vibe is most certainly there. Beware though, it is a text heavy game, and if you're the kind of person who thinks everything should be voiced this is not for you. The setting is marvelous, and the writing is exellent though, so to me it never felt like a slog when i read (as opposed to for example PoE where I started skimming text a pretty short way into the game.Combat is decent, turn based with enough abilities and tactical options for it to be interesting, although it's not the games strongest point. On the other you won't see alot of it, this is as far from a grind fest as you can come. Play it (read it), love it. I know I do.			"

												So I just finished my first play-through, at about 40 hours with a Gold/Blue dominant Tide. Some thoughts:COMPANIONS - I chose as companions Tybir, Rhin, Matkina and Aligern (before finding Matkina and after I sent Rhin home). I really liked them, in particular Rhin's story, personality and relationship with the Last Castoff felt really special. Matkina is a total badass, and was fun both as a character and as a combatant. Tybir's story was a bit diluted, but it hit home for me in the three-four occasions where it progressed, really touching. I managed to finish Aligern's quest too, but I had him in the party on and off, so I felt a little less connected to him.AREAS - I really loved the variety of locations and the detail of the backgrounds, visually they felt really appropriate for the setting and for the story. As far as game hubs go, I wish that Sagus Cliffs was 1-2 areas larger, and that it would be explorable again after the Valley, maybe with some wrap up for some NPCs, or some follow up quests for the initial ones. I think it might have been interesting to offer more than one way to enter the Bloom, also. Speaking of which, it was a great area to explore and absorb, I really liked it. About the end, I can understand some of the complaints I've read, but I don't mind how the whole Labyrinth/Calm area is used, I actually enjoyed the extra work to get back companions and the interactions with the other Castoffs.MAIN STORY - Great story. I don't get why people felt that the reveal of who the Changing God is so underwhelming, to me it was the best choice the writers did for the story. A great villain doesn't come from who he is personally, but from how he chooses to act based on what happens to him; basically, both in PS:T and T:ToN the Villain is an early version of the Hero, showing us how choices are what make the difference between good and evil, not our intrinsic nature. I liked how many themes and atmospheres were similar to PS:T, but significantly different: the never-ending war; the nigh-immortal protagonist; the many beliefs that drive individuals and factions to extreme actions and consequences; the quest for inner peace and redemption (protagonist and companions); the sense of helplessness in regards to the lack of knowledge (history, how things in the city works, superior entities ruling our existence). The only great difference, which I enjoyed and is tied to the difference in settings, is that PS:T was rooted in a world where rules are clear: rule of three, good vs evil, the Lady of Pain, alignment and the Outlands, etc. In T:ToN everything is blurred, leaving you without a ""map"" of what is best or right or good: you really have to go through some events, obstacles or quests by trial and error - and that's how adventuring in the Ninth World should feel like, in my opinion.INVENTORY, JOURNAL - I like the restrictions on the companions' inventory, I like the variety in weapons and armours, although as someone pointed out, some character builds are left without a decent weapon until later on in the game. Aside from that I liked the possible upgrades to the Last Castoff and to the companions' equipment. Oddities and Cyphers were good, and the Merecasters were fun and interesting, I also think there was an adequate amount of those for the dimension of the game world. As for the Journal, I was initially very disappointed by the lack of the Codex, but seeing as we're apparently going to get it later I won't complain, for now.CHARACTER OPTIONS & COMBAT - Some people thought that the game doesn't offer variety in character creation. I agree strongly that the descriptors and foci for the character are few and underwhelming, and that the classes don't seem to matter that much, at least not as much as dumping all your point in a single Stat. Of course I went for the Intellect route, thinking it would remind the experience with PS:T and being a max-WIS Nameless One. Skills and Esoteries were fun, some are OP in my opinion (e.g. any skill that moves a character across the battlefield) but in general they are well suited for the game. Crisis was very slow and buggy at release, seems better after the patch - also a few critical Crises (Miel Avest, Gullet) feel better now. Some extra fine-tuning would help, though, as it's never very clear where and how far you can move your characthers, or pathing in general.ENDING - At first I was a bit annoyed that the ending was so tied down to my Tides and previous choices, but considering what I said above it makes sense. I chose to play towards a Gold tide, and the curiosity of the first time player added a Blue tide. That's fine, and it only encourages me to attempt a different path very soon; now, I don't know how hard or easy it will be to get a Red tide, or a Blue/Silver tide, but if I recall correctly, also in PS:T I was struggling to get certain alignment. And that makes sense too, after all, because most of us are driven naturally to doing good actions, saving people and being altruistic. I hope the options to go in a different direction are there and are implemented well enough, but we'll see. Having said all this, the Gold endings I was ""allowed"" to choose were appropriate: self sacrifice and saving others is consistent with my previous actions and with how I played my Last Castoff, and to be honest, with me as well. So, the game reflected well who I am through my choices, and gave me the corresponding output at the end.In conclusion, I think the game is solid, it captures the elements I liked in PS:T and the right atmosphere from the Numenera RPG and blends them in one great experience. I think it holds a good re-playability, and the fact that we're getting patches and possibly extra content indicated that this aspect will be further consolidated. I hope Crises get worked on, I hope the Codex for the Journal is added, I hope more descriptors and foci are implemented, but for the rest, I'm really happy with the game and I can't wait to play it again.VOTE: 8/10			"

												This game is simply amazing, I made a clever nano with a silver tongue. I put so much point in intellect and persuasion that I made most of the game without fighting (except where I had no choice). Hell, I took control of a gigantic being (the Bloom) that ran on despair for fuel. I could have killed if I wanted too, but I decided that since he was the enemy of my enemy I might as well let him live. I ended the game by choosing to merge every castoffs in my body and becoming a God that surpassed the Changing God. I became known as the teacher of healers and much like the avatar I brought balance to the world. This was only one ending amongs't many. For my next playthrought, I am torn apart in between and impulsive warrior or some backstabbing thief or something. What I love most about this game is that nothing is black and white. You might decide to be merciful one day, and the little creature you spare end up being some serial killer later. Hell is paved with good intentions. Even if the combat system is quite clunky, there is merit to it and I learned to enjoy it. There is a form of tactic to it and it can be rewarding at time, keep in mind this is the game main weakspot, the other being the lack of voice acting, but I can understand that since the script is more than a million words long and that voice acting is quite costly for the devs.10/10 would play againI want more content or else I will die, I need my dose of tides.

												I remember playing a bit of Planescape:Torment back in the day, but I don't really remember it that well.  So I came at Torment: Tides of Numenera from a fresh perspective, I also know that spiritual successor doesn't mean direct sequel.  So I wasn't expecting one.  I have to say that I was almost immediately immersed in this game.  The Numenera setting is a mind blowing, imagination inspiring setting that I have had such an amazing time in this game.I'm about 30 or so hours in on my first play through, and I really don't want it to come to a close.  I'm also, for the first time in a while, feeling fairly conflicted about which paths to choose, because the consequences of my actions actually seem to carry weight.  The combat is simple, but can be challenging as well.  I'm playing a nano, and I've just reached tier 4, so I've got some pretty sweet abilities.  But I actually get more fun out of trying to avoid combat if I can.  My next playthrough will be on a Glaive (the warrior class) and we'll see how differently it plays from that angle.This is quickly becoming one of my favorite cRPGs in recent times, easily eclipsing Tyranny (Tyranny was great, but really really left me wanting more), Pillars of Eternity was good too, but came off a tad generic.  Again, for me, the star of this game really is the setting of the Ninth World, and the ecclectic mix of characters, settings, and abilities you'll find there.  I highly recommend you give this game a try.  Once you make it through the first hour and half or so, you'll be hooked.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR - What's available right now leaves me wanting more - I powered through it before my classes start back, and I didn't realize the beta ended when I got on the airship!! I want to play with my speedy glaive more!Negatives :Out of the thirteen hours I've put into the game (so far), I found one bug - Using the south eastern terminal in the Peerless quest without clearing out the southern drones will stick your party in place without the ability to move or to attack. Even if you kill off the peerless using Opportunist, you're still unable to interact with the game entirely and thus are stuck having to reload.Along the same track, older saves from early versions will keep your game from loading, but anyone using exclusively steam won't have that issue. If it becomes a problem, go to your InXile folder inside Appdata/locallow and delete the saves folder!Positives :The world is phenomenal. The interaction is very Pillars of Eternity. The characters that I have met thus far have been enjoyable, though part of me wishes you could dive a little deeper into them. I'd really like to be able to gut Fulsum's hold over the Underbelly and generally just sew chaos while I pretend to be the Changing God!The side quests are numbeous, fairly recognizable, enjoyable and more often than not completely worthwhile - I'd like to see further expansion on the invasive surgeries that you can get in Cliff's Edge, but I also run chromed out in Shadowrun so maybe that's just me.The combat is solid. While it can be tricky to get ahold of at first, this most recent patch (Tidal Surge, Dec2016) seems to have made things a little more accessible and easier to grasp without losing *all* of the math going into combat.Wishlist:I'd really like to see an option to speed up combat - Specifically enemy animations and general combat speed.I'd like to see further gear customizability - Not just for the Last Castoff, but also for their companions! I'm not saying I want to stick Rhin in a suit of full plate, but interchangability would be nice if it could be introduced somehow.Closing thoughts:I'm very much excited to play through this multiple times in full with different builds and party compositions. I do hope that all of our companions aren't necessarily introduced in the first city. I'm excited to see what changes happen with the Cult of the Changing God - Being a selfish and careless character for that run was really great for making them do all of my dirty work! Here's to looking forward to inXile putting out yet another phenomenal title!			"

												I don't know how inXile is going to walk out of that one.Planescape: Torment fans are going to be offended by the usage of the word “Torment” in the title.Kickstarted backers will hate them for all the cut content and failing to deliver on the sweet promises.Those who buy it off Steam will be frustrated and disappointed because of the ridiculous pricing.To be honest, Tides of Numenera is a good game, with an unusual setting and short yet enthralling story. At the same time, it's utterly awful. Attention to detail, user-friendliness, thoughtful balance? Virtually nonexistent. I can ♥♥♥♥♥ about things that annoy me here for hours on end.If you found Pillars of Eternity's dialogue to be too bland and heavy on lore, this one might feel a bit better (though the dialogs did at times get tedious!). If you don't like long overextended games, TToN's pacing might turn to be a pleasant surprise.If you love complex character development, you might find the roleplay system too primitive and simplistic, but the quest and dialogue variability adequate.Recommended to purchase on a sale, with as few expectations as possible.Personal recommendation for Fargo: modesty is a virtue.Personal thank you to Mark Morgan, who once again did a great job.

												Old school gamers who loved classic 90's RPG games such as Baulder's Gate, Icewind Dale, and of course Planescape:Torment will love what this game has to offer.  Rich and immersive story telling that forces you to slow down and take your time to read the dialog and put things together to figure out the optimal solution to quest lines.  The game lets you tread a path that mostly stays clear of combat situations if you desire allowing you take an intelligent approach over fighting.  Killing NPC's doesn't net you XP so your focus can remain on character and story, yet even if you choose a more brutish approach over compassion or intelligence you will find an interesting and fulfilling game to play.If a good game is a series of interesting choices than Torment is exactly that, a series of interesting choices leading to interesting consequences.  Despite its relatively short 35 hour play time its rich, compelling, and satisfying to play.			"

												Amusing and entertaining with some pulls of nostalgia. I had read that this was a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment and i have to say i agree with this. Story so far is intriguing and have found a small variety of companions to join my adventure. Combat system is straight forward with 1 movement action and one combat action, which can also be used as a movement action. Graphics won't have you in tears of awe but are sufficient not to detract from the experience for those who are not focused solely on them. If you seek a worthy RPG that balances difficulty, story, puzzles, and atmosphere then i urge you strongly to give this game a chance to sate your appetites.			"

												Isometric RPG, turn-based combat, 4-character party, great graphics, heavy on dialog, lots of non-combat challenges, light on combat. Many paths to finish so lots of replay value.25 hours to finish for me. I did most side quests that I could find, but not all.			"

												More of a thumbs up than a review, but... Torment is one of the greatest interactive books ever. Once you get over the concept of this unique RPG, its plot is seriously gripping and worth the time.I hope there will be a follow up in the future, with improved graphics and mechanics... In the meantime, I highly recommend interacting with this unique world, at least once.			"

												Such a good game, story, location, characters, it does these all so well.So the combat is simplistic? That was never the point of this game.Could not reconmend this game enough to someone that enjoys the roleplaying side of things.			"

												Good game in terms of story has a lot of hidden things you can miss and interesting characters you will meet. Combat is on par with the first one pretty bland but I never expected much. Reading a lot of reviews it feels like most people never even played PS:T before it became the hip thing to do but to me it feels like I'm playing the game again and it suffers from the same problems as the original while also possessing the same quirks that the original had that made me remember it fondly.I'll probably see it as a must have RPG in a few years and everyone will pretend they loved it before it became the cool thing to do but anybody who liked PS:T and all of it's flaws should like this as well.

												I just finished my first playtrhough of the game and finished in around 34 hours of actual game play.  I did as nmany optional quests, maps, and more to explore the world, and I really enjoyed it.  I tried the game, aand after about an hour,I gave up and created a different character.  I saw that there were ways to avoid combat with dialogue and challenges, so I decided to embrace that and became a charming jack, with skills like persuasion and deception and then added perception for a talk-y character who gets out of things and can convience anyone of really anything.  And I would often go hours without combat.  Later when it was needed, I was able to slide my Jack heavy party into stealth ambushing, with a fun group of folks.  So I enjoyed the game.Now mechanically, the game is limited to just three stats and classes, but the massive amount of skills and abilities helps out with that.  And combat is interesting, and you can stealth and flee, or try to find items to interact with to end teh encounter that way, so there's a lot of cleverness to that, but overall, the mechanics were about what you;d expect from these sorts of RPGs, from Wasteland  2 and Pillars to Baldur's Gate and Fallout.  Where the game really shines is the Ninth World.  It has a very bizarre, fleshed out, and detailed world, and better than the previous worlds.  It felt, in terms of flavor, like an odd cross between the original Planescape and the flavor of Sunless Sea.  In fact I found quite a large number of synergies in flavor from Torment: Tides of Numenera and Sunless Sea and Fallen London.  The flavor was sharp and totally on point, and the world was evocative.  It breathed.  So the result is a fun game, where you have a lot of options, and often I felt like prick becuase I;d choose something that kept my party together or my warrior...er...glaive...from heading off, and I had to be really antagonsitic about it too.  It had some nice moments where I didn't like myself.  Anyways, good game, with the expected amount of fun!   "

												A great game. I think it is more ""Tormenty"" than Planescape Torment itself.The setting is very fresh and interesting. I think it is now my favorite setting. There is much to explore in this game. There is a lot of text to read - but it is interesting text (not boring walls of text as in Pillars of Eternity). Quests are interesting, have multiple solutions and influence one another. There are no fetch/kill quests. The characters you interact with are very memorable - each of them has a background, backstory. There is a lot of hidden ""tastes"". It is worth talking to absolutely everyone, play with every oddity in your equipment. You may always discover something new.What some people may not like is the amount of combat encounters. These are almost non-existent. The game is more about the exploration than combat. Many of these can be avoided as well. So this contributes to the perceived shortness of the game - it took me just above 30 hours on my first playthrough. But seeing as almost none of it is combat, I think there is quite a lot of content. But I personally think some more dungeon crawling could be fun. Having said that, the encounters there are are actuallu quite interesting - killing the enemy is not always the only solution. Also you may utilize environment in the fight.So I think this is not a game for everyone, but if you want something fresh this is definetely worth trying. If you want more classical cRPG experience, this may not be for you.			"

												I don't understand all the hate for this game. I've explored every inch of the first major city in the game and I loved it. Sure, it's not Planescape, but what game nowadays could ever compete against such a nostalgia filled title.I admit, I have not finished the game but if it remains the way it has been I consider the attempt worth the effort and still much better than crap like Bioware's ""have-sex-with-everyone"" and ""triple-colored-choice-ending"".7/10 for me.

												To begin with the obvious: this is not a ""combat RPG"". Just like in Planescape Torment, you will mostly be offered detailed, well written stories and dialogues.Most of the game can be played by talking your way out of any situation.The combats are just too spaced and short lived to have any relevance in considering if you will enjoy it. And most of them will offer a ""pacifist"" mechanism to reach an objective and close the combat.Although the characters have a decent backstory, they provide limited interactions with the player.But there are numerous quests that will let you express a personnality. You can be cold and calculating, just, curious...These quests are short and compelling enough to let you want to try chaining them and completing all the side quests available.			"

												I just finished the game and if I were to give it an overall score i'd give it about a 6.5/10.I agree with what most other people are saying about the pros and cons of this game.  It really is a mixed bag of sometimes having amazing writing and other times being too long-winded and convuluted.  Combat is definately one of the weakest points, but like most have pointed out it is not the focus of the game.  I thought the visuals were great for displaying the amazing weirdness of the world without taking too much from your own imagination.My favorite part about the game was by far encountering all the mysterious numenera and discovering their secrets.  The creativity and the writing for the many different types of numenera is what I would consider the games strongest point.  I had more fun reading about and using all the different oddities, cyphers, and artifacts than I did progressing through the main story.  This shows that there is something lacking in the main story, but it is a positive for the attention to detail in the rest of the game.  I ended up not caring so much about ""What does one life matter?"" as I did about ""What bizarre piece of technology will I find next?""If you like exploring and learning about an amazing alien-like world with lots of logic-defying and imaginitive technology, I'd recommend grabbing this game once it goes on sale for sure.

												This game may not be for everyone but its a rich rewarding experience that was pretty different than any other game I'd ever played but in a good way. Sometimes the game was confusing and vague and I suppose that its done on purpose because your character is supposed to be a new consciousness with a hazy memory of past lives, but it didn't keep me from being immersed in the setting and wanting to know more and do more quests. Probably my favorite part of the game were the very cool companions. Having kickstarted the game it is sad to see that not all of the stretch goals were put into the game but I do think they put a lot of effort into the game.  Overall it felt like playing an interesting sci fi fantasy book and I would play another game like this so I hope there is another.			"

								The beta shows lots of potential. If the rest of the game is at least as good as this first part, then it will most definitely become one of the best RPGs. The only thing about which I would complain is the voice acting, espeically Matkina and Callistege's-they feel somewhat off.			"

												A game for fans of the truly classic computer RPGs, where reading large volumes of text to comprehension, and a fondness for the literary was a strong must. Not a game for the twitter, snapchat and ADHD crowd, those those that prefer action over story.It took about thrity hours to complete my first run through, though there were enough options along the way that I do intend to play through it again with a different character outlook and choices along the way. This should give you some indication of what kind of time investment you will need to make to complete the game.If you are strong RPG fan you'll know that the underlying systems can vary a great deal and be perfectly functional for delivery of the story, and the same is true here. There are some interesting new systems for cRPGs in play, and none were burdensome, so overall I am left with a positive view of them.This is one week after official launch, so keep this in mind at the time you are reading this. The developers have indicated they still plan to add additional companions and other expansions, so my next play through will likely be a year out.			"

												Bit disappointed as I ordered the immortal edition and havent received any downloads or links, or any instruction.This game is good, but very short. It is nowhere near the length of PoE and does not have as much content or flexibility. For a game that emphasized choice and consequence, it does not live up to its promises. The adventure is on a railway track, you cant go back to any locations once you have left them, character developement is kind of redundant, you dont need all of those combat skills because there arent enough opportunities for conflict and your party members, considering how much talk was made about how versatile they are, break down to one of two major life choices to decide their fate.As a fan of the tabletop I have to say I cannot believe that you don't get to fight ANY mutated future monster hybrids, like, not one, except the Nachywhatever. Also, no wilderness exploration locations? Whats that about? Numenera is full of that. There are 3 major locations. All of which you have seen extensively in videos and screenshots. The game was spoiled for me by this. They gave way too much away online and hinted that there was a lot more to explore, but no, if you have flipped through the screenshots and watched the trailer you have seen 99% of locations in the game.Considering the amount of money they raised and the promises that included, I am disappointed overall. *SPOILER TIME*Why the tides? Do you have to have a hamfisted karma system in every game? When it works it works, fallout etc, but here I thought the whole idea of tides was childish and forced in. It made very little difference to gameplay and was not fully thought out. It detracted from the game a lot and is definitely not Numenera canon. I mean, why can the rest of the world live without tides and be fine? Why does only the Sagus protectorate descend into madness with the tides removed? It makes little sense and is explained by, we are castoffs we're special.so lets say the Changing god has been around for a thousand years, which he hasnt as it is stated that he started this practise after the tabaht conflict which was a few hundred years ago in the game. So they also say he changes every decade or so. lets be generous and give him 500 years. At a castoff per decade thats 50 cast offs. So he would have had to be over 3000 years old to have around 300 castoffs. A lot of which are dead/disappeared. So the Sorrow, this extradimensional being is summoned into existence for, at an absolute max 300 people? Over 3000 years? That have affected a tiny portion of the world and made it sad? Not buying it. Should have just made a cool canonical numenera game. Basically this game follows the plot of throne of bhaal/shadows of amn. why does every game you guys make have to be about gods and changing the world/universe?? You know most rpg people would be happy with more freedom over character origin/backstory and a main quest that was about the land you are in specifically, you know factions, politics who you work for etc an just that, but well done and fleshed out. Not always, I am the chosen one, I must know myself/find my creator/mysterious scientist man/god who is bothering/hunting me. Its like the hero's journey on steroids, every time. If you are going to make a game out of existing IP then why not use that IP and lore that worked so well? Why invent new areas/factions/really big important reasons? if you already have lore and history that not only works a lot better and has had way more time to be improved and refined but you have also paid for the rights to, then why oh why would you recreate the same story you have told with other IP in this universe? I suspect that there is someone within your team that is like, let's make a difference guys, let's change people's perspectives, let's enlighten people. Yet instead of doing those things you are forcefeeding us the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t karmic/universal/finding yourself story in different formats. We are not looking for games like this to enlighten us or make us better people, there are plenty of opportunities in the modern age for access to material that is much more profound and likely to affect us than a Crpg. Please just stick to making good games and stop trying to affect us spiritually, it is incredibly boring and done in a really amateurish way.All in all this game has all the elements to be truly great. I am hoping that a decent amount of time is spent on making some great DLC to really open it up and give us a more exploratory/self created adventure. "

												The epitome of a story-driven RPG. Lives up to the original Torment in many ways and will likely surpass it if the developers continue polishing and adding to the game.It boasts a STAGGERING - 1.2 million words of text. Surpassing the original Torment's 800k by 50%. It crushes Dragon Age: Origins and Pillars of Eternity and their ~700k words. It even surpasses Baldurs Gate II with its 1 million words.Tides of Numenera is the ultimate story driven RPG with more text than every book of the Harry Potter series combined.I played the Beta in early access and then started a new game after full release. Every time I've opened the game I've played for 12 hours straight. The world draws you in and keeps begging you to stay.This is a game with endless story potential and mind numbing amounts of information to take in. This is Earth 1 billion years in the future. One can barely begin to imagine what that vast history could entail. And you get to explore it as much as you can. You'll only scratch the surface, but what you find will give you many many hours of entertainment.The combat is - as far as I can tell - completely optional. And while you will probably want to dabble in multiple combat events, you can further reduce actual combat by simply using stealth, diplomacy or the environment to solve the problem. Being attacked by a swarm of bloodthirsty drones? Sneak past them to disable their AI core. Attacked by nightmares? Paralyze them with nearby technical equipment. There are many options.To keep the exploration interactive and engaging without using constant heavy combat, your existing ability stats can be used as a depleting resource which can be restored by rest or items. So for example if you need to dig up some treasures under a pile of rocks, you may have to expand some of your ""Might"" stats, reducing the available resource. Deplete the resource too low and you may find that you'll lack it when you need it next. And you can never be sure when another need arises, and many of the resource checks can only be done once. So if you mess up, the story can change.Luckily, your companions can also help in many situations - though not in all. So hang around with the right people and you can have all the muscle, speed or intelligence you may require. But just like you, their resources will deplete and they will eventually run out.While resting is the obvious way to restore said resources, it often costs a fair bit of money, and furthermore - rest too often and you may find that the story of the game world passes you by and events can spiral out of control. Events that could have been solved one way, may eventually end in a completely different way because you tarried too long. Yet you never feel pressured for time since nobody really keeps track, you just have to trust your gut instincts.The companions are well written and have deep, complicated personalities. They will interject themselves into events and discussions, share information, gear and abilities. They each have their personal agendas with which you can help with or not. And many of the choices you make can have unpredictable outcomes. ---All in all, Torment: Tides of Numenera is an excellent game as long as you have no illusions about what you're getting yourself into. It's not a combat heavy game like Pillars of Eternity, or any of the old Infinity Engine games or later series like Neverwinter nights - though it's story depth could certainly be compared to that. No, Torment is all about the story and the setting. Torment is a massive 1.2 million word ""Hands on"" Novel that you can experience. And it draws you in like any great sci-fi or fantasy book (or series of books) should.You're an immortal being with fading memories of a thousand lifetimes, walking the Earth 1 billion years in the future, trying to figure out who or what you really are and how you fit into the events unfolding around you.

												Tides of Numenera is a great game if you play it for writing and atmosphere and mediocre at best if you play it for combat and mechanics. Its plot, while a bit short, is quiet interesting and unusual, side quests are fabulous and a vast majority of NPCs are wonderfully written. World of Numenera is intriguing enough and a multitude of useless but colourful artifacts that you gather in course of action adds a lot of flair. It's really a pleasure to delve into unknown aspects of this world, visit its wondrous places and get to know its inhabitants.At the same time, combat is awful. Luckily, you can evade it for most part, but when you can't,,, turn-based style works poorly here, where you often meet a lot of enemies and have to wait through their endless turns time and again. Especially now, when game sometimes freezes or bugs out and you have to restart from the beginning. Much-advertised tides mechanic is sadly almost non-existent too.But despite all these faults Tides of Numenera is one-of-a-kind game, well, two-of-a-kind, together with original Torment. You're not gonna find another RPG with these awesome and picturesque walls of text where you can resolve most of the conflicts with words. It's well worth to try out if you're a fan of this kind of RPGs.			"

Basically this game follows the plot of throne of bhaal/shadows of amn. why does every game you guys make have to be about gods and changing the world/universe?? You know most rpg people would be happy with more freedom over character origin/backstory and a main quest that was about the land you are in specifically, you know factions, politics who you work for etc an just that, but well done and fleshed out. Not always, I am the chosen one, I must know myself/find my creator/mysterious scientist man/god who is bothering/hunting me. Its like the hero's journey on steroids, every time. If you are going to make a game out of existing IP then why not use that IP and lore that worked so well? Why invent new areas/factions/really big important reasons? if you already have lore and history that not only works a lot better and has had way more time to be improved and refined but you have also paid for the rights to, then why oh why would you recreate the same story you have told with other IP in this universe? I suspect that there is someone within your team that is like, let's make a difference guys, let's change people's perspectives, let's enlighten people. Yet instead of doing those things you are forcefeeding us the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t karmic/universal/finding yourself story in different formats. We are not looking for games like this to enlighten us or make us better people, there are plenty of opportunities in the modern age for access to material that is much more profound and likely to affect us than a Crpg. Please just stick to making good games and stop trying to affect us spiritually, it is incredibly boring and done in a really amateurish way.All in all this game has all the elements to be truly great. I am hoping that a decent amount of time is spent on making some great DLC to really open it up and give us a more exploratory/self created adventure. "

Posted: April 11
												It's not often I feel compelled to write up a review of a game but some games such as Torment: Tides of Numenera deserve it, partly because of quality but also because of the anticipation of waiting so many years for it to be released.  I was a massive fan of the original Planescape game  (which at the time was underrated by a number of prominent gaming magazines), and is my favourite RPG of all time.  With regards to Tides of Numenera I feel that it has the potential to be nearly as good as the original Planescape but falls someway short.  That does not mean that it is a bad game, only that it is a good game that has a number of flaws that prevent greatness.   First the good:Setting - originally I was disappointed that the Planescape campaign was not being used but having seen the decline of Dungeons & Dragons over the past couple of decades (which Planescape is a part of) in the end I was glad that they went with the Numenera campaign setting.   As a reader of Jack Vance and a fan of the blend of sci-fi/fantasy that influences Numenera, I found the Ninth World instantly engrossing, and, just like with Planescape, felt I wanted to explore it further.  I particularly enjoyed the less linear sections of the game including Sagus Cliffs and the incredible Bloom, one of the best game worlds ever.Story/characters - I enjoyed the story, which kept me engrossed towards the end of the game, and appreciate the amount of text used to flesh it out, which I believe was over 1.2 million lines of dialogue.  I enjoyed in particular the back-story of the world's inhabitants and the games subplots perhaps more than the main story itself, and felt that this area started to approach that of Planescape.   Some people were complaining about the amount of reading involved so this game is not for everyone but for myself I thought it was well written, comparable with Planescape.  I also liked that you could basically complete the game with almost no battles if you chose to, relying on other skills such as guile or stealth.  Other reviews were not happy with the lack of spoken dialogue.  Whether this lack of dialogue was a design choice or because they ran out of money I am not sure, but I do personally find spoken dialogue too slow and distracting and much prefer reading at my own speed.   In term of characters they were generally very interesting and I felt that the personalities of the companions that accompany you were well thought out and each one intrigued me, particularly Rhin.  The downside to characters was that there were not enough of them but I will bring this up later on. Loading screens - when I heard this game used the same engine as Pillars of Eternity I was immediately apprehensive as my experience of that game had been ruined by loading screens.  Thankfully, Torment load screens were not a problem on my computer and the game was structured so there were not dozens of rooms to be entered (probably because of the game engine).   Stats/Skills - I found the use of Might, Speed and Intelligence an interesting system and how you could put points into tasks.  I particularly liked how failing a task could actually open up new options in the game world, which offers potential new playthroughs.   I also enjoyed the types of skills on offer and levelling up characters, although I felt the level cap was a little low (see not so good). Combat - there were a few complaints about the turn-based combat (which Planescape did not use unless you count pressing the spacebar to pause the action) but I have to say that I am a fan of this as it allows me time to think and strategise.  I thought Tides had much better combat than Tryanny (which seemed to be mostly AI and confused the hell out of me), but not as good as Divinity which had some very interesting spell combinations.  Now the not so good:Length - this for me was the biggest weaknesses, partly due because of the games strengths.  Around 40 hours into the game, and really starting to enjoy myself, all of a sudden I found myself levelled up to tier 4, and the game was starting to draw to a close.  40 hours seems reasonable but this was after completing every quest and having already played a large section of the game with a different character type before restarting, so it is feasible you could complete the game in much less time. I feel that the world setting was so good, particularly the Bloom, that I just wanted more, and it was very disappointing that it suddenly nosedived to a conclusion.  From what I am reading online it appears that the developers cut a whole game world and it certainly feels so from the flow.  You really feel that you are building up to something fantastic only for the carpet to be pulled from your feet as you are steered towards the end.  Hopefully, they can allay some of these issues by releasing additional downloadable content.Transition Linearity/Maps - although there are a couple of hub areas which give a degree of choice of how to approach quests there were a couple of linearity issues with the game.  For example, once you complete a certain stage you cannot go back.  There are a couple of points I would have liked the option to return to Sagus Cliffs to see if choices I had made elsewhere have influenced events in the city but this never happened.  This is possibly linked to the length of the game but there was a point on one map where it looks like you had a choice of portals to different locations but in the end you are shuttled through due to the approach of the Sorrow, which I found a little disappointing.  I also felt that more dungeon areas should have been introduced, particularly during the Valley of the Dead Heroes level which is more a sequence of rooms.  Tiers (levelling up) - this is related to the shortness of the game.  The maximum tiers you can reach is 4 (which is about 16 levels) and when I levelled up and could go no further, I had the sinking feeling that the game was starting to end.  Ideally, I would have liked a bigger game world and the opportunity to reach tier 5 - downloadable content please!Bugs - there were a number of bugs in the game that I noticed including one that actually prevented me from taking a certain action to complete a quest resulting in the game freezing.  I also encountered a couple of freezes during battles.  With so much time spent developing the game this is something they should have got right.  Thankfully, unlike certain Atari RPGs (Greyhawk - which when patched is fantastic btw) at least they did not hinder my enjoyment of the game.  Merecaster Sections - I grew up on Fighting Fantasy gamebooks so I am not put up with interactive text but I found these sections incredibly dull.  The problem was that they contained massive amounts of text and I was not clear what (if any) effects my choices were having.  I will have another run through the game to see if this improves.  Minor gripes:Extras - while not a major issue I would have liked some form of overall world map to have been available.  Planescape also had a codex/bestiary which I found interesting and I feel that Numenera missed out on this, although there may be some plans to introduce this via updates/downloads.  Overall I would say this is a good game that just misses out on great due to missing one major game location which leaves it feeling slightly unfinished.  I think expectations hindered it, and the fact I was not a Kickstarter Backer mean I am not as disappointed as I could have been, but it is worth purchasing if you are not put off by reading and turn based combat.  The characters, story and gameplay options mean that it is interesting enough for a second run through using different character companions and the Bloom is one of the great game locations of all time.  I would definitely be interested in more updates and games involving the Numenera game setting.			"

Maybe wait for the bugs to be patched out and the price to go down before buying.			"

												I love the story, the lore, the style, the turn based fighting system, the narrative, the level design and the fact that it's quite possible to fail at something and still get an interesting result. Of course there's a lot of nostalgia involved, I haven't had the pleasure to play a game like this for ages. If you are the fast twitching action type, you might want to try something else. This is a game that caters for those of us who loves reading, the fans of thoughtful exploration of a strange world and of morality and ethics.			"

I cant stress enough how much i love this game, do yourselves a favour and buy this game, you wont regret it.			"

												Very good game - though not for everyone.This is a game for you if what you are looking for in an RPG is: - an interesting story - a unique and original setting, different than a standard fantasy world - well-written companions that seem to actually be a part of the world instead of just extra bodies helping you in combat - quests that you can complete in multiple different ways - lots and LOTS of written text to readOn the other hand, this is probably not a game for you if what you are looking for is: - more classical ""fantasy RPG"" experience - more action-oriented gameplay (there are no random combat encounters in this game) - more visual experience (as opposed to text-heavy one) - deep and complex combat system "

												It took me total 40 hours to finish this game. I did most of the quests I ran into.I loved the setting (sci-fi/fantasy mash-up), the character skills/abilites/stats, UI. Lore was wonderfull and extensive, although lot of it felt a vague (not a native speaker, so that might explain it some). I would have liked more details (even more to read, yay!). It could have been a bit more personal, more explanation what the tides are, what the castoffs are, etc. Graphics could have been better.The game was a bit short, I think 10 hours more would have made wonders to the story/plot, so DLC please, InXile!

												I kickstarted this game free and clear the instant I found out about the campaign, waited four years to play it and I am mightily satisfied. The game is a thoughtful and well written RPG, and an excellent introduction to the unforgettable Ninth World Numenera setting.Like everyone else I have some complaints, but if you like to read and you're not bothered too much by some clunky mechanics, your money won't go to waste. Now for the complaints.The cypher system, a peerless tabletop system, is not particularly well suited to CRPG gameplay. The adaptations committed to make it playable strip away a lot of its tactical nuance. Its true that you can ""avoid all combat"" assuming that ""abusing the hide button"" is satisfying to you. The crisis system makes for very specific encounters, but there's really not many of them, so a lot of the time the game is a ""running back and foreth simulator"" which was fine with me, but I can see people getting impatient.The art is amazing! The graphics are... not. I found the models for the characters to be quite low clarity. Its very difficult to get a good idea of what NPC faces are like, which makes it difficult to get attached to them. Some of them are meant to be horribly disfigured and you just... can't see them. Even the NPC portraits lack impact. There's also no text area where combat logs and chat transcripts are kept which seems like a tremendous oversight.Overall I definitely recommend this game. I also recommend patience and circumspection while playing it.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough, and plan to do at least 2 complete others.Beware, this is a text heavy game, and there is very little ""action"", so to speak. I personally loved it. I liked talking or sneaking my way through crisis. I may have had to fight at some points, but it was due to my choices, I believe.I liked the level up system. I loved that combat didn't really matter as far as XP is concerned, and that you don't have to grind to advance the story.I liked every single companion you can recruit, their respective storylines, and their relationships with each other.I enjoyed each and every interraction with NPCs, even though sometimes I felt limited in my choices, and more annoyingly, I coudn't act on the knowledge I gleaned from reading thoughts most of the time.I liked how interacting with a Merecaster could make you change things in the past, though I must admit that apart for one instance I didn't see the difference it made in the world. But it may be because I didn't really understand what was actually going on.The story and universe were compelling and very interesting, if a bit short.All that said, there are a few thing I didn't really like. First is the feeling that my choices were deeply meaningful to my character and their companions, but not that much to the world at large, and most importantly, not that much to the end of the game. Second is the difficulty. The game was much too easy. Most of the time you can't really fail, and even if you don't try to make a good combattant, you most likely end up being a monster. I honestly breezed through every crises but one, and even that one felt difficult because the others were so easy that a medium difficulty one seems tough.Third is the length. The story was very very interesting, as stated above, but I think it could have benefitted from a longer development, or maybe branches. Because that was quite linear, which is a bit of a shame given the kind of game it is.But other than that, I had some of the best time I had lately playing a game. There are a few bugs here and there, but they are mostly inconsequential or easily bypassed.I must admit, 45€ is a bit much for what is there at the time of this review, but I know that more content is coming, and that it is included in the price. So I'm pretty sure it will be worth it sooner rather than later.All in all, I would give this game a 8/10. Solid gameplay, marvelous world, wonderful NPCs and companions, possibility to never actually hit anyone would have made this a 9 or 10, but the shortness of the story and botched difficulty make it an 8.

												This game is a little rough around the edges in some places, but underneath its issues there is a really great game. It's innovative, intelligent, and a lot of fun. I backed this game on Kickstarter years ago hoping primarily for excellent writing and thought provoking ideas, and it delivered.On the gameplay side, specifically combat, I think it's a lot better than people give it credit for. It's somewhat clunky but ultimately I enjoyed it quite a bit. I don't understand how people can be so virulently critical of the combat in Torment, yet a  game like Divinity: Original Sin is praised for its combat, which I found to be just as clunky and much more frustrating.Also, the character advancement system is pretty different from what you'll find in most RPGs, and I found it quite satisfying.Overall, I'd give it about an 8.9 / 10.

												The world is engrossing and feels like a real, utterly bizarre place. The companions were interesting with mostly satisfying storylines. The story was a good read, with a twist toward the end that I didn't see coming, and I'm looking forward to playing through again and seeing it from a different angle. The combat was passable, but I had more fun trying to avoid fighting anyway. The pacing can feel a bit off - the story can meander a bit, especially as you get lost for hours in sidequests, and then suddenly it jerks through major revelations before each one has really sunk in. Overall, I'm really satisfied with my experience and I really hope we get a chance to explore more of the world again in an expansion or spin-off (""The Amazing Adventures of Rhin,"" perhaps?).

												Finished the game end to end, after holding out for the full release.Completed as many side quests as I could - some disappointing glitches locked me out of finishing some early game quests, and a rather tetchy combat bug tried to prevent me from getting through the big act-2 finale, but on the whole the game was as dialogue-heavy and choice-rich as I had hoped. I'm going to play it through again as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, just to see what other potential options open up for me.I do hope that Obsidian decides to create some DLC for the game, as they've done such a good job fleshing out the world of Planescape that a 20-hour campaign doesn't do it justice.All in all, I'd give it an 8 / 10, with the anticipation that future patches are in the works to fix the game-breaking drone combat bug.

												As a whole it's a better experience than most of the other RPG schlock out there, and from the little I know of the source material, they did a good job of keeping the experience grounded (and weird). I have some major gripes though.For the main plot you're just carted around on an amusement park ride. So simplistic and lame. My super intelligent, observant nano was not able to figure out the very obvious plot points and identities of characters. The game forced me to act like a dupe, with no real power to affect other characters or the story. And then at the end, some morally questionable caretaker ""ancient being"" forces you to accept their power and their reality, when the story up to that point is about creating your own reality? The choices and consequences were lacking.The companions, too, felt short. The three I used were the hero, the jack, and the kid. I enjoyed their personalities a lot, and I might have missed something at the end game, but the characters just petered out. And, I got absolutely no closure with Matkina when I subsumed her to become God. Again maybe I'm an idiot and missed some doors at the final scene. But in my playthrough, they just stopped existing at a certain point.Combat was easy mode but fun. I didn't like the occasional bugs with trying to destroy terrain, or the knock down bugs that cause turns to stall. Those sucked, but otherwise, one-shotting everything while still feeling in danger felt like a good balance for a story game.The game is fun.			"

												I Picked this up being a fan of Planescape: Torment and the Numenera tabletop RPG. I will approach this review from that angle. The Numenera system works wonderfully in a video game format with minimal modification, and at least for me is much more approachable than the tabletop version, given that it can be hard to visualize a world so alien.   I was a bit disappointed with the lack of character customization, given that the game would lend itself to it better than most. As far as a Planscape: Torment successor goes, it is acceptable.  Not the highest praise, sure, but when you're trying to make a successor to the best written game of all time, it's hard to eclipse the original.  The writing is solid, the world building is excellent, and the combat is mediocre at best (Still better than Planescape). Much like the original, it's a great game if you want a story.  If you want a combat centric RPG, Tyranny, POE, or any of the classic CRPGs would be a better option.			"

As far as I'm concerned, they succeeded in making a game, which is similar in tone to PST, while still offering a new story and new characters. Quite frankly that's all I wanted from this game. I'm  happy to say that they also seem to have stepped up their QA process. While the release version of Wasteland 2 still had countless bugs (which were later removed in patches and especially the DC), I encountered like 5 minor bugs in my entire playthrough of Torment. That's pretty good for a release version these days. Numenera is a really interesting setting, I stopped missing the D&D licence right after stepping out of the first location.

												No game can ever surpass Planescape Torment and I was silly to expect it. Now I am only dissapointed a little bit. Don't be silly like me and play Torment: Tides of Numenera without unrealistic ideas and clean slate.If you wanna ready my 50 cents, here they are:______________________________________________________________Tides of Numenera is great game if you like to read, you don't even have to fight 99% of time. This is the main resemblance to Planescape and good job done.Atmosphere of the weird Ninth world works for me, it is a mixture of odd PT Sigil like feeling and colorfull Pillars of Eternity tone. Some of the locations were depressing and unpleasant as was Sigil.Companions were fine too. New Morde is not happening but we were truly unique squad - last castoff who doesn't know anything, woman with sister-shades from other dimensions, possesed shepherd and small girl who lost her memory.Story and quest are parts where the game shines although it is too short - 26 hours for first gameplay. This is the main resemblance to Tyranny and good job not done. "

								Tides of Numenera really feels like the first time I played Planescape Torment.  From bizzare and wonderous locations to strange companions, its heading down the right path.  I've seen some negative comments about combat and considering I've only played a few hours I can't really be definitive, but so far, what combat I have encontered, the sytem they use works and I'm not finishing combat dissapointed.  From what I have experienced, I would say that Tides is focused more on the story telling, and thats certainly not a bad thing as there are so many story paths to tell.  If you liked Torment, Tides is different, way different, but I don't think you'll be dissapointed in what you get.			"

Early Access Review
								Tides of Numenera by nXile studios is the successor title to Torment Planescape (1999) developed by Balck Isle. No longer based in the 2nd edition D&D universe of Planescape. We are in the 9th world of Numenera. However Torment: Tides of Numernera is wirtten by a heavy hitter in the gaming industry Chris Avellone. Chris has worked on titles such as the original Torment, Fallout 2, Baldur's Gate. This is most definitely what people are calling  ""text heavy"" and it's exceptional. This is a great rendition of the pillars of eternity unity engine. Character models looks great, every district you enter has its own artistic merits and acheivment. You can't help but play to learn more about the world of Numenera.			"

												Excellent game so far!The only glaring problem with the game for me is that there are only three foci to choose from. In the tabletop game that this is based on, there are many, many more.I'd give it a 9/10 if I hadn't played the tabletop. Knowing that they could have had more readily available options, 8/10.			"

												If this review had a title, it would probably be ""I liked it BUT"".What actually is in the game is good or great. The storyline is great, the companions are decent (except Erritis who's great), the fights are few but each of them has at least a little quirk (and at least they don't suffer from the RTWP plague), the setting is interesting, the choices are enough to keep things interesting but not so many that they lose weight.The problem with this game is, even to someone like me who started with zero expectations (I haven't really followed the kickstarter, I just backed it to reserve a low-price digital copy of the game) it's painfully obivious how much content has been cut. There are several important mechanics that were *clearly* designed with a lot more content in mind (the Labyrinth is the most blatant one, but *every* mechanic ends up feeling shallow because of this), and even the main storyline feels a bit short, with several major characters under-explored.So, whether I advise getting this game or not depends on your expectations.Are you expecting something as wide, deep and revolutionary as the first Torment game? You're going to be sorely disappointed. There *are* things in this game that wouldn't feel out of place in its predecessor, they're just too few.Are you just expecting a good small-ish RPG, with above-average writing and mechanics that at least don't get in the way of the story (looking at you, Pillars of Eternity, I love you but your battles are made of annoyance and boredom)? Then you might enjoy this.			"

												An excellent game for those who value narratively driven character arcs and original settings. In particular, fans of the Numenera tabletop game should enjoy seeing it brought to life. While the combat does drag a little bit, the unique and otherworldly characters, situations, and objects contained herein should do more than enough to keep your interest high.Be warned, like many isometric RPGs there is a hefty amount of reading involved.

												A fantastically sculpted adventure.  Beautifully drawn landscapes are populated with interesting characters, and the world has a spectacular back-story.  Gameplay itself is fresh, and the story is not combat driven, although the player has many opportunities to engage in violence if it is sought.  Read the first page of the manual, then learn the rest through experience.It's an excellent game in the same vein as Planescape: Torment.  This is definitely worth playing, and inXile should be supported in their efforts to make great rpgs.  In all those millions of words, I didn't find a single typo.---Spoilers follow---The narrative is compelling at first, but falters after the first act, and the game is ultimately over just as my interest peaked.  Maybe I'm a jaded fogey, but I feel like the game needed two more acts, and several more hours of gameplay and interaction in order to bring the narrative to a satisfying close.  Overall, the story feels rushed.  Many revelations don't even have time to sink in before the player is forced to make game-ending decisions.  The big, scary antagonist's motives are never fully explained to my satisfaction (they are revealed in a database in a memory-- come on!), and the human antagonist's motivations are ultimately boring.I enjoyed the meres, but felt they needed more impact on long-term gameplay.  I like the memory referencing oolatek and the Heavy Metal movie!!! "

												I don't understand why the negative reviews about content and whatnot. This game is brilliantly written, engaging and a must have for any crpg fan, or any Torment fan. It's not PoE and it's not Planescape:Torment, which you can buy cheap on gog...It's a new game, full stop.inXile will listen to people's feedback and will surely adjust the game for quite some time. I've been having a blast and I'm pretty sure I've got quite a few surprises ahead of me. The combat is hard as hell, the lore is awesome and well, the game deserves a special praise from an old school gamer like me. Just make sure you read every review inXile, and make it shine even more. Not much I can add, people have talked about the graphics for instance (yes, they could be better inXile, more lively - the scenery I mean), just don't accept the red reviews as a reason for not playing the game. It's a masterpiece in its own right. Now patch it, make it even better.Edit after I finished the game:Too short I'd say, but wonderfully written, everything comes into place magnificiently. I would have enjoyed a way way bigger world to explore, more secondary quests and well, don't trust a lot of text makes a game longer. I'm an avid reader and I read stupidly fast. Even the characters emotions.I never got to savor my leveling up, which was a pity.I loved the fact I could avoid almost every fight (maybe this was the culprit for a fast gameplay).The ending is...interesting. I've got a save right before so...All in all, needs an expansion of sorts. Needs more places to see, more characters to interact with. Of course I didn't do all the sidequests, mainly the first ones (I was just too engaged to avoid leaving the place without a second thought).All in all, I loved every piece of it. Thank you inXile. Gief more.			"

												20 hours in and I am absolutely loving this game. I might do a better review later but just wanted to push in a thumbs up for this game. I want to adress the negative reviews: There have always been changes, some good some bad, from the orginal fallouts, BGs, Icewind dales, Planescape: Torment, Pillars, Wasteland 2, Tyranny (Absolutely loved ALL of them) and now Torment: Tides of Numenera. There have always been changes to suit the game story, lore and gameplay. There were always changes that made you think why?, eventually it didn´t matter and maybe was a good thing after all, some things maybe not so much, but it was always fun. The true adventure with these games is in your mind, and with the writing in this game makes it so easy. Its the best writing in years! As an oldschooler I think the devs have done an fantastic job. Cant wait to finish the game.10/10 would trade a child to slavers for skills again			"

												No game can ever surpass Planescape Torment and I was silly to expect it. Now I am only dissapointed a little bit. Don't be silly like me and play Torment: Tides of Numenera without unrealistic ideas and clean slate.If you wanna ready my 50 cents, here they are:______________________________________________________________Tides of Numenera is great game if you like to read, you don't even have to fight 99% of time. This is the main resemblance to Planescape and good job done.Atmosphere of the weird Ninth world works for me, it is a mixture of odd PT Sigil like feeling and colorfull Pillars of Eternity tone. Some of the locations were depressing and unpleasant as was Sigil.Companions were fine too. New Morde is not happening but we were truly unique squad - last castoff who doesn't know anything, woman with sister-shades from other dimensions, possesed shepherd and small girl who lost her memory.Story and quest are parts where the game shines although it is too short - 26 hours for first gameplay. This is the main resemblance to Tyranny and good job not done. "

												(Spoilers ahead!)TLDR: If you go into the game with no expectations, you'll probably like it on its own merits. If you were a Kickstarter backer that hung on to every update or someone who will compare it to their childhood memories of Planescape Torment, you probably won't like it.As a Kickstarter backer, I was really pleased with the end results. However, I also didn't keep up with the updates, and looking back at what was promised (and what was delivered) I can definitely understand why people feel frustrated with the game. One companion I was really looking forward to, the Toy, was cut out of the final release. The Ruins of Ossiphagan only appear in a flashback sequence that is entirely text. The ""Labyrinth"" is more of a two-bedroom house. I only ever opened 3 fathoms and they didn't introduce anything new upon revisiting (though maybe I just didn't explore enough).What I don't understand are the poor comparisons to PST. It's called a spiritual sequel so it makes sense to draw a comparison, but the things people claim PST did better are not really there at all. Nostalgia is a very powerful thing. Taking on some of the complaints I read in the other reviews:""The combat is bad. It's turn-based instead of real-time with pause.""The combat IS bad. But so was the combat in PST. Can anyone actually say, with a straight face, that the *combat* was their favorite part of PST? I was constantly pausing in PST to micromanage anyways, it was hardly different from being turn-based. At least in TTON I eventually got enough armor and resistance to be able to take things on as a mage on my own; in the late game of PST I still died if anything so much as breathed on me.""The characters/models are ugly and there's no romance options.""There were also no romance options in PST. You could kiss Annah (and Ravel...) but that was about it. The PST characters/models were also pretty ugly and the portraits looked like weird claymation models at best.""It's too short, and there's not enough exploration.""Let's see, PST has Sigil, Undersigil, Curst, Hell, Sigil again, and the Fortress. TTON has Sagus Cliffs, the Labyrinth, Valley of Dead Heroes, Miel Avest, and the Bloom. Honestly do not see a difference in length/exploration here. Personally, I preferred exploring TTON due to the greater environmental variety--was there even grass in PST? Ever?""Too dialogue heavy, uninteresting writing compared to PST.""I had to laugh at this one, since PST to me was entirely about the dialogue. In both games you can avoid this dialogue (if you want a bad time). I do feel like the writing is less compelling than in PST, but that's subjective. PST was more... visceral, and urgent. After getting attacked by shadows, finding Pharod became a huge priority. Whereas in TTON, it doesn't feel like you're in any immediate danger. Yes, the Sorrow is after you but it doesn't actually pose a threat until at least halfway through the game. I felt more like someone on vacation that thought it'd be fun to mess around with the locals.Now, to discuss the game on it's own:The setting is gorgeous. I loved the unexplained weirdness of the numenera, and how you'd come across ancient technology that people just shrugged off as everyday. The giant, immobile robots that have been in the same place for thousands of years and are the architects of the entire city? Yeah, that's just my factory boss. The cannibals that live underground? They're just creepy archivists, and sometimes they help the authorities solve crimes.All the companions are human, which is a shame when you live in a world with people from different planets and even different dimensions. None of them, except for Erritus and Callistege, have anything immediately eyecatching about their characters. But they eventually grew on me, through their interactions with you and each other. Take Aligern, for example. I thought he was a real buzzkill, and needlessly suspicious of Callistege. I only took him with me because I wanted to see the Cult of the Changing God first. But then I started calling myself the Changing God. Philosophically, I'm not entirely wrong (I have his body, his memories, and his experiences--I might as well have been the Changing God just with amnesia). And it was so fascinating to watch Aligern trying to decide whether or not I actually was the Changing God, and if he could still trust me if I was. THE Changing God, the one famed for being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that he blames for the destruction of his village--is suddenly at his side and telling him that she will help in his search for answers. That's when I really started to feel for him, when I wanted the answers just as badly as he did. Rhin annoyed me at first because she had to go everywhere with me, and couldn't even be temporarily swapped out. This poor kid is getting mauled, shot at, burned, psychically punched, and more, and she still won't wait outside until I'm done with this fight. I had to take her into a hell dimension infested with insane murder cultists (Bad Parenting 101). But through it all she remained so, so sweet. She also gets better mechanically (as a healer and cypher user) and seeing her finally being useful in a fight made me feel like a proud parent.The game feels way too easy after the first 30 minutes. I rarely had trouble passing any ability checks, especially when I could just have a party member do it instead. By the midpoint of the game, the combination of my accumulated skills, bonuses, and edge made it so I could pass any intelligence check...without expending any effort. That feels like it should be a good thing, but it made the Bloom's challenges trivial. There's a portion of the game where you can get bonuses on checks if you convince your companions to go with you, and I didn't need to take any of them because my bonuses were already so high. I also had thousands of shins that went unspent--you can only buy armor for yourself and upgrade your companions gear once for less than 100 shins.They took an interesting direction by trying to replace mundane dungeon junk with unique items classified as ""Oddities"". I definitely feel like that design choice added to the mystique of the game world, but I'm not sure if it worked entirely because some of the descriptions had me wanting to hold on to everything just in case it would be useful.I will admit that combat felt more fun in the end game, after I had enough stats and equipment to be able to do what I wanted. Wiping out 4 murdens at once with a powered up Flash was nice. There's just something about it that feels very clunky. Maybe it's the character animations, maybe it's the slight delay after selecting an action, I don't know. I dislike that you can't buff NPC's that are helping you out (aren't they also allies?) and in the early game it feels almost impossible to hit anything without spending all your effort on a single attack. I rarely ever used cyphers--in the early game you're low on shins, and in the late game you can one-shot a lot of things as a nano. The Tide system is an interesting take on morality meters. Apparently it only affects the game in very subtle ways, so I never really noticed if it had any affect on the game world. Honestly, I'm fine with that. I liked it because I could treat it like a Myers-Briggs type of personality quiz. I still feel like the game is very skewed towards Blue though, especially if you want to piece together what's going on. I tried my best to follow my Idealist path, but in the end there were just so many more opportunities to gain Blue Tide affinity.On a final note, although inExile is getting some heat from unfulfilled promises, it really felt like they were listening to their backers during development and trying to incorporate their ideas. It might be just a coincidence, but most of the issues I raised when reviewing the beta were addressed in the final version. Nice!			"

												Excellent old school RPG. However a bit too much reading for my taste, but I still played it to the end. Because the world is so interesting and different. And lots of detail is put into meaningful choices, items and characters. I expected more combat gameplay going in, but often solved my conflicts with exploration skills instead. Be prepared to ""read"" more than u ""play"". Had they somehow managed to voice act most of this game. That would have made the entire thing MUCH more enjoyable. But that is probably not realistic concidering how massive the script it is. Would have liked a little more character progression, revisiting old areas and more ""filler"" combat stuff to balance out all the reading. After the bloom, it felt like an act was missing, because the ending seemed somehow rushed.  I rate it 7,8/10.			"

								I played through the beta. First thought: thank you Inexile ;)Tides of Numenera is a great game so far and I really haven't seen much of it yet. The setting is great - there is a ton to discover. I love the game mechanics too, finally a game that really IS different from all the rest. Although it's not the final release Tides on Numenera already appears quite polished. UI, sound, visuals (animations, backgrouds) are spot on for me. I've encountered very few bugs in 25 hrs of gameplay and none were game breaking (and just 1 crash).Can't wait to see the full game :)			"

												What can change the reception of a game?In my mind the game here falls short of its predecessor. That is not to say it is unworthy of your time, which is why it gets a thumbs up. Merely that it does not reach the heights of PS:T. The writing is quite good, but weirdly truncated and towards the end it certainly feels like the narrative was abruptly cut-off. No doubt victim to real life realities of a project for which we can only speculate the reasons. Its ending is perfunctory and cauterised and all the elements which were being woven together abruptly resolve. Surely another longer closing act was needed to bed down all the story elements and really deliver the pay-off it had been building.On the writing as well, I believe the story seemed to suffer from the ""mystery"" of the setting. With a sort of pick and mix approach to differing magics and technology. There was no consistency or explanation of much of anything. Everything you come across is a new and wonderous technology from a far-forgotten age. All of them apparently from different ones. Which in some ways begins to dampen your excitement as you realise you will never be able to put any sort of coherent lore in your head. Whilst i understand that this is the whole point of the setting, I think that it could have been reduced somewhat by the writers if they thoughIt's full screen narrative sections are beautiful and feel wondrous, Giving the sensation of being a handcrafted tabletop experience and the outcomes of which certainly seemed to have quite a bit of depth (Though minimal impact outside of them usually)The companions, whilst interesting also seem to lack any real input on alot of what's going on. Only ever interjecting (from memory) on main plot moments or there own set PLOT MOMENTS. Whilst I did develop a soft spot for them, i felt there was little opportunity to demonstrate it. The opening section of the game sets up the idea that your companions will have disagreements and there will be consequences and though notably all of the banter in the game is usually the companions sniping at each other (very little friendliness), there is rarely an opportunity to interject or any real consequences for the group dynamic. Finally, the inventory items were a great opportunity that seemd to fall flat. You get all these marvellous oddities which just scream to be used in quests or interactions but never have the opportunity to do so. I kept most of my items in order to find if any items could be used in obscure ways. But I was only ever able to do so on one occassion where I didn't pick the item up right next to its point of use. - For a game with a supposed emphasis on reactivity and conversations , I feel like this would have been an excellent opportunity to reward players who kept certain items because they liked them, because as I said all the items seem cool and interesting and are just BEGGING to be used. Of course this sort of reactivity takes time and as I said earlier it does seem like they ran out of it on even finishing the main storyline.A flawed game but an interesting one. If there is anything I have learned in my gaming across the platforms, it is that many things can change the calibre of a game.			"

												There's a lot to live up to when claiming to be the successor to Planescape: Torment. TTON suffers from a weak first half that's plagued by an excessive amount of descriptive text and dialogue for unimportant players in the story. I recall sighing whenever I laid eyes on yet another named NPC and wondered if the first interaction would contain 4 sentences of descriptive text, to 1 of actual dialogue. Aside from the nauseating verbage, there simply aren't enough quests that take advantage of the society and culture presented to the player. The Levy quest is a great example of a quest that reinforces the setting, yet very few quests do so. Thankfully, The Bloom's content is much better than that of Sagus Cliff's. The most controversial subject to consider when appraising this title is holding against the promises Inxile made during their kickstarter. Clearly, they bit off more than they could chew: numerous companions were cut, an entire major city hub was cut, and the factions are questionalby bareboned. Comat: typically a shallow affair that boils down to spamming your one-time-use cyphers against your stronger foes. climactic battles are particularly poor due to how long it takes the AI to complete its turnsUI: it's a shame you can't modify the interface at all, given how much Inexile touted its inclusion in Wasteland 2. the icons for the menus are obtrusive and get in the way of looking at the world. one pet peeve I had was when completing checks, even if you had a 100 percent chance of success, the game pauses for dramatic effect, EVERY TIME. it was cool the first hour, when you're getting your bearings, but after that it's just obnoxiousSound: there's a severe lack of environmental sounds, particularly in Sagus Cliffs. A lot of effort went into the Bloom's soundscape, which makes me believe the project was mismanaged. Voice Acting is also an issue, particularly because there's so little and yet some of it is pretty bad (e.g. Alligern). It's pretty baffling how they didn't include VO for the main players of the narrative, especially considering that the game opens with a voiced narrator that never chimes in again.TLDR: Should you check this out? Yeah. Some companions, the music, and The Bloom alone, make this worth a playthrough.  TTON complements Mask of the Betrayer nicely as titles that aim to scratch the Torment itch. Its legacy, however, will be that of a title that was sold on lofty promises that were ultimately too much to adhere to. What we have is a solid title that raises more questions about its development than its own narrative.			"

												This ""spiritual successor"" to the RPG legend PlaneScape: Torment does its best to mimick its predecessor, but falls ever so short on a few important facets. Me saying this might be a bit hypocritical though, as I did not play PS:T back in the day, but I know of its premise and characters. As a huge fan of recent proper RPG game renessance had to give it a go.Playing TToN is like reading a novel most of the time, with some added loot management and interactive choices (and few consequences) added as a bonus. Now I'm into reading even huge♥♥♥♥♥long book series, so in that sense the game was not off-putting in itself, but while TToN has lots to say, it does not always just feel quite alive. Its a longish game (clocked 51h) if you wade thru all the million point two words it has. Some parts of the storytelling is very interesting, some parts just feel its extra filling, lets say like fetch quests on some open world game!The companions and NPCs are not often super interesting, and their interactions with you feel lacking. The ""crisis"" combat sections - around 15 fights in the whole game - are mostly cool, but too easy at least after the first few, and as an INT character its trivial to power thru all the discussion choices to get ""best results"" without fighting.The game's systems feel a bit too simplified for yours truly's tastes. I hear many companions, a big city hub and things like crafting got dropped. The first area is superb (and takes 20h!), the ones after are tad 'meh'. I'd like TToN to have more voice acting, now its just first sentence of some important plot related discussions. There are also some technical issues and bugs; long discussions start to lag more and more, combat can get stuck (game breaking) and so forth. If there will be a Special Edition like Pillars and Divinity:Original Sin had, I could give it another go. It's not a bad game in any sense, but not a masterpiece either.7/10			"

												Awesome dialogue, great music and atmosphere and great little choices to make.I'll agree that they might not necessarily do a great deal in the world as such, but it feels nice to have the various options.Progession system feels nice, though combats are tedious without a way to speed up the action (too many moving allies/enemies in some fights is... annoying).Overall, if you enjoy old-school CRPGs I would highly recommend this game.If you don't like reading... stay away.

								As a backer for this when it was announced I had decided to check in on the game to really get a feel for it and see if I was a fool for backing it or not. Long story short, I am very happy with this game and what I have played. I have played almost 10 hours the past few days, sending in bug reports as appropriate (ran into one major one that blocked continuation/completion of a major quest and a minor issue with character creation not showing the correct Health value during creation, though it did show the correct value once you left character creation.) but overall the game is in good shape.This game more than any other really feels like playing a tabletop RPG. There is a ton of options for making decisions (including ones that will outright kill you such as diving in the initial sequence) and ways for your character's unique traits to really shine and affect gameplay in meaningful ways. The Tides system is also very clearly setting itself up to be the most interesting morality system ever put into game form. It really feels like I am making a unique person with unique views as I play and the system does a great job of distilling your character's motivations and thoughts into a tide.Combat in the game is fairly basic and straight-forward. It too feels like a true representation of a Tabletop Rpg combat system. But what makes Combat great is that it is almost never the only option available to you, and indeed it is often the least interesting.Overall, I am very excited for this game and cannot wait to play its complete form!

								Having a lot of fun with this so far. The tone is comparable to PST and the gameplay is a modern isometric CRPG. So far I've only scratched the surface, but this game looks to have a lot to offer. The world is neat and the story is engaging. There have also been some pretty neat characters in the first hour or so. Definitely don't regret the cabbage for this game!!			"

												This ""spiritual successor"" to the RPG legend PlaneScape: Torment does its best to mimick its predecessor, but falls ever so short on a few important facets. Me saying this might be a bit hypocritical though, as I did not play PS:T back in the day, but I know of its premise and characters. As a huge fan of recent proper RPG game renessance had to give it a go.Playing TToN is like reading a novel most of the time, with some added loot management and interactive choices (and few consequences) added as a bonus. Now I'm into reading even huge♥♥♥♥♥long book series, so in that sense the game was not off-putting in itself, but while TToN has lots to say, it does not always just feel quite alive. Its a longish game (clocked 51h) if you wade thru all the million point two words it has. Some parts of the storytelling is very interesting, some parts just feel its extra filling, lets say like fetch quests on some open world game!The companions and NPCs are not often super interesting, and their interactions with you feel lacking. The ""crisis"" combat sections - around 15 fights in the whole game - are mostly cool, but too easy at least after the first few, and as an INT character its trivial to power thru all the discussion choices to get ""best results"" without fighting.The game's systems feel a bit too simplified for yours truly's tastes. I hear many companions, a big city hub and things like crafting got dropped. The first area is superb (and takes 20h!), the ones after are tad 'meh'. I'd like TToN to have more voice acting, now its just first sentence of some important plot related discussions. There are also some technical issues and bugs; long discussions start to lag more and more, combat can get stuck (game breaking) and so forth. If there will be a Special Edition like Pillars and Divinity:Original Sin had, I could give it another go. It's not a bad game in any sense, but not a masterpiece either.7/10			"

												I backed the game when it came out.  Didn't really follow the development too closely, so was unaware of all the ""cut content"".  Did a 22 episode let's play of the beta a year or so ago - 


YouTube™ Video: Torment: Tides of Numenera pt. 1 

			Views: 2,926		

			Beta, part 1 Game played @ 2560x1600 resolution, 2x AA		

I've played Planescape: Torment a couple times and am familiar with how it feels.  This game captures that perfectly, imo.  The plot is awesome and original, the turn-based crises are cool to me, the setting is weird as hell, and I like the companions I'm using in my playthrough.  The meres, or choose-your-own-adventure illustrated story segments, are amazing.  This is an excellently-written book that you can play.  That appeals to you, or it doesn't.  I love it.   Great job, inXile!			"

												Turn-based combat that is used sparingly, almost no filler fights that tick numerous vapid hours to the playtime, and supportively for reactive text based CRPG goodness. Reactivity and depth taking priority over expansiveness. Took about 38 hours from start to finish, highly enjoyable experience. Someone forgot to playtest the skill check difficulty though, failed less than 10 checks the entire game.			"

												Finished game. Took my time. Did side quests. Pleasurable. But also, some negatives.Game feels short. A few acts short. Sagus, intermission, Bloom, and final act. Feels like there should be 2-3 more steps on the way there somewhere. Game is nowhere near as long as old torment, or icewind dale, or baldurgs gate. Storyline is fairly predictable, once you hit mid-game you can see where its going. A few twists but nothing mind-blowing.Another gripe, is bland companions. None of them were honestly interesting. Just...people, with their own problems and a short quest to solve it. Few paragraphs of text allocated to their background and quest. Meh. Now old torment, THAT had memorable companions. Floating skull, fallen angel, suit of armor, that githyanki or whatever... Those were interesting. Numenera companions, by comparison....bland. less then bland even. I finished game with half companion slots empty, because I could not care less - and because i did not need their abilities truth be told.Gameplay - you can talk your way past every single fight - this is not always interesting, like cheating. Also, once you get a full level and some mid-level gear, you can steamroll the NPCs - combat is unbalanced a bit, either its too hard, or becomes too easy. By end game you can become literally unkillable - you regenerate HP faster then you take damage, with certain gear and skills. Oh and you get a nice sword that bypasses all armor and resistances. Unbalanced.But main gripe is that skill checks are incredibly easy. You literally CANT fail past a certain point, and that point is a third of the game in. Game gives you all these various proficiencies, like lore-mechanical, or weapons, but, honestly, you dont need most of them, skill checks are that easy. overall, its a nice game. Worth a playthough. But nothing spectacular. "

												It's not really boring to play, but not great either, and many occasion to get frustrated.The huge problem of the game is the project rushed the phase where gameplay mechanics are tuned, polished, balanced. The result is the game get released with zero gameplay mechanics working, incredible. Let see the details:- Tides, the idea is good, to play a small game of roleplay. In chapter 1 there's some coherency, more or less. After that it's just broken, all logic is changed or weird and half broken, the result is a big fail.- Combats, it's not because the game allows skip most combats that they deserve not have any difficulty design, and I'll ignore the too frequent lack of design of each combat. Huge fail.- Skills check, it's just a joke, the system is just broken. A part of the problem is coming from allowing free rests, awful idea. But the core of the problem is just before half of game you'll end succeed any. That means that this is a fake gameplay mechanism.- Cyphers, one more pointless illusion because it's a fake gameplay mechanism. There's no point to use them, in that context, they end be just lost of time.- Character building, you'll reach max level long before end of game, that's ridiculous, it should have been polished a bit to avoid that.- Character building, with all gameplay mechanics not working, it ends be broken too, not a surprise. The problem is this contributes to build the feeling of a fake game.- Companions relationship, i ended have them loving me, but I'm still wondering what gameplay it involved, it felt so empty. Gameplay requires provide feedback to players otherwise it's pointless blinded walk.- Find items and inter-actable stuff, there's obviously zero thought about this gameplay element, it's either move the mouse everywhere in a tedious scanning, either use highlight key and use a kiddish picking.- Frankly i'm bored do this list, just pick any gameplay mechanics and it's broken. The only exception is some puzzling badly designed.Another very damaging error is the vanishing of main plot. Seriously find a piece to repair an item, that's the plot? What a failure in whole chapter 1 and chapter 2, then finally there's a vague main plot progression. I understand the game goal wasn't to make a RPG story guided, but that's going much further than that, it's the pure lack of plot building through most parts of the game.Current state of the game is a huge amount of wasted element, just because dev resigned and gave up tune any gameplay mechanics, lame.Save your money, buy anything else instead.

												Not what i expected, the writings is like is trying to sound smart all the time, everything has to be wired and complex. Way to much lore, its overwhelming. I been playing for hours and I only got in one fight. Im so disappointed.UPDATE: Decent RPG, should have delivered way more with all the money and time they got to developing it. But I still recommend the game, but its not for everyone, considering the heavy reading and the dumbest TB combat. I have supported inexile in wasteland 2, bardtale IV, wasteland 3. I even got bardtale for blackberry. Anyway, I was expecting more of you guys, and you really fail to live to the expectations. But again, I still recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								I had high hopes for the game but as it stands I cannot suggest anyone buy this; not for full price at least.  To begin with there are some massive, game-breaking bugs....can no longer save my game, followers stopped following then when I finally manage to zone they are there following but i have to click about 50 times to get an action to work, opening a box for loot, click the transition icon to go to new zone....none of that is working properly now.The game itself, combat was made to be pointless in that there is no xp at all for it, no loot at all for it....its just something thats in the way of progressing and it makes for boring combat..  The Tide system I absolutely do not like, its basically that every char will have 3 mana pools (called might, speed, and intellect I believe)...everything you di uses these up; making a dungeon really suck as you can end up unable to even melee.  Just horrible bugs and bad design.			"

												its a great game but be warned, its very text heavy. its a good storyline but if you dont want a game with a fair amount of reading then this may not be for you. the only other issue that you may hear about is people moaning that things were cut from the game, this isnt noticable at all and infact very little was actually not implemented into the game. its a great solid work of art. if your still in two minds whether to purchase this game or not then id recommend you wait until some of the (few) bugs in the game have been sorted.

Worst game start ever ...First you fall down from the sky, only accompanied by a wall of text. Not even a few pictures. Not even a single picture of a sky! Nothing. Just (spoken) text. And more text.Then you are trapped in a tiny room that looks a bit like the Geth server from Mass Effect. There you begin to play Zork, the text-only adventure. I am not kidding. If you read all the blurb and pretend that it matters, you will most likely play Zork for a full hour. Of course it doesen't matter, because once you leave the room, you can create your character from scratch.I have nothing against walls of text in good games. PST is one of my all-time favorites, but this is just stupid. The start felt like the entire artwork has been cut out of the game, just to meet a deadline, although I know that's not the case. Its just a royally stupid design. Its supposed to be an immersive way for you to pick your character class, but giving you the same three options (brawny/tanky, deceitful, intelligent) leading to the holy trinity is nothing but embarrassing.The first combat (""crisis"") that's forced on you will give any XCOM2 player horrible flashbacks of how the camera jumps arround ... ""Look here!"" ""Now look here!"" ""Omg you got to see this!"" ""Oh and don't miss this!"" ""Hey, over here♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" ... because all players are idiots and must be pointed at everything with blunt force, even if the entire scene fits comfortably on your monitor.Once you've survived that atrocious beginning, it gets a bit better. You meet the first two (interesting) companions and learn a bit about yourself, but the game keeps bombarding you with walls of text that mostly don't matter at all. It doesen't even give you the chance to get attuned to the world by discovering stuff yourself. It just dumps it on you, bookshelf-sized. Either soldier through or get the hell out.Torment also prides itself with its unique ""combat"" and the fact, that you can avoid most of it by talking or using items. That part is true, but the most important reason to avoid combat is that its unbelievably anticlimatic. I'm generally not a fan of turn-based combat with character chains, but Torment manages to crank up the chore by adding extra ""mana""-pools for every action you take. It feels completly pointless, like an arbitrary hoop the game forces you to jump through just so that you'll think twice before trying to kill something or use one of your skills with an acceptable RNG. Not to mention that once you are out of ""intellect"", you are a dumb ox and couldn't convince a child to have free candy. Once you are out of ""speed"", you are apparently moving in slow-motion, and couldn't dodge your mom's frying pan.Immersion? Lost.Edit: I read a few other reviews explaining the tabletop rules this weird mana-system comes from. Apparently, in the tabletop version there are no HP. Mental attacks hit Intelligence, hamstrings hurt Speed, slashes hurt Might. The more manabars are empty, the more crippled you become, until you die when all three are gone. It still sounds a little weird, but makes more sense than the ""Let's please everyone (aka noone)""-approach TToN uses.The entire ""crisis"" thing should have remained a crazy idea on the design table and never made it into the actual game. The combat is super slow, makes the camera jump arround from character to character like crazy, and the outcome is always the same as in every other CRPG before. You either talk your way through, press a button to deal with your enemies, or loot their corpses at the end. Nothing new here, just wrapped into an extremly tedious new package. And, as always, fighting your way through the world yields much better rewards and more XP.Combat in Torment is about the absolute worst of CRPG combat I have ever seen, from The Black Eye to Pillars of Eternity. Not because of the alternatives it offers. I like that part, but because of how the combat is done gameplay-wise (cumbersome UI, camera hopping, overly simplistic 1-move/1-attack, three types of mana) and how few incentives the player is given to actually do something other than killing everything.I will continue to play this game and see how far they drive this weirdness. The companions and the overall story is interesting and reminds the player a lot of Planescape Torment. Reviews say it gets better later on, and I sure hope so. Steam asks if I recommend it, and honestly I have to say, I wouldn't know a single friend whom I could recommend Torment to.If I was asked to recommend an oldschool RPG, I would point towards Tyranny, which had my attention from minute #1. Four hours into Torment and I still have to force myself to keep playing.P.S.: No Morte = no successor to PST, spiritual or not. The game world wins the prize of extra-crazyness, but its not Planescape. I hear they cut Morte, aka Oom, out of the game during development. Probably done by the same guy who designed that first room.Overall, this game would have been much better as a book, because the story is interesting, but the actual gameplay is atrocious.Edit: Now that I've played it for quite a while, I have to say the companions aren't as fun as they first seemed to be. Aside from that bickering contest at the beginning, only the child has anything to say during the game. There is like no party banter whatsover.God... I miss Morte hitting on Annah and Fall-from-Grace ... "

												So far it is not a classic CRPG. What a relief! (and I do love classic CRPG's)If you want to play a classic CRPG, play a classic CRPG.Why would you want a copy of the past, when you still have acces to it?This game is rather an interactive visual novel, with RPG elements.Amazingly well written one, that will immerse you and kill your social life.Don't try to find something else in it, because you will probably fail.Don't compare it to Pillars of Eternity - it is a completely different game.Don't compare it to Planescape Torment - it is a completely different game.It is not another the-same-game-but-different, nor an 18 year delayed DLC.You do not waste dozens of hours in generic dungeons?You do not waste dozens of hours fighting every little insect pack?You do not waste dozens of hours in overcomplicated skill tree?Hmm... that is probably why the game seems to short for some...Or it is because they try to play it like they play all other CRPG's -- by ""skipping all the boring text to quickly get to fight monsters"".Prepare yourself to reading a good book. Approach this game with love for the past of CRPG gaming, but without any fear of experimentation (well, it is a game about future), and you will be rewarded. If you fall in a trap of exaggerated and distorted attachment to tradition, you will...fall in a trap :) I mean, I do understand all the nostalgia, but you can have it and still appreciate choices they made with this game. You just need to accept, that inXile took the risk of taking something ""old"" and loved, and making something new and different to it, while still maintaining all the neuralgic elements. They was creative instead copy&pasting. Not surprising, now they have to swim through all that hate they get from conservative gamers.So if you are not a conservative gamer, do not listen to conservative-negative reviews. And if you ARE a conservative gamer, please do not buy this game. You will most certainly be dissapointed, and as a result you will write another negative review, which may lead to someone not buying the game...Someone, who would have loved it, but will be frighten away by you.(I'm 34 yrs old so this is not kindergarten vs grandpas kind of opinion)Ultra subjective last sentence: People are different, and I'm a more of a Fallout2 guy instead of Baldur's Gate guy so I actually love that the game has turn-base mechanics in battles instead of real-time-with-pause, but what's even better for me, that it actually doesn't matter at all, because I play as a pacifist and try to avoid every fight, and this game is one of the few that truly allows it. Thank you ineXile.			"

												*Introduces one of the wildest, most creative settings in recent memory, filled with insane possibilities and prospects.*As the hours go by, a sense of incompleteness slowly begins to pull you away from TToN’s immersion.*While the foundation for an interesting system was indeed laid, it’s like it was left unfinished, sadly not reaching its full potential*Takes us back to the old Baldur’s Age technique of marvelous paintings that are meticulously drawn, but are sadly void of life.*Depending on your playstyle, you should estimate that about 70-80 per cent of the content is spent in dialogue trees, reading.*Not a combat-based game, but a series of dialogue-checks that after you expand the basic Might/Speed/Intelligence pools, are not even that challenging.*Despite the shortcomings it’s very easy to fall in love with TToN’s setting and its enthralling penmanship.*It’s sad to see a very passionate community of gamers being divided and polarized. Maybe expectations were set too high, maybe there’s a lesson for all of us in this bizarre tale.*Definitely a niche game, Torment: Tides of Numenera is under no circumstances easy to recommend to an impatient low/med level gamer http://www.dsogaming.com/special/reviews/dsogaming-torment-tides-of-numenera-review/ "

								This is a comeback of the best RPG ever Planescape Torment by its original creators. It does not happens in Sigil and has different story line and universe history, but it is as great for story lines, questions that it raises, complicated answers that you will choose. It has great deep characters, fun investigations and quests, detailed art and interesting system of keeping an eye on your decisions. Have i mentioned that you are going to meet some characters for Sigil, like O? Awesome!On that stage the game is rather buggy (especially during crisis) , but this is what the betas are for. So save a lot.			"

												Well worth the money if you like old-style RPGs and pulp sci-fi novels. If you're some kind of game-mechanics-production connoisseur, then maybe it ain't. I'm the first sort.Upsides: I liked the story and the idea of the main character, and how the character interacts with the game world, lots of interesting ideas and thoughtful psychology. The writers are obviously fascinated with objects and artifacts and how we interact with them; everything you interact with is described in Proustian detail, it's great fun if you like to read (if you don't, it's probably infuriating). The world was strange and intriguing, enough to make you wish there were more of it. And little to no fighting! Which, as a contrast to something like Pillars of Eternity (also great but in a different way), was refreshing.Downsides: The scale was smaller than I expected, and it ended strangely, abruptly (though one could argue the real story had ended already a few minutes before the ""game"" ending). The companions (except for Rhin and Matkina) were pretty dull, I'm thinking that next time through I'll try just not having any at all, see how that feels... Kind of a low-budget feel overall, but still a top-notch story and main character.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter, so it's been a couple years coming. Unfortunately the finished product isn't anything more than an excellent argument for why crowdsourced games can be a bad idea.This game doesn't stand on its own merits and, really, was never intended to. From the beginning it was pitched as a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment, which was a well-written novel expressed through a bad (by today's standards) game engine. Much of the appeal of PS:T came from exploring the incredibly cool and weird D&D setting of Planescape where it all went down, and the equally cool and weird setting of Numenera is a good fit for an unofficial sequel. So that's all well and good. The other main part of PS:T's greatness was its cast of characters.Tides does an uneven job of bringing the Numenera setting to the computer screen. There's a lot of awkward callbacks to Planescape that feel fairly out of place in the Ninth World, like the ""Endless War"" made up for Tides for no apparent reason other than because Planescape: Torment featured the Blood War, but that can probably get away with being called fanservice. The deliberate references and callbacks to Planescape: Torment make this game weaker, but they're obligatory since the only reason anyone funded this project was out of nostalgia.The developers clearly lacked a strong understanding of how Numenera plays, or at least were shaky on how to best translate the feel of the tabletop into video game form. Cyphers, which are supposed to be the star of the setting, are reduced to a series of bland grenades and healing potions that are just sold by vendors on the street. Since the game actively punishes getting into fights, both because enemies tend to be stronger and more numerous than you and because the ""Crisis"" combat system is tedious and awful, the vast majority of items and abilities are useless garbage which you nevertheless must manage at least a little because they kept the Cypher Sickness mechanic.It's difficult for me to find things worth writing about this game. Wherever there are game mechanics you're much better off avoiding them--fighting is boring at best, frustratingly unfair at worst. Approaching the game as a piece of interactive fiction, something has to be said about the Tides: they're a really bizarre morality concept which the game makes a big deal about but which are way too vague and unintuitive to actually become meaningful. Basically, depending on your words and actions your levels in the five Tides go up and down. There is text to indicate what the Tides are supposed to be about but there's a complete disconnect between your choices and the fluctuations of the Tides. If you're compassionate it's a toss-up between Gold and Indigo, if you're brash it's a toss-up between Red and Silver. Oftentimes they'll mix and on rare oddball occasions you'll lose out on Tides, even though most of the time even if you go completely against what a particular Tide is supposed to be about it doesn't drop. You're likely to gain a lot of Blue just because they hand out Blue for exhausting dialogue options and asking a lot of questions--which is standard operating procedure for these games so that you don't miss out on content. I have no idea what the point is. The Last Castoff is an aggressively blank brick of a character and most of your dialogue is gormlessly asking questions and whining that you have no idea what is going on. It's a pretty big letdown compared to the Nameless One from Planescape, or the main characters of the Dragon Age series, or the Exile from Knights of the Old Republic II. Even the utterly generic PCs of Icewind Dale II had more character, and they were solely defined by their class, alignment, and who was speaking to the NPCs at the time.Since the main character is a blank slate, it falls to the NPC companions to carry the weight of the storytelling, which they don't. This is an area where the developers constantly inviting comparisons to Planescape: Torment hurts them hardest. The party members here aren't exactly on the level of Dak'kon or Fall-From-Grace or Morte. Most have no compelling connection or tie to the Last Castoff, which already is a problem, and they don't really do much to endear themselves to the player either. The developers chose to make them all very optional, which also means that they can't develop as a team, as was done in Dragon Age or KotOR. They feel like hirelings with short stories attached that they can spew out if you bother to ask them.Look, if you really want Planescape: Torment, just (re)play that game. Tides is boring. Tides is awkward. It very painfully wants to be something that it very clearly lacks the creativity to be. There's lots of little design decisions that add up to big frustrations and immersion-breaking laughs at just how pretentious and absurd this game can be. For example: the lengthy sidequest where if you rest an arbitrary number of times the quest-giver literally falls off a cliff off-screen for no reason. Or how about the numerous (optional, to be fair(?)) fights where if you do choose to [Attack] your enemies all get to go first, with no possibility of you getting the drop on them (of course you can't position your party or do anything to prepare before the fight, I guess because someone decided that would make it too easy). This is a pretty bad RPG by today's standards (even PS:T handled combat better), and it's not great interactive fiction either.			"

So that's all well and good. The other main part of PS:T's greatness was its cast of characters.Tides does an uneven job of bringing the Numenera setting to the computer screen. There's a lot of awkward callbacks to Planescape that feel fairly out of place in the Ninth World, like the ""Endless War"" made up for Tides for no apparent reason other than because Planescape: Torment featured the Blood War, but that can probably get away with being called fanservice. The deliberate references and callbacks to Planescape: Torment make this game weaker, but they're obligatory since the only reason anyone funded this project was out of nostalgia.The developers clearly lacked a strong understanding of how Numenera plays, or at least were shaky on how to best translate the feel of the tabletop into video game form. Cyphers, which are supposed to be the star of the setting, are reduced to a series of bland grenades and healing potions that are just sold by vendors on the street. Since the game actively punishes getting into fights, both because enemies tend to be stronger and more numerous than you and because the ""Crisis"" combat system is tedious and awful, the vast majority of items and abilities are useless garbage which you nevertheless must manage at least a little because they kept the Cypher Sickness mechanic.It's difficult for me to find things worth writing about this game. Wherever there are game mechanics you're much better off avoiding them--fighting is boring at best, frustratingly unfair at worst. Approaching the game as a piece of interactive fiction, something has to be said about the Tides: they're a really bizarre morality concept which the game makes a big deal about but which are way too vague and unintuitive to actually become meaningful. Basically, depending on your words and actions your levels in the five Tides go up and down. There is text to indicate what the Tides are supposed to be about but there's a complete disconnect between your choices and the fluctuations of the Tides. If you're compassionate it's a toss-up between Gold and Indigo, if you're brash it's a toss-up between Red and Silver. Oftentimes they'll mix and on rare oddball occasions you'll lose out on Tides, even though most of the time even if you go completely against what a particular Tide is supposed to be about it doesn't drop. You're likely to gain a lot of Blue just because they hand out Blue for exhausting dialogue options and asking a lot of questions--which is standard operating procedure for these games so that you don't miss out on content. I have no idea what the point is. The Last Castoff is an aggressively blank brick of a character and most of your dialogue is gormlessly asking questions and whining that you have no idea what is going on. It's a pretty big letdown compared to the Nameless One from Planescape, or the main characters of the Dragon Age series, or the Exile from Knights of the Old Republic II. Even the utterly generic PCs of Icewind Dale II had more character, and they were solely defined by their class, alignment, and who was speaking to the NPCs at the time.Since the main character is a blank slate, it falls to the NPC companions to carry the weight of the storytelling, which they don't. This is an area where the developers constantly inviting comparisons to Planescape: Torment hurts them hardest. The party members here aren't exactly on the level of Dak'kon or Fall-From-Grace or Morte. Most have no compelling connection or tie to the Last Castoff, which already is a problem, and they don't really do much to endear themselves to the player either. The developers chose to make them all very optional, which also means that they can't develop as a team, as was done in Dragon Age or KotOR. They feel like hirelings with short stories attached that they can spew out if you bother to ask them.Look, if you really want Planescape: Torment, just (re)play that game. Tides is boring. Tides is awkward. It very painfully wants to be something that it very clearly lacks the creativity to be. There's lots of little design decisions that add up to big frustrations and immersion-breaking laughs at just how pretentious and absurd this game can be. For example: the lengthy sidequest where if you rest an arbitrary number of times the quest-giver literally falls off a cliff off-screen for no reason. Or how about the numerous (optional, to be fair(?)) fights where if you do choose to [Attack] your enemies all get to go first, with no possibility of you getting the drop on them (of course you can't position your party or do anything to prepare before the fight, I guess because someone decided that would make it too easy). This is a pretty bad RPG by today's standards (even PS:T handled combat better), and it's not great interactive fiction either.			"

												Torment:ToN currently holds a score of 84 on Steam, which is why I'm writing this review.That's far too low.The reasons for this title to have a score lower than approx. 92 (which is about what I'd give it) are as follows:Torment:ToN was not designed to appeal to mainstream gamers. It was Kickstarted by people for whom the original Planescape:Torment was one of the best gaming experiences they'd ever had. People buying it on Steam without having had experience with PC games from the 1990s are unlikely to get something they expect.Torment:ToN won't be playable for people who don't read much, or who read slowly, or who need plenty of hand-holding to figure out what to do. It's true the game has a fantastic journal which notes new information for you and keeps track of what you're working on, but players who grew up with the flashing 'X' on their mini-map and an arrow pointing in the direction of the goal are likely to get overwhelmed.Game critics have called the Crisis combat system poor -- I don't understand this, personally. I enjoy the combat system enough to want to see it return in other games. It's streamlined, sensible, and challenging when it should be.Other critics have said the game should have been longer. I'm just out of the first area and I'm already planning my second playthrough. I expect to get many hours of gameplay out of Torment.Note also that this game is not priced at triple-A cost. It's about forty dollars now and I've already got sixty hours of gameplay on it.People say the character models are wonky. I don't understand what people want. I think the graphics are beautiful.In my opinion, the majority of people giving Torment a thumbs-down *must* be the sorts of players for whom it was never intended: children, poor readers, gamers who don't like an intellectual challenge, gamers who depend on iMac-easy tutorials, gamers who need to be told exactly where to go...I think this paints a pretty clear picture.If you love great interactive fiction and the ability to twist your story 1,000 ways, stunningly creative settings, and truly inventive puzzles, this is a game you're going to like.If you're really, really into first-person shooters, you should probably move along.Bravo, InExile. This is easily your best work of art to date.Last note: there are many scorching, damning reviews on T:ToN. Most (all that I've seen) are by players with as few as five or as many as thirty hours in. As I wrote, I have sixty hours and just left the first area. Subtracting a few hours for when I left it paused, let's assume I spent thirty-five hours on that beginning section. What this means is either I'm a terrible reader, or these negative reviewers aren't playing/reading much of the game. Often these bad reviews mention that the game is boring to them. Clearly, if you skim through a book, it's going to be boring. By all means, take bad reviews into account, but note the played hours, too. It's simply not possible to *get* Torment without putting in time.			"

												Overall...I have to say I'm very disappointed. Numenera is definitely not the game it was promised to be.The Good:Music and sounds - Weird, bizzare and mysterious, just like the 9th World itself.Location design - Incredible, weird, curious, mysterious, ""numenerish"".The Bad:Main Plot - ""What does one life matter?"", in the end the game doesn't really answer that question.Side quests - They are just there, forgettable and in the end it's all about the % roll on persuasion.Linear Structure - There is no open world. Game is divided on hubs, every hub has a few locations to visit, but at one point you'll be asked ""Are you sure you want to continue?"", and then every single quest from that hub will become ""Failed"", there is no going back.Compaions - VERY boring, uninspired, weak compared to the Main Hero, small choice to begin with and the most interesting one (The Toy) was cut out of the final version of the game. They don't have very interesting backgrounds and sometimes simply join you ""just because"". They don't have much to say, and when they finally say something it's not very interesting.Skills and Spells - Not much to choose from, very boring and bare-bones compared to the ""Corebook Numenera"" skills.Turn-based Combat - Sluggish, boring, completely NON-tactical. It was a huge mistake to make a pool on Kickstarter asking if people want turn-based or real-time. It was a bad choice, real-time would be much more tactical and interesting.False-advertisement Polish Dubbing - People were promised to hear the legends of the polish RPG dubbing, and we hear them indeed, for about 3 minutes. And that's it. Read the rest of it.In the end I'd say there are way better cRPGs out there. Numenera sadly feels solid only in some aspects but very weak in the others (more important ones). cRPGs should be all about you, your companions, relationships, friendships and adventures together. About tactical combat and overcoming the odds with clever use of your skills. Dialogues with your companions should make you feel something (like in Baldur's Gate where you could be betrayed in the most important moment as well as fall in love in someone who was near-irredeemable evil and change their heart).5/10, very expensive, very lacking in the core aspects of cRPGs, painfully boring combat, good soundtrack with emotional music but nowhere near as many emotions were put into the dialogues.

												As someone who's played Planescape: Torment many times over the years, I've been excited about this game since I first heard about it.  In general, I can recommend it on its own terms, and I think that, for the most part, though it does not quite live up to its ancestor's greatness, it does solidly fulfill expectations of existing PS:T fans.Pros:- The degree to which the Ninth World and its denizens are fleshed out and given life is marvelous.  The writing is mostly very good, and occasionally even better than that.  Some of the descriptions manage to find novel ways of conveying impressions and events, which reflects not only on the skill of the writing team but their dedication, in whole or in part, to truly evoking the gameworld.- Several of the companions are highly memorable.  I've only done one playthrough so far, so I haven't been able to fully explore all of the companion interactions (I only used 4 of the 6 extensively).- The visuals are great.  The backgrounds are static and pre-drawn, but the detail, variety and outright strangeness on display bring a heavy dose of the weird to the proceedings.  In many ways, graphics such as these, done right, are more evocative, more creative and more detailed than ultra-realistic, 3D graphics.- Lots of quests, some big, some quite small.  All of them display an attention to detail and self-contained emotional impact that makes them worth completing.  The general story and arc of the game is also compelling and evokes many of the same issues and tropes that made its antecedent so wonderful.- The game system is easy to learn, flexible and, unusually for an RPG, gave me no headaches with regard to the UI or its implementation.- The music is mostly electronic and ambient in nature, but does an excellent job of setting the mood in the various locations in which you find yourself throughout the game.Cons:- I didn't run into a ridiculous amount of bugs, but I did experience crashes every so often; 6 or 7 times if I'm remembering correctly.  All required a forced closure and restart of the game.  Most of the crashes happened only shortly after I'd saved, but a couple happened several minutes into extended combat/crisis situations, resulting in my having to replay a fair bit of dialogue and fighting/evasion afterward.  It's not gamebreaking, but its definitely frustrating.- The game is, as RPS noted, slightly artificial in its feel.  It was definitely designed with a specific audience in mind, and while this can lend a game focus, it also constrains the margins and limits of what the game will or will not be.  PS: T felt organic - Black Isle made the game they wanted to make, and they hoped there would be an audience for it.  This game feels a bit more like a product crafted to meet demand.  As such it doesn't leap out at you with new and fresh insights and experiences the way its predecessor did.- The story while multi-threaded and satisfying, is still essentially about how you try to defeat the menacing bad guy.  This makes it feel a bit more traditional than PS:T.  Likewise, much of the mystery lies in determining the motivations of others, rather than in self-discovery.  - Not enough combat.  And before you say, ""But it's not about mindless fights!  And neither was PS:T!"", I'l go ahead and make clear that I know that.  But where PS:T was ~65% story, 35% fighting, T:ToN is, if you avoid unnecessary violence, 85% combat free.  These are rough %, but the point is the same.  I'm glad it focuses on story, interactions, quests, puzzles, etc.  But the game plays this virtue almost to a fault.  I had so many cyphers and awesome weapons and armor, and only got sparing use out of it.  It is possible to play a bloodier playstyle, but it still doesn't seem that it would shift the ratio that dramatically.- Too easy.  Once your main character has enough edge and stat pool boosts, you're basically going to succeed at almost eveyrthing.  Since your companions can also use their stats to help, by the time you're 40% through with the game, or so, barring failure to rest or bring refresh items with you, you're not going to fail many, if any, skill checks.  It's a testament to the story, world and lore that despite this the game remains compelling, but some additional difficulty would have been nice.Conclusion:In a game like this, story and characters are king, so those elements win out over concerns about difficulty and lack of combat.  That said, you can't just ignore the flaws.  There are some things that may turn some folks off and, potentially because it tries so consciously to ape its forebear, it falls short of the greatness of PS:T.  That said, after completing it today, I felt that pang of regret and sadness at knowing the journey was over, the one you feel when you finish a particularly great book or game, and I'm already thinking over when I'll play through it again.  I think T:ToN is a very good to great game that falls short of true excellence, and would recommend it to those who loved PS:T (despite the noted differences), and those who love CRPGs in general, especially if story is of critical importance.

												For a kickstarter backer, the game delivered much less than promised. This does not keep it from being a great game, and if you haven't been involved in the crowdsourcing, loved Planescape: Torment and understand this is a different setting than AD&D, you should ignore the whining and enjoy the game for what it is.

												An outstanding achievement, especially considering it was built within the framework of a crowdfunding budget. It is a worthy follow-up to Planescape: Torment both in terms of its writing and how it tackles themes of identity within a truly atypical landscape. Despite some of the familiar-looking fantasy trappings of some locations, Torment: Tides of Numemera constantly serves up reminders that you are not in Fantasy 101 Kansas anymore. Tides of Numenera, like its predecessor, plants both feed firmly on the narrative side of the fence. Combats and dungeon crawls are of secondary concern. If you aren't fully prepared to engage with the narrative and the world-building, then this is not the game for you. If you love a good story-driven RPG, though, or if the narrative was always your favorite part of the Infinity Engine era and its successors like Pillars of Eternity and Tyranny, then take the plunge into the world of Torment: Tides of Numerea.

												Not a traditional RPG but that's what I like about it. It's more about the journey, the choices and the story. There isn't a lot of battling (and that does tend to be somewhat slow) and I'm ok with that. I find that the people who are nay-saying this game are mostly upset they aren't killing more things.  The game is also very weird and wonderfully strange and I like that a great deal. It's unlike any other type of game in that regard, pulled from the depths of imagination. It's a very very different world, this one.			"

												Aaaahhhhh..... Finally a breath of fresh air!First, it plays strangely slow, but once you get into the pacing and reading everything you can, the whole game conveys a unique atmosphere and feeling. It's exotic, different and mentally engaging. Much like reading a good book, it challenges immagination.If you want more action maybe ""Pillars of Eternity"" is a better title. But if you want to immerse yourself into an oniric, groteque, bizarre new world, than this is the title to go for. Leave your axe at home, you won't need it. Instead prepare the New Age crystals and incense!			"

								I've been playing turn based RPG games since the early '90's. My favorite game of ALL TIMES is Baldur's Gate II. I've played the first Wasteland, the second coming of the Wasteland, complete Fallout series and watched it turn from a majestic game into a shiny bauble for infants. So if you're looking for a game to pass your time, you probably should play Angry Birds instead of this massive interactive novel. I'm barely out of the first map, but it's apparent where this leads!I've been playing the game for the last 4 hours, and it looks like everything I ever wanted ever since I played the first Torment. I'm so glad I was a part of the beginning of such a thing.			"

												This is an old-school RPG with all of the pros of 90s gaming - high on ideas and low on fluff.Some of the complaints here are totally unjustified, money-driven and give you a huge sense of how entitled gamers have become. For the record, Planescape: Torment was also 40 Euros/Pounds/Dollars back in the '90s. Torment: Tides of Numenera is an immersive experience that expands your mind, confronts you with hundreds of philosophical questions and makes you look at morality in a completely different way. InXile should be applauded because this is the first RPG I actually could stomach for a long time. There have been a lot of saccharine, stupid games in the genre over the last 15 years and the imagination that went into this game is a feat in itself. If you want epilepsy inducing 4k graphics, non-stop killing and brainless clicking, look elsewhere. This is a game that demands your absolute attention, logic and abstract imagination. Torment: Tides of Numenera has the same undeniable quality, weirdness and presence that PS:T had... except it's not Planescape, the combat is turn-based and it's a bit short.  Pros:- Some of the best game writing in a long time.- You can think or talk your way out of any situation.- The Crisis system is an inventive take on turn-based combat.- The graphics are a great nod to the original Torment.- Excellent soundtrack. Dark, atmospheric, ambient. - The meres: mini-stories that allow you to influence the game.- Forces you to think critically.- Numenera's Tides System is a new take on morality - all of it is relative.- Beautiful, weird and downright disgusting locations.- The visuals and animation breathe new life into the isometric RPG format.- Items can help or harm you and all of them are odd.- The sheer number of options and outcomes make it very replayable.- Totally alien and dystopian: free of shouty 21st century politics.(potential) Cons:- Shorter than expected. - No faction system.- Very text heavy. If you don't like reading, don't buy it.- Not for zombies. Requires imagination. - There are some minor bugs in the current version.- Some very blatant re-hashes of the original Torment.- Small choice of characters.			"

												I feel like this game is getting mixed reviews because people are holding it up to Planescape: Torment. This is not that game, by far. Planescape was a masterwork, to be sure. This title stands on its own, with it's own flavor. The music is great, the sets are lovingly crafted and the dialouge is a good read. If you're looking for a ton of combat, right out of the gate, this game might not be for you. I've managed to avoid a lot of Crisis by talking my way out of it. That's just my style, though. I understand that this is a departure from the tabletop game, and that is a bit of a shock, to some. However, the tabletop game requires only 4 XP to advance. That feels a little slim for a CRPG. You do so much that waiting for a single point of experience might feel a little castrating. The XP tolerance between advancements is acceptable and picking advancements often leaves you making hard choices about the direction you want your characters to take.I'm really liking this game so far but, I am a sucker for this setting. It's so unique and fresh compared to a lot of the high fantasy or hard sci-fi that is available! If you like CRPGs and are hankering for a new experience in a sea of sameness, give this a shot, please.I'll do my best to update my review as my play time increases.

Dark, atmospheric, ambient. - The meres: mini-stories that allow you to influence the game.- Forces you to think critically.- Numenera's Tides System is a new take on morality - all of it is relative.- Beautiful, weird and downright disgusting locations.- The visuals and animation breathe new life into the isometric RPG format.- Items can help or harm you and all of them are odd.- The sheer number of options and outcomes make it very replayable.- Totally alien and dystopian: free of shouty 21st century politics.(potential) Cons:- Shorter than expected. - No faction system.- Very text heavy. If you don't like reading, don't buy it.- Not for zombies. Requires imagination. - There are some minor bugs in the current version.- Some very blatant re-hashes of the original Torment.- Small choice of characters.			"

												Though it’s not afraid to lore dump on people who seek such things, the adventure occupies a world that’s bigger than your unnamed protagonist and will just carry on around you with or without your understanding. Ignore some quests for too long and they will progress without your input, eventually resolving themselves at times and leaving you without reward and experience. Or perhaps you’ll undertake an action that seemed to be for the best and suffer the consequences when forced to view your solution from another angle. There’s talk of a mole-like monster hiding in the dumps that keeps burrowing under people’s houses, prompting them to fatally collapse on their occupants. Surely just killing off that pest would benefit everyone, so why not gather up the flaming torches and pitchforks?Because there’s rarely just black and white in Torment; there are varied shades of grey. And there is always another solution available for people who look for them. Though the game has a reasonable combat engine, you can avoid the vast majority of conflicts by charming, lying, bluffing or threatening your way out of most situations. Even when a battle does break out, you often have more options than just putting everything to sword. A relic left by an advanced civilisation long dead has its basement filled with hostile AI drones you could probably bash to bits if you wanted. Or, you could try creeping around the sides and purging command consoles to restore them to default setting. Because even in the realms of high fantasy, the answer to almost any IT issue is to turn it off and on again.I appreciate moments like these, because if Torment has one big failing, it’s the hopelessly drawn out and somewhat clumsy battles that always seem to take three times longer than they should. In the combat system's defence, there’s a lot to fit in; each character has a healthy range of battle options, and the equipping of ciphers which act like (often) one-shot special attacks. Effects range from the commonplace, like blasts and stuns, to the more remarkable, such as when a target is forced to walk around muttering randomly to itself for six turns while it drops a trail of money. Some characters can hide from sight to escape the enemy’s attention, or to set up devastating ambush attacks. Others have skill sets involving grappling hooks, short-range teleportation or especially harsh words.But the world itself is Torment big star, shuffling in alien creatures from different dimensions or sentient beings of gleaming liquid metal as the norm because why shouldn’t they be? Why shouldn’t that fountain shoot gibbering eel-fish instead of water? Why shouldn’t there be a centuries-old would-be warlord, cursed with immortality and now forced to stand in a corner as punishment for a war waged so long ago, it’s faded from memory? Why shouldn’t some of the artifices you find be ridiculously useless knick-knacks from a race of people history insists never existed? Why shouldn’t someone’s half-remembered guilt of an age-old atrocity be manifested in your own mind to offer slight stat buffs?

												Hello friends this is my somewhat short, but hopefully somewhat useful review of tides of numenera. I'm going to break this review down into four separate categories followed by my closing thoughts. -----------------GraphicsSo let me be honest with you this games graphics isn't anything special, It's a crpg and I feel graphics isn't one of the major factors you should judge this genre of game on. That being said character models weren't all that impressive but they weren't by any stretch terrible. Some world environments actually looked pretty interesting and had a beautiful tone to it. I feel like the special effects of this game was its strong point in the graphics department but also it's most frustrating part. For instance there are certain parts of the game when you meet the sorrow and witness its grandstand this is amazing looking and creates a moment of awe, as well as some other maps you encounter look incredibly vibrant and colorful. While others look very plain and unimaginative. The most frustrating part is getting special passives later on in the game. These passives create a colorful shine effect around your character, near end game my guy looked like a walking Christmas tree about to give me a seizure. Overall the graphics where solid and did its job well that job being able to support the story and help tell it.Graphics : 7/10-----------------SoundSo let me start of by saying the soundtrack in this game was good mixed with a feeling of who gives an S***. There were times where the sound matched the mood correctly and gave me a sense of emotion and feeling to the task or event at hand. There was also times where I didn't even notice the music in the background at all tuning it out. Which made me wonder how their soundtrack was so hit and miss I could never really wrap my head around it. I feel like the major points of the story the music fit in well supporting the mood while delivering the message it set out to send us.All the music in between I honesty couldn't care less. None of the music was really terrible just most of it didn't really matter to the game. I feel the sound track aside all the ambient sound and voice acting (what little there actually is of it) is superb and immersed me more into the game. Sound: 7/10-----------------GameplaySo there is a common theme in my review which I'm sure you all have noticed. That theme being the story is the major strength of this game and I'm judging the other aspects of it based on how they support or elevate the story. Which brings me to my next category game play. Oh boy this game is hit and miss there are amazing moments to be had followed by head scratches and for game play this also holds true. The game play is honestly not very imaginative in this game and extremely straight forward.There are two aspects to the game, running around talking to people and making decisions based of stats, skills and tidal abilities, then there's the combat. The first part is fun and has rewarding moments along with emotion and enlightenment. Though I feel that this ties more into the story with a mix of it being game play. The game play being you holding tab looking for things to interact with and get into the lore and story of the world. Which leads me to the second part of the game play which is more of the definition of the word and that's the combat.Man oh man, I honestly don't know how to describe the combat for you I feel like the combat almost had no purpose. I mean it's not real time which that's okay but it's a turn based system without any real strategy or relevance. Abilities really didn't matter at least for me they didn't I was a glaive did not upgrade any abilities or used any at all for the entirety of the game. I put points into edge, stats pool, and effort I believe that's what it was called. Then I proceeded to click and auto attack on every enemy I went against till they died. Ciphers once again cool concept, it's a really powerful item that gives you stat boost or damages your foes or both but it can only be used once before its lost.Unfortunately I used a cipher one time against one enemy throughout the entire game, even then I didn't have to I just was curious to see how they work. In the end all I did was stack artifacts that made me hit harder and sell all my ciphers I had for gear. Maybe this is a glaive thing and the other classes aren't so fortunate but by mid game my guy couldn't die and my auto attacks where taking 50 to 75% of enemies life pools a strike. To me I feel like the purpose of combat was to make the game last longer and nothing more, that's how bland and tedious it was for me as a glaive at least.  Gameplay: 7/10 (the aspects relative to the story, the combat id give a 4/10)-----------------StoryLast but not least by any stretch, the reason why I bought this game and I'm sure many others did the story.Tides of numenera is carried by its excellent story telling, lore and connection you feel with the castoff and his allies. If by any chance you are 1/3 into the game and aren't feeling the story I advise you to stop playing the game. Why? because that's how much this game relies on its story to flourish. Without it, it's not even worth a steam summer sell for 75% off. Is the story perfect? No, but is it interesting fun and keeps you waiting for what happens next? Hell yes. *Slight spoilers* you are a cast off of a deity called the changing god who is in essence immortal. He achieves his immortality through transferring his consciousness from being to being improving himself from his previous life. Your role is one of these castoffs trying to figure out what is going on in this world. The game has a lot of choice leading to numerous altercations and outcomes depending on how you act and treat your followers or the world around you. The voice acting is amazing but there is barely any which is unfortunate because I believe if the game had more of it, it would appeal to a larger audience. Warning if you do not like to read do not purchase this game it's basically a visual novel with combat being its mini game in between chapters. Overall this game is good but it has its share of flaws that are out shined by its interactive and amazing story telling. I would love to tell you more but I do not wish to spoil the main reason why you should play this game. Story: 9/10Closing statementsI had fun with tides of numenera I believe the game could have been a lot better though, There were a few moments in this game that where the best I have ever played in a crpg. That being said it was also inconsistent at times which lead to frustration, the combat is poor and needs to be revamped for future games. Also, some story telling which was the best and most brilliant in the game were flashbacks. To be able to play these flashbacks in real time would have been awesome instead we got a screen that we click on with nothing to show for it. Overall in the end I had a blast it was well worth the 26 hours I spent to complete it.Overall: 8/10			"

But now, there is a reason to play ... no, to be honest, reason to PLAY, to READ, to ACT, to LIVE. It´s time to become boy again.Brian and his henchmen did lot of good work with W2, now he´s back with Torment. TORMENT!!!Aaaaaaanyway.First chapter, available in Early Access, is like, hmmmmmmmm, multiple eyegasms from start to the end? :)))All hail to Brian			"

												Just wanted to throw a positive voice into the growing mass of hate here.  I never played the original Torment, but I have played nearly every other crpg I am aware of at least (from fallout 1 to pillars of eternity with many many in between) and I have been absolutely loving this game.  It's everything I'd hoped for.  Even the combat; while somewhat simple and thin is fun to me.  Especially considering how infrequent you get to actually do a fight.  It's certainly more fun to me then combat in wasteland 2 was, InXile's last title.  Maybe it's just cause I love to read and roleplay in a game so driven by the narrative, but I would certainly reccomend this to anyone who's at all interested.			"

												A smidge too verbose for its own good, bits of text that wants to be lofty and poetic but it's just pretentious. Surprisingly sparse fighting, despite a great many combat options, abilities and skills.Managing expectations is key here. If you want another Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity you'll leave this game angry and frustrated. However if you're prepared to play an RPG heavy on good old adventuring, to read a lot of text and to submerge yourself into a very strange and alien world (perhaps too alien) you are in for a treat. Tides of Numenera is much less accessible and niche game than the original Torment. But it's mechanically very solid, bursting with content and dazzling with creativity.			"

												Taking a path of less combat, more persuasion. Initially found the game mildly difficult; as I progressed, I felt as though the game was getting easier. Just as I was starting to think there would be no challenge, and that the story was going as I expected, the game near-simultaneously gave me a killer 1-2 combo. I found my expectations were knocked out. Will revisit this review if I deem it necessary to adjust it after more play.			"

												It's clear from the store page reviews that this is not a game for everyone. So is it a game for you?Torment: Tides of Numenera is a spiritual successor to the original Planescape Torment game. In this case, spiritual successor means that it follows the same sort of weird setting, wordy, and philosophical story that the original had. It is not otherwise connected in characters, story or gameplay, so you don't have to have played the original to enjoy this.While there are plenty of fairly pretty (but not cutting edge) on-screen graphics thrown around, the game relies heavily on text to get its message across. If you don't enjoy reading through a lot of text, you probably won't enjoy the game. Combat (which can usually be avoided if you talk your way out of it) is in the game, and can be hit-and-miss. If you've got the right party setup or you figure out the best way to use any environmental tools provided in the combat area, it can be pretty fun. If you have a couple of members who aren't good fighters, it can be far less enjoyable. It does get easier (and more enjoyable) as you level things like the ingame 'edges'. Combat is turn-based, not real-time-with-pause like Baldurs Gate or Pillars of Eternity, so it can run a bit slower than fighting in those systems. There also isn't really any trash-mobs to fight - all fights are usually important to a storyline, and so there's a limited amount. If you enjoy regular combat in your rpgs, this game is probably not going to excite you.The story takes a bit of time to get into as you get familiar with all of the terminology and the weirdness being thrown at you, but does seem to click after a couple of hours and become fairly absorbing, One thing it does do well, much like the original Torment game, is transport you to an unfamiliar rpg world that doesn't play to the usual rules of orcs and dragons. It's wordy, to the point where some may consider it too wordy, but if you enjoy a highly descriptive game then you should find something to enjoy here. Overall, while it has its flaws it does seem to be a fairly good spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. I don't regret putting money into the kickstarter for it all those years ago.			"

Early Access Review
								I started Tides of Numera on a Sunday hoping to get a glimpse into a game that is still early access.  I didn't expect to be fully engrossed for over 6 hours in a game that had me caring about the world and interested in the writing.  Simply put, the writing is excellent, and if the rest of the game is of similar quality, this has the potential to be spectacular.  If you are on the edge, I highly suggest the purchase.  This is from someone who never had the pleasure of playing Planescape.			"

												Really good game in old-school style. Not much of combat, but plenty of well written conversations, quests and rich lore. Really very similar to old good Planescape, there are many easter eggs from there. Almost all quests have multiple solutions and can be solved by different approach.			"

												While I have never been a big fan of CRPGs, mostly because of their boring combat and often slow and uninspired character creators...one thing that is almost always on display with CRPGs is superb writing. inXile returns to form with their kickstarted spiritual successor to what many people consider the greatest RPG of all time... Planescape Torment. Torment: Tides of Numenera is a spiritual successor in just about everyway...well...I think it falls short in pacing, as the game can certainly drag on at times. But it does a good job going away from the boring Paragon/Renegade or Good/Evil moralities. You can find yourself having a number of different tides, which help shape your character. The character sheet/customization is pretty lacking, especially with almost no ability to customize your looks.But if you like strong lore, strong story-telling, and a well written (but not too long) story I would certainly purchase this game.

												This is a real successor to Planescape Torment. The combat can be a bit dull and it becomes ""easy"" as you level, but none of that matters. Its a game about reading, exploring options and making choices and it is fantastic at that.The world and characters are very interesting and the fact that ""trash"" items aren't just generic, but have stories and even interactive dialog options is amazing.Highly recommend this to intelligent, patient gamers.

												Torment is made by the same folks who brought us Planescape: Torment, and it shows. There's a definite feel to it that's very similar, even though the setting is very different.  The art isn't much to write home about, but it's still better than Planescape.  It's a short RPG that's very text-heavy: lots of story, not a lot of combat. The world is interesting and the story it tells is pretty good. I'm not finished the game yet, but I'm glad I bought it - I'm enjoying the game in a way that I don't always. "

												While I have never been a big fan of CRPGs, mostly because of their boring combat and often slow and uninspired character creators...one thing that is almost always on display with CRPGs is superb writing. inXile returns to form with their kickstarted spiritual successor to what many people consider the greatest RPG of all time... Planescape Torment. Torment: Tides of Numenera is a spiritual successor in just about everyway...well...I think it falls short in pacing, as the game can certainly drag on at times. But it does a good job going away from the boring Paragon/Renegade or Good/Evil moralities. You can find yourself having a number of different tides, which help shape your character. The character sheet/customization is pretty lacking, especially with almost no ability to customize your looks.But if you like strong lore, strong story-telling, and a well written (but not too long) story I would certainly purchase this game.

								Pretty damn good for an alpha -- the potential for greatness, both in gameplay and writing, is absolutely showing. I made it through most of the available content, but unfortunately ran into some issues with my save file. Which is fine, it's an alpha after all. I'm extremely excited to see where this game ends up after another half year of development. The devs definitely have their work cut out for them -- the engine is really clunky and has a lag-like quality to it. Additionally, there are a lot of little edge case bugs. Having played enough of the game to know its merit, I can get past that, but I doubt that the general reception would be so favorable.  "

												A worthy successor to the original Planescape: Torment, Tides of Numenera offers a deep, complicated world and a story where your matter a great deal.As others have said, if you're looking for endless combat or dungeon-crawls, this is not the game for you.  If you're looking for deep characterization and an interesting setting, however, this offer some of the best to come along in a long time.			"

												++ Good and immersive writing & setting, left me thinking about some of the characters.+ Different from other recent RPG:s (such as Pillars of Eternity) in its emphasis on solving problems through dialogue, making the game feel fresh even for an RPG veteran+ Failure can also result in interesting events+ Combat sequences are not ""filler"", each encounter is different, and there is usually a non-combat solution available+ Text adventures in the style of old ""choose your own adventure"" books bring some variety to the gameplay+ No grinding for levels+ A fairly good amount of content if you do all the sidequests you can find. Good for at least one playthrough, possibly more if you want to find everything.- Some minor crashes in combat sequences- Although combat scenarios are well done, the ""flow"" of combat could be better- ""Choose your own adventure"" sections could have a wider variety of possible good endings, now there is often some optimal path to take and lots of ways to die, resulting in a need to reload- Unless you develop an interest in the game world and its themes, there may even be too much text at some points to develop minor NPCs.- A bit too many ""lore dumps"" from minor NPCs. Fortunately, the main story is not told just in text but also through gameplay and visually.- Some areas are a bit too crammed with stuff visually, leading to a theme park aesthetic in e.g. the Valley of the Dead zone.Overall a very solid 8/10.

												I am a big fan of this style RPG and Torment: Planescape is probably in my top 10 all time games. I still play it. So far I love the world.  It has been a long time since I have thought about playing a game at all times of day.  That said, there are definitely some differences. This game does lack some of the customization of the old D&D games and the combat system in general is a little odd.All and all, I really enjoy the game.			"

												If you like classic CRPG's, this is one, and is enjoyable if that is what you are expecting.  I am recommending this game for that reason alone.  I will continue to play and enjoy this game.  Good job with this game.But I can't say great job.  I just can't.As someone who Kickstarted this game, and waited FOUR. LONG. YEARS. I am also disappointed.  Foremost, I am disappointed by the companions in this game.  Compared to Dak'kon Zerth, Annah, Fall-from-Grace, Ignus and Morte...this game doesn't have teeth (cwutIdidthere?).  Erritis comes close, but ends like a poorly told joke.  Rhin is blatantly designed to evoke Feels.  But Feels should be organic, and take time to grow into.  Her story is interesting but its in the wrong place.  Aligern, Calistege, Tybir and Matkina are boring.  They don't have interesting mechanical choices.  They don't have interesting narrative choices.  I feel like I can swap them in and out without ever caring.  Even the art for them is boring, from portrait to character model.  They should look like fantasy heroes! Iconic! Not bland normal people trying too hard.  I want to throw up everytime I look at Calistege -- really, she lives a thousand lives at the same time and chooses to look like Effie Trinket?  Where is the torment of these characters??? Where is the betrayal?  Where is the hideous past?  Where is the struggle for growth, the triumph over OR fall to darkness???  Where are the amazing, genius connections and mysteries of the characters that you gradually uncover throughout the course of the game?  Come on! That's the core of what made Planescape amazing, not the weirdness of the environment, or being able to die over and over, though I appreciate the homage.  The characters in this hardly react to my decisions!  Their banter is almost non-existent!  Also, for as huge and zany as this game wants to be, it feels awfully small.  You had four years!!It's just disappointing.  Please go look at Obsidian Entertainment.  Pillars and Tyranny both blew my mind, and I can't throw my money - - sodden with tears of gratitude - -  at them fast enough to get more of those GREAT games.  Wasteland 2 was good, but not great.  So Inxile is now at strike 2 for me.  I really really want devs to make great CRPGs, but it's not worth $$ backing for just another good game.			"

								Best, most interesting RPG I've played in a while. I was sad to see Planescape replaced with Numenera, as I always liked the Planescape setting a lot and am completely unfamiliar with Numenera, but this game is still pretty awesome. I'd appreciate more of an explanation of the setting, even if it is just in the form of a text file or pdf that came with the game, but aside from that, this has been a throughly enjoyable experience. Can't wait for the full release.I just hope we can continue from the end of the beta-released section rather than having to start from the beginning.Definitely recommended.			"

I got it as a Kickstarter backer, and while it's not perfect, I do find that the writing is solid and it m ostly lets you decide on your interpretation of many things and find your way through stuff. If you are looking for a lot of combat or for pitch perfect graphics, it's not for you but if an interesting world with some decent writing it is worth your time!Pros- Excellent Setting- Good Writing- Nice Cast of Characters- Ability to resolve confrontations without Violence- Branching StoryCons- Rule system makes doing everything too easy with other characters- Cyphers get somewhat ignored			"

												Overall I liked it. It tries really hard live up to the ""Torment"" legacy and while it unfortunately falls short of this ambitious goal, it's still a enjoyable experience. It focuses heavily on the story element with combat being very infrequent to almost non existant depending on choises made. Where it falls short is mainly in it's companions and general difficulty. Where Planescape really made you work to achieve ""good"" results Numenera feels a bit more like an extended choose your own adventure, as long as you have the right skills nessesary most things solve themselves rather effortless, if an dialog option shows that it require the use of a skill it's almost univesally the ""right/best"" option.The companions, while well written, are a bit unfortunately not well integrated into the story. You'll encounter them, learn their intriguing backstory and then drag them with you until you hit upon ""their"" sidequest, after which they are for the most part done narratively. I miss the interwoven and gradually exposition of the Planescape companions.Still it's a good game in a nieche genre so I'd recommend it.			"

												Torment: Numenera HISHE (How it Should Have Ended) ReviewTorment: Numenera is a true sucessor of the Planescape formula. A rich and deep story on an interesting world bordering on a literary adventure of the surrealist fantasy genre. While it is certainly worth playing, it falls short from it's goal of achieving the same level or even surpassing it's predecessor. Not surprisingly, this has far more to do with the narrative aspects than the gameplay or technical aspects, simply because of the fact that, a true roleplaying game worthy of such a label has to be focused first and foremost on storytelling, it's characters, the choices made and their effects on the world. Numenera's story isn't told as well as Planescape had been, even with the advantage of being made 20 years later, after much experimentation and innovative narrative mechanics have been developed. Even if we take into account that surpassing Planescape Torment is essentially the tallest possible order for any Roleplaying Game, and Numenera is much better written than most recent triple A RPG games, its shortcomings are so glaring that they cannot be ignored.Planescape Torment had a similar Main Character, one who started life suffering from an accute case of amnesia and immortality. However, if we take a closer look, the similarities become evidently superficial. The Nameless One was a character who could indeed become any class, and voice many different opinions at any point, he could be a bully or a hero, kind or aggressive, but unlike the Last Castoff, he always did so with style. The Nameless One was always his own character, never a clean slate, a tabula rasa. The western industry standard of writing for video games, especially RPGs, is the idea that the character must be written is such a way that the player will feel to be the one fully in control to be properly ""immersed"" in the story, free to do as they please. Instead of creating immersion, what this actually does is create an awkward dynamic where your Dovahkins, Wardens and Vault Dwellers are template characters instead of having a mind of their own. The only effect this game theory has on storytelling games is creating a disconnect of the narrative and it's central character.The InterrogatorThe worst part, however, is the way how the Last Castoff interacts with the world, or more accurately, how the world interacts with her. Go out and ask the first person you see the following question ""Tell me your story"". The last thing that person will do, is to answer what you asked. Not only it is invasive and even creepy, people will often not reply to questions with objective, direct and concise answers, especially when they have ulterior motives and well rounded personalities. The only explanation for the way people talk to the Last Castoff is if they are being forced to speak in such an open and unusual manner by some kind of influence from the Tides. This would be a way to justify it in game, but even then it would simply be an excuse to spare the writers the trouble of coming up with realistic interactions and explaining away the bullet point, excel table, conversation style of Numenera's NPCS.Torment: Tides of MacGuffinNumeneras are MacGuffins, the definition of a Numera is exactly what a MacGuffin is. MacGuffins are useful storytelling tools, but they often create Deus Ex Machina situations. The Tides themselves are Lacanian/Campbellian archetypical forces, and can only have such a powerful effect on reality when we accept the premise of existence being a construct of the mind, human or otherwise. It's an interesting premise that would be especially easy to accept when taking the 4th wall into account. Unfortunately, even when it is the very center of the story, since the nature of the Sorrow is to be the actual representation of Campbell's Shadow, it's not properly developed, well explained, or interestingly delved into. Even the Changing God's personal quest falls flat and uninspiring by the end. Especially since it's revealed to us at a point where it was simply way way... past the time to sympathize with the character, and there was no bond at all formed between the player's character and the Mysterious Girl. It's a shallow and hollow sideshow, instead of an emotional reveal.Railroad Ending The game ends with yet another interrogation type conversation, where the Sorrow delivers a heavy dose of plot exposition, in a similar way to the Architect's Monologue in Matrix: Reloaded. It isn't as bad, and allows a window into the mind of a being that couldn't have been understood, according to the story, except for the fact that it totally could. It would be far better to discover all about the Sorrow during the story, exploring the past, learning about it's origins from other sources than simply ""asking for exposition"". Too much exposition is awful by itself, direct exposition from the main villain? I shouldn't even have to say anything about it.If the idea was to show that the Sorrow isn't truly the villain, but the hero. That Castoffs are in the wrong, selfishly destroying the world to achieve their own ends, and the only option to destoy the Sorrow would be the ultimate act of selfishness on their part... then it falls flat on its♥♥♥♥♥completely.HISHE (How It Should Have Ended)After the main villain makes its whole spiel about how the Last Castoff has to choose options A through Z: Kill the Castoffs by subsuming them into 1 person, Kill the Sorrow to let Castoffs Live but condemn hundreds of thousands in the present and potential millions in the future to a horrible death, allowing the Sorrow to persist, thus condeming the Castoffs to extinction by it's Grim Reaper hands, etc...The Last Castoff finally decides to take an active role and confronts the narrative of the Sorrow, showing the flaws in its reasoning and taking it down from its high horse forcing it to accept the moral low ground on which it stands. Then, with the power of the Tides, the Last Castoff makes it see the horror of it's existence and kill itself, letting Castoffs and humans free to choose their own destiny, accepting the consequences of their choices.The Sorrow is a World Killer. It has killed millions if not Billions before and deprived other tens of billions, if not trillions, from being born. It is a genocidal force that wiped out civilizations, allowing such a thing to live would be a far greater crime, even at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. Because at some point in the future, it would be inevitable that technology would once again discover the power of the Tides, conscience transfer or whatever, and after the Sorrow managed to prevent access to the Resonance, it would be far more difficult if not impossible to stop it. The effect of Castoffs bodies self-sustaining with Tide energies is a potential problem, but only when they actively decide to use the Tides, every other subliminal effect implied is either too subtle to be perceived or just hasn't been properly represented in the story to be relevant. We live in a world where our emotions and self-image is constantly manipulated by chemistry, propaganda, marketing, and even the temperature or hardness of where we sit can change the way we look at things and how we feel about the world. This is a very poor excuse to condemn Castoffs to death, especially in a world where people constantly use Numenera to influence each other and the world around them. Where telepaths and empaths, Machine Intelligences and Ctonic Ctullhian transdimensional entities move around the world unchecked and unfettered.As it is, the moral of the story is that The Last Castoff is simply not smart enough to debate against the Sorrow, ""technology is too dangerous"", ""the price of Immortality is too high"" and ""It is more moral to embrace mortality and live a short happy life in ignorance than to pursue the understanding of fundamental forces in the universe""			"

												I have to say this game surprised me more than I expected based off of all the feedback that came froms critics and fans alike. I was a kickstarter backer of this game, but I had no *real* expectations of what would come of this. Like most things on kickstarter, the end product can be a mixed bag. That is what I would say we got with this game here. A mixed bag.HOWEVER, it is still a pretty decent CRPG. It takes awhile to get going, but once it does (especially when you get to the Bloom) it is a truly fascinating game that takes place in a new and interesting world. It aims high and falls short in many ways, but more often than not it hits than misses. Like many have said...the dialogue is interesting...but sometimes feels like they are just trying to fill space or be clever for the sake of being clever. Yet, for each instance of that you will find many more examples of just plain weird and out there concepts that will pull you in.If I had to give it a score out of 10, an 8.3 is where it would sit. It is a perfectlly servicable game, that perhaps with patches and some refinements to dialoge, combat and glitches could rise to an 8.5-8.8. I do hope they continue to make games like this, but based off of sales and feedback it seems unlikely.Note: I wish they had been more open about cut content. Well I personally don't hold ire like some of the backers, I think it just send the wrong message right before release. Like I said, this is a decent RPG and if your a fan of these games play it. Unfortunately, their poor handling of cut content just....made it so it whimpered out of the gate more than was needed.			"

												I'll take a bit of a contrarian stance on here to most of the people commenting: I never played PS:T, and I have no familiarity with anything else regarding the game's world or the developer other my experience playing this game. I can respect the people that come in with their expectations and biases, but I'm evaluating the game based entirely on its own merits.First off, T:ToN is an exceptionally-written game. As many have stated, it's much more an interactive visual novel than it is a classic game -- something, to my understanding, that made PS:T such a cult hit. It is a great surprise to me, then, that there is so much egregious focus in other reviews on the combat mechanics not being this or that. I was recommended the game by a friend who was a big fan of PS:T and backed this game on kickstarter, and he was very upfront about what I should expect based on the developers' history. Nowhere did he mention ""damn man, PS:T's real time combat system really sold me the game!"" No, it was ""hey, you should check this game out, PS:T had an exceptional story and narrative and this game is its spiritual successor.""It should be understood, certainly, that T:ToN is not a conventional game, but I don't think it ever promised itself to be. The entire game is intended to lay out a very detailed world, and build up a compelling story based on very subtle and sequential revelation. Many people complaining about the pacing, I imagine, were expecting to plow through the game with a bunch of combat as you chase down the mystery of the Changing God, and were broadsided by the fact that the game is far more reading than it is fighting. But that's where T:ToN really shines: the developers clearly never intended to make this a fast-paced experience, and you can definitely tell they placed their efforts entirely on developing the strongest narrative possible. The story is central and key -- and yes, that means there are a bunch of characters who are small and irrelevant from a gameplay perspective. But these characters add to the overall depth of the story. NPCs in this game aren't NPCs in the traditional sense: they're narrative delivery devices, and laid out in such a way to add bits of depth to the player who is willing to spend time and effort to explore. You're not going to get Bioware little romance plots or a Beach Scene with the Team, or really detailed Friendship Time Scenes with your companions. Your companions feel extremely real in that regard: they're aren't your friends or pals, they're people who incidentally end up traveling with you for personal reasons.I won't talk to any points regarding the story in terms of content, as the story is the entire reason you'd play the game. In terms of replayability, though, some have said there is none; to a certain extent this is true, but I think the writing is interesting enough that you a 2nd playthrough is certainly possible and would be enjoyable by making very different decisions from your first playthrough. It was about 25 hours for me to beat the game on a full playthrough doing as much as possible, and I could see another 15-20 on a replay. But, as with most RPGs, this is something I'd do down the line in a couple years' time and not right away.Does this game have some flaws? Absolutely. I think the stories with the side characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, and I think more effort could have been made to develop a world map to tie in visually tie story events in with the narrative. I really enjoyed the Meres from a storytelling perspective, but felt some of them were a little too abstract tying things in with present time. But most complaints of this nature are minor.Play this game if you enjoy reading books with good stories. But if you're looking for a gameplay-driven real time action RPG, steer clear. The devs made a niche game that is not going to have a lot of widespread appeal, but they really nailed the niche well. I'll definitely keep my eyes on this company in the future.			"

												This is a game that wanted badly to be a Planescape: Torment successor, but never really came close enough to it in depth. Everything bad you might have already read about its mechanics, balance, cut content and broken promises is entirely true.But. If you are a backer like me, you already know all this, and you don't need a review to confirm it. If you are fine with replaying Planescape: Torment again and again until the end of your life - go ahead. Might be worth it.If, on the other hand, you are simply a fan of isometric RPGs with great stories, fascinating worlds, branching quests and extensive dialogues instead of combat, and you are looking for something new worth playing - you should definitely buy and play this right now. It's not ""the new Planescape: Torment"". But it's the closest thing to it you'll get anytime soon, and it is a great game in its own right. Well, maybe not technically a great *game*. But all the things mentioned above are in, and they are great. Why should you care if inXile promised anything else to someone like us? You are not us. You don't have to be disappointed.Honestly, this game doesn't deserve the review score it gets. The developers do, though. That's what you get for promising to surpass a legend.			"

												I consider the hallmark of a good RPG to be two things. 1.I stayed up way too late playing it.2.I'm planning my next playthrough before I'm done with my first.So at 7:30AM, having not slept, and planning to be a Nano using two of the three party members I left behind, I decided this game qualifies. I found the world intriguing, the story interesting and the characters likable enough, some more so then others. The system for battles and general gameplay was great and I loved how simple and easy it was to understand and use. Overall a good experience, a game for people who love an interesting world and story to explore. Hardly perfect, a few things did annoy me a bit, but after playing and hating almost every cRPG thats come out in recent times its nice to have one that I felt motivated to play and not bogged down by game mechanics.

												My feelings toward Torment: Tides of Numenera are mixed. While much love and dedication was obviously put into this CRPG, its hard to ignore it's weak points.I chose to recommend this game because at the moment of writing the game's overall score deserves some positive correction upward. I think people should be encouraged to play this game, and games like this in general (such as PoE and Tyranny), though when it comes to this title they would be served best by curbing their expectations.Pros:* A fascinating world full of wonders to explore and discover.* Interesting questlines and characters, for the most part.* Well written narrative, for the most part.Cons:* An incredibly frustrating combat system with long waiting time between rounds. (Although you can choose to avoid combat most of the time).* Banal and unsatisfying asnwers to some of the game's most intriguing mysteries.* Rushed ending that fails to meet the expectations.Verdict: Play this game to enjoy the ride and don't expect a mind blowing closure, just try to avoid the combat.

												I liked it. If you like to ""visit"" a very intersting world and does not mind reading a lot I can recoment it. The crisis system, I think, is very interesting and fun when not doing ordinary combat which is a bit lackluster but most situations can be solved without violence. Altough your interpretation of beeing a ""good guy"" might not involve always beeing a pacifist, which I liked. I had more fun with Torment: Tides of Numenera then Baulders gate 1 (althogh I did not go much further then after the mine ,I did do as many side quests as I could thou) and Ice wind dale (do not remeber how far I came in that game). But I found pillars of eternity and Never winter nights 2 as better games. It should be mentioned that I have not played planescape torment yet.			"

												Torment is a more than worthy successor to Planescape:Torment, evoking the vast feel of colossal worlds and impacts with your every word. Every companion has a well-thought-out reason for being, and I was amazed at how some of my choices came back around. Was the whole point of everything as personally earth-shattering as PS:T? No. Nothing ever will be. Accept this, and let the Tides take you as close to that apex as we'll ever get again.			"

												It felt a bit short and a bit hollow compared to the Torment of yore, but it is a true spiritual successor.  Lots and lots of text and dialogue, it was very well written.  There is usually more than one way to obtain whatever objective you have.  NPCs are complex and nuanced, each with their own motivation, personality, and attitude.Very few required fights, and those that are forced are almost always objective oriented... you're trying to survive, escape or reach some goal rather than just kill the enemies.  It's a neat idea, and mostly successfullly pulled off - that said I would have liked to see more of it.  I also would have liked more opportunities to just pound some baddies.The supporting PCs are all unique and very well thought out - you will be interested in your followers, their objectives, and what they have to say.The leveling system felt a bit thin - most of the combat abilities weren't terribly useful in my ""jack"" (rogue type) playthrough.The whole ""tide"" system felt really undeveloped - supposedly your behavior opened up options that you might not have had otherwise, but even after finishing the first playthrough I wasn't really sure whether it made any difference at all.  Overall, I was mildly disappointed, but the original set the bar very, very, high.  I still recommend the game on its own merits.			"

												I just finished my first play through of Tides of Numenara. (I didn't play it during early access, seemed silly to play a partly complete story based game before it was finished)Overall, I liked the game.It's certainly a niche game. You have to like reading, as in full length novels type reading. Combat and character building took a massive back seat. If you play these games to level up, collect loot, and test your characters in combat, pass this game. You won't like it. It kept the original Torment ""feel"". Everything is strange, weird and alien. It takes some time to get the ""feel"" of this strange universe. The game eases you into it by taking a page out of the original Torment, your character starts with no memory. Everything is just as strange and new to your character as it is to the player. The universe is complex, and I actually caught the game breaking it's own internal consistency at least twice. For example your character is pretty much immortal (not much of a spoiler, you find this out 2 minutes into the game), as well as other characters who belong to your characters ""race"", only extreme things can actually kill them, however, the game forgets about this fact at least once. (not to the main character)One page it didn't take from the original was the lack of wacky party members. You got some crazy extreme ones in the original, (a floating scull, a succubus, a man who burns forever..) Nothing like this here. In fact I found them to be ""ok"". The exception to this would be Rhin. Though she is a normal human, her character differs enough the she breaks the mold from the rest. Not that the other characters you take on are all boring and dull. They all have backstories and little mysteries attached to them. The game can be progressed in various ways. You can avoid 75% of the combat with your choices, character skills, and some luck. When you are actually in combat the in game system is passible for certain. One thing that bothered me with combat was there was no in game explanation as to what all the damage types did.  Combat was also very buggy. Certain functions just stop working and cannot be access for no in game reason and random times. This bringing me to my next point...BUGS!!! Combat had the most of them, (stealth for example, sometimes I would not be able to select it, sometimes the menu would come up, I would have a good percentage of success, but the ""ok"" button would not work) If there was an in game reason for this I had no idea why it didn't work. Other abilities seemed to be prone to this. Twice the game got ""stuck"" on the enemies turn.  A couple times I would somehow break the combat rules and do something not allowed that usually got my character stuck and unable to end their turn. Outside of combat the game gave me issues saving, sometimes it just would not allow me to create a new save file. (thankfully ""quick save"" always seemed to work) Sometimes I would be unable to select anything for some reason. The only way to fix this was to save and reload. Another frustrating bug was if you look at something then shortly afterwards move to a new area, the window giving feedback gets stuck on your screen. The only way to fix this is to go back and look at the same object and allow the window to close on it's own. Had the game lock up randomly at least 5 times.One thing I have to bring up, the game creators have a video showing a slice of the game. In this slice they show pretty much every NPC spoken to using actual spoken lines. The game has hardly any spoken lines at all when you actually play it. Worse still, once you arrive at the same slice of the game, none of the characters who spoke in the video speak any of the same lines, (it's all just text reading). I'm not sure what's up with that. I don't mind reading everything, but I don't like being tricked into thinking the game has certain features it does not.To summarize; if you liked the original Torment, you will like this. If you like reading/story heavy RPGs, you will like this.			"

Early Access Review
								As of version 0.1.2:InXile has truly created a spiritual successor to PS:T with this game; the world is overflowing with story, depth of character, intrigue, excitement, and choice. That said, what exists now is VERY similar to PS:T and I hope there is a significant directional change as the story progresses further and deeper into Numenera's 9th World.As an early beta, it is undeniably riddled with bugs, balance, and user interface issues; all of this is to be expected of course. Thus, I don't mind so far and am eager to see the game become more painted, polished and perfected. I have seen FAR worse betas. Many, many, much worse.My two greatest likes about T:ToN: the beautifully painted areas, and the wonderfully scripted text/dialogue. In this InXile has shone.What I hope to see more development in: For it's otherwise gorgeous artwork, the user interface (menus, gui/hud, etc) is lacking in the artistic department; it is unfortunately drab and plain. It doesn't reflect the beauty of the world it overlays. There also seems to be a significant amount of interface lag when attempting actions, dialogue, or navigating menus. As noted elsewhere, the game itself seems to suffer from slow transitional load times. Im fairly confident, however, that these problems will be addressed before final release.In summary: This may be the game I am most excited to play in a very, very long time.			"

								Although in the beta stage, I do recommend this product so far. The characters look interesting and the environment can be used to your advantage. There is an element of reload in the game though, which might encourage you to play the same scene multiple times until you receive a favourable result. One almost hopes this will have an ironman mode for achievements to solve this, since it seems silly to save and just reload until your chance percentages are favourable!			"

												Less like a traditional cRPG to me and more like an isometric choose your own adventure game which happens to have pretty decent writing overall (there is a lot of a reading in this game) so if you like choose your own adventure books you will probably like this but if you go in expecting something like some of the newer cRPG's released of late like Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland 2 or Pillars of Eternity as examples then you may be slightly disappointed. There is a lot of content the developers cut from the game which annoyed me as a backer on Kickstarter but they have promised to work on bringing as much of those things as possible with few exceptions later through free content patches so I have not dwelled on that aspect in this review. Since I have also not yet completed the game I did not delve deep into the mechanics or too much of the gameplay specifics in this review, I will update this review with that sort of information once completed it but until then this is more a general review about the game format/style, value and issues I have with it so far in my playthrough.Combat in the game happens rarely and way to easy to avoid with little to no effort in my opinion, the stat/skill checks are very easy which makes the world feel less threatening in the sense of not on edge worrying about game over screens much and less rewarding because the game is heavily weighted in favor of you passing checks and balances to avoid most conflicts so avoiding them does not feel like much of a challenge. Normally in past cRPG's avoiding conflict was harder so when did manage to wriggle your way out of getting into fights it felt more rewarding.It does not feel like you are in much danger most of the time and also feels like hardly anyone poses much of a threat because of how easy it is to talk your way out of most conflicts plus you tend to ressurect in your mind in most cases when die anyways with very few perma death situations. Investing in combat abilities feel somewhat redundant for most of the game so I found picking things that boost worldly knowledge and things to help pass dialogue checks a better choice overall. I have seen others calling this game akin to a 'visual novel' but that is not an accurate description of this game and to call it that is a bit misleading since there is enough actual gameplay and action to counter that perception. The writing is good in general, the companions are interesting enough even though there is not much in the way of quests for them, the world setting/lore is very interesting plus the music is also fairly decent at times but it is not the game I hoped it would be when backed it on Kickstarter if being honest. I was expecting a high quality traditional cRPG but this is pretty much a choose your own adventure book in isometric game format. I am pretty far into it I think but have yet to finish it so do not know if it drastically changes between now and then though I doubt it will to a large degree. Overall I would give it a 7/10 so far of which the score I give it may go up or down slightly by time I finish it. I like Wasteland 2, Divinity Original Sin and Pillars of Eternity more than this overall even if each of those have their own flaws, this one I put on par with Tyranny as it stands currently. I will likely update this review when finish it. If you are unsure whether will like it because of how expensive it is you might want to wait till on either 33% or 50% off sale, I think it is worth at least 50% of it's current price personally so around 20-25 GBP, I do think it is a bit expensive at 35 GBP for specifically people unsure about whether will like it or not and if you are one of those people then you shold definatley avoid buying the 50 or 70 GBP versions. Obviously also take into account my valuation on things might not match how you value things but I stand by what I said for those who remain unsure about picking this game up.			"

The way the game plays takes a little getting used to, as you'll find yourself taking in massive dialoges rather than strategic battles most of the time. But it does this very elegantly. The numenera system might seem shallow at first glance but offers a lot of depth as you progress.

The reviews that say this RPG is less game and more 'choose your own adventure' are spot-on. If you're the type of person who buys PnP campaign settings or pre-made adventure paths and likes to read through them (not even necessarily play them), this game is for you.As someone who is somewhat tired of the standard fantasy tropes on display in RPGs today, the Tides of Numenera's setting and characters are a breath of fresh air. Yes, the game has glitches. Yes, random NPCs are willing to give you their life's story at the drop of a hat. But if you can look past its flaws and enjoy it for what it is, Tides of Numenera is well worth your time.			"

												Overall, I really enjoyed this game.The good:  The story was well written and I really liked the companions I chose to bring along.  It had a very Planescape: Torment feel to it, as befits a spiritual successor.  There were a lot of quests but none of them felt like chores.  The ability to not just interactively ""remember"" the past but actually change it is quite a cool concept.The neutral: The game does strip down much of the staples of the classic RPG genre.  Combat is infrequent (and mostly voluntary), gear upgrades are few, there's no such thing as grinding and even character progression feels somewhat unimportant.  Most of the game revolves around dialog and your choices there, and there's basically no truly ""trash"" encounters.  These could go either way - I found them a refreshing departure from combat-heavy games, but if you enjoy killing a lot of stuff and getting a lot of gear / XP then you may find this game lacking.The bad: Tidal surge is a mechanic that both seems fascinating and woefully underutilized.  In fact the entire Tides system had no obvious impact upon the game, in spite of being a key focus to the plot.			"

There was so much lore that it was very easy to get sidestracked with a second and third novel while reading the novel. I appreciate all the love that was put into it, but it was a bit much.The combat was the really rough part. The devs have stated though that they realize it needed love and will work on it.All that said I still give it a thumbs up. Some will love it, some will hate it, but all in all it's a good game.			"

Early Access Review
								Feels already that this will live up to the legacy of its predecessor, Planescape Torment, which was in my opinion the very best game ever made.  The writing in this game is of the highest quality.  The pre-rendered backgrounds are jaw-dropping in their beauty and awesome strangeness.  The NPCs have their own personas and have great humorous banter between them, a la Baldur's Gate.  I love how this game is not about good and evil choices.  Every choice has elements of both.  That's where the 'tides' come into play.  It is quite possible that this game will be the very best game created in the 21st century so far.			"

								A true gem in the making! Players of Planescape: Torment will feel right at home, what with the eerie tutorial sidekick and everything. ;)When first familiarizing oneself with the UI and stats, it seems pretty generic; though intricately detailed and pleasantly complex. Then you notice the last two damage types. ""Relativistic"". Whut? The game's lore is definitely on the level!Combat is the familiar turnbased: one movement + one action (generally), in either order. Though the movement can strain you, expending the action you had for that turn.			"

												This game is truly wonderful. Sure the animation is somewhat lacking and there is a few minor facelifts that could be made, but I am in awe. The deep strange story that unfolds is beathtakning and the characters are so complex and well written. At one point I got overwelmed with emotion over a reunion of a beloved character and a tear of joy fell from my eyes to my keyboard.If you ever enjoyed game like Baldur's Gate, Pillar's of Eternity or Newerwinter Nights ect. This is not only a must, this might be the best. "

												While it doesn't feel like a true sequel to Planescape: Torment, it certainly gets a lot right.  Definitely the Spiritual Sequel, which is what it's supposed to be.  A sequel released in a timely manner would not have been as good.  I'd argue that the Numenera setting is even better than the Planescape setting.  The wonder and imagination is all here.  It's as mysterious and intriguing as PS:T, if not more so.  If you are into atmospheric, text heavy RPGs this is one of the best.			"

												This game is different from most other RPGs. It's setting in the Ninth World creates a unique, interesting scenery of eccentric characters and deep conversations. One has to like this particular type of game and as others have mentioned there are definitely some shortcomings in the execution (which I won't repeat here) but I still recommend to at least consider giving Tides of Numenera a chance before you dismiss it due to having overall ""mixed"" reviews.

								***Update 1***Very much playable after patch 1 update. Will return after a Numenera expedition***First Impression***I have a Lenovo y50 and this game is almost unplayable on it atm. The framerate is extremely choppy and every click takes 5-6 seconds to resolve. There are no perceived issues with my laptop. I ran Divinity Original Sin, Dirt 3 and Witcher 2 immediately after trying Torment and they all work fine. I've sent feedback to the devs. Thumbs up if this gets solved. Really want to dive into Numenera.			"

												This game tries hard to be as deep and enchanting as its spirutal predecessor. But sadly it comes short. The main storyline is fine enough, but never gets really personal or philosopichal like was excepted. The side-stories are ussually not very interesting. And the party NPC's are not developed much. The premisse of some characters are good and exciting, but the game dosen't let you explore those relations much. Maybe because the game is quite short and there is not time and things going on to go into those realation stories. I would still recommend the game based on what it is and not what I hope it was. It was still an interesting adventure to play trough. With a lot of different and strange enviroments and stories.			"

												Just finished the game, and got one of the pretty nice endings. Everyone has said this already, but if you're a fan of Planescape: Torment you will probably enjoy this game too. It doesn't quite live up to the scope, and the overall cohesiveness of the world of PS:T (I think due to budgetary and time constraints), but T:ToN was still a delightful experience.The Crisis system is interesting but I think it wasn't really utilised to its full potential. I also didn't think much of the combat, but then who needs combat when the peaceful solutions to conflicts are usually the most interesting solutions? I made some mistakes and accidentally got into combat a few times, but usually I will try to talk my way out of bad situations because the writing is really good.Huge shout out to the writers for making the companion characters likeable and interesting. Especially Patrick Rothfuss who wrote Rhin.I LOVE RHIN SO MUCH. If you meet Rhin please adopt her and keep her. Trust me.			"

												I enjoyed most of this game. Overall, it's quite a unique experience. Tides of Numenera feels like a tentative first step in what will hopefully become a series, or at least have its own spiritual successor, and as an experiment, a tinkering with the crpg formula, I think it was mostly a success.The game doesn't end on the most positive of notes though - I don't mean the details of the actual ending (which aren't that interesting, the main story of this game is less interesting than the million smaller stories that make it up), but how it happens, accelerating quite quickly once you progress past a certain point in the Maw.

												This takes me back to my first time with Planescape Torment, or even to the original Ultima games (1-7) - Keep notes, make decisions carefully, and fully expect everything you do to have important effects on your end game. Like with the original Torment, how you end depends almost entirely on how you played, so expect to play many times and have many different endings.			"

												Disclaimer: I backed the game on Kickstarter and played it on GOG rather than Steam.The first thing anyone should know about this game is that it is very heavy on text and could almost be thought of as an interactive novel rather than as a game. I've you have never played any games like that (such as Planescape: Torment) I would not reccommend buying this game yet, as the price is quite steep. Wait until you know for sure whether you like this style of game or until the price drops.With that out of the way, I can say that this game is in my opinion a more than worthy spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment. There are significant differences between both games, but they clearly fall within the same niche subgenre withing RPGs. However, as much as some people seem to have fond memories of Planescape, I never liked it all that much. Its setting and characters did not feel relatable to me. This made it hard for me to care about the story or the world, altough it must be said that some of the characters definitely had their moments. In comparison, Numenera offers a setting that is an interesting blend of fantasy with science fiction and a bit of post-apocalypse. In many ways, it feels familiar and therefore is often much more relatable. But this familiarity is constantly broken up by strange and mysterious elements, giving the setting the weirdness that also defined Planescape's setting. In my opinion, the better setting also leads to ToN having a better story. In contrast to Planescape, ToN managed to make care about the world, the story and characters and kept me engaged and from beginning to end. I feel this is the most important aspect of any RPG and would therefore greatly reccommend this game. Of course, whether you like a story or not is heavily subjective as it depends entirely on individual preferences, but I had the best time playing an RPG since I played Baldur's Gate.That being said, the game is not without flaws. Its is relatively short and the combat system feels like an afterthought. Even though this game focusses on story rather than combat, I do feel that combat is essential to any RPG. A better combat system and more content would have greatly improved this game.			"

								After months of developement, the game ist still annoying. It's incomplete and most of the time very boring. I'm a great fan of Planescape Torment and the Baldur's gate saga, but this game doesen't use it's potential. Tons of text to read,  no action, just walking and talking...I played 6,5 Hours and had two fights. KI is overpowered when you've got the wrong character built, what you recognize after 6,5 hours of gameplay... very unballanced. I know that it's early access, but for how long will it still be ""early access""?Character developement is unstructured, items are senseless and leveling up one level takes hours and hours.Still very buggy (savegames), really disappointing...

												Oh God yet another tunnel game using Unity; I feel like I'm playing Shadowrun: Hong Kong reskinned with just as attrocious UI, graphics, and gameplay/dialogue.  Wish developers would state as much during the kickstarter ""Hey we are just going to make another Unity tunnel RPG clone"" instead of what the promised ""Torment 2"" which had an excellent UI (though dated).  Can't stand the classic Unity ""can't zoom out far enough"", ""Final Fantasy like zoom to mini/sub battles"", etc.  Hey let's ""tab"" all the time and examine things that are irrelevant or the just as bad inverse point me exactly what to do . hmm what am I suppose to do there, oh I know click the highlighted only action item!!! .. Oh which dialogue am I suppose to pick, oh the more info / peaceful / more complex one.  How much you want to bet the ""meaningful"" dialogue and action choices which were promised aren't (just like SR and POE).   Not going to continue playing though might try again in a couple patches but doubt it.  Love the concept, love Torment, and the story here looks interesting but yet another UI/engine/graphic failure just like nearly every game I have bought off kickstarter (yes that includes POE, SR, etc).  If nothing else last three years have taught me to quit kickstarting so I can steam try and return a game first.Hopefully they don't screw Bard's Tale IV but I'm not holding my breath (from the early previews)			"

								Let me start by saying that I hope I'm able to change this review someday. I love Numenera,  I loved the original Torment, and the small parts of this game that work show a lot of promise.That said, the ""game"" is far too incomplete to get a recommendation at this time. It's at a very early alpha level of bugginess, such that all but the most patient of gamers will not be able to tolerate it. If you don't imagine yourself happily persevering after the fourth time you've crashed during character creation, you should probably wait a while before checking this game out.Even if you are prepared to save after every action and reload a lot, brace yourself for a shocking lack of content. You'll get a quest, head out for the dungeon, and then get a dialog telling you to imagine you just completed the quest. At the current state of development, the game is very thin.These two complaints should be addressed as development progresses. One thing that won't change is that this game looks and plays like a game from 1999. Thats not a bad thing, it's just what a gamer like me wants, but it's not for everyone.Those complaints aside, I haven't returned it and continue to slog through it. Why? Because it's a great portrayal of the Numenera setting and system. Because the writing is top quality and the dialog trees are extensive. Because I suspect that I will love this game when it's done and don't want to wait for them to finish it. So, if you're the kind of person who loves Planescape and plays in a weekly tabletop Numenera game, this title is worth a look. Otherwise, I'd keep my eye on the forums and pick it up when it's got a little more meat on it's bones.			"

There are sooooo many of QOL things that should have been implimented and the lack of them makes it unenjoyable. Camera following always, can only select your main character out of combat, lack of defined skill trees. Combat is by far the worst. You have only a move action and an attack action. Maybe I am just spoiled by Pillars, Tyranny and Divinity, but they might as well have just removed combat entirely and ended with the same game. It feels just feels unfinished. I would have rather them spent another 6 months and polished it rather than release it in its current state.			"

Summary.Torment: Tides of Numenera is a party-RPG, 35-40 hour long, the battle system is poor, the story is fine. The game is good, but it fails to compete with either nostalgia or the other RPGs available. Approaching it without comparison or expectations would provide the best experience.Update. Completed the 2nd playthrough. The game tracks most of player's choices, but doesn't show if an event is the consequence of player's actions, time-dependant or a default scenario; There is not enough information in battles shown (i.e. no log, no rolls, no opponent's stats or defenses);There is usually one weapon per type (Heavy, Medium, Light) per stat (Might, Speed, Intellect) per area (except for Medium Speed weapons, there are sometimes 2 per area).Key points: The story is fine, the lore is rather bizarre, the information is presented in pieces to form the whole picture by the end (some side quests bite later during the main ones);Several ways to resolve quests;The decisions sometimes provide immediate or clear results, due to the game's structure you see some outcomes only in the epilogue;Areas change subtly depending on the actions taken;Terminology is different for the sake of being different - ""nano"" is a mage, ""CRISIS"" is combat, ""fettle"" is an effect/status, ""oddity"" is useless loot and ""numenera"" is an artifact in the most common meaning (matearial product of human culture/civilization);3 battles in the firsrt 15 hours, more unskippable battles later, turn-based combat, hard to say how balanced it is;No stealth outside of combat, which means inability to scout areas before encounters or start combat with an attack from stealth;RNG-based skill checks in dialogues encourage to use F5/F9 often;Several choose-your-adventure (text-based) sequences, several dialogue pazzles (i.e. answers mean something);Good graphics, good animations (but there's no option to speed it up);""Heavy"" UI, no option to sort items in the inventory (which gets more problematic as the player acquires more items);Good soundtrack, annoyingly voiced commands (turned off VA after 10 hours);Customizable controls;No fast-travel and a lot of running through the same locations;Some side quests are bugged (v.1.0.1);Companions, who are available, but not in the active party, don't gain experience;Tides seem to be the same thing as allignment in D&D and it can be min-max'ed as well.There are other games doing what TToN is trying to do, but better.For hardcore RPG experience - The Age of Decadance;For nostalgia - Pillars of Eternity.

Just like they used to make them!What a fantastic game!""Tides of Numenera"" is a worthy successor to ""Planescape Torment"", my favorite game of all time. Although not as good as the original, ToN is a first-rate RPG just like they used to make them back in the days.Pros:+ The atmosphereI can not stress this enough. The atmosphere in this game is simply gorgeous. The game makers perfectly managed to recapture that special Planescape feeling. Exploring the streets of Sagus Cliffs felt just like exploring Sigil for the very first time so many years ago. And ""The Bloom"" is one of the most scenic areas that has ever been created in video game history in my opinion.+ The LoreLots of philosophy, just the way you like it. There is so much stuff you can learn about this world and it's always told in an engaging and informative way. + The StorySuspenseful story-telling, cool characters, it's all there. I've heard people complain about the ending of ToN, but I can't share that opinion at all. The ending (at least the one I chose) was a perfect conclusion to the story arc.Neutral:+- The PartyIn my opinion the biggest ""flaw"" of the game. The NPCs are not nearly as interesting or fleshed-out as the ones in ""Placescape Torment"". No companion has the charme of Morte or the wits of Annah. They are likeable (most of them), but I wish there would have been more interaction and more depth to the characters.+- The UniverseToN takes places in the Ninth World, which is not related to the Planes you know from D&D at all. In the beginning this was a bit of a let-down for me, regarding how much story potential the Planes still seemed to contain. In the end though, I found this new universe really fascinating. It's thoroughly developed and I think you should give it a chance. Don't listen to people who say: ""It's not the Planes so it's bad!""+- The Game MechanicsNot really a bad thing. I like the new mechanics, but boy does it take time to get used to them. The fights are turn-based and you now have ability points that you can spend in order to increase the chance of success of a certain action. It's closer to an actual Pen & Paper RPG.+- The LengthIt took me about 30 hours to complete the game including most side quests. Not too bad, but I think the game could have lasted just a bit longer.Negative:Nothing really. The game has some small flaws, but nothing serious that would interfere with the game experience.Bottom Line:If you can get over the fact, that the new Torment is set in a different universe and you don't mind learning new game mechanics, I strongly suggest you buy this game. It might not be as amazing as the original Planescape, but it's a very strong second installment that manages to fill the foot-steps made by it's predecessor.			"

								After two hours of play my impressions are of a wonderfully strange RPG with new and interesting mechanics.			"

												9/10Overall: An excellent example of Inifinity-engine style storytelling in the mold of Planescape: Torment. One of the biggest strengths of TTON is that it is without the excess weight of some elements that (while fun) don't contribute to this particular kind of narrative RPG; specifically, excess grinding and extra-story combat. On the downside, of course, some people will miss those things, and some will be further disappointed at the fact that this really is a specific story with a lot of beautiful text (ala PS:T), and not a free-form RPG like Baldur's Gate, where you can build a character of your choosing. However, the limited choices when it comes to character creation are still quite robust, and I didn't feel like the story was missing anything for not having, for example, more than three Focus paths to choose from. Major Pros:-Tight narrative that allows for MUCH more reactivity than I expected, making choices that felt thematically or logically correct actually have impacts (sometimes extremely significant impacts) to gameplay. Unlike BG/BGII or even PS:T, for example, sometimes a quest item is actually as useful as the person who asks you to retrieve it claims it to be...-Interesting characters with personal motivations beyond ""You seem trustworthy; allow me to join YOUR noble quest!""-An interesting character with personal motivation that is EXACTLY: ""You seem trustworthy; allow me to join YOUR noble quest!""Minor Pros:-Beautiful music and art-Background item descriptions blend into interactivity and actual bonuses/powers; be sure to examine all the Oddities carefully.Major Cons:-The final act was so tight that I'm willing to bet anyone who doesn't play a heavy-Intellect/Lore/etc character, AND strive for finishing side-quests, will feel like it is lacking. The major narrative is strong and well-implemented, but I think it would be easy for someone playing a different kind of character to miss some things I found and enjoyed (though, I suppose, I could be wrong, depending on the usefulness of Smashing/Quick Fingers/etc as skills to find other ways around problems).Minor Cons:-Voice acting didn't hold up to the music and art; I was OK with it, but some characters were much weaker than others in this regard. -I was surprised there are only 4 character tiers (sort of the equivalent of levels, or level-brackets) in the game, as I was assuming it would have the baseline 6 from the tabletop game. I was certainly not under-powered at the end, but when I stopped advancing, I had to go and check to see if that was a bug. "

												What an awesome game. Please buy this game. Support these kind of classic RPGs. It's a dying art, this gaming medium of interactive storytelling. When you use your dollars to show your support, you help the writers and developers know that their work is appreciated and desired. This game is frustrating. It's frustrating in the best of ways. It's frustrating in that you can't outsmart it every time. You will make mistakes. But mistakes are OK! Mistakes sometimes lead to opportunities you wouldn't have had otherwise. Failure isn't always the end. Sometimes it's the beginning. This game is meant to challenge you. Don't savescum for best options. Accept that you'll make mistakes. Burn through your limited resources. But talk to -everyone-. So many people have a story. So many of them might have some hidden secret for you. I think that's what I loved best about this, was digging through the small secrets and finding big ones. The characters were fun and interesting to play with, the setting was weird and alien and macabre and funny-- it reminded me so much of the original Torment, a game with such a weirdly alien setting that no one should feel 'comfortable' there. You will fulfill and subvert tropes almost constantly. This game isn't a challenge to be summited. It's a story to be read-- an experienced to be shared. "

												This game is AWESOME. The ninth world is interesting and full of wonderfully detailed characters and places. This is NOT PLANESCAPE TORMENT and DOESNT NEED TO BE! Im so sick of hearing how great planescape torment was and how this game will never be planescape. Of corse it wont! its a totally different world you morons. I have played every great rpg known to man and this game is just as great as planescape but in different ways. I cant wait to see what the future holds for this game and its expansions. inXile did a great job on this game and they deserve mad props. You ♥♥♥♥ing planescape whiners need to realize its 2017 not 99 ...yes planescape was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome but so is this game so STFU and enjoy the hard work and effort these guys did to bring this game to your ♥♥♥♥♥y crying♥♥♥♥♥..

												Piece of advice before you buy this game: expect a lot of reading. If you are not a reader, do not get this game. It is that simple. A few of the 'negative' reviews seem to have to do with the amount of reading this game throws at you. Do not get the game for the combat, get it for the story, the characters. You can get by with very little combat, actually, depending on how you play your character. There are a variety of ways that you resolve a single quest and develop your playstyle in the process. This game has more depth than you realize, although it does need some polishing to be honest, and I won't lie: I'm a bit disappointed in the cut content despite knowing that's a reality all game developers face. I hope that the developers can continue to polish this game now that it's been released and add more content that can address some of the concerns other people have. I still say, however, this game is worth the purchase.  "

												The story and world in the game is amazing. I really want to continue playing through it and discovering more of what it has to offer on that front. It is just that I can't. Combat in this game is rediculously hard. Even after choosing a class that ""masters defence"" my main character is killed after 2-3 hits from basic enemy attacks. After a dozen attempts in this one encounter where death is a game over, I was done.			"

												Good game. Unique world (not some generic stuff like Inquisition, Pillars or Divinity), unususal and well written story (finally, you do not have to save the world), a lot of possibilities for roleplaying and interesting quests.P.S. Not for people who think that RPG is about fights. This game is about roleplaying and making decisions.			"

												This one is a special gem and a worthy sucessor to planescape torment.Some minor issues here and there but nothing that makes it not worth buying.If people want to see games like these being made that takes alot of risk. Buy.Great story so far. Pledged to kickstarter then bought the collectors edition as well.Hopefully it sells well enough to continue expading the torment universe and more games.Good work here. "

												TToN seems to be a great game... The visuals are innovative, the interactions are plenty, the possibilities great.So far there are only one thing I truly disliked (the fact that I can't choose the appearance/name of the main character) and one thing that could be better (more fights!). All in all it is already a good true RPG!After words: finished the game! Indeed a very good RPG! Changed my mind about the fights, that are plenty of them if you make it happen!			"

												I have never written a public review before, but for this game I will definitely take the time to write it.I grew up playing BG and Planescape Torment, both games are pretty much the foundation of my interest in RPG games. something that involves real decision making and consequences as well as a fantastic story line.I was thrilled when I heard a new Torment game is coming out and ever since I am/was a backer for this game.I always believed that a real RPG game should give you the option to play the game however you wanted. The only way I can explain as to how this became a reality with Tides of Numenera is that the first 14 hours of game play i had exactly '0' (yes that is the number zero) encounters in terms of batlles. I have played as a slippery bas**** and got through each situation with deception, lying and persuasion. This is literally the best s*** ever. You may ask, well what if I want to kick a** and take names. Well guess what, you can practically murder anyone in the game that you do not like once you are done with them. Sometimes even before you are done with them (voice in head: *why did it say quest failed*)...Overall, there are still some improvements that can be made, and these guys take the development and players very seriously when it comes to positive critism and requests.I will highly recommend this game to anyone who really enjoys RPGs			"

												Great game just a bit too short. Wasteland 2 was longer allthough Tides of Numenera had more funding.I played it trough the first time in 25hours and I did most of the sidequests too. Original Torment was also longer.8/10 points. Would have scored it full probably without the shortness of the game.			"

												This game is getting a thumbs-up from me, WITH qualifications. Also, since the game labels itself as a spiritual successor to Planescape:Torment, I will be making references to that masterpiece. Also, some SPOILERSBefore you decide if you want to get this game, you need to figure out if you love to read. Personally, I love reading, so this game is a few steps up for me. The prose is effective and appreciated. If reading is a chore for you, skip this game. I say skip it in that particular instance because the combat system is not sufficient to make this game stand on it's own. In fact, the game has no real challenge of its own due to a problem within its mechanics. See, for any skill check or combat check, you will use your pool of stat points as a finite resource. This could be a potentially interesting system, especially if you combine this fact with the notion that even failure on skill checks brings a reward (sometimes even a better reward). You would have a system where failure was as common as success, leading to an almost real-life scenario where people fail and live with the consequences.Except the Edge mechanic burns this system to the ground.As you level, you will eventually get Edge points for your stat pools. In essence, Edge gives you free points to spend on a task EVERY TIME you attempt a task using that stat pool, e.g., 3 Edge for intellect means 3 free points spent every time you attempt an intellect task or attack. This corresponds to a rough 45% increase for your chances for success. For free.Then you specialize one character per stat pool, and you'll never fail a roll again. Ever. Taking the uncertainty out of the system was a mistake, particularly since combat does NOT have variety in its abilities. In fact, Planescape:Torment had more combat options. Let that sink in; a game from 1999 had more combat options and variety than one released in The Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Seventeen. Sigh.And since we are on the subject of comparison, let's compare companions. PS:T's companions not only had more depth and backstory, but they all revolved around the theme of that game; ""What can change the nature of a man?"" T:TON's companions, while ranging from acceptable to pretty good, never achieve the success of its predecessor because they don't cleave to the theme of their own game: ""What does one life matter?""In fact, the game doesn't really deal with this theme either. If we saw, more directly, how the tidal manipulations of the other castoffs and the Last Castoff himself truly hurt the people around them, we could see the tension between hurting others by merely existing. However, it all rings false when I play my character like a paladin and improve the lives of almost everyone around me: Sagus Cliffs and most of its serious problems resolved, including the removal of the adversaries, who want to wipe out all life on Earth, yet I'm told at the end of the game, and not really before in any significant way, ""sorry, your existence makes life miserable for anyone you come in contact with"" I can't help but roll my eyes at the fact that my suspension of disbelief lies bleeding on the ground before me. Outside of this attempt using the titular tides to move the theme, there are no other appeals to ""what does one life matter/""Also, some really annoying sound effects tied to buffs can't be turned off. REALLY ANNOYING effects.So why the heck am I giving this game a thumbs-up? Because the whole is greater than its parts. Any one system from this game held up to the light looks mediocre at best, but when put together with everything else, it... works, and I don't regret a single hour of the 22 I spent beating the game. It doesn't come close to topping Planescape:Torment, but it doesn't have to. This is a fairly well-written game that takes lots of risks; while those risks don't always pan out, I prefer developers to take risks and fail on occasion as opposed to playing it safe, Assassin's Creed style.TL:DR If you like to read, give it a shot; not as good as PS:T but still good.

												I think it's a very interesting, and overall very good game. Would I recommend it? Yes, for sure. Alas, it isnt a game for just anyone.tl;dr: If you like reading, and like slow pacing, and you are looking for something fresh and in some ways unique, with characters that have their own stories and are memorable (at least some of them), you liked Planescape Torment, and have enough time and have ability to focus, go ahead and get the game!On the other hand - if you can't focus, prefer fast pacing, are action oriented, and you are more Pillars of Eternity type of RPG player, with more fighting, dungeon crawling, and you arent interested in companions at all, but progress and very visible main story is important for you - you may not enjoy Tides of Numenera. What did I enjoy? What did I think was done right?+ The world/setting is very good and pretty interesting. It does have that bit weird feeling to it, as Planescape Torment had.+ Characters are very good. They aren't just a stat-sticks, that you drag along. They have their stories, their opinions, and the world reacts to them.+The game is story driven, and the story is good.+Quests are very interesting, because they can be solved in so many ways! And I don't mean: just one-or-two possible solutions. There's plenty!+it's a game you can re-play and discover many new things on your next playthrough. I think it is worth re-playing and I am just about to do that.+After you finish the game, and will look up the achievements that you can get, you're like: 'wow, is that really possible to do THAT? I need to try!' The game is flexible, and the more effort you will put into it, the more things you will discover.+Combat system - it's new, and fresh. It is turn wise, and at first I wasn't convinced, because I hate turn system with a passion, but in this game, the turn system has it's merits. It isnt used only for combat. It's more narrative, you can even try to talk to your adversaries at times and try to get them to your side. It's different from just - go and kill everything that moves.+You don't like fighting? You don't have to fight. At all. There are many ways to solve the problems, and fighting is only one of options.What I think they could improve:-No intro/movie at the begining - I couldn't care less for the cutscenes, but because there is no intro, you are plunged into a world you know nothing about, story you know nothing about, and you get all those seemingly random quests you just go and do, without really knowing why the heck are you here and what is your purpose.  BUT! Give it a chance, the more you will play, the more you will understand, and the more you will see that 'random' quests arent as random as you think they are :-)- There is just too much of text! Wall of texts absolutely everywhere, make your attention go away quickly. But if you will pay attention and go slow, it will seriously pay offOverall I think that it's a very good game, and I am very happy it got released. They did cut some content, but what is left in the game is well made. At first, I was very confused and didn't like the game too much, because I had no idea what's going on, and it smelled too much like a weaker copy of Planescape Torment. But I gave it a fair chance, and I am very pleased that I did. The story isn't a copy-paste of Planescape, which I did dread for a time, it has many options and you can play as you like. So it's honestly a game to experience.I am very pleased that I got it, that I didn't quit, and I am totally going to re-play. I consider the game Time well spent. "

												Mixed feelings about this game but I would sum it up like this: Very buggy, NOT ready for release!The bad first: Really, it is awful due to constant crashes. I have a little over 60 hours logged with this game now and I would say over a quarter of that time is wasted on crashes due to hangs etc (memory leaks?) in Crisis battles. After 5 hours wasted on the brain fight in the last two days I have given up and come here to justifiably slag the game off! As a number of other players everywhere have reported the same issue I find it hard to believe they were not fully aware of this problem in beta testing and released it anyway.I assume it's a memory management/leak or similar as it's fine until you get a crisis with several adds, then the memory usage jumps up to 2Gb, 3Gb and keeps climbing and the game freezes.If - hopefully when - they fix this, then - and only then - would I say, yes, it's a great game with plenty to offer.  Fixed, it is a refreshing chance to level up by questing and solving problems and puzzles and having your actions alter the game. Mindless kills mobs to gain levels get so tiresome after a while, so in this respect the game is a winner.But, as I say, unless/until they fix the issue with crashes during crisis events, then give it a wide berth.( Writing writing as at patch 1.01 ) This review reflects that the game is not fully playable, rather than how playable it is!

												If you're looking for story, a reactive world, great dialogue and some provokative thinking about what, ultimately, does one life matter, then this is your game.I went in wanting these things and did not come out disappointed, except in wanting more. It's rare enough to come across a game with a story worth paying attention to, and this one was a delight.			"

												In Torment, you decide who your characater is, and you'll have to live with the consequences of those decisions. This is an RPG in the purest sense: you're playing a role, not a tatical combat simulator or an experience grind. Even more than the original Torment, this is more of an interactive visual novel rather than a Baulder's Gate-like CRPG.I highly recommend everyone who enjoys story-based games play Torment.			"

												Does this game live up to Planescape Torment? Overall, no. Nonetheless, we are speaking of a highly reactive role playing game, with many (I'd like to stress it once more: *many*) options being offered to the players to shape the story. It might not be Torment, and in fact is not (sadly, Planescape's NPCs make those from this game just pale in comparison), but I think it's as close as we've ever got to it since 1999.			"

												pro:* great storytelling* mind-blowing setting* great quests, with many different possible endings* no good/bad morality system, rather an five-different-affinities system, which allows also for mixed affinities (are you e.g. more the knowledge-seeker, or more the narcissist, ...)* good-looking and good-sounding game (for my taste)con:* combat can feel a bit clunky, in particular since there are chances to miss attacks. All in all, this is a great rpg in the spirit of Baldurs Gate. If you are into that sort of thing (including reading a *lot* of text), then this is your game. I love it! It is rather slowly paced, though, so if you get bored easily, then this might be not for you. I don't like the combat, but then again you can talk (or sneak) your way around many encounters, without missing too much, in particular it is not the killing of enemies which gives XP, but the resolution of problems (and acquisition of knowledge).

												I just finished this game and enjoyed it pretty much. It is a successor of Planescape: Torment in a way that it is an exploratory game. T:TON is about discovering the denizens of the sixth world, finding clever solutions to people's problems, using junk you found on the way to invent new solutions. It is fantastic, the quests are well thought-out, the game truly shines in this aspect, every quest has several solutions, you can find another one and another one way to get what you want. You can see the amount of love and care that was sunk into this game and it really makes a difference.To add to this the designers managed to solve a problem as old as crpgs: How to avoid ruining the whole experience by saving/restoring. It is pretty hard to die, yet characters have three pools which they can use to solve different tasks which refresh every time they sleep. If you sleep a lot, you can solve every problem that can arise, with a little twist: Some quests change when you sleep, some goals become unattainable as time passes. This system is brilliant and most likely will become a new basic mechanic for crpgs. The world itself is beautiful and exciting, however I feel it is a bit fragmented, some cohesion would have made it even better. Several companions can be hired, most of them are interesting, and have rich backstories. The story of the game is enjoyable, not as great as P:T's but still entertaining and iimmersive. Considering everything I can only recommend this game to everyone.  "

												Many reviews (and the game's marketing) focus on its credibility as a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment, or lack thereof. For people wondering how it compares: overall, it doesn't quite reach the same level of storytelling as its ancestor. It's also significantly shorter, with my first full playthrough clocking in at about 25 hours with almost all of the sidequests completed. I completed the entire game with only two combat encounters, and, although the combat system is uniquely designed and fun when it works (it's certainly much better than the endless waves of enemies in PS:T's Baator), its frequent bugs and the very, very slow turn-based movement eventually take the fun away. Because there are so few unique locations in the game, the world also feels much smaller and somehow less memorable than that of PS:T.Despite all this, you'll notice that I've still recommended this game. That's because, if you move away from the gigantic shadow of nostalgia that PS:T casts over it, this game is still incredibly fun, presenting a great array of dialogue options and possible actions to resolve situations. Many encounters, despite seeming linear, can actually be replayed in a vast variety of ways which have small impacts on subsequent situations in the game. I also enjoyed the stat-based system, which, although simple, fits with the overall feel of the game. Picture Baldur's Gate 2's Athkala, with all the combat replaced by stat checks and RNG, except with more depth to the NPCs and more nuanced dialogue choices and ways to resolve conflicts. If that sounds like something you'd enjoy, buy this game.I've also seen a lot of comments about the companions. If we're comparing them to PS:T - they're more interesting than Falls-From-Grace, but none of them manage to beat Morte. Companions have many interjections and their own story arcs, although the most fleshed out companions are Erritis, Rhin, and Matkina by far. The former two are particularly memorable, and resolving their quests actually felt like it had far-reaching consequences. Their character arcs are incredibly satisfying. While the other companions also have multiple resolutions (or none) to their quests, they feel more ""standard"" and less reactive than the others, who actually have evolving dialogue as you discover more about them (like Dak'kon).In conclusion, even though it was short and not as memorable as its predecessor, the overall package makes for a very good game. It suffers because it's not ""great"", like PS:T was. But if you play with an open mind and don't expect it to be exactly the same, you've still got a solid RPG with storyline branching, interactive companions, excellent NPCs, and very interesting and unique quests. Recommended for RPG fans. "

												I had relatively low expecations for this game, and was very pleasantly surprised. I was hoping for an rpg/adventure where exploration and dialogue counted far more than grinding away at combat, and that's what I got along with a solid story, fun setting, great writing, and entertaining companions.Did inXile hit it out of the park? Well, if you compare it to the original PST, then obviously, they did not. The game is smaller, occasionally frustratingly so, and not nearly as ambitious. (although one of the upsides of the relatively small size is that there's virtually no filler) But that's an absurdly high bar. Compared to other indie(ish) RPGs like PoE, Wasteland 2, Shadowrun Returns, AoD or Tyranny, it's difficult to not call Torment: Tides of Numenara an excellent game. (unless the whole ""lots of talk and hardly any combat"" concept is not to your taste)Actually, speaking of other similar titles... I think it's absurd and unfair that this game is currently far worse reviewed than, for example, a game like Tyranny - which had a lot of potential, but was clearly released unfinished, and features far too much pointless filler. I think many of the poor reviews are less about objective judgement and more about shattered, impossibly high hopes.			"

												I'd recommend this game at a $30 price point.The Awesome - I loved the art, loved the story and the writing as a whole.  They did a great job creating worlds and characters that will stay with me for awhile.  The blend of sci-fi and fantasy was refreshing.  I thought Planescape was well served in these regards.The Okay - I enjoyed the original game mechanics (spending of attribute resources to accomplish tasks and pass checks) but certainly felt they could have done a better job detailing character progression.  Every level/tier I gained was a surprise in regards to what skills and abilites would automatically be doled out.  I had already invested time, money and points into a number of them having no idea that I would get them for free a level later.  The Penny Pinching - The technical execution re: animation, models and combat polish was quite frankly amateur.  There's no excuse for not having matching character models and portraits, no NPC portraits during conversation and in-game armour for the main character only.  There's a ton of other shortcuts taken but I digress.  It's the little details like this that make a good game great.  It cheapened the experience and made you wonder what they spent all that money on.  The phyiscal game itself reminded me of a ""hidden object"" game in terms of production value.  Obviously not the games strong suit.Ultimately it's a well written storybook with some beautiful backdrops and whimsical art.  The game itself leaves you with a sad sense of what might have been as it feels like they dropped a finely tuned engine (the writing) into a cheaply made car.  I hope they get a second chance to right the wrong because what matters most is certainly there.			"

												It's a pity more stories cannot be told in the world created, as the developers really did go all out. However, the lack of a codex did not work in its favor, though perhaps this is a side-effect of playing Bioware RPGs.The combat system is...underwhelming [though I am aware that it is not the focus]. As are the companions. But all in all, it should be played through at least once.			"

												7.5 / 10 Another long time CRPG / PS:T player here.If there wasn't so much hype about this being the spiritual predecessor to Planescape : Torment it could be an 8+/10 game. It is a high-quality title certainly worth the time to explore with some niggling design issues. Disclaimer, I intentionally started playing this at version 1.02 after a lot of early bugs were squashed that possibly plagued earlier users.I'll start with the good. Big props to the immensely detailed environments and the intricately written stories / mini-stories you will encounter. The sheer whackyness and ambience did certainly (on occasion) rival/mirror the experiences that made PS : T great.The bad: By far the biggest let down was the poor companion character development. Very little emotional depth and story development to your tag-alongs which was one of the best parts of PS : T! Huge omission. Also mid-to-late game it feels like there are no difficult challenges combat either combat or skill-check wise. So long as you've spread your skills out between party members, you almost never fail. Also the story intensity arc is ratherflat throughout the game, meaning the ending feels almost arbitrarily tacked on and somewhat anti-climatic.In summary, this game's entertainment value comes in the sheer randomnessand quirkyness of the Ninth World and it's numenera coupled with very detailed artwork and writing. The main story, combat and emotional development does however feel like it gets lost in this detalied randomness at times.			"

												Couldn't put it down (on GOG). I love that each item, place, person, etc. has its own place in the world, makes you wonder. You run into a superintelligence with enigmatic motivations, then a group of soldiers broken by endless battles where they died over and over, and then round the corner to talk with a time traveler who can't remember how they started but remember meeting you countless times.A few things are explored in depth, but there is much more breadth than depth. I liked taking each idea and imagining how it would work. How would you function if you were one among an infinite number of alternate versions of yourself, a human GPU? What would you do with the energy of a star?The weakpoints are mostly a matter of going in with the wrong perspective. You HAVE to be willing to read; almost all of the best parts are through text. The combat will not stand on its own, don't expect Pillars or Tyranny or Baldur's Gate. The villains and side-characters are great, but companions are unfortunately shallow.The game is a dense, weird, compelling scifi book about possibilities, with a good dash of choice. Expect that, go in with the attitude, and love it.			"

Nonetheless, this game has faithfully recreated a similarly mysterious world in which you can spend hours unravelling its mysteries.  It's fantastic fun to dig around numerous NPCs and interactables for little bits of knowledge or small rewards.  If you liked Planescape:Torment, or NeverWinter Nights 2's Mask of the Betrayer, then you'll definitely enjoy this.As far as downsides go, the game definitely isn't perfect.  First off, the combat is not terribly enjoyable.  PS:T's was bad too, but this is worse.  On the upside, your choices can avoid almost all of them.  The companions also don't hold up as well as the original -- several of them are not nearly as quirky, interesting, or interactive.  Lastly, there's a _LOT_ of reading.  Even compared to PS:T.  Plenty of the language is used is...overly complicated.  Esoteric words, etc.  Not necessarily a downside, but I can't recall another game that made me consult a dictionary as often -- and that's from an avid CRPG fan and book reader.There's also plenty of Kickstarter drama surrounding this game, but don't let that concern you.  TToN was funded at the height of Kickstarter's popularity, yet before developers got good with managing promises and rewards.  Combined with poor communication on their part, and it resulted in some upset backers.  But the game stands on its own, and is still worth playing.I would hands down recommend this to any fan of the original PS:T or NWN2: MotB.  If you like CRPGs, and don't mind a word-heavy low-combat game, then you'll probably enjoy this as well.			"

												I was an early backer for this game after hearing about it in conjuction with the Numenera tabletop RPG, and I have to say it lived up to its expectations well. The story is very solid with lots of decision points and tidbits to uncover.The gameplay follows the Numera tabletop system very closely, but still proves incredibly fun to play on PC. For newcomers used to typical RPGs, it's worth noting that not all ""Combats"" have to be resolved with violence. Unique to this game, though familiar to tabletop gamers, is the idea that many environs can be used to solve encounters in place of swords, and that's assuming you don't just talk them down.The game itself captures the world and atmosphere of Numenera to an amazing degree, really bringing out the sense of living in a world loaded with things beyond our ken that players can somehow finagle to accomplish something. Not to mention the fun of exploring everything the world has to offer and uncovering many different secrets.			"

												I would recommend this game but with some reservations. It might be best to get the game when the price drops or after future patches and added/re-added content. I enjoyed playing the game, with three different playthroughs, but not without some criticism. The very nature of this being hyped up as a spiritual sucessor to Planescape: Torment already set expectations too high and caused them to over-promise, which ended up coming back to bite them. But taken for what it is, it is a decent game. It just could have been more.  World/Story - The setting is imaginative and intrigueing and the story is pretty good. The plot is a bit linear and, unfortunately, it feels a little rushed in the 2nd half of the game. Relative to my expectations for an RPG, the game's playtime is dissapointingly short and the areas are small. You get a strong sense that they had earlier iterations that were much more epic and had twice as many locations, but they ended up cutting out half of it. That's probably the biggest dissapointment for me. It's all over too quickly. Character Progression - On a related note, the level cap comes a little too quickly, at least if you play as a completionist and do all side quests. This is a feel bad thing in any RPG. In all three of my playthroughs, my main character reached the cap with about 1/4 of the game left. There was 1600+ experience past that which I couldn't use. That's easily enough XP for another 2 Tiers. If they added abilities for 2 more tiers, they could easily raise the cap to 7. Choice and Consequence - This is probably one of the aspects that they nailed pretty good. There are usually at least 2 or 3 ways to resolve most quests, sometimes with vastly different results. There are also lots of variable dialogue options that affect your tides. That said, in the long term plot, there isn't as much of a sense that your choices matter as there could be. It's all sort of foisted upon you as you're rushed to the ending. Graphics/Art/Music - The area backgrounds look beautiful and are well done. The character/NPC avatars are much more simplistic and clunky in comparison. The background music is pretty good for setting atmosphere, though maybe a bit empty at some points. You do get a sense sometimes that there was extra graphical/animation polish that existed in earlier iterations that they took out. This aspect is not that big of a deal to me though. Dialogue - It should be expected for this type of game that there is a lot of dialogue. This isn't a bad thing in and of itself. Anyone who wants a hack and slash dungeon crawl doesn't get what a game like this is supposed to be about. That said, sometimes they got overly verbose for details that didn't matter. 90% of the game is reading text and it could have been paced out better with a little more combat and exploration. Even Planescape: Torment wasn't as heavy on the text-adventure aspect as this is. Combat - Combat isn't quite as bad as some people are saying. It isn't a great though and the Crisis system can get buggy. With the relatively few combat encounters there are, and the fact that you can talk your way out of most of them, players may feel like they rarely get to use their combat abilities and thus character progression feels a bit empty. Much the same goes for all of the Cyphers, which are unique one-time use items, but you don't get enough of a chance to actually use them. Skill System - The general idea of the skill system is pretty good. The way they implimented it, however, probably makes the game a bit too easy. With investment in Intellect based skills, Edge points, plus the ability to use your companions to help with skills, it is easy to pretty quickly get to a point where skill checks are no longer a challenge. With a few exceptions, after the beginning it's possible to breeze through most of the game's skill checks regardless of your character build. Needs to be rebalanced with more risk and limitation. Tides - This is one of the most interesting and flavorful aspects of the game. The way that your choices determine your tides and the world subtly reacts is pretty well done. My one complaint about the tides is that I wish there were more explicit ways you can use them in gameplay. With a few exceptions, the tides are just a display of the morality of your actions and are not as reactive as they sold it to be, within a given playthrough. The subtle effects of the tides do show more across multiple playthroughs though. Companions/NPCs - Aside from Rhin and maybe Castillege, the companions don't feel as fleshed out as they could be. There is a significant lack of companion interaction, party banter, and voice acting in general. The game also pretty much encourages you to choose a team in the first area and stick with it, and there's no going back to the first area once you leave. There are no mid or late game companions. The lack of NPC portraits also takes away from immersion. Also, unlike Planescape: Torment, most non-quest-related NPCs can't truly be interacted with, they just show one liners above their head if you click them. Basically, I think the game has a lot of cool ideas and potential, but they just didn't flesh it out as much as they could have, or they gutted their own ideas a little too much to a point where quite a few features that were either promised or that actually existed in earlier iterations of the game ended up being left out entirely (including: NPC portraits, more voice acting, more companions, two or three more game areas that could have easily added 10-20 more hours of content, and so on). That makes the game feel a little empty or over streamlined.With all of that criticism, I still would recommend the game because it is still a unique experience, it has a unique setting and story, and it has its share of flavor. In some basic ways, they did capture the feel of Torment, they just could have refined it more instead of putting time and money into making it a console port and over streamlining content. I also am holding out hope that there will be future patches and add-ons that make up for at least some of the criticism.			"

I would not recommend this game if you are looking for a more combat oriented game like Baldur's Gate. There is a lot to read and explore in the game. I did spend some 30+ hours on my first playthrough, but I did explore everything I found.			"

												The world is engaging and the characters are interesting I happily emursed myself in the game world exploring the deep history and interesting resource system. The combat for the most part isn't very challenging or interesting and lacks most strategic depth with certain attacks and abilites being obviously better in almost every situation. Having said that I still enjoyed it, and the process of trying to manage your resources in combat so you still have something to work with to complete tasks felt added a slight tactical wrinkle. (Having said that with solid character building that can be all but eliminated.) The focus of this game is story, and building an interesting setting and exploring ideas, I believe it succeeded on those fronts. As such I would recomend it to anyone interested in an interesting and engaging story and game world.			"

												An interesting RPG that has a great amount of spirit taken from its predecesors accompanied with some welcomed enhancements. The story got a bit tedious at the end, the Desu Ex style of press a button to choose an ending didn't really do it for me. I have to say that keeping all the mares till almost the end before activating them makes them (IMHO) very boring after 2 or 3. Didn't see them impact the game much, maybe a few lines of dialog so overall I didn't like the gameplay that they contributed. Worth the time invested, was an interesting experience but defiantly pick this one up when it's on sale, full price i think is not worth it. Maybe when it is closer to 30$/€.			"

												This is really an amazing game, and in my opinion it really catches the spirit of Planescape:Torment, which I loved. The atmosphere is fantastic, the characters are deep and believable, the world is enigmatic and invites to be explored. I'm not really sure if I like this Crisis-system and the round-based combat, this seemed to be better in the original Torment, but that's just a minor flaw if you ask me. Can't understand why so many people are so negative about this game, did you really expect some kind of copy of Planescape with a different story? Anyway, I would advice everybody who likes text-based RPGs to give this game a shot, it's worth it as far as I'm concerned.			"

												This game takes place in a world that kept me going ""oooh"", ""aaah"" and ""what is THAT"" constantly, and this is coming from someone who has read/watched/played dozens of different fantasy/sci-fi worlds.The Ninth World is alien, strange, wonderous, and the amazing writing makes it real. Every area has its own set of characters, creatures, structures, landmarks, quests, etc. I almost never bother with sidequests in any game, and on my first playthrough I did 90% of them - and was rewarded in more ways than one.Most (if not all) quests offer interesting thoughts and some tough dilemmas that will make you ponder on the ""right"" answer before you choose an action, and even after you do, you might wonder if it was the best of all decisions.The game mechanics are easy to get and offer customization for each character class, allowing for different playthroughs with significantly different abilities.While I did play the original Planescape: Torment, I don't bother comparing it to this one because, quite frankly, it's pointless. I was 17 when I played it (more than a decade ago!), it took place in a different world, with a different system, and different writing team and standards. The first of the series was great, unique game, but the only thing you can possibly compare to the newer one is the writing, and even that is a case of ""apples vs oranges"".My only complaint is that the turn-based combat is a bit too slow due to the AI taking very long to act. The mechanics work fine, but the speed could be better. Not enough to make me dislike the combat, but enough to note it.			"

												This is actually a complex game to rate, as there are a number of positives and negatives. So, without further ado, let's start by the positives: - The setting and ruleset: This one will look like a negative, but it's actually a positive. Numenera, the tabletop RPG, sells itself as innovative both in terms of settings and rules. Sadly, it is not, in either case. That is not to say it is a bad RPG in any way. It is not. It just oversells its “science-fantasy” setting, when it is really just fantasy with an interesting makeover.In the same sense, while it attempts to portray itself as an avant-garde, alternative game, which favors roleplaying and exploration, it is basically a simplified D20 RPG with pretentious names, not getting even close to real RP-heavy settings, such as FATE, or even WoD. Although I do realize this makes the game look very bad, it isn’t. It just isn’t what it attempts to sell itself as.Those issues, however, doesn’t affect the PC game. The rules, which aren’t really that good for a P&P game, work really well on the PC, and the setting translated very well for the electronic media. I was actually quite impressed.- The theme and mood: as stated above, the setting clicked very well with the engine used, and it oozes with character. In this one regard the game succeeds greatly in doing its stated purpose of being a rebirth of Planescape: Torment, with interesting scenarios and exotic NPCs.- The plot: although only the beta has been released so far, and only for backers like me, it was easy to see that the story is well written and woven in the game itself.And now, sadly, we move to the bad:- Your companions: in a nutshell, many of them are bland at best, and tremendously annoying at worst. While I did like some of those, the game starts poorly, by not letting you have both the real interesting ones, which are clearly the most relevant to the story, with you at the same time. I can only hope that this changes as the story progresses, but I am not optimistic about it. The glowing Glaive (that is a warrior, for the not overly pretentious RPG players) is one of the most annoying NPCs I ever had the displeasure of having on a party, and that includes James Vega! Which brings us to two related issues…- No romance: for some insane reasons, Numenera forbids you from having romance options. While this stance is forgivable on games such as Tyranny, where every NPC either hates you or is terrified of your very shadow, or Pillars, which basically had only the most superficial interaction with your companions – to name recent examples – Numenera, in theory at least, is a game about your interactions and relationships. And now the game intends to tell you that, in a game about interpersonal relationships, there can be no romance?This is probably the (second) worse sin this game committed, and the one that made me want to ask for my Kickstarter money back, if that were possible. Let me be clear: I am not talking about sex scenes. I believe we all had more than enough claynimation sex scenes with Mass Effect and Dragon Age. However, the lack of romance in a game about RPing is not only prudish and a little schizophrenic, but a real offense to the sensibilities of any reasonable human being, who knows that, in a tightly knit-group of people working a living together, romance is almost certain to bloom. This was the main deal breaker for me personally, and it wasn’t even the worst problem with the game. That would be…-Misrepresentation: one could call it more simply, lies. As I said, one of the main issues with the game are the either annoying, irrelevant or simply uninteresting companions that can join you in the game. That might have not been a problem if only there were more of them. Sadly, in a one-sided decision by inXile, they decided to cut one third of the possible companions in the game, and two of the most interesting ones at that!Added to that, many features were cut, such as crafting. And to put the cherry on top, the company was “unable” to inform the players about said changes, only doing so a few weeks before release.Unfortunately, despite the game’s no irrelevant qualities, I find myself unable to recommend it to other players.

												It seems like there is a lot of hate directed at the game, mostly from backers, and it mostly boils down to tantrums about this not being a PST reboot.Honestly, I found the game quite enjoyable.  It has an intriguing (I am fairly certain that I misspelled that, but I am seriously not going to be bothered to spell check it - or anything else for that matter - so deal with it) game world, it has interesting quests and solutions.  Furthermore, to be quite honest, it is a bit of fun playing a RPG where you can actually avoid combat in almost all instances.  Does this make it an adventure game as some suggest?  Why?  What is the core concept behind a RPG - that there has to be combat? For reals now?  It is an RPG.  It gives you the choice - you can fight, or not, its up to you.The game breaks away form most RPG convetions, which also seems to be causing a lot of tantrums, which I dont fully understand.  Should every RPG include the same 6 stats?  What is the big hub-hub about something different?I find this game refreshing and interesting.  It does not adhere to all the norms of C(conventional)RPGs.  It took me some time to get used to it, and to be honest, several hours in, some of it still feels slightly odd, but I can live with it.On another note, unlike Pillars, the game has had me laugh a lot more.  There is a bit of humour in there.			"

												I was a huge Fan of Planescape Torment and considered it the best written story in a game for the PC.  Planescape Torments charm came not only from it's narrative but also from it's characters and who they interacted wtih the world, and with each other.Torment Tides of Numenera had some huge shoes to fill!   Tides of Numenera just about fills those shows.  Does the game feel like Planescape Torment?  Yes it does right down to the ending.Torment Tides of Numenera is a Really Great RPG and one that is worth reading, I mean taking.   For what the game is it's done really well, it's very tight story.   Could it be better?  Yes of course it could be better but what they accomplished is really good.  The story is fantastic right to the end.  You will find yourself invested in the game and you will end up making some pretty tough choices through out the story.The characters all have unique stories and personalities.   The Battles which are called Crises all of different ways of reaching the goals.It's pretty wild world with a Giant Transdimensional Organism as one of it' stars.I really recommend Torment Tides of Numerna if you are a fan of Planescape Torment.  If you love fantasy and scifi I would recommend playing the game just to go through the story.Let's see this world expanded more with a Torment Tides of Numera 2.			"

												""Torment: Tides of Numenera"" is a game that is not for everyone.There's a lot of reading, so if you're illiterate, I tell you here and now, stay away from this title.Many people will find the combat system is not to their liking, and there are plenty of other aspects to this game which the vast majority will complain and wine about, as this is a game that does not fit into their perfect world view of what they perceive as a quality purchase.I personally enjoyed this game quite completely.I experienced no issues with running the game.I had no qualms about the combat, on the few occasions where I felt fighting was necessary or perhaps unavoidable.I enjoyed the artwork and the graphical style, though I longed for more detail, the abstract nature of the models and descriptive text presented in game, gave my imagination room to breath and expand.I found delight in the main story and side stories and interwoven events that made me feel as though my choices actually mattered, rather than having those choices just lead to the same result as in similar games.YOU may not enjoy this game. YOU might even hate this game and regret purchasing it.However YOU! Yes YOU, in the back there, standing and staring blankly off into space.You're going to play this game and come away feeling satisfied and a little thrilled.You are like me, but not exactly like me.YOU should try ""Torment: Tides of Numenera"" for yourself.No, not you... I was talking to the other guy... girl... over ther-- oh they're gone.Nevermind. This game is not for everyone.			"

Not in a long time have I dedicated all of my ""gaming"" time to a single title and enjoyed every moment of it. I particularly liked that I did not feel the need to reset or reload any saves to try alternative actions, I was more than happy to see where my path took me.The result? One of the most memorable gaming experiences.			"

												This is one of the best roleplaying games of last 10 years, I would say.The spirit of good old Planescape: Torment is alive. Most of the game consists from reading and choosing from different options none of which are usually 'good' or 'bad'. Combat is probably the most boring part of the game but it is generally avoidable (it is possible to avoid all fights in the game completely depending on your playstyle and skills).Overall, 10 of 10 sorrows.

												I was a backer and have now completed the game. I consider it a worthy successor to Planescape: Torment. The game system:The effort system works a lot better for this kind of story than AD&D 2nd ed did. It's easy to pick up, and you are forced to choose when to invest resources in a particular outcome, and how companions can aid you. It's okay as a tactical combat simulator; not the best, but this game isn't really about combat, and combat was frankly the weakest part of Planescape.The story:I think it was better told, and coalesced nicely with some things illuminating what came before and some just being side stories, and it not being immediately obvious which was which. I think the philosophical message/underpinnings were a little clearer in Planescape, but Numenera feels a little more personal, and better at the gradual reveal of the true story going on. Stability:Pretty good. Once or twice a combat would go a little wonky and a character would lose their turn, but otherwise I played for 20+ hours and didn't crash or run into any noticable bugs. Graphics:For an isometric game, it's beautiful. The different areas have a strong sense of art direction and consitency, and the words used to paint the rest of the picture did the job admirably. I never felt that everyone was speaking stupid because it was a video game.On the whole, I give it a strong thumbs up. It tells an interesting story, has gameplay that forces you to make interesting decisions, and doesn't overstay its welcome.			"

												A true successor to Planescape:Torment. Brilliant writing, astounding locations, epic story.After Pillars of Eternity, I thought modern games had degraded my attention span to under two sentences. I just could not bear the amount of text the game threw at me. But Torment just showed me wrong. It has even more text, but all of it is engaging and interesting, never dull.combat is so-so, animations and character models rather bad.			"

												A very ""Torment"" experience. Combat is much better than in the original Planescape: Torment (where it was adapted from dungeo-crawling AD&D 2 and never felt right). Texts are plentiful. Locations are exotic.The companions, probably, not as good as ones in PT, but then again, I only ever really like Morte and his jokes. The game is shorter than PT, but this might be actually good, because this kind of games wears you down a little with lack of diversity in activities (a lot of reading, and a bit of fighting).All in all, this is a good game, probably deserving of ""Best writing"" award for 2017, though probably not ""Game of the Year"". It is also an experiment in moving the gameplay balance away from combat toward dialogues and other interactions with NPCs. As an experiment, it is not enirely successful, but not a complete failure either. It's an opposite or Action RPG, where there is so much combat that it tires you out quickly. Here, sometimes you wish for talking to stop and fighting to start.			"

												add me to the thumbs up crowd. i loved planescape, and this is an excellent follow up. there is tons of reading, there are mysterious objects that i carried around the whole game waiting for when they would be the exact thing i needed, there are companions with  pretty decent plot lines, who are distinct from each other. i finished the game today, and i immediately started on it again with a different character. even in the first couple scenes there is enough difference in the play throughs for me to be happy to play again.my only complaint: compared to the elder scrolls games it's short. ;)the game was super stable on my pc (i had to tab out a lot and it handled it very well), and i found no bugs. i hope these folks continue to make these games. i will continue to buy them.

												Finished the game in ~22 hours doing every side quest I came across. The first 1/3 of the game is amazing 10/10 but each successive chapter gets a little worse. The ending was a bit of a let down. The diaglogue trees, exploration of memories and interactions with the usable artifacts and oddities were the best parts of the game, the sluggish combat and complete lack of difficulty where the primary drawbacks.If you want to play an interactive novel in an a very detailed and well crafted world the Torment is a great choice though it falls short of similiar titles Wasteland 2 or Pillar of Eternity.All in all a solid game even if it didn't live up to all the hype and promises from its Kickstarter.

												Reminiscent of Planescape: Torment, Torment: Tides of Numenera is an excellent story driven rpg. For me the most important aspect of an rpg is the developers ability to bring the world to life, this game excells in this respect with a creative, original setting and well written, varied characters. The setting is also well drawn.The isometric camera works as well as in other games of this type.Reflecting the balance of the game, the combat system is less complex than in some other games of this type, such as Pillars of Eternity. This feels appropriate given the greater emphasis on non-combat solutions.Playtime was 39 hrs for my first complete playthrough, which is probably a bit of an overestimate and is less than some other games but nevertheless felt like good value given the lack of tedious ""fetch 10 of X"" style quests and time wasting filler combat.Much of my enjoyment came from the text which made me lol on several occasions and the game would be less well suited to those who don't like reading in games.

												An amazing game. So many things to read, to do, to look at. I absolutely love the writing, the characters, both companions and regular NPCs are fascinating to listen to. There are several options for almost everything. Combat is rare and almost always avoidable. One fight most of my group was fighting while one member was working on ending the fight in a different way.The world itself is great, I love getting tidbits of information about the wider world, even things that are not in the game.While in a way completely different, the game still reminds me of Age of Decadence (which has way harsher combat) and Shadowrun Returns (which is more linear) in that they are all heavily driven by lore.My main complaint would be the subpar interface. How far can you walk? Move your mouse very far away instead of showing markers whenever you are moving in combat. And of course the markers have a delay. Sometimes companions block interaction spots and you have to zoom. And sometimes interactions and movements feel sluggish. But it's not enough to make it a bad experience. Just an annoyance sometimes.			"

												Having played BG1 a handful of times and BG2 so many times I lost count I have been watching this game with high anticipation since it was announced on kickstarter.  I'm ~27 hours into the game at this point and am close to the end and have been having an absolute blast playing it.  My first run I chose a non-combat character to learn as much of the lore as possible and it really is one of the best I've seen in a game - the story and setting are incredibly interesting and the writing is also top notch.  I will be playing a more combat oriented character in my next game, and to be fair there are a few points that I feel might turn people off:[list[ Combat seems like to needs a little work - don't get me wrong it is fun, and I do love turn based combat systems, but something seems to be missing.  Good news is devs have announced improvements mad to it in an upcoming patch Tidal Surges - this seems like an amazing concept yet feels tacked on - I've barely had a chance to use tidal surges throughout the game and am unsure what this really adds to the game (maybe for the ending?).It really is a fun game though, and very much brings me back to the glorious settings of the old BG series.

												*** Yes, but set your expectations accordingly ***I'll adress this review in particular to fans of this game's spritual predecessor, Planescape Torment.While it would be unfair to call this a bad game, it does feel like a shadow of what it could have been, to say nothing of how it stacks up against the masterpiece whose legacy it was trying to live up to, Planescape Torment.While the writing is mostly good throughout, I felt a distinct lack of the humour, quirkiness, and freshness of the title that this game is trying to imitate. It seems like this game is trying to hit many of the same keynotes that PST hit, but done without the same sense of confidence and originality. For as much as the game boasts about the word count in its script, I never felt as connected to any of my companions as I did to Morte or Fall from Grace. That's not to say that the characters your meet aren't interesting at all, but it seemed like the devs were more focued on breadth rather than depth as far as your interactions with other characters. This extends to the antagonists of the story, which felt drawn similiar yet less compelling than the antagonists of Planescape Torment.I think what the devs missed about Planescape Torment is that for all that game's (excellent) philisophical musings, they lost sight of the fact that some of the most memorable moments of that game were the humourous banter between your companions, the bizarre and quixotic situations you found yourself in. Remember getting sucked into a Modron Maze, or engaging in philosphical debates with a reformed succubbi in a brothel for quenching intellectual lusts? None of that here, I felt as if the game takes itself too seriously ( or more likely didn't have the dev time) for such interesting diversions.There is a distinct lack of polish throughout. While the digitally painted backgrounds for the most part are creative with a wonderful sense of art direction, I wish I could say the same for the character models and sound design. I also find it odd that there's no option to customize the look of your character aside from choosing a gender, and the lack of character portraits for the people you're talking to in dialogue seems a strange omission.

												I kickstarted this game many years ago and my name is on a gravestone! I have finished the original torment numerous times and I am a big fan.TToN is good but not great. I finished the game in ~18 hours and I believe I finished most of the side quests. I had a great time playing it so I do recommend it.Don't expect to be playing a game as good as the original Torment. Even side by side, today, the original is better. This shouldn't be a mark against TToN though because it'd be damn near hard to beat the original Torment.Good:- Story is engaging, setting is interesting- Visually impressive - lots of cool things to see and each locale was unique- I thought the bar with the psychics was the coolest part of the game. Especially tracking down who wasn't real.- Lots of talking that I didn't feel like skipping through the majority of the time.- Many of the decisions I had to make had me umming and ahhing as I agonized over them- Companions have interesting stories that made me want to know more (Especially Rhin and Erritus)- Length of game was about right for me- Combat was well implemented. I think the difficulty was about right for the game - pretty damn easy- Lots of different ways to play, but I think the Int builds were the favoured path.- I didn't encounter any bugs and the game never crashed- A couple cool Torment throwbacks (particularly a person's name, and one of the characters in the psychic bar).Overall, what was keeping this game from greatness to me was not things it did wrong, but things it didn't do at all. I'm looking forward to any further entries in the franchise and I wish the developers the best of luck.			"

												TL;DR It's a good gameJust finished my first playthrough with a diplomatic character. The story is interesting, the characters well written (although there isn't as much interaction with them as I'd like) and there's plenty of approaches to problems. There are ways of completing the game without pretty much any combat (which is good).A lot of my enjoyment came from exploring a completely unknown world - I am not sure how well it will hold up over multiple playthroughs. I also didn't feel there were that many quests I wanted to go back to, to do them differently.			"

												So far Torment seems like a very well written story driven game that makes me feel like I am playing a highly immersive choose your own adventure book. It creates a world that is very unique and interesting while fostering mystery and intrigue. It seems to take the role-playing part of being an RPG to the next level while including some cool mechanics to give it a twist. Having options to resolve an encounter instead of just mowing down the baddies is very interesting. If you want something different from the traditional RPG, this could be a good pickup.			"

												I never played Planescape Torment all the way through until some time last year. Until that point it had taken me several times to get passed the first hour. The game is dense for lack of a better word. And while the reading can be fun, it can also be laborious and confusing, particularly in the early game.Somehow. Somehow, I made it past the heavy intro and was rewarded with one of the best experiences RPGs have to offer, but I could understand why the game was so critically acclaimed and hardly played.Before I continue, I'll give the impatient folks the quick rundown. Should I buy this game? If you don't mind reading, and are open to interesting stories without the need for action. If you're a fan of the Numenera setting. If you want an RPG you can soak in, or think about for a while. Then yes. If not, or if you're only halfway into any of those suggestions, then no.The Torment series, which is what it is now, is defined by wordy texts and heady philosophy. They aren't RPGs as you may think of them, so much as they are adventure games with RPG mechanics. They also exist in bizzare settings and are not easy to get through. Not because of any mechanical challenges, but rather the literary challenge of committing time to read these things. They have more in common with the kind of narrative games you see in Japan than Mass Effect or the Witcher, which is to these game's credit in my opnion.There are bugs, but all RPGs have bugs. The bugs in my playthrough happened twice, and it was nothing a simple reset couldn't solve. I think I lost 3 minutes of gameplay at most.The combat is interesting, but could use some tweaks to make it more palatable. It's infuriating trying to move around the game world, or figuring out distances. Often a lot of effects and abilities are going off at once and there's no combat log to help you get a handle on things. It uses the Pillars of Eternity engine, which is already a cluster of nonsense checks and balances. Thankfully the largess of these combat additions aren't so important as to break the game, and combat happens very rarely.In fact, if you take a moment to pause and assess the situation before engaging in the ""crises"", you'll find an easy solution if brute force isn't working. Which is wonderful because it's very easy to have a team of completely useless combatants.In the end it's technically better than Planescape's combat, but also more challenging, and not always in a good way. Still, Planescape could use with much less combat, which Torment has learned from.As far as the story goes, I had a hard time getting into a lot of the text, as has been stated before, it's DENSE, and not always in a good way. Planescape was wordy as well, but there was an interesting terseness to it that drew you in, where Torment mistakes synonyms for artfulness. It's not amateurish, but it gets in the way often.Numenera also deals with complex situations and weird hard sci-fi, and the dev team went with the terrible interperetation of the setting where you have weirdness for weirdness sake. Nothing can ever just BE a thing without it needing a paragraph of complicated text describing a single object. Numenera as a setting works better when it's like Samurai Jack, Adventure Time, Star Wars or Rick & Morty. Settings where you're presented with alien worlds, but the functionality of those worlds is simple enough to follow along.Your companions are interesting, though not as charming as the ones in Planescape, though I'd blame that on the post-9/11 focus on darkness and cyncism that creeps into all writing nowadays. Nothing can ever be dark with levity, it's either insipid Joss Whedon immersion breaking smarm or overwrought seriousness, and Torment leans on the latter. In the end I'd like to learn more about them, as the ones I did get to know more I did like, but couldn't interact with on the level of the companions in Planescape. If some companions were cut to make the ones we got deeper, then I'd rather the dev team cut even more, even though all the fanboys are crying because one or two of them didn't wind up in the final cut.I remember spending an entire weekend afternoon going through the book of Zerthimon in Planescape. THAT is how you do a companion quest. The companion stories in Torment sort of flit in and out and never really solidify or change in a meaningful way. I remember the devs talking up how companions may come and go, and while the first two (Castillege and Aligern) have an interesting parting of ways, I never felt like my companions would ever really leave my side, though two of them did wind up leaving at the very end before the final fights for good and well written reasons.Now that all the complaints are out of the way, I felt Numenera was well worth my time, and I'd say it's the best of the inXile/Obsidian retro callback games they've been working on (Wasteland 2, Pillars, Tyranny, etc). I'll probably play it again some day after the updates come through.I did back this game during the kickstarter, and I did enjoy myself, and I did get my money's worth. But it's easy to think about how this game could be better. That and the requirement to actually READ and not simply mash buttons to see violence is probably this games biggest detractors for a lot of people. It isn't perfect, but then again there isn't a single great RPG that is. Not Earthbound, Planescape, Morrowind, Baldur's Gate or Vampire: the Masquerade Bloodlines. And now Torment will join the ranks of RPGs with great storylines that no one will play because reading makes them feel icky and also there are sometimes bugs. :P			"

												Sigh. I really wanted to love it. I did enjoy quite a few parts of it. But in the end the feeling it left me with was disappointment. It feels unfinished, its concepts barely more than a sketch. A good start leads to a rushed and uninteresting ending. The majority of characters elicit no emotions from you whatsoever, they are actors in an incoherent drama you don't really care about. Some of them don't even enjoy a luxury of having a discernable personality. And as some people pointed out: a lot of text doesnt necessarily mean good writing. And yes - it is a spiritual successor to original Torment, that can't be denied. Unfortunately, the only thing which it failed to inherit is the original's quality. A game with great potential which it succeeded to fulfill only partially. I'm pressing a recommend, only because there are few if any similar games out there. That, however, does not mean that this one meets the expectations it had set for itself.			"

												I didn't want to invest much time in a RPG, expecially not reading much. Initially I wanted just the experience class advancement and combat but I found myself reading the gazillion words describing the world, objects, characters, etc... not only that, but also avoided almost all combat maxing out everything knowledge related skill so I could exhaust every bit of detail of the world. I admit that not being able to customize my castoff (not that it mattered in-game) plus its origin made it feel disposable, but thankfully I was able to click with Rhin and Matkina (I ended up being 100% Gold Tide) and was content on having them around while working on giving them a happy end. Couldn't care less for all other companions. Fighting was slow, didn't like that. Would have liked to see more of it. Try it, if you don't like it within the first hour get your refund.			"

												If you like powergaming, min-maxing, and really looking at the numbers, you probably won't like this game as much as other CRPGs, but if you liked the original Torment for its story, you'll undoubtedly like this one too. Go into it without knowing anything about it and it'll be a good experience.			"

												KS backer.  Enjoying so far. No bugs.  Good writing and engaging story, although not quite as good as PS:T.Fully SJW converged.    Most characters in military leadership/fighting positions are women? check.   Male NPC casually mentions gay lover? check.   Get physically overpowered by female NPC? check.   Sidequest of creepy male stalker? check.Needs moar Morte.			"

												Absolutely amazing game. I was early backer and yes game had it's highs and lows through developement and yes there was some content that was cut. Game developement isn't just so straight forward process, it could be handled better but in the end I think we got a great game. I've played a lot of PnP Numenera and they just nailed the 9th World atmosphere. Story and characters are great, every NPC has nice background and you'll have walls and walls of text to read and immerse yourself in fantastic world of Numenera. Other thing is exploration, explore everything, tinker with stuff you find, try to find out how it works and what you can do with it if it works (or if it doesn't!). I didn't feel like any location was empty and bland, every map has some depth to it. Personally those things were by far most important for me.Combat still feels clunky and they are currently working on fixing freezes and crashes. That said I didn't had any problems except one game crash while I was in comat crisis. Note that this isn't combat oriented game in any means, if you go with pacifist playthrough expect something like 3-4 fights, if you want to play more agressive cast off, expect something like 15-20 or so. Other than that, I would really love to see more of everything, more cities, more maps, more foci. I can't say that this game doesn't have it's flaws, but if you like slower paced RPGs and if you like game full of flavorful characters please give it a try.If I had to give this game some rating I think it would be 8/10, it really hit the spot for me. With some work on combat, additional reactivity to your choices, more maps (mostly cut Oasis of M'ra Jolios), more foci and some general polish this game would be easily 10/10 for me.			"

												I loved the game. It made full use of the Dying Earth setting to deliver a slew of strange concepts, which I found extremely stimulating. The writing was generally of a very high calibre, and even the descriptive text I found to be a cut above almost anything else in the RPG genre (c f Pillars of Eternity where a lot of the descriptive text and worldbuilding is awwwwwfffuuullly boring and should never have made it into a finished game - though it's a good game for other reasons). I liked the reactivity built into the interactions. I replayed Planescape Torment recently and something that bothered me was how there'd often be no recognition that you'd done or learnt something. For example, I'd be well into the Clerk's Ward, having done every quest I could, and still have the exact same conversation with Pox outside the Mortuary, asking who the Dustmen are and what they believe. From what McComb said in one of the streams, this may have been a casualty of technical problems with the engine. Numenera had excellent reactivity - if I'd learnt something related to one character or which might be relevant to a quest, I'd usually have an option to bring it up in conversation in NPC interactions. Consequently, it was very easy for me to look at the situation the Last Castoff was in, think 'How would I deal with this?' or 'What would I want to know if I were in the Castoff's position?' and explore the resultant avenues of inquiry.It's probably fair to say I was most interested in the setting and writing behind the individual quests, which is where the game was strongest. Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun is one of my favourite literary works of all time, and Jack Vance's Dying Earth isn't far off (honourable mention to Michael John Harrison's Viriconium - Harrison is, much like Wolfe, a technical writer par excellence). The thing I most would've wanted that the game didn't give? More! And by that, I don't mean that the game is short - I don't know exactly how long it took me; my recorded gameplay time is just under 43 hours, but I spent quite a bit of time with the game open in the background while I was doing other stuff, so I'd estimate I'm in the mid-30s for game time, which is not short. What I mean is I loved the world and quest writing so much, I'd love to have played a sprawling, Baldur's Gate 2 length game, seeing all of the weirdness that the Ninth World has to offer. But I understand this would be beyond budget and not worth the return on sales. Anyway, the game's flaws don't feel so significant to me.I can see how they would turn someone else off the game, however. Combat was flawed, for example - not irredeemably bad, but with faults in execution such as the time taken for turns, and poor encounter design. The central storyline was also not great. It didn't feel like the game's primary antagonist related particularly well to the game's purported theme, nor was it well-developed. I think the inadequate attention paid to the Sorrow is probably the biggest failing of the game's writing. An additional area to the game, in which you explore a location related to the Sorrow's origins, would have done a lot to remedy this, even if it wouldn't have fixed the direct role of the Sorrow in the story's central conflict.The Changing God was interesting and I thought dealt with well. Possibly more could have been done with him, but he's a concept which could be pushed in so many directions, and there's so much that could be done, that it'd be very hard to look at any particular use of him and say that that use exhausted his concept or executed it perfectly. Some of the flaws other people experienced I did not find - for example, I liked the companions. Again, more could have been done with them, but what is there is not bad. The only one I did not care for too much was Tybir, who was simply too generic. He wasn't done badly, so that failing is no real knock on the game. I also liked the visuals. Sure, more animations would have been nice, particularly combat animations, but I thought the art style and colouring were vivid and evocative. To summarise my view on Numenera, considered alone: I liked it a hell of a lot, and it's probably my favourite RPG since the Witcher 3, and before that... Vampire Bloodlines? Arcanum? I'd put it comfortably above other relatively recent high quality RPGs like Pillars of Eternity and Fallout New Vegas, which I also enjoyed but didn't resonate on a deep level. The writing with respect to the individual characters and the setting are top-notch, even if the central story lacks in some respects, and earns the game a place in my pantheon of great videogame storytelling experiences.How do I think it compares to Planescape Torment? Having replayed that game recently: quite well! PST is a more coherent game, from a storytelling perspective, and that gives a good argument that it is better from a literary view, but I didn't think the setting was as fascinatingly varied and exotic, and the quests aside from the central storyline weren't as consistently engaging. Combat in PST was also, rather than being deeply flawed, fundamentally bad and odious. Character wise, PST has an edge, because each companion related thematically to the central storyline, though I found that the common thread of the binding nature of torment and suffering was a little relentlessly dour.On the whole, I'd say they're closely comparable in the level of enjoyment I derived from them. I suspect my view that they are comparable in terms of overall merit is premised on my affinity for Dying earth science fantasy settings over straight fantasy settings, even ones as strange as Planescape, so take that for what its worth.

												As I have never played the original game I just started without any prior knowledge (besides the basic stuff I read up about the world).At first I was very confused and couldn't get into the story at all. Too many strange words without explenation, confusing people, places. Etc. But the more I played the more I got into it, so much that I couldn't even stop playing this game. The story is really amazing, well written and executed. I can't imagine I ever read pure text in some side thing (Mere) that had nothing to do with the main story itself, but moved me deeply. Very well done.A warning anyway. This is a RPG with a lot of text. Really a lot of text. And text that needs to be read to actually understand what is going on. This is not an action heavy RPG. You can really skip, escape, avoid all battles. There is also not the ultra loot here. So shop interfaces are very simple because there is no need for more.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a deep great story with amazing art work and fantastic locations.If you came here because you played Pillars of Eternity, this is very different. The battles are turn based, there is not much loot and no vast areas to scout through some hidden artifacts.Came for the story, stayed for the story.Highly recommended. Will play it again.			"

												I do not usually write reviews on Steam but I think it's ridiculous that this game has a mixed rating right now. A lot of the complaints of people giving it a hands down are valid. However it is a game in a very unique world with great writing that can make you care even for minor characters.It isn't all people wanted it to be but it's enough to warrant a definite thumbs up.

												This game is full of amazing ideas and insane concepts, all packed into a condensed space. Though you probably know by now, only play this if you really are in the mood to read!It's one of those things that throws so much overlapping content at you that you'll feel overwhelmed until you realize you only really have to pay attention to the stuff that interests you (ala William Gibson or Cloud Atlas). The game emulates the world it creates: everything feels old (it is really retro) and confusing; like layers upon layers of unknown culture, you are often lost, but find ways of sorting out the problems by exploring.Gameplay wise, you mostly LISTEN in this game: talk to NPCs, learn about the world, solve quests. The combat is fine thanks to it being turn-based. Inventory management is minimal, as are most systems not related to dialogue (though it can be odd that, when you level up, you are often making precise decisions about things you will never use in the game at all). The ""pools"" system, like RPG stats that deplete based on checks that determine if you fail or succede, is novel.It's telling that many people's favorite part of of this game are what's called ""meres."" Essentially when the game strips everything else away and become a simple choose-your-own-adventure. At its heart, this game is a graphical representation of a very inventive paper & pencil RPG sourcebook, which a cool story running through it.Also: If you are a fan at all of Jack Vance, you should definitely pick this up!

												I've been waiting for this game since it was announced, and it was well worth the wait.The world is astoundingly detailed: everyone and everything has a meticulously crafted story.  In many places, those stories will intertwine with eachother, both on a short time-scale, and across chapters. The end result is that almost every decision you make feels important at some point or anothers.  From a mechanics perspective, the Tides are a refreshing change from black and white morality that has become so common in the past 15 years.  It leads to some interesting conversation paths, though there are times when it feels as if it was designed to have a bigger impact than it did.  The crisis system is also a novel new approach to combat.  The wide array of options in handling conflicts is incredibly unique, and led to interesting challenges.  It probably could have been featured more heavily, but the lack of  conflicts may have been due to my conversation-based playstyle in my first game.  The game does suffer a few minor issues, however.  I was absorbed in the game, but not as the player character.  So much of the game is about the world that the central character can slip your mind.  Another flaw is closely linked with the crisis sytem.  By focusing on alternate methods of conflict resolution, the violent approach feels less developed than similar RPGs. With the focus of this game being so far from combat, this doesn't feel too out of place.  Finally, the character models feel bland.  With one or two exceptions, your eyes slip away from the cast, and to the gorgous backgrounds.  The disparity between character and background visuals feels odd.All in all, this game was successful everywhere it needed to be to feel like an appropriate successor to Planescape: Torment.  The game could still use development in a few areas, and I expect that content updates in the future will help to improve on some of the problems.  It would be a real shame if the team doesn't create a follow up to fully marry the storytelling at which they've excelled with improvements to their core game.			"

												This is a really hard game to review because its both good and bad. The story and characters were good but it had a lot of downsides which I'm surprised were not fixed considering the game was in early access for so long.ConsBare minimum voice acting, even for companions.No diaogue portraits shown during conversations (can make it a bitconfusing who you are talking too, especially without voiceovers)No charactor customisation (aisde from clothing)No clothing customisation for compationsBuggy movementMissing Kickstarter promises.Considering the developement time and money this this game raised it kinda fell short of my expectations and cheaped out on some of it (like customisation, voice acting etc).  I can't help but feel that InXile have bitten of more than they can chew managing multiple projects (Wasteland 2, Bards Tale and now Wasteland 3) and it had a negative effect on this game.Saying all that I enjoyed playing it so am not going to leave a negative review, just don't expect it to be worth the £34.99 asking price or as good as Wasteland 2 if you know what I mean. I'd say its a £20 game as it stands so worth waiting for the price to go down and some of the bugs to be fixed. "

Early Access Review
								I finished the first act in the current beta and I wanted to share my thoughts with the community. Now I am a long time favorite of games like Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale + pretty much all other RPG's, but I never played Planescape Torment - unfortunately, so I was excited to try this alleged successor to what many claim to be the best RPG of all time.First of, this game is different in the sense that it is a true rpg - meaning that you can actually avoid combat pretty much all together through diplomacy, threats and deception. Now to some, I imagine that might feel boring, but to me its really a treat to be entertained in an old-school kind of way. It feels like you are living in an excellent book, where your choices matter. Its also sci-fi fantasy, so don't expect to find much in terms of familiarity in neither the world itself or its inhabitants. Sure there are a few kinks here and there - but nothing gamebreaking, however the lack of character customization seems disappointing.I would recommend this game to people who enjoyed a game like Pillars of Eternity for its writing - not the combat. You absolutely have to enjoy lots and lots of complex reading, so if you are a 'big words hurt my brain' kind of person, then you will probably not like this game at all. There are no fancy coup de grace killcam animations and the actual combat feels underwhelming, but I like to think of it this way; I may find the♥♥♥♥♥of a baboon ugly, but I still like to watch it sway in the brisk wind ...Rating: 4/5			"

												Having played Planescape: Torment many times, and with all the information I had about Torment: Tides of Numenera prior to the game released, I had the highest expectations when I bought this. Although not as great as Planescape: Torment I still think it's a good game with a good story. One of the main differences is the main character, the last castoff, that - unlike Planescape: Torment - isn't the main focus of the story and is more of a tool/vessel whom the story unfold around. The game is more 'a' journey than 'my' journey. The roleplaying game is toned down and the emphasis is on the narrative. The companions, with a few exceptions, feels less likable and interesting compared to those in Planescape: Torment. I wish the developers had dared to go further with their imagination in the creating process.Very nice graphics. I loved it. Sagus Cliff, the Bloom...beautiful, fascinating. Characters, for example the last castoff, is unfortunately quite ""robotic"" and the visual effects of spells/effects on characters a bit annoying after a while.Music is great, especially in the beginning - ambient - though there were an overall lack of songs that stood out, like ""Fortress of Regrets"" in Planescape: Torment. Sound effects are sometimes too prominent.Many of the quests and sidequests are even better than those in Planescape: Torment. Lots of different ways to solve them with lots of different results.    New system for skills, abilities and fighting. I like it and I think it's promising. The biggest problem is that it's too easy. In the beginning of the game it's ok but quickly the challenge disappears. You fail a skillcheck because you choose to (can sometimes give interesting results), not because you run out of skillpoints.  8/10Knowing what I know now, do I regret buying it at full price? No.Will I buy any expansion in the future? Yes. "

Is it fun...well that depends on you.  If you  like a great story with an acid trip background, and can forgive it's rpg and combat short-comings, then look no further this game is for you.If you want another Pillars of Eternity or Divine Divinity Original Sin look elsewhere....as this is not it.I like it!

Posted: March 1
												Hello all,I am early in the game and from what I could see, the game is good, but not good at the same time.I am really hesitating between recommanding and not recommanding the game at the same time.First, the game is gorgeous, you can't say they didn't make a great work there, the pillars of eternity engine is certainly great (though I would have liked some coop like baldur's gate).Then the story, the story is certainly worth it, it is really well written, intriguing and you really want to go deeper into it.The narrative is certainly the strongest point of the game with some stuff I could argue about like the change of scenery coming out of nowhere which in game is only a story, you take a couple minute to get into and by the time you're into it, you're back in reality... Some game effects could have been added to make more immersion.Music and narration goes along with it, all pleasant and makes you want to hear more.The the mechanics, the gameplay, the combat system... Well, let's start by saying that turn based combat isn't bad, I personnaly like turn based when it is well made such as fallout 1,2 or more recently divinity original sin!BUT WHY OH WHY CHANGING THE MECHANICS SO MUCH??? The first torment was a blast combat wise... This one is really a deception... They threw away the D&D mechanics relative to the Torment universe to create a really poor system with 3 stats (might, speed and intellect) which form a ""pool"" from which you can drain points to perform successful actions or having a chance to fail them... Meaning, if you make a warrior, you will have high might and most likely succeed your might test all the time until your might goes down to 0 ! (example if you have 9 in might, you make an action and decide to spend 3 points to succeed it, you will have 6 left in might until you can replenish it)The system is horribly bad, just like the cyphers which are kind of like a one time use magic object.Going away from the classic D&D rule set is the biggest mistake they made, they should have conserved it even if it would cost more to have the right to use them! Which also did cost them the class system which is down to the nano (the mage/mechanic), the jack (jack of all trade, master of none, kind of rogue) and the warrior, well, what's more to say about it? Master of weapons and armors.Heck, even taking the pillars of eternity system would have been better! It was their engine so why not take their combat system instead of this horrible pool system!Even by beeing a warrior with everything in might, if you empty your pool, you can fail a test... Same with the nano I am playing with right now.Finally, the interface is really blend and I would have appreciated to see the portrait of NPC you're talking to avoid confusion while reading a dialog between more than 2 characters because this ask you to be really attentive to each name popping during a conversation.The dialog window could have been made better to avoid the need to scroll down when making a choice.Appart from that, the game, the animations of the decor, the story, everything is great and is the reason why I would recommend the brilliant writing of the scenario... Don't play Tides of Numenera hoping to get a deep RPG system... The RPG is all about the story and what it will make you discover althought many already state the story feels short.Fort a 50$ game, this is quite a let down! I am finally glad I didn't back the game.The world while seeming quite alien is lacking of mystical creatures and npc like the modrone, the black knight, morte, Anna, Ignis... And all the fun, weird, original and deep characters which could travel alongside with you in the original game. They made us go back to something classic.			"

												Enjoyed the game.  If you can't bother to read and get into a story, this is not the game for you.Plenty of choices to be made, and they all seem to have repercussions later on.  This alone is awesome.I didn't have any issues at all with crashing/locking/whatever.  Game ran flawlessly for me thorugh dialogue and battles alike.For the folks with negative reviews - not having a name and the amnesia are part of the story, explained rather well near the end of the game.  If you have completed the game and have read stuff...Yes, you can largely avoid combat.  I avoided 90% I suppose?  The other 10% I was able to solve without slaughtering everything on the map (even during a battle there are ways to end it sooner with interactions and conversation).  I like this!  And you definitely could play it the other way, though I imagine things would be more difficult and drastically change the ending.I liked the followers, they all had their personalities.  Problem I ran into was the only character to completely level up before the end sequence was my own character, so there was no real opportunity to catch another one up to replace those who needed to leave late in the game.  Less of an issue I guess if you're not fighting your way through.  Perhaps fighting through affords more xp?I played Planescape: Torment.  The atmosphere is there.  I didn't hold some preconceived notion that this should be a sequel-better-than-original though.   It's its own game, review it on its own merits.As far as I'm concerned, this is a well done game and I very much enjoyed it. "

												  So a thumb up , as you cant rate the game. Thumbs up buts its really not a game for everyone, some of my friends stopped it just after a few hours completely bored by it ,i cant blame them.  Inxile are not really good at story stelling, 5 min into the game you know who you are and what is chasing you. Unlike the original torment keeping the mystery till the end. You are bombarded by wall of texts and cryptic stories , no idea how they relate to you , nor are those collections of shredded novels especially interisting  . Hard to make any sense of it until later.Pages and pages to read without reasons, with barely any player input.Many will give up...    You should approach this game more like a classic adventure game than a roleplaying game.You character building doesnt matter , nothing is challenging,you will have plenty of points to succeed in everything.The game certainly lack of adrenaline and momemtum. The turn based combats are so tedious slow and lacking of strategic options you will try to skip them the most possible and use skill checks instead.The cherry on the cake is they sometime hard lock the game.However it has strong points, the unique and alien setting.It's a pleasure to explore those bizare, unstettling and gorgeous environements. I always appreciate when people try and dare new things, its a very strong point for me and mostly why i give a thumb  up . This is not dwarves&elves fantasy, its an alien multiverse  and in that way at least partially a successor of planescape torment.The writing is good, if the story telling is not, its a showroom for the numerama pen and paper rpg setting . You can get attached to the companions, especially rhinn and their side quests were a pleasure to complete. 20 hours only to finish it thats far below the classics , manys flaw indeed,years too late  but as a backer  cant say i feel scammed.Too small budget, likely inexperience of some members i guess. I would back a torment 2 if they could learn from their mistakes and read our feedback.			"

												In a word: wonderful. A true successor to the original Planescape: Torment. If you don't fear reading and prefer narrative and storytelling over gameplay in your RPG, this is the game for you. The turn-based battle system is a lot of fun, but if you're like me, you end up rarely using it. The game is at its best when you use your powers of persuasion to better connect with the characters you encounter. Two thumbs way up.			"

												Really liked Torment : Tides of Numenera.One of the things, most people criticize is, that it is too short.I don't think that thats the point, BUT after i finished the game, i wanted to seemore of the world, more characters more things mentioned in dialoges and so on.And that is a good thing, because it shows how much love and detail were put in the making of this game.Really hope there will be another game in the Numenera setting which shows more of this awesome world.It took me nearly 50 hours to finish the game and i did not see everything.Really recommend it.

												Buy it:- When you like games with a good complex Story - When you like to read.( You should love reading.) - When you like games with a unique settingDo not buy it:- When you expect Planescape Torment 2.- When you need an explosion every 0,5 sec. - Love to klick on stuff till loot ups up. Didn´t had a single cash, bug or freeze, which is sadly uncommon these days….    "

Early Access Review
								ok, wow, where to begin?  well, first off, i liked the story so far as ive seen.  it's an interesting concept and keeps my attention moderately well.  The sound track is good, and i enjoy elements of the gameplay, but...1)  the graphics are pretty awful.  I mean it, it honestly looks awful, even when comparing it to PST which this is supposed to be the successor to this game.  2)  Combat is a chore.  the few fights i actually had were pretty horrendous, the abilities were pretty pointless as you could only use it once or so and then its done for not just fights, but until you rest next.  it made combat really unsatisfying 3)  The overwhelming sheer quantity of bugs!  Ive played this game no more then two hours and have already ran across over half a dozen (already documented) bugs ranging from game crashes to freezing to simple things like the portraits vibrating weirdly when the mouse scrolls over them.  I know its in early access, but im barely into the game and already finding this many issues?  seems a bit ridiculous to me.4)  general lack of care for the characters.  When i first played PST, i instantly fell in love with one of the first characters you find.  He was unique, he was witty, and he was memorable.  The 3 companions i met so far ive played with and am trying to want to get to know, but they are just really really boring.  This might just be a judgement call on my part or a matter of taste, but they are by no means worth remembering or so much as caring about.don't get me wrong, i want to like this game.  i'm going to play it to completion (or as far along as completion goes for now), and if it changes my mind, i'll gladly rewrite this review with glowing reccomendation, but sadly, this game doesnt live up to half the example of PST.  If i were a potentially interested buyer, give this game a hard pass.  Its too late for me, but save yourselvesUpdate:  ok, as of the december 20th update, i need to revise some of my statements.  The graphics, while still lacking, are refined and look a little better.  Combat actually feels fun now that it doesnt cost ALL your ability points to use an ability once or twice, and i actually ran through the game with only minor hiccups and bugs, nothing game breaking or disheartening.  Still dont care bout all the companions, but thats more that you dont get to explore their backgrounds.  They may not have an instant eye catching appeal, but once you get used to them being around, they grow on you.  All in all, i still wouldnt reccomend the game for preorder but, maybe when its out february 28th 2017, it might be worth a try.			"

Posted: March 8
												I love RPGs in general and I have been looking forward to this game for several years. I regret that I didn't have the income to be able to back it when it was in its kickstarter phase as I would have loved to.  It claims to be a spiritual successor to Planescape: Torment and I think it delivers on that and then some. Here's my overall thoughts on the game.  The Good This game grips you right from the start and makes you start asking questions. What is the Sorrow and why does it hate me? What is the Changing God trying to do? What do all these memories mean? You learn over the course of the game answers to these and many more questions in such a great setting. The Numenera world is the first one since Planescape itself that makes me want to take up tabletop RPGs again. It's that interesting. You never know what is around the next corner from a mirror that kills you to Total Recall style mutants to a psychic bar and everything in between.I love how virtually everything in this game from the Crises to the quests themselves can be resolved in a multitude of ways that all feel meaningful. Failure isn't always bad necessarily as it often results in resolutions you never would have seen coming. When it comes to the skills and abilities, the developers have done more with less. There may not be a huge variety of abilities but there's enough that each choice you make feels meaningful and there are a wide enough variety of builds that even replaying as the same class doesn't mean you'll be the same castoff as before.On a technical aspect, I really enjoy being able to effectively choose which input style you want to play with. Most games seem designed with keyboard/mouse or controller in mind and seem extremely clunky with using the ""offhand"" input. This game not so much.  The Bad I get that this game is centered around dialogue and story but the combat is at best mediocre and at worst strait up boring. There are a lot of bugs with the heavily scripted fights in the second half of the game that was relatively untested compared to Sagus Cliffs crises that we got in the early access. Even when your UI doesnt lock up from the knockdown bug, there are a lot of pathing and pacing problems that make you want to go grab a drink until your next turn. Several fights seem to take longer than they should due to respawns in fight that make you want to ignore the fight and just beeline to the objective.There are also NUMEROUS bugs with the current release of the game. These vary from minor cosmetic things to the knockdown bug where you have to alt+f4 the game and restart to game saves being deleted entirely. I wish the developers had given early access the full game to test these kind of things out because I feel a lot of these bugs are going to hurt unless they're addressed soon.  The Ugly For all it's greatness, this game has its fair share of mediocrity as well. I'm a big fan of game music and still listen to PS:T soundtrack to this day. This game soundtrack will not be something I listen to very often. It's not bad, it's just not great either. Nothing stands out other than the tidal noises and opening theme.It also doesn't feel like any of the companions except Matkina seem especially memorable. Callistige is a pretty generic mage, Tybir is a pretty generic rogue, Aligern is a generic fighter (who happens to be a Nano, wtf?). Rhin is a complete waste of a slot until you get to tier 3 then she goes from zero to hero faster than a Disney film. I haven't used Erritis much but I didn't get anything more than a ""nuttier than squirrel turds"" vibe from him what little I used him. The banter is few and far between and generally unless prompted, once you talk to them the first time and ask everything, you won't need to talk to them anymore. I wish they had been more unique overall.Overall I think this game generally delivers where it matters and most of the failures are easily remedied or ignored and I will continue playing it for a long time. I hope you all will too!			"

								1Old Planescape:Torment fan as most here likely to be. Numera is a different world to Torment but indeed feels very familliar. Spoiler alert: Found O!. There are some references for the old dogs here and there and its grand. The game gives you multiple choices from the very beggining (your choices can kill you 2min into the game). So far only got 11h under my belt but loving it all the way. Still there are areas to improve on. Bugs in alpha stage are to be expected and the game needs polishing. One thing I am missing is the bestary from P:T where you could look up creatures and ncps you encountered and read up on them a bit.			"

												A true successor to the Legacy of Planescape: Torment. Well written, interesting, sometimes disturbing. It is not P:T. It does not try to copy it. It asks you - as P:T did - a question and waits for your answer.The only thing that I did not like is the crisis system. It is interesting but requires some polishing to be really good. A 7/10 here.Graphics - interesting, not great however, serves the purpose right - 8/10.Story - 10/10.Music - 9/10.Sound in general is nice but could have been better. Lacks some depth - 7/10.All in all - 9/10. If you play games for the stories that you exprience, for interesting characters, for amazing worlds that you may visit. This games has it all.If you focus mainly on mechanics, systems, stats - do not buy it as you will miss the whole point and will be left frustrated.			"

												It really is more of a gamebook than a game. In my walkthrough I passed every single skillcheck there was, I avoided almost every fight and those ones I could not avoid I lost without having to suffer for that. So there never was any feeling of challenge, it really was more like reading a book - but a very good one at that.As for the replayability: I finished the game yesterday and unistalled it immediately. Skillchecks are few and easy, I passed each and every one of them, finished every quest effortlessly - no, there is no need to replay the game at all.If you are looking for a game with great replayability try Age of Decadence, though be warned: It is more of a puzzle than a game as well.

												When a game that starts as a kickstarter to one of the more beloved RPGs of its time, Planescape: Torment, is announced, a certain amount of hype is created. That hype becomes bolstered by a wildly successful kickstarter campaign in which numerous additional funding goals are completed and a slew of content is promised as a result. When the dust settled, reality set in. Clearly the developer faced a series of unexpected issues when it came to realizing the vision of the Numenara setting and Monty Cook's Cypher system for the gameplay. Changes were made, content was removed and the game was released to much clamor and outcry, both from detractors and supporters. So the question is, how is the game?My playthrough of Torment last 36 hours and involved a ton of reading, talking my way out of fights and finally, learning how to fight. I found the setting to be engrossing and interesting and completely bizarre. They really managed to capture the insanity of the Numenara setting and in doing so, at least evoked some fond memories that I had for the Planescape setting and even the few novels that were written.The story itself is a fairly common one, the search for one's self. This is brought about through exploration, conversationa and the recalling of memories. Certainly the amnesia trope is a somewhat common one and it was mostly utilized here to good effect. While not anywhere near as engaging as the Nameless in Planescape, your character was still an interesting blank slate.Like most RPGs, this game contains a series of main story quests, side quests and even some companion quests. While the game does manage to avoid the ""go kill me 5 monsters and bring me their parts"", most of them are still fairly standard. I must admit I did enjoy moving about the various locales and seeing hot spots that could be manipulated. The sheer amount of strange creatures and entities available made for an enjoyable journey.The combat, as has been pointed out elsewhere is not the strongest. It was not really until well until the game that I started to come into my own in terms of fighting. Part of this is because I chose to talk my way out of nearly every enocunter I could find. The downside to this was that I never really had the opportunity to learn fighting strategies early on and it took me a long while to get past the first few mandatory battles. I also did not realize until well into the game that during a battle (or Crisis as they are called here"" you can sometimes speak to your enemies and in some cases actually talk them out of fighting. There are also a number of enocunters that include parts of the terrain, traps, devices, etc that can help turn the tide of your battles. I just wish there had been more exposure to the combat, since it wasn't all avoidable. The stat pools mechanic was also a bit of a strange thing to get used to. These stat pools covered things like trying to persuade or intimdate somebody, to snatching an item off of an unsuspecting NPC, to actually being required for us with combat and combat abilities. Much of this information is just not really properly explained all that well. I think a more extended intro with more tutorials would have been highly beneficial. Still by the end of the game, your stat pools should be so high that you are able to easily make your ability checks.There has been much talk about the length of the game and as always, your mileage may vary based on your indivudal play style. I know that I missed out on some content, including one companion that had their own quests. I also missed out on talking to a certain beast in a tank that I look forward to doing next time. I also played the game and talked my way out of so much, that I intend to try it a different style next time. Having said that, many may be expecting the kind of enormous, epic sprawling adventures of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. This game is a smaller game, featuring perhaps 5 different areas to explore and aside from the first one, they begin to feel confined after a while. Another issue will be the exclusion of promised materail from kickstarter stretch goals and I can only hope that the developers add as much of that content post release as they are able to.I found a few bugs here and there, but thankfully none of the game enders that others have reported. There has been a little patching activity from the develoeprs since release, although the month of April has been relatively quiet for them. If they continue to support the game, then this should help remove many of the issues that others have described.Ultimately, this game is my type of game. I like the sometimes absurd setting, the ability to talk my way out of battles and at least the illusion of choice in this game. I would have liked to see more useful loot in the game, as I found I had to buy my best weapons for the most part. I also would have liked far more encounters and combat opportunities. Perhaps my play style led to that outcome, I guess I will find out next time. While I would have liked to see more of all the content on offer, I did find what was there to be compelling and worth playing from start to finish. While this game may never end up reaching the heights of its spiritual prdecessor, I think many will find it to be enjoyable. Maybe wait until it goes on sale.			"

												Absolutely beuatifully written game, well worth investing your time into if you love deep story, great characters and an incredibly strong backgound. This game is *not* a BG clone, it has many of the same mechanics and many similarities but there is definitely less combat overall and vastly more options to deal with potential combat situations (or you can just smash faces in like a pro if that's what you enjoy!). The game does an excellent job of bringing the tabletop RPG to life and converting the mechanics to work in a video game, about as well as it could possibly be done I suspect.It's very hard to give more specifcs without spoiling anything, which would be criminal given how interesting it all is, but suffice to say your moral choices make a huge difference to peoples lives and deaths but you're not being *judged* for them, you're seeing the consequences, after all... what is one life worth?If all you want is click and loot then Diablo or Path of Exile are great games that satisfy that itch, if you just want another Baldurs Gate, probably look at Pillars of Eternity. But if you want a deep story with fantastic characters (Favourite so far: Rhin... Patrick Rothfuss knocked it out of the park with her!) and some very interesting game & combat mechanics all very much in the flavour of Planescape: Torment (for those who played it waaaaay back when), this game is for you imo.As someone who both played Planescape when it came out and backed the kickstarter for this I couldn't be happier and more satisfied, awesome game and well worth it.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. To be fair the story is engaging, but it dosent make up for the combat. That in all honesty is so annoying it borders on torture. The game gives you many oppertunites to avoid combat altogether, but my problem lies with the many times you are forced to fight. Long story short if you have the patince of a saint and you like reading, this game is for you. If not, I'd reccomend looking else where.			"

												Backed this on kickstarter. Compared to the original this one just completely fails to grab you. I do not care about any of the characters, who all feel stiff and lifeless, nor for the contrived psudo choose your own adventure at the begining. In the entire time I've played it there has not been a single meaningful decision for me to make. I don't really care why the changing god does what he does, and I fail to see how adequate ground has been laid that I reasonably should. One snarky old guy doesnt like him and the other person seems neutral? OK? Am I the changing god? I really don't care one way or the other.  Now perhaps this game has much more to offer, but I'm already at the point where I'm not going to give it that chance			"

												I'm sure the Good Ship Internet is already groaning under the weight of reviews comparing this with the original Planescape: Torment, which is only to be expected. The entire premise of the Kickstarter seemed to hinge on our collective desire to have more of that sort of thing, please and thankyou. It basically succeeds, I guess? Only much like with Pillars of Eternity, now that I finally have access to the Further Adventures of Videogame Systems I Found Thrilling in 1999, it's no longer something for which the Me of 2017 has any patience. I was messing about with Divinity: Original Sin to pass the time before this was released and realised it is exactly what I wanted all along, a worthy successor to those venerable Infinity Engine titles but infused with all the vigor and innovation of almost 20 years of gaming evolution. On another, much more specific topic, that dialogue window. Bleh. You spend so much time (SO MUCH TIME) in conversation with grotesque interchangeable character models, particularly if you choose to placate your way out of ever having to engage in the tiresome combat system. Could they not have hired an artist to sketch some portraits for the NPCs? It honestly feels like I'm just reading a wiki at times rather than interacting with characters in a fantastical realm. Anyway, recommending because it performs exactly as advertised! "

												BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL (YMMV)This game has some of the best writing and most interesting story of any video game, ever. I was majorly disapointed with previous ""tribute"" RPGs like Dragon Age and Pillars of Eternity. I feel that this game finally hits the nail in terms of storytelling, even surpasses our favorate late 90s classic CPRGs. The writing and original settings are top notch. Lets say that it TTN was a novel, it would probably be winning SciFi literary awards. What makes it even better than a novel is the way it tells the story by letting you explore and interact with the environment, rather than merely scroll through pages of text. The setting of this game is in a specific part of the Numenera world that was segrated specifically for the game, basically on the opposite side of the world from the table top setting. So all of the settings are original totally unqiuely created for the game. The Bloom was the area I was most impressed with be there was lots of original weirdness and interesting backstory to all of the areas in the game. Additoinally because of the alternate outcomes to a lot of events this game is definately worth mutliple play throughs. I've already beat it twice but am waiting for new (free) content to be released before I try the thrid time.			"

												A lot of people ae upset because of cut stretch goals and the like, and that's all fair. But saying the game is not good becasue of that is not fair nor logical. The fact is, the game is great fun, if you are into this type of game. One has to understand it isn't about making the biggest, baddest warrior there is, although you certainly can and can beat the game that way. But that isn't the game's focus. It suppossed to be about the dialogue and the character. The characters are not, admittedly, the best, but they are good. And I also find the leveling to be very addicting, for some reason. It's incredibly fun and I have enjoyed every minute of it thus far and look forward to the end of my midterms so I can finish it. Again, its fair to be mad that content was cut and that there was bad communication, but that doesn't change the fact that it is just a really enjoyable game. I give it an 8.5 out of 10.			"

												Despite what many of the top reviews are saying right now, this game is fantastic. The negative reviews are mainly for a mismanaged Kickstarter. So long as you aren't part of that, then this outrage doesn't effect you.The actual game itself is a very well written spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. However, there is even less of an emphasis on combat, so if you prefer more combat heavy RPGs like Baldur's Gate than this may not be for you.The RPG mechanical elements themselves are pretty light. There are 3 ""effort"" skills you can spend to pass checks, which can only be recharged by items and sleeping. The combat is also based on spending these skills to use abilities. The main alluring part of this RPG is the top quality writing and all of the different choices that can be made during quests and even outside of quests. For example, in many quests, you have the ability to learn deep secrets from people. After finishing the quest, you could always go and trade those secrets away for another secret, perhaps one that can save people, or perhaps one that you can use to your advantage. Is this something you want to do?Torment: Tides of Numenara is all about these kinds of choices. If this sounds appealing to you, then I highly recommend the game!			"

								The setting is fresh and allows the writers to go where they will. One of the few games that has me continually intrigued and seeking out the individual stories of a passerby.Combat, aka 'Crisis', can be resolved in a variety of ways. Each solution carries repercussions further down the story. I enjoy every choice I make. My curiosity for how everything turns out keeps me coming back for more.			"

												T: ToN is a great game and a worthy successor to the Torment name. The strengths and flaws of the two games are pretty similar, so if you're looking for an immersive, story (text) heavy game to explore and think your way through, here it is. + The world and characters within it are fantastic, it's easy to immerse yourself in a place that feels alien setting-wise but familiar mechanics-wise. This is the thing I love most that both Torment games share. + The writing and quests are overall very good. The quests react pleasingly to the different ways you can solve them and the descriptions and dialogue are often thought-provoking and fun. There are times when a little too much text is dumped on screen without much other interaction, but if you don't enjoy reading you wouldn't be playing a writing-heavy RPG in the first place. People who are complaining about ""reading a book""... what the hell did you expect? ~ The combat is solid, but not wonderful. I did run into a couple of bugs in combat (I didn't encounter any outside of it) which was annoying, but eh. I expect a few bugs in a game this size. I actually enjoyed the turn-based combat here more than the Real-Time-with-Pause of Pillars of Eternity, which surprised me a bit, being a big oldschool IE fan (BG, BG2 etc).- It's quite easy. The combat and skill checks are at least reasonably challenging to begin with if you avoid sleeping while you do all the first town quests like I did, but after that there's not anything that took more than an attempt or two to ace. I don't really play narrative games for a heavy skill test though, I play for the story and setting. Making the moral and investigative choices in dialogue is where the ""difficulty"" lies in my mind.- Yes, the final act ends a bit abruptly and the game is a little shorter than I'd like, but it's not worth getting bent out of shape about. 64 hours for a methodical runthrough of an RPG seems decent enough to me. I don't care what budget the game had or where that came from, I care if the game is fun and (in my mind) worth the money, and this one is.If you're the sort of person who likes investigating all the nooks of a game before moving on, this one has plenty of fun to discover. People wanting a more mechanics-heavy challenge or who get bored reading long chains of dialogue, then yeah, stay away.			"

												MAN.  I don't write many reviews, but I already feel compelled to share my thoughts on this game.I'm roughly 1.5 hours in and I'm in love.The story is alredy compelling.  I'm traversing every conversational path I can with the worry that I'm negatively effecting my relationship with the strange and fascinating characters I've met already.  I can't wait to read more about this world.The user interface is GORGEOUS.  It's fast, sleek and polished.  It's flowy and vibrant and relaxing. Very well done.The character creation process was definitely my favorite done in any RPG I've played to date.  And I've played a LOT of them.  70% of my library is RPGs.  I love RPG's.  So much.The music is to die for.  It's beautifuly done and it changes flawlessly as tensions change in dialogue.  I already feel like I could play this entire game with VERY little (and quite possibly none at all) actual combat.  And I LOVE it that I have that option.  I'm already envisioning replays with different attitudes and builds in mind.  I believe they will create completely unique experiences already.The price?  Meh, so far I'm feeling good about the purchase.  But I think to make that detrminaiton before 20 hours is probably silly and something that would have to be changed later.  So I'm abstaining on this topic while leaning towardy the thumbs up side in the early leg of the race.If you've been watching this one, get it.  If you start to watch it now, pounce the INSTANT you see it go on sale.  Games this well done take me back to my 15 year old summer nights reading choose your own adventure books while my actual imagination was still vivid.  Now I'm old and jaded and I require advanced technology to take me there.  But this game is doing an EXCELLENT job so far.			"

												Pros:+ Good writing with interesting characters and lore.+ Open-ended quests with lots of roleplaying opportunities.+ Really rewards you for being thorough and gaining as much information as possible.+ Lots of skill checks.+ Weird and wondrous sci-fantasy setting.+ Combat is mostly avoidable.+ Almost every piece of loot is unique.Cons:- Combat, while better than PST's, is mediocre.- Inventory is as bad as the one in PST.- Some bugs.- No codex (may be implemented later).- RNG-based skill checks are and have always been inherently pointless.- By the halfway point, you (or your party) can successfully complete any skill check, making your character build somewhat irrelevant.If you're looking for an RPG with deep, strategic combat, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a hardcore RPG where you're forced to specialize or else end up with unviable character, look elsewhere (i.e. Age of Decadence). If you're looking for an RPG that is less about what you can do and more about what you choose to do, Torment should be right up your alley. It successfully recaptures the strengths of Planescape: Torment in providing you with plenty of interesting characters to talk to, exotic locations to explore and deep, open-ended quests to complete. As a fan of PST and interesting content in general, I'm very satisfied with Torment.			"

												I know its a bit early to say it but this game is probably my game of the year. I enjoyed Torment's strange atmosphere having never played anything like it before, and I found the story increadibly engaging and gripping. The interesting mechanic of balancing your exertion between combat and world events, with the same action pool for both, added a tactical edge to the world map and combat both. For the most part the game is very forgiving as well early on, with death being as much of a mechanic as a fail state throughout. All in all I would recommend this game to anyone with a love of weird absurdist sci-fi fantasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, old-fashion crpgs, and a hard on for being the most important person in the world.10/10 best game			"

												I rarely game anymore because games lack depth of thought and/or story, but that also include, enough freedom of choice and consequences to make you feel your choices matter.  The original Torment had it and this Torment takes it to the next level.  Though there are some really vocal complaints here, I feel their focus is not on the right elements. This is truly a game worth playing if you want to experience multiple immersive, exciting stories. Pros:- Great storyline, imaginative experiences all around, I found myself caring about lots of characters in the world aside from just your companions.- Great visuals help you dive into a strange world.- Ambiental sound and effects would truly move me and involve me in the scene, be it grossed out, excited, tense or mystified.- Creative and interesting environments, oddities and interactions that allow your imagination to go wild.- Challenge level is simple enough so that you can focus on playing the story multiple times with different options vs min-maxing and finding the perfect build.- Multiple friends started at the same time as I did, and we would talk about completely different experiences, companions, resolutions, and paths.Cons: - As other people have complained: Still quite a few bugs in interface or interaction of storylines that won't complete unless worked around.- Clunky interface issues with visibility, overlap and some actions don't effectively produce the corresponding audio.- Not really much challenge to the game if you are into ""beating games.""- The main con I see is that many people who don't like to read a lot are going to miss out on one of the best gaming experiences in a long time.

												Easily the best game I've played so far this year, but I have those opinions you get when you like something recognizably flawed.For a 'spiritual sequel', this game is actually at its best when it forgets to be the distant progeny of Planescape: Torment and explores its own vast, colorful world. The Last Castoff's personal conflict with their past was a dim shadow of the Nameless One's, but the potential conflict with the world, lingering at the edges of the game, was by far the greater.I feel like the Ninth World was meant for a game that truly fits the word 'epic'. I'd really like to see this setting in particular, and the loving way in which it saturated the gameplay, on a grander scale.Like, I get what it was trying to do, with the whole quest of self-discovery, that's all very 'Torment'. I liked it for that, but I wasn't surprised when it didn't quite capture the intimate, personal feel that PS:T had. It had one-off NPC's that were more interesting than half the major characters. Vendor trash that was more interesting than artifacts. The game was flavorful to the extreme, but that flavor itself was often at cross-purposes with its stated narrative goal. This was mainly a game about people dealing with a precursor, a history, that was innately unsympathetic, even hostile, to them, and trying to find a way to make that harmful past serve their future. It was a good metaphor for the Ninth World itself, what with folks poking through the garbage of great ancient civilizations for useful junk, but the whole feel of that was sort of muddled by the end, because, well, spoilers, but also because the devs themselves seemed to forget that treating the characters like set pieces defies the message they were ham-handedly trying to send. tldr: Beautifully-written, organic world. Rich characters. Slightly stilted 'themes'. Play it.			"

												Full review here : https://forums.inxile-entertainment.com/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=17771What has made into the final game with all the cuts and delays it’s superb, It’s detailed world full of interesting characters to meet and the side quests are very interesting. We have a robot who wants to have children, an octopus (Nychthemeron) that can only talk at night, and you can make it night just for that alone, you will meet a cult that worships the Changing God and you can tell them that you really are him to sleep for free. We meet cannibals who eat the dead to preserve their memories or people that fight in the endless battle between the Changing God's army and the opposing force.It really is a joy to read every interesting opinion that a character has. All quests can be resolved in multiple ways.The most interesting part of the game comes after the first major city, in the Endless Gate I had a great time listening to Inifere and trying to solve all the possible outcomes. Also, that holds one of the hardest fights that can lead to game over screen if you fail, and of course if you choose to fight. After that , aside from Miel Avast, the next major hub will be the Bloom written by George Zeits who is responsible for Mask of the Betrayer from Neverwinter Nights 2.The Bloom area is where the game really shines, it shows it’s full potential by using the setting, writing and the great soundtrack from Mark Morgan (same composer from PS:T, Fallout, Wasteland 2) Some examples from the Bloom : a robot who collects hosts that are only beautiful, a spaceship that has smashed into the bloom - that is huge monster like where people live, trade and so on. You can also find out what different mows want and feed them people or even your companions in order to open portals to other dimensions. It all feels very alive, and well put together.There’s a unique crisis system here that involves using your party members to distract a tour guide while you steal an important quest item, if you resolve to violence the battle will be almost impossible. The other companions you can find throughout the game are Tybir, Rhin and Erritis. Rhin is interesting because it’s a kid that can talk to Gods and Erritis, well, he is written by Chris Avellone and you can enjoy his full potential only if you choose a certain class with a certain ability. Tybir is just the funny guy in the game, and well, that’s about it. The characters while being interesting it can't compare to PS:T.Graphics in the game are good, especially in the bloom area, I like that we are able to zoom in very close, about the size of PS:T characters.I have read on forums that people think T:ToN is lacking in humor but that’s not true, the game has humor but a more mature one then the first.The whole story of the game is great written and you can have different endings based on your choices and the Tides. The Tides serve as a kind of alignment system, but a more complex one, because it can change depending on what you say to a character.Another great addition to the game are the meres : devices that can help you get into someone's memory and change the future, there are some that you need to interact because of the story but most of them are scattered throughout the game for the player to find them.Conclusion: I will recommend the game despite it's flaws and cut content, it’s a rough gem that can suck you into the great written story, a story that was written by 6 different actual writers and it’s complexity and narrative, detailed characters, choices that matter and reactivity all over the place will make Torment Tides of Numenera a game hard to miss for anyone that likes a real RPG and don’t bother reading. Maybe some of you will want to hold on until patches and cut content to be added, but for myself that I waited so many years to finally arrive , it’s a good experience, especially since true RPG’s with real reactivity are hard to come by today.

												Excellent, bizarre, well-written, you won't find a unity-based isometric rpg like it.  The world of Numenera is vivid, like something out of a bad nightmare/fever dream.  The writing at times can be very Lovecraftian, and the descriptors very superfluous but it works in this setting.  It adds to the surreal atmosphere you are immersed in, the characters are unique, the side quests plenty. Basically, if you don't mind reading and like western rpgs like the ones Blackisle did, and Obsidian make - you should enjoy this one.			"

												I enjoyed the game.The game is very text heavy, and contains a huge amount of background and detail. It's not unusual to spend half an hour or even an hour in a single scene, investigating every detail and talking to all the NPCs, trying to understand what's going on. It's also nice to play a game in a fairly unique setting rather than in generic fantasy world #2514. So buy this game if you're someone who enjoys reading, story and depth. Avoid this game if you want a by-the-numbers JRPG where you're looking to grind through a thousand combats, maximising every stat.			"

												All I expected it to be. It`s a true spiritual sequel to PS:T; Strange, alien worlds, oddities aplenty that you can take interest in or leave by the side, truly unique and interesting companions and several novels worth of dialogue, both optional and main quest related.The effort system is quite innovative and well done, if surprisingly easy to game, and the Tides system is, possibly, the best way a game has ever quantified your alignment and how that influences how the world around you reacts to you.It IS quite a short game for its genre, which many seem to consider a negative, but I would heartily disagree. Tides keeps a very tight narrative focus, which would be impossible for a game of much greater length, and allows for a much easier replay to explore choices not taken the first time. It does not meander endlessly through sidequests, sideplots, base building and what have you; it`s a game about one man/woman, the choices they make, the emotions they feel, and their impact on the world around them, and it is better for that than a thousand epic fantasies of chosen ones and dark forces.And let us not forget that PS:T itself was quite a short game, and it too was better for it.A hearty reccomendation for what may well be the best Roleplaying game of 2017.

												Many people got this game because they liked Planescape Torment. I got this game for one reason: Pat Rothfuss. This review is thus aimed at people who are doing the same.He wrote an NPC called Rhin who is designed from the ground up to be more or less worthless. For most of the game, she deals 0 damage, dies in 1-2 hits and her only redeeming function is that she can use special consumable items and hide. I can't help but feel that this is a deliberate bit of trolling on Mr. Rothfuss' part, but the game isn't so terribly difficult as to make her presence in the party a terribly big deal. Besides, having Rhin in your party probably means that you're generally going to take the non-violent and sneaky options instead of chopping your way through everything.In any case, Rhin will be instantly familiar to a Rothfuss fan. She tosses out lines like ""He's not a rock. He's a stone."" and all that goodness. Unfortunately however, I have to report that there isn't really much there. Rhin is very interesting, but her full story is at the periphery and much is left to the player's imagination. This is a really text heavy game, but I don't think you would have a very thick booklet if you were to print out all of her dialogue. The rest of the game is cool and imaginative. I liked the story (which is probably one of the most high-concept bits of science fiction I've encountered in a video game) and I liked the other characters for the most part. You can definitely feel that Pat Rothfuss had some creative influence on the overall direction. But this isn't the Name of the Wind by any stretch of the imagination.Overall: Don't buy this expecting to find a huge amount of Rothfuss inside, but it is still worth exploring nevertheless.			"

												Ok, so I'm another one of these guys that hasen't written many reviews so bare with me.Short and sweet:PROS:Awesome story with amazing backdrops and characters.  The diolog between them is funny and the voice acting is pretty solid. The quests are enjoyable and well written for the most part with some pretty amazing surprises along the way.Finding out what ""random"" stuff does in your inventory is a nice treat and some of the items have some pretty amazing stories associated with them.CONS:  (and sad to say, the motivation for me coming here)The combat.  Holy jesus the combat is pure infuriating at times.  It's not because it's overly difficult and you can't manage to figure out how to deal with the enemy.  It's because in some cases you just can't layout a strategy because you can't select different characters and set them up.   You MUST lead in with your main character who cannot die or it's GG and in many of the cases I've found so far your enemy has a much higher initiation level than you.  So they go first.  So, you lead in with a character that can't die or it's GG (while your allies don't die but get ""knocked out"" instead) against enemies who in large part can move first.  Pure rage inducing.Why this company, who made Wasteland 2 (among others) with it's amazing combat, would choose to make such horrid combat decisions is just adding to the anger.  I'm a pretty big InXile fan and LOVE wasteland 2.  It is a huge letdown in this game that you can't select seperate characters and move them individually.  As far as i can tell you can't even decide who stands next to who in the ""lineup"".  I love the overall aspects of the game.  The story is really pretty amazing.  The combat though...my god, i just don't understand.   Those 2 things make such an impact on the pure frustration levels of the game that I just can't figure out why they went with it.Would i recommend the game, yes.  Overall, yes, i would.  But it's a strained yes.			"

												Overall a good game but nowhere close to the original ""Plancescape: Torment"".The game desipite it´s only roughly 30-40 hours long campaign still a good match for the original in aspects of general playtrough (focus on story not on battles) and unfortunatly companions (P:T as combat aid, T:ToN as combat aids (minor) and skill mules (major). Aside from that they are glorified NPC´s)The new mechanics work and fit into the story. The overall story is also good (if short)Despite the overall matches sofar there is however one, or rather three, big part/s that invalides the game as a successor instead of a standalone: It has nothing to do with the charactes, places or story of the first game. Places: As the name of the original suggest it takes place on the ""Planes"" more specificly the first 2/3 take place in Sigil, a place called the City of Gates (to other planes) and is filled with creatures of said planes. T:ToN on the other hands play on the ""ninth world"" and among other things you see at least 2 spaceships and in ""flashback"" one space station.Characters:The only character that comes from the first game is Adahn. First Game he was a fictional character that could be brought to some sort of live by telling people that it´s your name. T:TON makes it the name of the previous host of our body in the game. Story:The only elements of the original story that makes it into this one is that the Protagonist can´t die (with exceptions). The reasons in P:T was that we underwent a ritual to seperrate us from our mortality. The reason in T:ToN is that we were made this way as a vessel for the changing god.Summary: Would buy again (even the Immortal Edition but that one only in a Steam Sale) but take down the ""Successor of Planescape: Torment"" Award. That one is undeserved. Even as a ""spiritual successor"".			"

												TLDR: If you like crpgs or want to try and dip your toe into the genre, this is a good place to start.  There isn't too much combat to worry about and slow your enjoyment of the story.  Great replayability, if you like reading and want something different from typical scifi or fantasy play this game you won't be disappointed.As a gamer that has never played the original Planescape: Torment and having limited experience with crpgs, I went into this a little intimidated.  The ones I've played were daunting in terms of gameplay, while they were all rich with deep storytelling the pacing of the game would often be hampered with the endless amount of creatures which  you would have to fight between story sections.  Some of which could be a frustrating wall until you grind even more weaker monsters to progress yourself.  That is not the case with Torment: Tides of Numenera.  I completed the game on my first playthrough in 40 hours, throughout that time I had very limited combat encounters and instead got to enjoy and immerse myself with the well written story and side lore that each environment you cross paths with uninterrupted by needless combat.  The developers weren't kidding when they say they have a books worth of story packed into this game.  I enjoyed this game, on the second playthrough you'll likely skip a few dialogue here and there but not in the same manner as other rpg games where you'll make a few different choices but be lead the same way.  In this game, there's a lot of replayability.  There is no way you can see everything in a single playthrough even if you save-scum.   "

												I remember playing Planescape torment years ago, liked the way combat was not the center of the game, was very different at the time and took me awhile to get used too. This game feels very similar in that aspect, combat is an option, but often the 3rd or 4th or 5th, not the 1st option. There are only a handful of required fights (i believe required, otherwise my choices may of forced them) even those often can be run away from, or assited by using objects on the battlefield to change things.I overall had a great time playing this game, even if i did save scum a lot, just to see the different outcomes at times of success or failure. I feel like unless you do that,  or play the game multiple times you will miss a ton of the dialog/lore/backstory/etc...Not sure if the game is worth the 45$ price tag, but it is SURE better than a 60$ price tag and i know i had more fun with the game than some i spent 60$ on! I say give the first hour or 2 a try and see if you like it, otherwise there is always the refund option. "

												This is my review, will be split in 3 section:1.) General.2.) Compared to Plansescape Torment.3.) On its own.1.) GeneralPros:Interesting world.Good story telling and writing.Vibrant Graphics.Interesting companions.Cons:The game world is small, only 3 main areas.Some weird bugs, companions will stop following, you have talk to them or reload a save to get them moving again.Game length is very short compared to other CRPG's, especially if you consider the day one cost.2.) I think this game falls flat compared to PS:T.PS:T was much more engrossing and intersting and had my attention up to the end, where this game seem to fall flat at the end.3.)If you look at this game as its own entity and ignore the hype, it is a fun and enjoyable game. A good story told, even though the ending was a bit boring.If you enjoy a decent story and a interesting world, this game is for you.I recommend to wait for a sale before buying this.			"

Some content seems to be cut, and battle system could be better, but it's still a good game overall, good story and interesting lore, nice music and pretty, although small and cramped locations (that amount of quests and dlialogue rich npc's should be spread for twice that many locations). I would advise to wait for a sale though - price is a bit high at the moment.			"

												First review ever...I've played nearly every crpg since the dos days.  The original torment was definetely one of my favorites. This though very text heavy does the original justice, and then some.  I find myself drawn into the lore, not just the major points but also the suddle nuances.  The combat i find is fun, and avoidable if you so choose.  Bottom line i highly reccomend this game might not be for the action seekers but if your a fan of the genre, and like to think/involve yourself in an epic story you should enjoy this.

												A deep narrative experience. If you seek a shallow, childish pseudo-roleplaying experience like most of the crpgs on the market (including the loved BG saga - which I like btw), with tons of fights, and only ilusoric influence on the world around - you will be totally disapointed. This is not a dnd style rpg. This is a masterpiece - closest to the non linear tabletop storytelling experience ever made. For me it's 8/10 when it comes to gameplay, 11/10 when it comes to storytelling, non-linearness, atmosphere, creativity, roleplaying etc. Can't  to dive into it again. Don't listen to whiners - they wanted another childish monster slaying crap. It's not.			"

												I was a backer of this Kickstarter, and now that I've finally had a chance to play it, did it live up to my expectations?  Well, it's not quite up there with Planescape, but I was enthralled by the world.  I actually recommend reading the Tides of Numenera Novellas first, because they added an extra layer of familiarity to the world and locations (finding a certain skeleton and the weapon beside it actually made my jaw drop as I realized who it was, but only because I had read the novellas). The world is fascinating, the characters I traveled with a little less so (although there were definitely touching moments with some of them). The final conflict was a little underwhelming, and I may go back to try it differently.  But the whole concept of effort and finding alternatives to fighting in the Crises was intriguing and well implemented. But there were so many interesting stories, and the central plot, once unveiled, will leave me thinking for a long time.  It may not stand up with the classics like Baldur's Gate and Planescape, but it's only a small step down from them, and still definitely worth the time of Isometric Role playing games (and interactive fiction fans who don't mind dealing with some of the trappings of traditional RPGs).

												What was special, really special about Planescape: Torment, was the sense of intrigue in every corner of the world. That everybody you talked to, every corner had some new story to tell you. Some were sad, some were funny and some were really weird. Some of them were better than others; but they were all worth your time.I think, for me at least, Torment: Tides of Numenera captures that feeling that the world is vast and strange and that, even if it is at the end of the day, a construct with a finite amount of narrative for you to see, you never quite have a full handle on it.

												Torment: Tides of Numenera is a decent execution of the heavily-story focused old-school Isometric RPG type game.The setting and little side stories of Numenera are by far its strongest aspect, with the 1-billion old world filled with strange stories and technological wonders from ages gone by. Considering a majority of your time is spent learning and interacting with this world, it being so interesting and fleshed out alone makes the game worth playing. It is, and this cannot be overstated, absurdly varied, imaginative, weird (in a good way), and unlike any other setting I have seen in other fiction. I will not soon forget it, and it is easy to see the vast amount of writing, design, and other work that it took to craft this detailed a realization of this world.And then there is the rest. I found almost everything - the main story, companion interactions, combat, navigation - middling in quality. The main story is focused on an interesting concept of a 'Changing God' who lives forever and spawns endless immortal castoffs who are powerful and do much to shape the world. This leads to some interesting lore, but is undercut by the antagonist being 'The Sorrow' (seriously? a generic unstoppable evil force?) and the crux of the conflict being highly abstract and removed from real-world moral concerns. The story is also undercut by spotty pacing, big intermittent info dumps, and mixed quality of writing. The same is true for companions' stories; some or better than others, and the writing of the characters is actually quite good, but all suffer from how they are delivered. Don't get me wrong; the story is not bad, on the whole I found it pretty interesting and worth going through, but it feels like it could be told much, much, better. Likewise, the world-building dialogue is often delivered in uninspired ways, much as it was in Wasteland 2 - you can ask for backstory on everything, to the point that it becomes tiresome.As to the gameplay - my biggest complaint for the game may be that the combat feels terrible, and there is not much else of interest. The combat system itself is actually pretty cool, but the degree to which actual combat moves slowly and clumsily is ridicolous - in the age of the recent X-COM revival and other far superior turn based combat games, it is strange that this one is so badly executed. This is not a huge deal due to how little combat there is (the vast majority of it is avoidable, which is cool), but sadly the dialogue-based solutions around violence are rarely very interesting. In the vast majority of cases I could simply use my 'Persuasion' skill, which made it seem ridicolously overpowered and the actual act of pulling of dialogue solutions unimpressive. The game looks good insofar as the worlds are detailed and imaginative, but is otherwise underwhelming as far as graphics go; all characters are only ever low-poly models which you see from the usual isometric perspective (there are portraits for you and your companions, but they doo little to help things). It could really benefit from less stilted dialogue, some cutscenes (such as the story trailer), or really anything to make it less of a choose-your-own-adventure book. The audio is barely worth mentioning, except that something started making a constant sound effect in the latter half of the game that was maddening. So... yeah, a narrative-driven game with a flawed narrative but a fantastic setting/premise and many memorable details. I do recommend it, if only because there is very little like it out there, but with the caveat that the execution is rough and going through it will involve far more reading than playing.			"

												I played this game after going back and completing Planescape: Torment and, honestly, it's very very loosely attached to it. The only things that a taken from that are a few vague themes. I'm not complaining about that at all because this game stands up on its own. As with every game like this, the main upsides are going to be the story and the characters. The characters and their development were done very well. Each person has their own unique feel and you do genuinely get drawn into their own stories, none moreso (for me) that Rhin. The story, on the other hand, was pretty bare bones but I feel it was more a vehicle for the characters and it was interesting to a point. The look of the game is also great, lending a lot to the themes and the different ages of history that you're told about. The cyphers and esoteries (spells) are also quite cool and well animated. Now for a few gripes I had. Firstly, the voice acting. The quality itself was fine, as you would expect from a higher budget indie game but the amount was quite disappointing. You expect to have voice acting all along the main storyline in games like this but, even when you would expect it, it wasn't there. For example, the last encounter of the game had no voice acting. Secondly, there is A LOT of text. I feel like these 2 points are linked but I feel this would turn off a lot of people. Finally, the combat mechanics were a bit poor. I feel like it would have benefited from a system with disengaging strikes and other things from the game Tyranny. Overall, it's a great, interesting game with a hell of a lot of character and you can just tell the devs loved making it. If you like story, grab it. If you like old school CRPGs, why haven't you already got it?			"

												So far it seems like a more polished version of the beta I enjoyed 9 months ago. If you are a cerebral, bookish type then I fully reccomend this game.It won't be for everyone - lots of reading, not much combat. If you liked Ps:T then you will probably like this. Quests seem well written and well put together. Generally if you can think of how your character would go about solving them, you can solve them that way in the game. The answers aren't always obvious either, it's not like a Bioware game where you are very explicitly presented with THE CHOICE - in this game there will often be other options if you look for them.

												Yes… this game is somewhat unfinished and a lot of the kickstarter promises were left unfulfilled (I backed on the oddity collector level). My expectations sank deeper and deeper through the last two years of development woes. But even in the cut down state the game was released in (I weep for all the content that was left on the cutting floor) I was still wrong! I did replay through PS:T six months ago and just finished T:ToN  (Steam counts 76 hours). While T:ToN does not reach the heights of it´s sire imhO it does stand tall and proud among the 10 best RPG I did play in the last 30 years. For a better review I fully share Alec´s opinions in his Wot I Think on RPShttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review/But there is an important thing to add here. This game sets a glorious monument to one of the best forgotten Rock songs ever. And for this alone it deserves a thump up.

												Planescape Torment is one of all time favorite games so you can imagine the excitement and high hopes I had... HAD for this game.Greatest disappointment ever - the game is bland, poorly written, slow, boring, awful gameplay and just uninteresting.There is nothing here, nothing at all, no inspiration, no awe, no emotion. It's a cold, barren attempt to recreate a classic that will never be replicated.I've been loving the revival of CRPG's (Original Sin and Pillars most of all) and you know what I've been doing in this game? The so called paragon of writing? I'm skipping... SKIPPING text just so I can advance through the game to end it just for the sake of it and end the TORMENT that it is playing this utter piece of junk.I didn't like Wasteland 2 either so inxile is like a banned dev company for me now. And by the way - a big middle finger to steam for the refund policy. Games like this take more than two hours to minimally understand how they run and how they are.I want my money back, this game is more expensive than half priced and much better games out there.			"

												One of the best stories I've ever experienced in an RPG, a truly memorable adventure from the beginning till the end. The writing is top-notch, there is no artificial padding of gametime, no grindy bits of any kind, the pacing of the story is constant and flows well. Sadly, there is not much actual challenge, but I didn't get bored at all. Yep, it's around 40 hours of almost pure storytelling.Just don't expect it to be some sort of tactical simulator with lots of micromanagement and strategizing, it's a type of an RPG more similar to visual novel-ish choose-your-own-adventure-ish Shadowrun Returns style games (yet I felt there was still less reading than I had to endure in Shadowrun: Hong Kong!). So if you find the premise and the setting appealing and you're ready to read a lot - definitely give this one a shot. And don't listen to those who fanatically worship Planescape: Torment and other Infinity Engine games in the reviews around here, because more often than not they're out of their minds.			"

												After 20 hours in game and time well spent on reading and expanding my knowledge about universe of Numenera I can fully recommend this game.  This is not by far any sequel to original 1999 Planescape: Torment, but it is ONLY contender that even tried to come in a quarrel with it.  It's that one RPG that is true to the roots of genre. Walls of text, interesting characters, I can't even call them NPCs, because NPC's are those 'shells' of useless meaning that we are all used to right now. Everyone got something to say in Tides. Everyone got a perspective and it fully depends on the player what he will do about it. Long story short: You will not like it, if you are not invested in LEARNING about the lore of the game. You will not like it, if you expect only occasional dialogues and less meanings conversations. However - You  will like  the game if you loved classic 1990's RPGs and put Planescape on a altar.  You will love it .I don't recommend this game lightly, everyone must grab it alone and feel if it's the kind of game for him, just like Dark Souls - it's not a game for everyone. Sorry for any mistakes - English is not my native language.			"

												First, an apology to InXile. Like many others I fell under the sway of negativity that surrounds financially invested individuals like swarming bees.buzz buzzThe story writing is enthralling. While most are not connected to the protagonist,this is ok, because he (and you) has all the time in the world.The ruleset guiding Numanera's combat is where things get muddy. It's a complex system without much of a visual pay off. As opposed to the original Torment,where a 'big move' would get a full screen video. And, at least with S.P.E.C.I.A.L there was the illusion of freedomwith the odd bit of tactics.As for the visuals, well, if a few billion years into the future looks this good, then count me in. "

												Different, original, simply great, but not as deep nor expanse as original Planescape: Torment - it's still unsurpassed masterpiece.But be warned to really enjoy it you have to read everything and there is not much combat (if that's what you want). It's also buggy and not optimised enough.I think it's best to treat it like interactive novel (there are sections of game what are exactly that!) or pen and paper RPG to get most of it.			"

												I played the original Torment back in the day multiple times over multiple years. I was a diehard fan of the game, delving into several of the nooks and crannies of that wonderful universe.I can't speak to anyone else, but I love this game.The Numenera setting does a great job of keeping the weirdness and mystique of the Planescape univserse. I greatly enjoyed the writing, the worldbuilding, and the storytelling.One of the things I liked most about this game was how easily you could go through it with little to no combat. Even the fights that were there could be approached in a way that involved fleeing/problem solving with no actual fighting. I really dug that.I will say, however, that this is a wordy game, somewhere between a Choose Your Own Adventure game like Sorcery and the new age iso-RPGs like Pillars. This combination was practlically geared for me, but it might not be for you.Also, the mechanics in some circumstances can be quirky, though not overbearingly so. I would have liked the ability to save while in a conversation or a ""Mere"" (a choose your own adventure style diversion that occur occasionally in the game). I personally like the turn based mechanics they introduced into the system, and likewise really like the streamlined Numenera system for skills that they use, but it may not be some people's cup of tea. That said, I'd say this compares to the original Torment, which had its own quirks in converting the Infinity engine used in Baldur's gate to work in a much more character focused game. They both have a few areas that could use refiniement, but the other parts of the game more than make up for it.I truly hope this game does well, I think it deserves to do so. I much prefer this character heavy type game over InXile's (still good) squad-based Wasteland series. I hope they make more games in this world, and continue to refine this particular system. I heartily recomend this to anyone who enjoyed the first Torment game.			"

												It's interesting.  It's certainly a great throwback to the great Bioware cRPG games of the past with many much needed quality of life additions and some pretty great unique ideas.  I both enjoy and detest the 'crisis system' that handles combat.  When it works, it's wonderful.  It's like doing a pen and paper game.  I like that not every battle has to end in all enemies dead.  I would suggest I fought less than thirty battles over the course of the entire game, and this was, to me, far more satisfying than the sort of constant grind that Tyranny, Pillars, and Dragon Age embrace.  Battles feel memorable and that's an absolute breath of fresh air we've needed to see for quite a long time.  On the downside, somemtimes the AI in combat is really profoundly stupid and I get the impression some of the combats aren't set up very well.  I had to savescum a little bit.  The story, which should be front and center of everyone elses review, is good.  Choice, to some degree, maters.  I would suggest it matters more than most modern cRPGs.  There are legitimate multiple endings.  I can't say I enjoyed The 9th world as much as I did Sigil from Planescape Torment, but I think they did the best they could with the source material.For those thinking of buying this game it can get pretty esoeteric and verbose.  Know what you're getting into.  Know that there is a hell of a lot of reading involved.Edit.I see from my reviews a lot of people didn't like what I had to say about the game and a lot of reviews that aren't from major publications are negative.  To start, I wasn't a kickstarter backer, so I didn't go into this game expecting much more than a fun blast from the past.  I agree it could have been longer.  I wish the companions were better developed.  I've also been interetsed in Numenera the RPG for years.  I woudln't be shocked I qualify as something of a unicorn fan.  Looking back at what I paid for it, if I hadn't been given it as an xmas gift by a friend (they paid the full price and I'm not a reviewer), I probably would have waited for sale.  Either way, I enjoyed it.  I'm now really looking forward watching youtube videos explaining everything that went on in the game.			"

												I was a backer of this game and am very satisfied by what I received.  I have fully played through twice already.Is it as good as Planescape: Torment? No.  But then that is true of literally every other CRPG ever made so that is a ridiculous standard to hold it up against.  The followers are not as engaging as those in Planescape or Baldur but the world is suitably bizarre and interesting, the writing is good and frankly, the absence of 'trash mobs' which infested all of the classic Infinity Engine games goes a long way towards my enjoyment.I will echo what most people are saying, if you are cool with tons of exposition and like to read you will enjoy this but if you are more combat focused you probably will not.Something else to keep in mind when comparing it to Planescape is that Planescape was almost unplayable due to day 1 bugs, most people discovered Planescape after it had been officially patched and then community patched.  There are supposed to be additions and fixes coming (for free) so this may be another game that grows in reputation in the months and years after release.			"

												I backed this game on kickstarter, and I actually like it. Maybe because my expectations were not over-hyped.This is a nice little game, with beautiful locations and well-written stories.This game is largely a story-telling game, conveying much of the story through text. If you hate reading books, this might annoy you.The combat is adequate, but not more. If you want a complex, challenging combat system, this is not the game for you. "

												I liked the game very much, though, full disclosure - I came for the story and have no problem with long chunks of text. In contrary to most reviews out there I liked the crisis system. I liked the idea of being able to do stuff other than fight, even when you're attacked. Things I didn't like about it was that it felt a bit clunky (the controls mainly). I liked the real-time system in games like Pillars of Eternity better.I liked the quests, and the fact that I could influence different outcomes using my character's skills. Though I didn't like the fact that the game sort-of felt linear. This is apart from the Sagus and Bloom sections. I missed the freedom to have a 'World Map' and travel between locations, and solve quests that spanned multiple of them.I'm not a backer of the game, and have no recollection of what was initially promised. Any cuts that have been made have not influenced my opinion. The game, in it's current state, brought me 30+ hours of interesting story and fun. While I do still place it below Planescape: Torment in my all time hall of fame, I'm happy to have supported the developer with my purchase of the Collector's Edition.			"

												This game captures the spirit of the orginal torment amazingly well. It's so much fun, and one of the few examples of roleplaying games that are like actual roleplaying oposed to hack and slash or tactical battles.Also please note if you like games like Pillars or Tyranny for the tactical combat exclusively, this game may disappoint.This game isn't about the combat, it's bout the characters and how the interact with each other.  However if you like amazing world's detailed roleplay and complex stories, this game is for you.			"

												I've only played it for 5.4 hours so far, yet I already know that I like it a lot.    I backed the game on Kickstarter, so I might be biased towards liking it, however I disliked other games which I had backed (including Wasteland 2, from the same developer) and so I did not expect it to live up to my expectations, but it did!I adored Planescape: Torment (PT) and Torment: Tides of Numenera (TTN) is exactly like it.      When you compare the Torment games to the Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights games, then NWN are the most combat heavy and the Torment games are the most dialogue heavy, with BG being in between.     I usually dislike dialogue heavy games, because many games have♥♥♥♥♥♥dialogue, but the Torment games had great writers working on them and I haven't met a single boring NPC in the 5 hours of play time.The type of storytelling that games excell at, is where you get to explore a world. Many wannabe movie directors make games nowadays (esp. AAA games), but the linear stories are anathema to the interactive medium of games. The Torment games are not linear.       In the storytelling aspect, TTN is a lot like Witcher 3 with more dialogue.If you like dialogue heavy games, you can't go wrong with TTN.If you dislike dialogue in games (because it's usually badly written), then I suggest you give the much cheaper PT a try first.Edit:Many reviews are mad about cut content etc.I didn't follow the development the last 4 years and didn't play any alpha versions. I don't even remember the promises made for the game; all I expected was another PT.Thing is, PT was mostly an interactive novel with very basic RPG elements.TTN is the same thing. Shocker! I know. I got what I expected, which is the first time on Kickstarter for me.So to make it clear: TTN is mostly reading, not combat.			"

												I don't play a lot of old school RPGs. I couldn't get through Pillars of Eternity because I got bored by the story. I never properly played Planescape: Torment. I couldn't stop playing this game. Yeah, the combat kinda sucks, but the story is great. The writing is great. The side quests are great and meaningful. I'm glad it only took me around 20 hours to get through it as I usually lose interest if games go on too long. I usually don't post reviews, but I just can't stand idly by when the game has so many negative reviews on here. I don't care about what happened with the Kickstarter or whatever. This is a good game and I thoroughly enjoyed it!			"

But I really enjoyed the characters, the story, the writing, the universe, and all the different paths offered to you when solving issues. For anyone who enjoy those things, I recommend that game.

								Despite the game being only in Beta state at the moment, it is a very touching experience. Torment: Tides of Numenera feels very much like Planescape: Torment. Familiar themes include but are not limited to: many lives, choice and consequence, peculiar possibilities arising form failure and also graphic and sound design.If you are like me, and you enjoy less combat orientated games that some might even call interactive novels, you will have fun 15 hours with the game on its current state. And you will be left yearning for more!			"

												Trying to follow up PlaneScape: Torment - in my opinion the best RPG story ever told is ambitious. Tides of Numenera comes really, really close, which for me is enough. Especially considering how rare games like this are.The atmosphere, mystery and above all uniqueness of the setting are great on their own right and when comparing it to PlaneScape I only like the latter slightly more because of personal preferences.The lack of actual or forced combat where you hit things with a weapon is impressive - the game even calls them ""Crisis"" encounters and there's often a way to do something other than killing all the enemies to get through it.The companions and places you visit are interesting, but left me wanting for more (which is often a good sign). It didn't feel like I got to know any of the companions well enough beyond their main backstory. The first big hub of Sagus Cliffs wasn't as interesting for me as Sigil or the other, weirder places you get to visit later in Tides and I wanted more of that.The variety of meaningful choices and reactivity to them was probably the best out of any RPG I've played. Despite having hard-fought and ""ideal"" solutions to problems that probably wouldn't have any consequences later I was more torn than I ever have been between the all the other options. All because of how well written the game is and how many intriguing choices the game had for me.The story of Tides manages to invoke similar deep philosophical concepts to the original Torment while not retreading the same ground. The plot, while slow to get going had some interesting twists and an overall satisfying conclusion.Overall I haven't played anything as compelling as this since the original Torment.			"

												Despite it's many flaws, I still recommend this game... but if you get it on sale. This game will draw comparisons to two games: Planescape Torment, and Pillars or Eternity. The former is in terms of spiritual succession & writing whilst the latter is in terms of technological performance & gameplay. Compared to P:T - it's not as spolished, feels a bit incoherent at times, and I think the companions aren't that interesting. The story is more of an interactive novel with not much impact on the world and quests that can be solved quite easily (a few just by going to the next map and talking to someone). Compared to PoE - I hate the ""crises"" combat in this game. It's awful and makes me realise why Obsidian went with pausable real time combat, rather than with turn based. But luckily most of the compbat in this game can be avoided which is nice. The maps in TToN feel a lot smaller, but on the plus side have a lot more 3D assets with things actually happening (i.e. light arks, water dripping, light pulsating, etc) whilst PoE felt like playing on a painting. So I seem to have been quite negative compared to both P:T and PoE, so why the recommendation? I feel that I got enough enjoyment out of this game to warrant buying it on a sale. Some of the quests were quite interesting, the world artwork / 2D assets were very qurky, and (very) few times it made me laugh. FYI: even thought it says Ive played it for 2 hours, I've played it offline for 47 hours and done every quest I could find.			"

												There's a lot of salt in the review section for this game, which is unfortunate. After sinking almost 50 hours into it, I found it to be a well-written RPG in a fascinating world with a compelling story.It seems to be unfairly held up to the original, which is hailed as some perfect zenith of gaming. If you have rose-tinted nostalgia goggles on, then yeah, you'll probably hate this game. It's not Planescape torment.But playing this game, and juding it on its own merits, I found it worth my money. The combat wasn't great, sure, and the graphics aren't anything to write home about. But as I mentioned above, the game takes place in a fascinating world, with a well-written and intruiging story. Could it have stood to be longer? Probably. In the end, however, I got what I came for, and don't regret my purchase.			"

												4 hours in:Just started playing so I'll update the review once I finish, but off to a great start.Playing this toook me back to the old CRPG days of when I was back in highschool. TTON definitely feels like a solid successor to the original Torment.  The game has the same mystery, detail and story as the original and it feels so right.If you're not interested in a long literaly journey - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  There is a lot of reading and if you don't want to invest the time to read it through, you'll miss out on the whole point of this game.If you're a fan of CRPGs and want to expereince a great story - you MUST BUY THIS GAME.   - Every NPC so far has been a great experience.   - The items have all been interesting.   - The decisions have all given me pause, just what impact will this have down the line???The polish on the game is solid as well, very smooth feeling and it's just a goregous game.===========9 Hours inWow - this just gets better.  I ended up completing several quest chains in 2 new area maps during my next playthrough.  The NPCs continue to be very deep and engaging and boy am i sweating my decisions.  I actually failed at a quest I really wanted to succeed at, however I recall Colin McComb saying that failing in this game has sometimes more interesting consequences, so I'm letting my failures ride!Also, ended up at a bar for psycics and spent probably 2 housrs in there alone.  Ran into an NPC from Torment, very cool, and also had to do a few very interesting things with the NPCs in there.  I have to tell you, this bar, so far, is my favorite part of the game.   The folks in here were so amazing and the detail written for each made me care and worry about each one of them.  So great.===========18 Hours inMain Quest: Alright, so i'm making headway on the main quests now.  I have to say that i'm finding it quite interesting but also i'm getting very curious to see what role my character is going to play here.  The sheer amount of castoffs i'm running into is making me feel far  ""less special' that I did at the start.  I think it's interesting to talk to the others but we seem to be a dime a dozen - which could be the point - The Changing God apparently changed bodies every 10-20 years.  Just not sure if i totally dig this aspect of the main story.  I wanna be SPECIAL DAMNIT!Bugs: As for bugs, I've noticed that long conversations bog down the game.  Some conversations with so many responses are the problem.  But this is easily fixed by stoppiong the dialog and starting again.Environments: They continue to be quite engaging and some of the NPCs are seriously funny.Items and quests:  So great.  Everything is interesting and the quests have lots of depth.  They definiteyl spent a lot of time making these both meaningful.Consequences: Definitely continue to feel i'm making an impact and i'm leaving a trail of broken situations i will need to see the counter-conclusions to in my NEXT play through.===========25 Hours inMain Story: Progressing through the main story - still quite interesting.  Making little progress on it though, so many fun side quests!  I have made some seriously f'd up decisions but that's how it goes in a Torment game : )  next play through I'll switch things up and see how things turn out on the flipside.Environments: I'm in the bloom now - what a great environment.  It's like a mix between the alien nest in Aliens and The Thing.  It's truely unique and the quests and the items and the interations that are possible in such a wild blend of environemtns make for such a great experience.  My favorite zone so far - just so much depth it's great.Special call out to the Doctors in the bloom - very funny dialog.Items and quests: The items i'm obtaining and the things I've been able to do with dropped items have been so fun.  So many unique itemts to use and figure out.  Dependant on your skills, you're able to use unique items by fiddling with them.  Hope I keep finding them, they're so interesting.Bugs: No bugsNext up - the Ascention!Highly recommended so far, more to come.			"

												Amazing story!  If you like Planescape Torment you will like this too.  They have gotten a lot of critizism for the lack of character ""descriptors""  or alternate classes basically.  However I believe that to be a poor critizism becase if they had encluded all these alternative descriptors, it wouldn't have changed the end product much at all.  It's a story driven CRPG and the story and your choices are what matter.  People are mad they don't get a word next to their name and a bonus percentage to another skill.  Which would change little to nothing, you might use less intellect points here or there but the story would remain.  Do you critize PS:T for having a lack of classes?  No, you don't because it's about the story, which is why the two games are so similar.  The stories and quests in both games can be very interesting.  I found Tides of Numenera's combat system to my liking.  It would have been nice to have the ability to increase the difficulty as I found the combat a bit easy, though I haven't finished the game.  This is because I've completed every quest I started; because they are so ineresting.  So I guess I out leveled most the content.This game was very nostalgic of Baulders Gate and PS:T.  I loved it and it deserver a better rating than it currently has on Steam.  I've aready addressed why there complaint about descriptors is irrevelant, such contect would change little.			"

												This may have the Grand Daddy most RPGs would love, it simply falls way short of the new generation of kick-started Classic RPGS.Firstly the class design is odd and takes a while to actually know how when you'll get new active abilities.  Most games offer new active abilities every level, and TON gives them every 5, in their hybrid system.I was getting into the odd system during the game, and when I finally felt the system was going somewhere, I hit the level cap at for all but in name Level 4.So the class design is very poor, as it simply doesn't have time to grow over the game as my second point is the game is way too short.It may boast 1 million words, but frankly when a world is so small you wonder where the dev time has gone?Add to that the confusion sometimes in conversation between multiple people on the screen, when you only get the name of the person talking, in a wall of text.  Simply we have come to expect character portraits of speaking characters in the game, and even the dev teams Wasteland 2 did it, so what where the artists actually doing?So all in all, a disappointment.- Class system not given time to develop (small cap)- Small World- No clear path for expansion (Story opens and closes fully)And would not recommend only for the die hard CRPG fans like myself hungry for the next one to drop!Better choices:  the excellent ""Shadow Run Returns"" (Sci-fi) or ""Wastleland 2"" (Post-Apoc)			"

												backed this on kickstarter beeing a fan of the original torment:planescape. Having lots of text was rather a neccesity back then, than a design choice. Feels more like a book at times, than an actual game. with a book though, you could at least use your imagination about how the characters look. here sadly, you have to deal with the most ugly characters possible. clunky models and weird animations. The models in wasteland 2 were allready bad, but at least you could change the portraits. "

												Truelly the spiritual heir to Planescape Torment, and in a number of areas significantly better. Rather than stat thresholds the use of chance, edge and effort create a great and engaging game mechanic. The use of death and failure to open up alternate developments in plot is fantastic. So many items and associated mechanics with items such as cyphers, oddities and artifacts, each giving so much more in gameplay possibility whilst painting an ever richer lore. Skills, Foci and items make charachter development far more meaningful than just unlocking extra dialouge options. Turn based combat that allows you to use elements of the battlefield, interaction with items and persons in handcrafted scenarios known as crises make both dispute resolution and combat enthralling. 10/10 Extremely pleased I kickstarted this great game.

												Well, I funded this game before trying Planescape back in 2013 or so.  I then tried Planescape and thought it was extremely boring.  It just didn't have a good balance of story and gameplay.  It really was a interactive book.  If I had tried P:T before funding this one, I probably would not have funded it.  Definately not my cup of tea.  I do look forward to reading the wiki though as the story seems like it is interesting, I just don't want to read through 1 million lines of text to get to the end.  Bottom line is this, if you like reading (which I don't), you will like this game, the premise is interesting.  Know though, that gameplay is pretty much non-existant, similar to Planescape.  I personally, like a good balance of both gameplay and story.			"

												Not as good as I hoped it would be, but still worth the time and money. The overall story, while full of potential, ends in a non-satisfying way. However, individual quests and side plots in the game more than make up for it. You are immersed in a fascinating world full of possibilities. While I am critical of wasted potential, I definitely enjoyed it and hope that more games would focus on depth and storyline over combat such as this one.			"

												One of the best RPGs in recent years in my opinion. Be prepared to read a lot! And remember to take breaks :)- Couple of times AI couldn't decide what to do in combat and I had to load- Few times I managed break the game or story by doing stuff in wrong order (expected in RPG of this size)- Could have perhaps used one more location. I clockked bit under 60 hours and wished for more.- With right skills talking and influencing becomes bit too overpowered.+ Intresting and refreshing world.+ Companions+ Story+ Talking and interacting with surroundings during crisis (combat)+ You can basically talk your way through the game. I fought propably like ten times during my playthrough.			"

												This game has provided me a hefty amount of nostalgia dude to its cRPG style and graphics, and the setting is extremely thought-provoking. I come from a background of 20+ years of playing many different kinds of RPGs and I am a huge D&D fan as well. This game did an excellent job at its depth of story and lore, its playability, and its respect to the core of what this type of RPG is. What drew me to T:ToN was an opportunity to visit and engage in a fascinating new world, full of excitement, adventure, and wonder. Torment: Tides of Numenara does have a lot of dialogue and reading text is a huge part of the game. So if you have ever enjoyed reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, than this game is right up your alley. Combat isn't the forefront means of handling conflict in this game, so it can seem like it doesn't happen often enough. The combat system does provide something more fresh than the old D&D controls as well, which could feel clunky and burdensome at times. I have put in around 12 hours (already good value) and I've only focused on my one character.Needless to say, I am a huge supporter of this game. In terms of raw utility, this will provide me many hours of good fun.			"

												Currently buggy as Hell. Seems to be only partly complete despite having been in development for 3 years way back when some of us decided to kick start it.Very wordy. Unnecessarily so - there's a lot of boring dialogue. The story could be interesting.For now wait and see what the next few builds bring up.I expect most people now playing it have already paid for it so I've just put this initial review out here and now for those who haven't and are thinking about it and to counter all the people who say it's the most amazing thing ever when it's a very unfinished article.Edit. Ok. Finished it now and have had some time to think about it. It's disappointing, in a word. Not as long as I'd hoped for, not as developed as I'd hoped for, not as interesting, not as fun, not as immersive and the characters ultimately all sound the same. Overall a big let down compared to POE which I kickstarted at the same time and which delivered much more.Double edit. And the time spent on the game includes about 22 hours playing the Alpha: really short game that many have indicated was cut due to one constraint or another (can't be budget, they went way over with their kickstarter and can't be time as they're 3 years late in delivery so can only assume they got crowded out by pizza boxes).Buy it on sale or better still, buy PST and enjoy a damn fine game.

												I backed the kickstarter and waited patiently for the release, I didn't actually realise how much it was delayed but well, here it is and now I've completed it. Others have spoken about InExile and the kickstarter promises and so on, I will just speak about the game.This game is all about the lore and world-building, and everywhere you go in the game there is something to poke and prod at and uncover secrets and memories. Even the loot is mostly unique, giving you little snippets of lost cultures and mysteries to ponder. I love that, and I spent a lot of time pouring over every bit of text I could find. The characters are varied and interesting, pulling from the lore to create a fascinating cast of original characters, which was definitely remiscent of Planescape: Torment. I found the companions a little lacking, though they each stand out they perhaps didn't have as much to say as I would have hoped, and they didn't react to events very often and didn't have much of a part in the final scenes as the companions did in PS:T.The story is obviously the main focus and I'd say it's interesting enough to recommend. It's very much a personal journey and while you do have an effect on the world, it's not your generic world-in-peril kind of stuff which is refreshing. There are some twists and turns and in the end your choices feel meaningful, and present a moral challenge that makes you think beyond ""what is the right choice?""The combat is garbage, what else can I say. Planescape: Torment is probably my favourite game and I feel like it was a massive departure from the spirit of the original game to go with turn-based. In PS:T, the combat was criticised for being too simple and chaotic, but I liked that, and even where it failed to impress it at least went by quickly. The same cannot be said of T:ToN. There is no hurry-up or skip turn button for AI characters, and so in big fights you have to sit and watch them derpily stagger around turn by turn, and if they all decide to gang up on the main character, then too bad load a save or start again with less items. In PS:T you could pause the combat and use a healing item, but in T:ToN if it isn't your turn, too bad you can't do anything. There are at least a couple of fights in the game with an enemy that can one-shot anyone on the screen and if it targets the main character... yeah you guessed it. There are non-combat options to get out of crises or have them not start at all, but due to the turn based nature it can often be frustrating to achieve them when your character is standing right next to the thing but can't interract with it because they have to let themselves get wailed on for ten more turns because that makes sense. In case it isn't obvious I don't like turn based combat, I'll stop ranting about it now. It's not the draw of the game, and I only point out how bad it is so that people don't have any expectations that this game has any kind of decent tactical combat - it doesn't.All in all I think it's a decent shot at a spiritual successor to PS:T, and I'm glad I backed it and played it, and I will play it again in the future to try the different classes and companions. I don't agree with others that the game is too short, I feel the story warranted the length and it feels like value for money to me, especially as it does have some replay value. I don't think it's going to be making my favourite games of all time list, but if you want an interesting story-based RPG then I'd say this is worth your time.			"

I waited for a long time for a RPG that would scratch the same itch as that game, and after more than 15 years I finally found one in Torment: Tides of Numenera.

								Of course it's not a finished game, but..If you were expecting the great return of PS:T, don't. It's not there and signs are it will never get there. The design IQ is not of the same level. * Graphics are unsettling and annoyingly cluttered. They totally went way overboard in depicting the ""whacky"" setting, that a normal area would probably have a few ancient robots made of banana cake, floating eyes with tree shaped black holes above them and a giant tuba encircled by moons of multicolored cheese balls. Basically it's nausea inducing rather than being fantastic or even interesting.* Writing is bad on many levels. It's... it's really bad guys. Sorry.You have these half hour long text-adventures that are grossly over-written, you have writers trying to be ego-tripping-writers to the point where you got characters being written so over the top that they're retard-funny.For example, here's a guy threatening you in TTON: ""Two things are more dangerous than death in this world"".. ""Asking impolite questions of strangers and playing with numenera you don't fully understand"".Who the hell wrote this crap? What the hell could be more dangerous than f*** DEATH?!I mean props for trying to be ""dramatic"" but ""2 things are more dangerous than death"" ?? Why not 3 things? Why not chocolate bunnies? I mean, ""being impolite""?? What?!?!Or why not ""2 things are more dangerous than drinking and driving"" for example? ""2 things are more dangerous than boarding an overloaded elevator""? Maybe ""going outside with wet hair"", But DEATH? srsly??At times it feels like the writers of the game were told to ""write really damn good!"" and overdid it to hilarious effect. It is nothing like the gritty and compelling writing of PS:T, where characters are characters and your guy is a character also.The devs. explained at some point that the dialogue is so godawful because they didn't want to describe your character too much, and so dialogue is mostly ""information"".  I guess that's what you get when you try to make a torment game without feargus urquhart and chris avellone both on the teamAnd there you go. The more I played it the more the comparison to PS:T made the experience a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one for me. So I stopped. Maybe when it's released somewhere in 2065 (it's been delayed like 3 years already)			"

												After finishing the game my impression of this game is a very positive one albeit i feel that inXile did themselves a disservice by closely associating this game with Planescape:Torment as I have seen many try to compare every aspect of the game to PS:T. If they would have created the game without mentioning it being a spiriutal successor peoples expectations would have been different and maybe the reception would have been more positive.If you are a fan of strange and fantastical settings, lore heavy isometric rpgs with more focus on dialogue than on combat i believe you will enjoy this game. The combat is not something to celebrate, but the writing more than compensate for this deficiency.As the combat was not an issue for me and I did not base my expectation on how it compared to PS:T I must say inXile created a good and exciting game. The theme of torment also resonated nicely troughout the game as all the NPCs you can recruit all are tormented by their past.As a last word, if PS:T was a 9/10 this game would be an 8/10. Recommended for all isometric RPG fans. "

												I'm not the best at writing up reviews, so I'll try to keep this fairly basic.The combat system is simple but fair.  There's a lot more of it than most reviews would have you believe if you don't build your character to just talk past everything, however.The setting...I love the setting.  It's the deranged aftermath of multiple apocalypses and ascensions, where the line between science and magic has worn so thin it's almost impossible to tell the difference anymore.And it's very much a proper successor to Planescape: Torment.  More concerned with philosophy than action.Finally...this makes me want more Numenera games.  The system has some very interesting possibilities.			"

												There are some shortcomings, but overall I liked it a lot. I don't know what else people expected from Planescape's ""spiritual successor"". The game focuses on story and writing above all else, it has a huge amount of text, it raises questions about immortality and consciousness, it's full of weird characters, items and locations, and it favors intellect-based characters so much that it's totally unfair. Yep, sounds totally like Planescape to me. It's not AS good, but still good.The only problem for me are companions, their stories just aren't that interesting, except for one or maybe two.Also, why people who have like 60 hours on record complain that the game is short? Seriously. I have 50, that's one playthrough with all sidequests and some save loads to see different outcomes. Even without all that, I think just the main story would be at least 15-20 hours. What the hell, guys.			"

								Gonna give this a negative review, not because the beta doesn't have some good stuff in it but because the company banned me from their forums and steam community - for making one negative critique post about the start of the game.Not only they banned me for critiquing a game im a backer of, and i would of course want to see made better or as good as possible, but their hypocrite ""community moderator"" falsely accused me of ""trolling"" and being insulting and some nonsense about ""not showing mutual respect"" to other posters.He means that their deranged yesmen ""fans"" stared attacking my post and ""me"" with all that he accuses me of. Calling me a troll, responding with utter nonsense and then insults. Those are protected and approved because they dont write any critiques about the beta. Nobody tells them they are trolls and lack ""mutual respect"" because they ""love the game"".The same thing happened with Wasteland 2 and then those who were flinging all the garbage they could come up with (which was pathetic nonsensical diarrhea) at me - were given moderator positions on their forums.So i guess the little newly employed pathetic community moderator - ""developer"" - whatever - whose personal mod for Dragon Age i also criticized for the exact same things as these two games, namely logical inconsistencies and incoherent plots, jumped into panic mode as soon as he saw my single post and rushed to ban me while inventing false accusations. I hope he got a pat on the shoulder for his loyal service.Before i had a chance to write a post about some of the good things in this beta.Height of intelligence and honesty as you can guess.If you want to support such a company, feel free to pay this hugely overpriced beta. I overpaid both games a lot during their kickstarters and this is what i get for it.No doubt the trolls will jump onto this to accuse me of ""thinking i have special rights because i am a backer"" , but in actual reality i only expected i will be able to provide some constructive critiques (which they all were) without being attacked by their ""fans"" and trolls and then getting accused of somehow just attacking them and then banned.Support that hypocrisy. Pay a lot for it. But remember to be a nice little good yes men (or woman) when commenting and attacking anyone who criticizes anything about it, There may be a moderator position in it for you.cmonn Sea, Brother None, scramble to delete this and invent more false accusations. There must be a way.			"

												A tremendous game - well written, set in a fascinating and bizarre world with a compelling story and interesting characters.  The adaptation of the Numenera ruleset, despite a few odd choices, is done very well and rather faithfully.   Especially love the fact that the Conflict system allows you to manuever, bargain, sneak and outthink your foes not just kill them!  A real breath of fresh air among ""old-school"" crpgs being made thesedays that emphasise combat above all else.  If you want to play a grand choose your own adventure with terrific reactivity (your choices do matter!), and stellar writing, Torment:ToN is a winner!			"

												This game is going to be amazing...once the first patch comes out! The setting, writing and the gameplay mechanics are all really good. You can interact with pretty much everything. I spent ten minutes solving the color puzzle in the Order of Truth and was really surprised to get a decent item as a reward...a game that actually rewards you for thinking! That's new.Anyway, I'd wait a few weeks before playing this game until the bugs are ironed out. I just entered my second Crisis, used a special ability and then CTD'd :(			"

												I wasn't a kickstarter and though I've been looking forward to this game as someone who loved Planescape: Torment, I subjected myself to as little hype or foreknowledge as possible.THE SETTING: It's a bit like a cross between Fallout and Planescape. The premise of a Sci-Fi/Fantasy world filled with gadgets that might do something cool or blow your face off is very appealing and could possibly lend itself to all sorts of great stories. Absolutely loved it, I hope they'll make more games that use it in the future. GAMEPLAY: I really like the Crisis system and the idea that you can, and indeed sometimes have to, resolve them without combat. In fact, I experienced so little combat I can't even properly comment on it. STORY: WARNING, SLIGHT SPOILERS. This is where the game lets itself down a bit for me. Of course, I still compare it to Planescape: Torment (which I rate as the best video game of all time, storywise), so it's still not BAD. Just, could be better. I liked the party characters, none of them felt flat or one-dimensional (with the exception of Erritis but perhaps that was intentional). I just wish game developers stopped enforcing arbitrary headcount limits. The foreshadowing you can get with Anamnesis gets a bit spoiler-y at times; I guessed several major plot twists (like the importance of the Ghostly Woman) before I even left the first city.The abrupt ending feels more than a bit rushed and the central question ""What does one life matter?"" gets a bit flimsy at times, where Planescape: Torment's ""What can change the nature of a man?"" never dropped out of focus.Also the final end sequence I hated, for the same reasons I hated Mass Effect 3's ending. Throughout the game, the primary antagonist (The Sorrow) is represented as a hateful force that tries to kill you through no fault of your own and cannot be reasoned with. At the last moment it basically goes ""Turns out trying to kill was really hard, maybe I should just talk to you instead"" and offers the same insane troll logic the Reapers in ME3 used as justification for trying to kill you. And then the game forces you to agree to play along with the Sorrow's one-sided offers for compromise; The only ending where you don't is shown to be a bad one.			"

												I am posting this in part in reaction to the childish negative reviews directed towards inxile that have nothing to do with the game.  This game is amazing and strickingly original and we don't get enough games of this quality that we can afford to post negative reviews for stupid reasons.    Some content was cut?  So, look at the final product.  What are you, five?  Content always gets cut.  The game is strong and feels polished and finished.  The story is great, the world reactive, the writing fun (if a little on the purple prose side of things.)  It's a great RPG with a strong narrative and a fascinating, original setting.  Don't let the crying babies keep you away from this gem.			"

								This is a very buggy game. I highly recommend not purchasing.It's also a terrible spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. Cheap Art and UI design. Woeful performance. Terrible world and lore. Boring characters and a poor attempt at a Torment-like story. The turn-based combat is also boring, so not exactly an improvement over the PS:T combat. What's more, the developers and the publisher Techland are not to be trusted.The people that think this game is good are just the people who spent $100+ in the Kickstarter and are in denial, because who wants to admit they spent a lot of money on something that wasn't a good product ?

So unless you enjoy the journey of debugging and watching a game slowly grow to a finshed state, I'd wait for the final release.			"

								I sat down to enjoy this game mightily as they recently handed all of us kickstarter backers access.Shortly after the character creation process you are introduced into your very first ""fight"", which is basically run up and do automatic damage to 3 creatures. It's story stuff.Except the game is buggy, and 10 out of 10 times I am unable to move or attack. I check the forums and they say to simply reload your game a number of times and you should be good. Except... apparently they've all had this happen to them later in the game where you can actually use the save function.That's right. I went through 5-10 minutes of character creation 10 different times hoping to be able to take actions and combat because I couldn't save and load from somewhere closer, and with no success.Currently, I would warn everybody from buying this game, because who wants to be the poor sap who paid for it and can't play it. (But hey, supposedly it's complete from start to finish!)			"

								Ill start by saying im a massive planescape: torment fan. If i was reviewing a game similar to that i would be totally happy and giving it a great thumbs up. The mistake the developer made was saying it would be similar to it in the first place.If your buying this game forget the notion it will be anything like Planescape torment, nothing apart from the art style is anything like the old game. You will find no interesting characters, no interesting areas, no interesting quest in your first 6-7 hours of play in the first area, almost no combat to speak of, no humour. Its just NOT FUN. Well lets look at the positives charater creation is cool, until you relise you get the same stupid looking character model/ portrait no matter the choices, i mean the planescapes main character looked terrible but it was totally apart of the story why he looked like a corspe and thats what made him unique. Animations and graphics have evolved due to technology but it displays some of the worst character models ive ever seen, i can barely see the difference the species of creatures.Out of all these type of game so far its the worst ive played, once its finished ill review again but hell its not worth the money, looks like a million dollar cash grab to me.

								Wasted a lot of money to kickstart this supposed game at a high tier, just found out that release was delayed so that they could turn it into an unplayable console port piece of crap.I paid for what I was told would be a spiritual successor to the classic Planescape: Torment, not to be a tester for a console ""game"" that console players won't appreciate in any case and that PC players won't ever be able to play properly and that won't do anything but spit on and tarnish the memory of the classic it's supposedly inspired on.Not only that, but in their infinite greed they also released the beta (which was supposed to be a limited kickstarter reward, on which I wasted a significant amount of money thinking they were worth supporting intead of scammers of the worst kind, and which is so far too incomplete and buggy that selling it as a ""game"" quite probably can legally be considered fraud) as ""early access"", in an effort to get more poor idiots to do their testing job for them and pay for the privilege.This was the last drop of unspeakably nauseous filth (and a quite massive drop at that) on an already on the edge of overflowing glass. Inxile just got exiled to my boycott category (as if the unfinished disappointment of Wasteland ½ wasn't enough). I doubt I'll be playing (to the extent that a console port can be ""played"") this if it ever gets released for PC in any somewhat playable state (don't count on it), and I most certainly won't be wasting more money on any other piece of crap this despicable bunch of traitorous greedy shameful turncoats might extrude in the future.EDIT: Well, look at that, now (a month before release, just like the scammers Braben and Frontier!) it turns out[www.rpgcodex.net] that they've ""had to cut""[www.dsogaming.com] (that is, never intended to implement and simply used them as bait to get more money) one third of the planned companions, the second major hub (the Oasis of M'ra Jolios), crafting, the lore compendium, the italian translation, half of the spanish translation, and who knows what else (so, basically, most of the stretch goals and a significant part of the base ""game"", or the whole ""game"" for italian players who want to play in their language and who backed this thing because they were told they'd be able to).I'm sure the ""game"" (at this rate it'll barely be a demo in the best case) being a console port had absolutely nothing to do with that... :(Also, I already said it... but revealing this a ♥♥♥♥ing month before release is Frontier Developments levels of devious scamming.What the ♥♥♥♥ is it about game development that seems to turn people into pure unadulterated human filth..? :(Or maybe it's just that gamers are simply easier to scam and thus the sector attracts more despicable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s..?

												Like Planescape: Torment, this game tells its stories through reams and reams of text. Unlike Planescape, it's horribly overwritten. The writers have used 50 words where 5 would do. As this is pretty much a massive choose-your-own adventure novel, the tortured prose made it tiresome and unplayable for me. Also, the game doesn't seem to have a connection with the original Torment game, other than the main character being an amnesiac who's recovering their memories - an RPG cliche that should be killed with fire.

								I'm not the demographic for this game.I didn't play the previous Torment, but I was excited due to the positive feedback from the kickstarter and the overwhelming response from nearly every review online.That being said, my objective observation is that this story is not a game. It is a build your own adventure book in which you'll traverse a wall of text. After twelve hours of ""playing"" this game I was just... bored. The ""combat"" is so sparse that you could even argue that it isn't necssary, and that the whole ""game"" could be ported to a kindle with the same value. I'd rather have read this as an adventure book. It would have not brought forth expectations of 21st century animation and probably wouldn't have cost $45.			"

												It took about 30 minutes of trying to stay awake reading stuff just to get to the character creation screen. Then you step out  into a tutorial fight, ok, getting somewhere....and the game crashes. Apparently it does not save the character you just spent creating.....and so if I wanted to play again, i would need to start over again. No thanks.  "

								Not impressed.The lack of D&D in this game was a real letdown.The gameplay is dull... the ""otherness"" of it is so/so...I didn't feel engaged with it, with the story, with the characters or with the background mechanics of it. It's a shame bu there you go.If you think this will be like Planescape - Torment, then I suggest you reconsider.			"

								I think somebody needs to say this. It took 4 years or something for these people to come up with this titbit of rubbish. The latest patch changed very little and to get advice like we already know the text doesn't fit in dialogue box and we're working on it. WOW. Pease guys shelve the product, keep my money I don't care but don't ♥♥♥♥ up torment. And another piece of advice stop trawling the kindergarten for your writers the story is so unoriginal. A person who doesn't know who he is, anybody recognise that one. This is terrible.			"

								Contains spoilers. You were warned.To those who think im being unreasonable or just hating on the game: please go back to your fallouts 4, wastelands 2 and other garbage hailed as universal masterpiece. If however you played things like Consortium, Age of Decadence, Silent Storm Sentinels, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines or had an irl roleplaying adventure with a competent DM, and enjoyed them, - you are likely to agree with me here. The game is at best a 7/10, despite all the promises and hollow boasts at how incredible its gonna be, it doesnt deliver. It hasnt delivered the experienced it strived and promised to. If you disagree with that, hey im happy you are happy with the game, because i am not.I have concearns about this game. I absolutely love the concept, how its realised however... i played just one hour got annoyed with some things to be honest. A lot of people are giving this a 10/10 straight up, talking about how great it is, and for the most part its pretty solid, however: there is room for doubt. During my 1st launch i died before spawning, *spoilers* you are ejected from a sort of cocoon down the planet, so i figured might aswell get there faster. Dead. But if you sit around in midair pondering existance you dont die despite falling god knows the distance. Now ingame the reason for why you die in one condition and dont in another : Terminal velocity, nevermind the distance its the speed that kills you. Great. Moving on: the tutorial is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and in theory as you see memories of others it could be incredible, what it fails to do however is give any sort of direction or motivation. Oh hey its another faceless husk i never seen before and i get to decide what happens... oh boy, where you pretty much select what stat you want to increase, which is probably far from what you would have done if you gave 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about the characters involved.Writing is top notch with a few bumps here and there but its all too ♥♥♥♥ing convenient. Oh hey check it out! There are 5 tanks and consoles, oh gee and 5 enemies 1 per console who could have guessed. Oh and the radiant light vanquishes yeh yeh great tides n stuff.I sat there for an hour (or less i might have went to cook something) being bored out of my mind and i love rpgs. I had no empathy to anyone involved for all i care the characters should have all died. It wasnt some intense situation there is no sense of urgency or impact or pretty much anything other then tedium forced upon you. QUICK THERE IS NO TIME TO EXPLAIN GET THIS DONE! OH YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE? WELL LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT FOR 20 MINUTES WE GOT TIME! You just proceed at your own convenience, where is the monsters starting attack midsentese because you are ♥♥♥♥ing too slow? Where is need to survive? Why should i care for a hundred characters im gonna see for just 20 seconds of screen time? Its 2d and yet it lags like no other. There is no optimisation whatsowhever. And on top of all that, they hired Mitsoda to help them sink this boat. The game has a great potential, it can be amazing, hell i ONLY saw tutorial, nothing more but it was enough for me to be dissuaded from exploring any more at least till they release this. Its a no for me atm, only people i can recommend this to are avid RPG fans, game has some interesting things to offer, but not too many and are outweighted by all the negatives.Update11/06/2016: Well, they made an update, removing the horrid starting battle/introduction to tides, replacing it with no introduction, random spam of TIDE INCREASED with no explantion on why or what. Sometimes it just keeps spamming same one aswell GOLDEN INCREASED, so after about 20 blips of it i thought ok i might have it up in the sky with that value by now, - turns out it didnt even move. Battles! The famous ""we'll have about a dozen crisises"" yeh no wonder, with a fighting system where you cant attack or cast anything, no ♥♥♥♥ing wonder you dont want any more of that. So right now, tides is a talking simulator. So i decided to give it a go after people said 'its just tutorial"" and went out there, talked to people a bit - 1st area there was some orc in stasis, weird looking semiconstruct, cultists and quantum clock, in a bar next to it - a psychic cafe in which a few ghosts, an alien and an otherworldly creature preside, all like 5 minutes of walk, not to mention talking digging insects that were brought from another plane, yet EVERYONE is losing their♥♥♥♥♥♥that you are just another body used up and discarded, which apparently were plenty before. Half the npcs ♥♥♥♥ing met you before anyway, others know who you are just because, some are psychics, some have spies that you cant ever see, others just deduce or heard rumors. Everyone is so ♥♥♥♥ing well informed, its a wonder peasants havent rebelled by now, since everyone is so incredibly observant, they see corruption, some can even see into the ♥♥♥♥ing future and whatnot yet no one does nothing. Thats another thing, so you got an npc who can see the future, but she doesnt know hers. Makes sense, just like so many other things. There are A LOT of problems in the writing. Some things are done right, i loved some of the npcs, those were brilliant like that girl who kept yelling that she is CHAMPION OF LAND YOU'LL NEVER SEE, or the dude who crashed and burned, the digging insects were done well, the scummy negotiator, - a lot of things are done really well, not impressive, but fun and enjoyable. Point being, good thing you are gonna delay this till 2017 there is A LOT of work ahead of you. Get to fixing.			"

								Yall giving this game positive reviews lately haven't tried to play it.  No lie, there's way you could've played it in the past 2 months and given a good review.I've had this game from day 1 and i'll give everyone the positives first.  The storyline, mechanics, and gameplay are the best ever for the genre.  oh wait, you're saying,  then why is this review negative.  Well, now we hit the meat and potatoes.  This is literally the buggiest, quirkiest, non-saving, random, acts however game I have ever played, been gaming for 30 yrs btw.  It wasn't bad as they developed the game, but they very obviously have spent zero time/money on testing or correction of feedback.I have approximately 20 hrs of play time on the latest update to get less than 2 hrs play time because the game is that broken.  I am a Planescape die-hard and I might swear off this style game just because of how broke♥♥♥♥♥♥this is.			"

												I think they've used text too heavily in this game. Many uninteresting characters can have pages of text.I think the pacing is completely wrong in this game.

I backed this game on Kickstarter and frankly, I did not expect soo unplayable product. I've waited quite a bit to play it so I'm prepared to wait a bit longer for a patch. Though, the first impression is already ruined.  I do hope that after the patches this game will turn out to be good.			"

								I'm not liking this game at all and certainly don't recommend it. I paid full price and can't get past 2.5 hours. This is that bad. Character generation is needlessly long. I sit through a question/answer sequence that ultimately means nothing in gameplay. Unlike the old Ultima, there's no distinction for answering different ways. Just different numbers in meaningless stats.  The story? This isn't one of those 'gamers hate to read' comments. It's simply not an interesting story and THAT's why I don't like reading it. Combat is wonky and unintuitive. The only attraction is the artwork. If you like this perspective and Baldur's Gate feel, get Pillars of Eternity. It's out of 'beta'.  "

I'm sure I'm missing out a great story, but I have no desire to go back.Edit: Commenter makes a good point, no fault of the game that I can't stand the combat mode of the game. But I only have two options, recommend or not. I wish there were a middle of the road option since that seems to be more what I thought of it.			"

I feel like I bought a half-game.  I'm not super happy with some of the crashes that have forced me to start entirely over.
