												This game is awesome. If you love squad-based action/strategy games as much as I do, you will undoubtedly agree. The character progression is great, the loot is bountiful and the gameplay is addictive. But what makes my heart skip a beat is the combination of believable physics with highly destructible levels... Enemies in the next room? Empty that machine gun into the door and catch them off guard. Goons in the basement? Detonate a charge and bring the floor/ceiling down on their head. Pesky fiend hiding in the library? Have your skilled sniper fire a high-caliber round through two walls and a bookcase and right between the ribs... Take all that, set it in an increasingly fantastical version of WW2 (mechs, anyone?) and you have a recipe for good times. If the visuals and presentation were better, even a little bit, this would be fighting for a spot in my 'top 10 favorite games of all time' list.			"

												In the house across the street there are several Nazi's bunkered down and need to be eliminated.  Do you:A) Set up heavy machine gun fire and unload into the house until it's a smoldering pile of rubble?B) Hide in the shadows and plant explosives on key structural supports and bring the building down on the Nazi's?C) Blow a hole in the wall with your bazooka and rush the Nazi's from behind?D) Kick in the door and take them from the front like the badass you are?If you answered E, ""why can't I do all of those things?"", well you're in luck because with Silent Storm you can!  But wait, there's more!  he ways to complete your mission are only bounded by your imagination in this Nazi killing simulator.			"

												Silent Storm is one of those games that you wish they'd remake for modern PC... Take a special squad composed of sniper, soldier, grenadier, engineer, scout, and medic, and take them on different missions with or without allied help, as they use WW2 weapons to take out enemies, capture vital intelligence, and discover a threat to the world that perhaps, trumps the fight agains the mortal enemies... You can play as either the Axis or the Allies (slightly different missions and character choices). This is turn-based tactical combat done right (not that X-COM is wrong, but this game, with destructible environments (try the grenades, explosives, and rockets) and ragdoll physics gives very visceral and satisfying combat (complete with blood spatters on the walls) that somehow XCOM seem to lack. The main complaint is the game turned a bit too sci-fi later and that's very annoying, and the end fight is also extremely annoying. Still, enjoy the experience.			"

THE BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUTHere's the short version or the TL;DR version.Silent Storm is an amazing Turn Based Strategy RPG that has the most depth of any game i've played in its genre. It has hundreds of authentic and detailed WW2 weapons and equipment, challenging gameplay, attention to detail, fully destructable buildings and cover that realistically break apart and degrade, simple to learn combat system that is the deepest i've seen in this genre, very good RPG systems with Skills and ""Perk"" style rewards for leveling up with branching trees, 6 different classes each with specific perks and play styles, open ended missions set on levels similar in style to X-COM or Jagged Alliance, excellent inventory system, a choose and build your own squad mechanic with perma death to all squad mates and just an all around charm that lasts through almost the entire experience of both games. I probably forgot to list a few more awesome things, but there are some not so good things too. The Voice acting is rather poor and bland, the game can be fairly difficult to get accustomed to, the story is predictable and dull, the Stealth System never seemed to work very well and toward the end of the game your squad becomes overpowered due to the introduction of some fictional weapons and technology that detracts from the otherwise extremely challenging and detailed WW2 setting. FULL REVIEWTHE GOODThis little known game is actually in my top 3 video games of my lifetime so far. I picked it up used (back when used PC games were sold in stores) at a Gamestop by chance. I saw it, by chance, on the shelf and saw the WW2 theme and all the different guns and cool stuff on the box and i decided to give it a chance. Little did I know..... It would become one of my all time favorite video games and my number 2 series that i desperately want to see get a true sequel. Since i bought it, which was back in 2003 or so, i've never met anyone else who had ever played it and when i saw it on Greenlight, I wanted so badly to see it get onto Steam because of how amazing a Turn-based Strategy RPG it is. It never got any real recognition nor any major awards, which was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me (Journalists only give a real ♥♥♥♥ about games from Big names, like always and forever), but its honestly a ♥♥♥♥ing excellent game.THE COMBAT SYSTEMIts more or less a hybrid of X-COM and Jagged Alliance. It has Turn-Based combat, which displays percentages on your chances to land a hit or sucessfully throw a grenade accurately. Theres some randomness to the game, sometimes a stray bullet will ricochet and strike an ally, enemy or barrell and cause some damage. Environments are completely destructable. This was the 1st game that had true destructable terrain and cover that mattered in game. It was years ahead in destructible buildings and made on a much smaller budget. The combat, for a turn-based game, is the most in depth of any turn-based strategy games i've played. Its a bit convoluted, but it does a great job of conveying information on any given action. In combat you can literally go anyway you want. You get 6 soldiers, send 1 soldier to a high window to be a sharpshooter, send 2 around the building on a flanking manuever, keep 3 together to flush out enemies and get their position. Once you see them, you can kill them anyway you want. Sniper shot to a specific body part, grenade in the window the nazis are standing at, spray an SMG or heavy machine gun and hope some of the bullets penetrate the wall or blow open a hole to get through to them or you can go balls out and fire a bazooka round at the window, blowing a gaping hole into the building and destroying the floor, wall and any furniture in the area.THE WEAPONS AND WEAPON SYSTEMThe other awesome part, that i love the most, this game has A METRIC ♥♥♥♥ TON of different weapons. Each with specific stats and all of them are realistic and accurately modeled to their real life counterparts with authentic names. Near the end of the campaign you'll start to fight and comandeer Panzerkleins which do use some fictional weapons, but the rest are historically accurate which always made me giddy. I love WW2 era weapons, and this game has them on lockdown. Not only guns, theres dozens of different grenades, medical items, ammo types, engineering tools and landmines that are all historically accurate too and add some extra depth to your combat abilities and options. They even went as far as to have a ""Weapon Familiarity"" system, where if your character uses the same weapon for a long time, he becomes more skilled with it. A nice touch.THE RPG SYSTEMNext to talk about, the RPG leveling and skill progression. You make your main character at the start of the game. After the 1st mission or 2 you then get to choose from a list of soldiers with specific personalities, backgrounds and classes. Theres 6 classes, Sniper, Medic, Soldier, Scout, Grenadier or Engineer. They all start with the class skills at a higher level and develop them as they use those skills. Kill some enemies, your combat skills improve. Patch up a squad mate, your Medic skills improve. As they improve, you can use better items. Theres something like 12 or 14 skills in total and each level allows you to unlock a choice of 3 or 4 different ""Perks"" on a level tree. Each class has unique perks, though some of them are shared. By the end of the game your characters could be a legendary marksman, an expert medic who can use any medical item and good with a rifle, or a grenadier whos as accurate with a Grenade as an NFL Quarterback with a football.THE OTHER COOL STUFFCharacter models themselves are extremely detailed in the equipment they carry. If you put some German M-24 Stick Grenades into a characters inventory he will have the grenades hanging from his belt or his chest slings. Knifes, pistols, ammunition all show up and have unique models for what types of ammo they carry. The inventory system itself is similar to Resident Evil 4 or Deus Ex Human Revolution in that it kinda becomes a minigame trying to cram as much equipment in as possible. After you gear up you use a map screen that you travel over to get to a mission. Random encounters can pop up on the map and you can choose to attack random enemies. Theres about 20ish missions, some take a long time to complete, some are short but thats not including random encounters. THE NOT SO GOODROUGH AROUND THE EDGESCan't have the good without the bad. The problems i've had with the game, and i've played both games about 6 or 7 times a piece, were the AI, the Stealth System, the Voice Acting, the Panzerkleins and the Story. AI can be braindead, but it they're still punishingly difficult. Voice acting is very low budget. Panzerkleins make you overpowered at the end of the game and the Stealth system never seemed exactly as it should, though it still functions somewhat. IN SUMMARYI'm out of characters to use, so in summary, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and its positives far, far outweigh its negatives. For $10, its damn worth trying and its extremely replayable. I tried to mention all the awesome mechanics and details but I know i missed or had to leave out a few. Get it for yourself, it never got the attention it deserved. It was a WW2 X-Com/JA Hybrid that was built on the perfect engine for this genre. Its in my top 3 games, its up there with Metal Gear Solid 3 for me and thats saying a lot for a budget game that was $40 brand new in 2003. TRY THIS GAME!!! And if you like it, please spread the word of this gem :)			"

												I've been playing a lot of turn-based squad tactics wargames in my life, every now and then. And of whole this genre (or sub-genre) I place Silent Storm in the top 5 of them all. Even after 12 years, with out-dated graphics (which is still looks quite decent, though), with some flaws in the late progress in the game (yeah, I guess you've already heard of Panzerkleins) - still it is a masterpiece.Why I praise this game so high? There are several reasons:1) game's mechanics at first seems quite similar to Jagged Alliance. And that's not a flaw, because JA2 was one of the major swallowers of my time in the early 00's, compared only with Civilization 3 and TES Morrowind... More to it, Silent Storm is not trying to wear JA shoes, it walks its own path, and somewhat similar technical solutions only helps to get familiar with the game.2) Game's setting puts us in the perils of WW2, but, despite the fact it was created by Russians (maybe because of it), it lacks many of typical unnatural cliche, WW2 games usually so full of. I can't say that a gameplot is a ""War and Peace"" in a new cover, but it is certainly a result of good thought. It is clever all the way through, it is not using dehumanization, so common in the late media (you know, ""good guys - bad guys"" pattern). Everybody are players in the plot, which makes it sound like a good spy story, with unexpected trivials and rivals along the way. And all of that still plays like Jagged Alliance! You get it now? Nival created a very distinct game, but was clever enough not to distress people with new gamedesign decisions. So it has a very comforting start, and then the tide catches you, and you swim into completely another world of alternative history, where Nazis was not a menace, but just one of parts of the long-going power struggle, with their own hopes to better future... I don't making excuses for Nazis doings in the WW2, mind it! Many of my relatives died because of them, and I hold that score with me. But then again. Axis warmachine was very far of those mindless Ubersoldiers from Castle Wolfenstein, and it is good that at least somewhere soldiers of Axis block shown as they were.Oh, well, I'm skidded away a bit, talking about game's topic. Let's just say, game gives a very thorough dive into the WW2 reality... and then adding some spice with technologies-never-existed. Most of the players like the game more without that spicy part, but hey! All other stuff is great without any doubts!3) And of all of the great stuff in that game, one of the most exciting features is the level of destruction you can add to anything around you. By that parameter, Silent Storm stands proudly above all other tactical games up to this moment! Battlefield Bad Company 2? Mercenaries 2? There are so little games where you can level literally everything to the pebble and dustl! But in the Silent Storm it is not only fun to do. You actually training your characters skills with every shot and explosives usage! So please, don't hold yourself! Shoot through walls and ceilings, blow everything apart! Become the weapon of mass destruction! Groovy!Okay, let's finish all that praising: game has some minor flaws, but they are very little comparing to the amount of fun that game can bring to you. And it is on sale now! Go for it, right away!Mark 9.1/10			"

												How you lose a normal TBS game:The enemy slowly picks off your squad because they are way too powerful for you to take on.How you lose Silent Storm:You take a shot, it misses and goes through the floor hitting an explosive barrel. The resulting chain reaction destroys 75% of the house and kills all of your squad except the guy who took the shot. He is then blown out of a second story window by a guy with a machine gun.10/10 would become flat like beaver again.			"

												Besides decent overall game mechanics, there are also some things that make Silent Storm particularly cool.I have never seen so well implemented environmental damage in any game, it beats all the modern strategy games and even the original X-COM (1994). It is just beautiful to see how building can partially (or entirelly) collapse depending on how many holes you have shot or blown up to its walls. That is not all however, as also the objects (your cover besides buildings) get damaged and in the end destroyed. It is an awesome feeling when after an intese firefight you look at the map and see how a peaceful English town or a industrial complex got turned into a ruined ghost town. These well modelled mechanics aren't of course just graphical (although they do look great for a game this old), but they play an important role regardless of what tactics you use.Another thing is the original story, for Silent Storm isn't just another WW2 game that we have seen so many already. It becomes quite clear at the moment when futuristic laser weapons and power armors enter the stage.Besides those two, there are these other basic features bringing depth to these games, like managing your team members, equipment, gaining experience, varying challenging tactical situations and such. Silent Storm is a well done game with interesting mechanics and other innovations.If I had to address some of the biggest issues, they would propably be stability and voice acting. I did experience a few crashes, but they really weren't anything I couldn't cope with, thanks to autosaving even if I did forget to save often enough. The voice acting on the other hand is something between hilariusly bad and making you want to cry, but anyone who doesn't know what eg. Finnish should sound like is propably spared from the worst parts. All in all, we are not really talking about any game breaking issues.Silent Storm is one of my favourite squad-based strategy games among Jagged Alliance 2 and X-COM series. If you are into these kind of games, I really do recommend trying Silent Storm.			"

												If you played Jagged Alliance but didn't like the overview map mechanics, micro-management, or realism, then this game is for you. It doesn't have an overhead map, but it adds a lot to JA's combat. Also it's way more silly. You can blow a hole through a wall with a machinegun.This game is like JA's goofy nephew.			"

												Silent Storm itself is a great game as was said many times in the comments section. It feels like an Xcom game but without the need for knowing what to research into and all that; it just puts you straight into the action. The destructive environment mechanics work absolute wonders in the game and, in my opinion, has never been properly done in another tactical strategy game like it. There isn't really enough time in the world for me to talk about why the game is amazing.However amazing it may be, it isn't without faults. Its voice acting is pretty obviously bad (though they did improve it a bit in Silent Storm: Sentinels... which is probably the only good part about that game), the graphics did not age well at all and, one thing I never see mentioned is just how badly Panzerkleins ruin the game. It's a nice idea but it really, really takes away from the tactical aspect of the game; Panzerkleins, in my opinion, aren't fun to use, fight or just anything at all, really. While in the sequel, they do include a stat called ""Penetration"" to compensate for Panzerkleins, even then, they just seem like extremely cheesy units, especially when used by the player, who is essentially unkillable in one due to the AI not knowing what to do against a Panzerklein. It just really muddled the experience for me in an otherwise exceptional tactical strategy game.As for the sequel, I do not recommend it... at all. It does try to be a successor to Silent Storm but the content that carried over feels more lazily thrown together than anything so it just sort of ends up being much more bland than the original with a plotline that really doesn't make even the slightest bit of sense (it picks up after WW2, i.e., the first game, and carries on the plot of a secret organization looking to rule the world, yadda yadda, you've seen that coming a mile away anyway and then manages to become even more generic in the sequel, including that you start the game as some random person who was kidnapped for reasons the game doesn't explain and brought into a supposed secretive special forces who just take you in after your escape because... reasons.) and, worst of all to me, has almost no destructible environments at all! That's what really made the first game unique to me was just how you can be creative with how you engaged the enemy but most of SS:S just takes place in either indestructible corridors (yes, including an obligatory sewer level) or pointless destructible maps, such as a mission that is supposed to be conducted in stealth but is one of the few maps that has destructibility in it. Lastly, they added a currency system that just proves why currency should not be a thing in a tactical strategy game with RPG elements since it ultimately just turns the game into farming ""Random Encounters"" that aren't at all random.Long story short, I highly recommend the 1st game to anyone who enjoys xcom-like strategy games but do be wary as eventually it does take a turn for the worse once Panzerkleins are introduced and, unless you really and I mean, REALLY like Silent Storm, don't waste your time on SS:Sentinels.

												For any of you that remember the boardgame 'Ambush!' (by Victory Games) or the PC title 'Soldiers at War' (by SSI), this game will probably seem familiar to you.  It's a full 3D, turn-based, World War II tactical combat game where you control individual members of your squad in special ops missions.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Pros:* The AI (while not fantastic) is pretty good - or at least seems pretty good - definitely going to give you a better run for your money than most games* Everything is destructible – walls, doors, chests, windows, and even trees and floors!  It's a game like no other* It's very addicting.  I have over 200 hours playing it and have still not come close to being bored with ANY part of the game yet* Game physics are amazing - easily beats out some triple-A games with how well they're implemented - nothing beats killing an enemy a level above you by blowing up the floor below him* The array of weapons and ammunition types are awesome (most completely accurate, given the genre)* The music is not bad... it'll either get on your nerves or grow on you - or both ;)- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Cons: (in paragraph form with explanations)Most complain about the dated graphics, but while I love the jazzy newer games like Diablo III, I found the visuals in Silent Storm (or S2) to be quite functional... even sort of impressive.The voice acting sucks, but the cheesy quips the soldiers (both friendly and enemy) say are so funny, you wind up almost liking it better that way.The missions are all based on this clandestine what-if slant on World War II (such as fully uniformed Germans operating with near impunity all throghout Britain, or Axis commandos striking targets they never even dreamed of having access to in real life).  This (IMHO) is really no issue – just simply pretend everything is happening somewhere in occupied France or something.A really odd game decision made by the developers was to include (later in the game) such things as laser guns, PanzerKlien (near-impenetrable armor that makes soldiers look like space robots), and modern-day-esque weapons.  This has game-altering impact and is the source of many complaints regarding gameplay.  There is however an easily found and installed mod that removes all this wacky stuff from the game entirely (replacing it with better equipped enemy soldiers... which works).- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -All and all, I love this game and HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone who likes turn-based games and World War II tactical combat.  Hell, even people who play games like Jagged Alliance, X-Com or Fallout-Tactics will likely enjoy this as well.			"

												This is one of those few games, which I played the hell out of when I was a kid. Since I remember playing video games, I always loved those games that tried something new or different, regardless of game genre. Silent Storm was my first game that was turn-based, resource management, 3D strategy game that was set in World War 2 with the addition of a sci-fi element. What's not to love?

												I've only play a little on the steam version of this game but I played the retail version a great bit (100+ hrs).  One of my favorite games. It takes a bit of getting used to and, of course, moves a lot slower than many games today.A few warnings, in S2 the skill leveling is broken, making some of the classes much less useful than they should be.S3 fixed the skill issue. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be the mods from teh community on steam.  Some of those added tremendously. It takes some tial and error on some missions as your usual playstyle might not be the best fit.  And in one mission in S3 (the stealth mission) many have thought that it is impossible to meet all the goals. Without spoiling it I'll just say it isn't.			"

												My favourite tactics game of all time!Awesome graphic design (I love those HUD icons, they are no worse than in Warcraft 3!). Awesome gameplay (you can destroy literally everything, shoot through walls, make holes in them, explode buildings; also on higher difficulty levels you must carry your fainted companions out of the battlefield). Awesome replayability (this game has random set of story missions every time you play, and mission order is nonlinear; also there are random encounters and special encounters). Awesome atmosphere (story and musics are quite nice, graphics are on the level of modern indie games, except no shaders).Awesome everything else (really, not much cons for this game, a couple of glitches on modern systems and sometimes cheating AI).Oh, and Sentinels add-on makes the game even better and has a new storyline. It also has widescreen, money system and good old companions from the original.10/10P.S. I run this game on Win8 and no major glitches except for the graphical ones, which are not so annoying.			"

												This game is awesome!  A steal when it's on sale.  It plays like the old Jagged Alliance 2, except the buildings in this game are destructible, which adds a new dimension to a fire fight when acetylene tanks are in the background.The voice acting has it's moments in the game, it's intentionally hammed up for laughs.  This alone makes it a worthwhile purchase even at regular price.Just let yourself in with grenades and roll out the red carpet with an MG, anything goes!  And just in case it doesn't remember to save often.  I see myself having many late nights trying to finish a mission with this game.			"

												Despite this game being almost a decade old (in about 5 days it will be) this game is still amazing. The AI can be downright brutal at times, especially if you don't try and play as Ninja's which a lot of people seem to do. The sheer fact that everything can be brought down to rubble is amazing, don't like how the sniper in that tower is causing problems but can't seem to hit him? Just destroy the tower supports and he will die in the fall. Highly recommend if you enjoy XCOM.			"

												This is one of my favourite games ever. It's like they took UFO/X-COM: Enemy Unknown, modernised the UI and GFX, and put it in a World War II setting.  ..The fully-destructable environments are awesome, the number and types of weapons is mind-boggling, and the combat is *so* much fun. Takes a while to work out which are the best weapons, and what characters to pick for your team, but once that is sorted I can play the game exactly the way I want to. Snipers are possibly too-powerful a player-type. And I find most of the soldier types useless. But a friend loved roaming around with soldiers and full machine-guns and laying waste instead.  I preferred the stealthy approach, spot the enemy with my scouts, and use the snipers to take them out. So the game can suit quite a few play styles. ..and when you find some of the stealth-ier enemies, you might have to adjust your strategy. Both Silent Storm, and Silent Storm Sentinels are a huge amount of fun, even after all these years. I'd think anyone who loved the UFO/X-COM series, or turn-based combat games, or even just the thought of a WWII oriented RPG, would get a huge amount out of it too.  (Just turn off the voices .. they're not so good.) :)  ..and look on the web/forums for a patch to return shadows to the GFX on Win7/8 systems.			"

												Silent Storm is an AMAZING Turn Based Strategy and RPG. If you can get past some of the basic things such as bad voice acting and the graphics, you'll find a rather in-depth game where instead of going through the front door into an enemy base, you can walk around, blow up the wall and just walk on in. I dont really write reviews, but honestly this game is AMAZING and FUN, and I would recommend this to everyone who likes a nice strategy game or like X-COM.Have a good day!			"

												TL;DR- XCOM gameplay set during WW2. First off, the story is lame, voice acting is laughable, and graphics haven't aged well...  Those are the only real downsides. Don't watch the trailer, or look at the screeshots. Their marketing folks are butts full of stinky stupid (like most marketing people.)Silent Storm is a fantastic turn-based shooter from Nival. The game is set in Europe during World War 2, and you are the head of an elite squad of soldiers, tasked with doing important stuff.... blah blah blah. The game's story is pretty bland and forgettable. It doesn't matter. The gameplay is what matters, and that's what excels here. You create ""you,"" pick a class between sniper, soldier, engineer, scout, grenadier, and medic. Almost DnD in some ways. After that and some basic visual options, you are put in the game world, and allowed to pick your team. There you pick 5 more mercenaries from a list of about 25 pre-created characters. I usually opt to pick a character from each class.  Once you do that and some more tutorial stuff, you are given your first mission. The game starts out tough. Your characters aren't elite spec ops ninjas. I find myself yelling at the screen, and save scumming frequently, but you learn to love your rag tag group of mercs in your mission to save Europe (and possibly the world) from its demise.  Luckily, there is a great RPG element implemented for improving your team. Skill trees! Also, the game utilizes a mechanic not found in most modern RPGs. Your characters gain skills in activites they actually perform. If you are constantly sneaking around, you will improve at sneaking. Always healing yourself and others? You will improve your medic skill. You get the picture. It's awesome. Upgrading doesn't stop at skills, but items as well. You can return to your home base and equip your dudes/dudettes with an arsenal of gear. As you progress through missions, your selection gets better. You can also snag items from your missions and bring them back. I like to hoard grenades. JUST IN CASE :)The options for completing missions are virtually endless. You can sneak through the maps and silently take out all enemies. You can dynamite, grenade, and rocket launch the entire map until you are playing in a field. Speaking of which, the environment is fully(ish) destructable. If you suspect an enemy is behind a wall or door, BLOW IT THE F*** UP. I've done it many time to great satisfaction. The game gets a little sci-fi towards the end, which you may think is either cool, or silly. I prefer the latter. To each their own, it doesn't completely detract from the greatness too much. Graphically, the game didn't age terribly well, but there are a few mods out there to fix certain issues like resolution and other graphical stuff. Check them out, and install them under great reccommendation. If I remade this game, I would add the ability to mod weapons, introduce currency and some kind of market, and update the graphics to modern standards. That's about it. It's a great game and deserves a look. Especially if you like games like XCOM.			"

I mean, it has everything we wants. Historical weapons. historical units, destroyable buildings, rag doll effect, lootable corpses, shoot thru walls, et etc.Now, regarding this game i will just say: Yes it is a good game. Yes it is absolutely worth to include in your collection if you can get it for a nice price.			"

												So, I will be the first to admit that aRPGs are typically not my thing, but they have been slowly growing on me - thanks, in large part, to great games such as Silent Storm. S2 blends tactical turn-based strategy with action-packed RPG goodness.There is a brief training course tutorial to associate you with gameplay, which is niether too bloated nor too shallow and gets right to the point. There are two story campaigns to choose from, one for Allied (US, UK, Russia) forces and one for Axis (Germany, Japan, Italy) forces. You can choose a premade character or create a custom one, starting the game as a lone wolf who will go on to lead a small squad of elite commandos. Each profession (see below) utilizes its own stats and attributes, which can be upgraded as you progress. As with any good RPG - even an aRPG - there is a rather hefty skill tree available for further fine tuning and customization.There are six professions: soldier, sniper, grenadier, scout, engineer, and medic. Each offers its own unique playstyle and you will need to utilize the full range of their given skillsets (as a team) to successfully complete your missions. This makes for some really interesting gameplay and near-endless tactical possibilites. Will you have your sniper pick your enemies off from afar? Or will you send in your scout to silently dispatch any sentries and infilitrate enemy lines? The choice is yours! Your engineer can provide new and intersting paths to success, as their primary strength lies not in direct combat but instead in safely navigating minefields or bypassing locked doors. Perhaps you favor the more direct approach? Not to fear, that's why you always bring a medic - ready and able to patch up even the deadliest of wonds and get your soldiers going again in no time!Between missions you are returned to your own personal base of operations where you can manage your squad, access your armory, visit the sickbay, or initiate further missions.

												Silent Storm was one of those games that when I first played it I loved it. I wasn't very good at the it, even the first mission (Allies) but I wanted to be. Seeing it on Steam is another win as now I don't have to track down those CDs everytime I build a new PC. Silent Storm incorporates squad level, turn based strategy action with RPG elements and memorable characters. As a long time fan of the Jagged Alliance series I was immediately drawn to the similarities between the games and soon found myself lost in the eye of a Silent Storm.  Missions revolve around your Allied or Axis specialist squad investigating a mysterious foundation known only as Thor's Hammer and their background dealings with senior Allied and Axis leadership. Most often than not this leads to combat against both Allied and Axis troops but also Thor's Hammer mercenaries who will almost certainly be better armed with you.  As a big WWII buff and weaponry fanatic I was lost in number of period weapon choices and the attention to detail with regards to ammunition types. Default demage values are a bit odd but there are numerous mods out there that rectify several small issues that in all honesty, don't effect the game that much. Sentinals is a continuation of the fight against Thor's Hammer immediately after the Second World War and introduces new missions, weapons and equipment.The only oddity that I know throws a lot of people off the game is the introduction of walking tanks later in the story line known as Panzerkleins. These weapons are incredibly powerful when used correctly but more often than not can be easily defeated with an excellent marksman or hail storms of machine gun fire. TLDR: 9/10 would Panzerklein again. Anyone who really enjoyed these games I strongly suggest checking out Hammer and Sickle.  "

												Pls dont let my little time on steam for this game fool you, I bought it on steam just to be able to write this review.There are many great a thorough reviews here and I really dont know if I can add much to them so instead I will share a few moments I will never forget, memories that this game gave me that will linger on. I recall a mission that seemed almost unfairly hard yet was logical in its situation. We appeared in a quiet courtyard but in virtually every direction where patrols that you had no hope of avoiding.  I sent one of my two scouts up the north street with my sniper following along as support.My other 4 went west My second scout Elf taking point, followed not to closely by my grenadier and a heavy weapons guy. My CO was the doctor who hung back enough to avoid any major risks most of the time.My 2 man unit managed to take out a full patrol very quickly, a good grenade toss from the scout, a spray of some smg and the sniper picking off the stragglers it was over that side in 2 turns.Things for my 4 man unit got hot fast, The patrol they encountered spread out taking cover, making use of grenades not an option as they had too much distance, and cover kept them safe enough an extended fire fight with all the patrols around not a good place to be. Doc used his kbar to break in a window and crawled through but kept his head down and ears alert. my scout was right behind him and  moved for the door, Meanwhile my heavy machine gunner kept up fire to hold off the patrools, 2 now had merged up intoa  dangerous force. Too far to read the window, my grenade guy used a heavy explosive saved for emergency to blow a hole through the brick wall of the same building but into another room with a hallway running down the length. he went through and provided some fire support under cover that kept them focussed on him while my heavy gunner got through.My scout and sniper had cleared a second patrol with quick brutal effect, catching them from behind as they had been moving in towards all the noise of the firefight.My 2nd scout had gone trhough the door, taking point while doc held back to offer cover if needed. This scout a lass named Elf only carried blades no guns, she dispatched a german soldier quietly who was at the buildings front door. My explosives expert had set a few nastry traps at the hole in the wall before he and the heavy gunner moved out to join my scout at the front of the building.Scout 2 and the sniper had cleared another patrol on the main street and met up with the rest of the team. both the scouts headed off to cross the street and hide among bushes and trees while sneaking towards a series of buildings along the west side of the map. My sniper headed for the attic of the building we had cleared and my heavy weapons and grenade guys took positions on the front courtyard LA my blonde from hollywould who we figured LA meant loves attention proceeded to use heavy weapons fire to soften up the earlier patrols now circling to the front after one had caught a nasty mine and the rest thought better and decided not to persude that route.Great enemy AI btw Doc was still lingering in that first room, just in case, and good thing to. No idea where the nazi scum bag came from but sudenly doc can hear someone out in the hall moving towards the front along the same path we had used and was going to perfectly flank LA and her partner. Doc didnt hesitate, he pulled his kbar( did I mention I made my doctor a melee killing expert before a master of medicine?) and crept up to the doorway of the room that opened to the hall. as I could hear the unknown was on the other side abit past the door it was a prime moment to move out and Doc took the scum bag down with a triple stab to the back of the chest.Meanwhile my sniper had finally reached the attic window and was doing some amazing work on virtually single handedly whittling down 4 patrols worth of men that LA and her partner had been holding off and softening up.Over the next tenses turns enemy fire constantly peppered that buildings top floor, eventually lucky rounds caught my sniper through the wall forcing her back, but that didnt stop the fire coming her way, and it wouldnt be long before the entire area she had been at was gone,a gaping hole in a once lovely building.she wasnt doing to great and doc met with her in the saftey of an out of the way 2nd story room to patch her up. My two scouts had gotten across the wide open street to the far north west corner but not without trouble, a sniper on that buildings 2nd story balcony had caught Kate and she was down though Elf had managed to drag her to the safety of bushes and stop the bleeding and stabalize her for the moment. So elf was on her own, she managed to get inside, had picked up an enemy smg and some grenades from dead foes, and used those to cause abit of troublewe needed to all get across that wide street and while many enemies ahd died no small number whre left. LA being a blonde with serious balls went first managed to get most of the way across and grab some pavement and keep her head down praying for the best. doc had grabbed an enemy rifle and alongside my sniper where offering distant support fire as my grenade guy went out, but he wasnt going for cover.He had seen the situation, he knew that sacrifice was going to be needed. and went head on at the single biggest cluster of foes, he got as close as he could while having 2 throws in him, and he made them count. decimating 9 men and wounding several more. but he was in the open, his ap spent and the next turn he was left bleeding out riddled with the fire from at least 4 enemies. But it had been enough. Doc and LA got across, and put up fire so my sniper could get over to.Elf had at this time managed to locate several documents, and a enemy we needed to take prisoner. but had been disabled and only barely saved by doc who got her stabalized.we had 3 downed men, and a hostage. no way to recover my man on the street without a bloody fight we hadnt the chance in hell of lasting through. all of us beat up, some still mildly bleeding. LA had caught a nasty bullet leaving her blinded for now.I made the hard call. doc took the hostage, LA grabbed Elf, my sniper a russian woman named Zenilda  went to grab Kate, and we withdrew to the extraction point That man I left behind, bleeding out in that cold street surrounded by nazi scum. Some times his face still haunts me until the booze blurs it out along with the name I try to forget. He was a brave man, he died to see the mission complete and his allies live. I never left another man behind.This game is a special kind of game. It has many subtle layers, many elements that come together to create something bigger and more substantial then many modern games, it may look abit dated. but it never gets old. Like fine wine and good liquor its taste only becomes richer as new offerings in the genre only make you go why dont they have fully destructable enviroments?X com enemy unkown Im looking at you. For all your pretty graphics, fancy voice acting and cut scenes, your game play and challenge do not come from well balanced or logical scenerios. And nothing beats winning the day by saying ♥♥♥♥ this lets bring down the whole god damn building on top of the nazi scum.Yeah thats right I beat a mission once by throwing in a single grenade that set off so many traps nothing was left but a basement and a few documents.

												The strategy set the realities of World War II. The player becomes the commander of the elite soldiers performing a very dangerous task deep into enemy territory. In each mission you can directly command the five soldiers any selected from forty subordinate our people (six professions: scout, sniper, sub-machine gunner, grenadier, physician, engineer). Each has its own history, nationality, (30 nationalities) and individual characteristics (over 50 skills that we can develop along the course of the game). In our hands and was given more than 75 authentic weapons from World War II, from knives, bayonets and hand grenades, and ending with a sniper rifle and experimental weapons. Await to comply two large campaigns, one on the side of the Allies, the other on the side of the Axis, giving a total of 24 non-linear missions for various purposes, including release prisoners and the destruction of important enemy installations. The game takes place in a turn-based system, similar to that used for example.'s Famous X-COM, and observe the action in full 3D (changeable weather conditions, day and night, a number of visual effects).9,5/10			"

												Absolutely without question one of the best and most innovative games I've ever played. The fully destructible environment is so amazing that, after playing this, you'll wish every game had something like that. You'll never know what turn a battle might take, and on Hard it's quite punishing and brain-taxing(which is what makes it so awesome of course).  Careful planning and tactical assessment of the situation at hand often end up resulting in set pieces and event chains that are just beautiful. The character development is executed well too, and it's really engaging to (in time) build a squad capable of taking on several enemies at a time.I also want to make it a point to mention that because the voice overs are(for the most part) excellent and lively, you'll end up actually caring about your characters and cheering them on. Didn't expect it from a game like this, so it was a very welcome surprise.If your attention span hasn't been completely stunted from the whirlwind of today's portable technology, I HIGHLY recommend getting this one. You'll easily get tens and tens and tens of hours from it, if you play both campaigns.			"

												A great ""tactics"" game with decently destructible environments, varied classes with powerful skill trees, a wide selection of weapons, decent and suspenseful plot (esp. for ""this kind of game"") and even some comic relief in the form of the stuff the characters say in battle (each has their own personality and voice -- there are probably about 20 to choose from. Also you can personalize your ""main"" character appearance a la Fallout 3 or The Sims or something like that).I had purchased these retail but somehow lost one of my CDs!!!  (An exceptionally rare occurrence for me, I assure you. To this day, I don't know how...  TBH I expect to find it the next time I move house, behind a bookcase[en.wikipedia.org] or something ;) ) Made my day when they brought it to Steam, as I guess it was basically abandonware before that, and I was not looking forward to paying another $40 or more to replace it.  I don't think I've ever bought a game on Steam full price, but this one I almost did, and that is honestly saying a lot for it.Made by the same guys who made ""HOMM V"" and ""Blitzkrieg"".			"

												A solid squad level, turn-based tactics game. This type of game seems to be missing in recent years. Released in the early 2000s; you control a 6-man squad from the top down in a WW2 setting. The weapons are concurrent to the setting, complete with corresponding range, accuracy and power; EXCEPT for the bits of science fiction thrown in...I'll just leave it at that. The environments are descructible with beautiful physics. Depending on the weapon, you can shoot through walls, ceiling, or floor...if you're sure of the target on the other side. If you were a fan of JA, the original XCom, or even SWAT 2 (remember that one?), you can't go wrong with this. It's a classic that might even beat those examples given. I only wish i'd discovered this when it came out. In fact, it made me go out and get a copy of Fallout: Tactics, for my library. This came on Steam through Greenlight; while lots of trash comes out of that program, diamonds like this exists.            If you want more specific detail: There are 6 ""classes"" to choose from, and each class have their own special skill tree, although I've noticed they pretty much overlap with each other. Each character has a class, attribute (strength, intelligence, dexterity) and ""secondary attribute"" (throwing, melee, sniping etc.) For example: a Sniper class character is likely going to be good at ""Sniping""...but that doesn't mean you can't get your Medic to get up to speed at ""Sniping"" as well. Classes are as follows: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Grenadier, Soldier and Engineer. There's also a ""weapons familiarity"" modifier each char has with various weapons...as you can see, there's lots of customization that can go into this game.			"

												For anyone who likes games like XCOM 1 (with Longbow mod ofcourse !) and other tactical games (maybe also Divinity OS's  combat elemental and environmental effects ), this old game is truly going to satisfy.I haven't started the Sentinels  expansion yet but I've truly been enjoying both the excellent tactical combat model used.  LOS , stealth spotting, ricochets, ragdoll and ofcourse.. the physics of a totally (and I mean TOTALLY) destructible environment. Using the environment is now a trully delightful affair. Got a snipers nest above you in a building with troops protecting the floor below..throw a nice fat HE grenade, watch the guy fall to his death as the floor below him crumples in to a ruined mess and crushing troops underneath their ceiling. Make no mistake though, this is not an easy game as you progress later. You will need to consider choices with thought or permadeath of squad members may result. (You can reload a save if you have one).It's not a perfect game but it was originally developed in 2003 (?). The visual mess of death and the environmental damage is quite satisfying too. I'm not sure re: Sentinels expansion but I would STRONGLY suggest atleast the following mods:""Grenade Range Increase"", ""Improved Backstab"", ""Headshot Should Kill"", ""Ammo Fixes S2 mod"", ""Easier Medical and Engineering Items"". ""Skill Watchdog hack"" (is an important mod that fixes skilling up of your active squad)You should also use the ""Save Mod"" to install and uninstall mods in to save games.There is also a UI resolution fix for slightly higer screen level (see community pages here on Steam) which really is essentialThis game cost me $2.95 on special I think..but even at full price of $9.99 it is ridiculously good value.

												A great ""tactics"" game with decently destructible environments, varied classes with powerful skill trees, a wide selection of weapons, decent and suspenseful plot (esp. for ""this kind of game"") and even some comic relief in the form of the stuff the characters say in battle (each has their own personality and voice -- there are probably about 20 to choose from. Also you can personalize your ""main"" character appearance a la Fallout 3 or The Sims or something like that).I had purchased these retail but somehow lost one of my CDs!!!  (An exceptionally rare occurrence for me, I assure you. To this day, I don't know how...  TBH I expect to find it the next time I move house, behind a bookcase[en.wikipedia.org] or something ;) ) Made my day when they brought it to Steam, as I guess it was basically abandonware before that, and I was not looking forward to paying another $40 or more to replace it.  I don't think I've ever bought a game on Steam full price, but this one I almost did, and that is honestly saying a lot for it.Made by the same guys who made ""HOMM V"" and ""Blitzkrieg"".			"

												This game has very special place both in my heart and my library. It has incredible high production quality and graphics is insanely good taken into account it was released back in the 2004.You could effectively compare it to Jagged Alliance or XCOM, but when you dig a bit into the game, it is very obvious that the gameplay is significantly deeper and more enjoyable. Did I mention it was released back in the 2004? It has completely destructible environment - yes, in 2004. Don't you find viable option to enter a building through the door? Make yourself a new door with a bazooka or any other explosives. It is still fun to play, even 12 years after the release. You could release it today with an updated graphics, and it would still be able to compete with the best turn-based games out there.If I would ever become a game producer, I would buy rights to this masterpiece and make a sequel/remaster right away. It is that good.			"

												where to start?lets start with the bad This is challengening and difficult which at first may be a turn off but once you get used to it it mellows out. The game at times can be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and F you over.now the for the good. This game is really fun sure the graphics may be a little dated but the gameplay is still fun. The dialouge is the dumbest thing i've ever heard next to the MoW accents. The campaing is fun even tho the axis & allies is the same story just different characters. Every level has random encounter specs so if you fail or restart a mission it will play out diffrentley than before. Overall this game is really fun.			"

Now, that may not make much sense based upon the actual release dates of the above titles, but Silent Storm is a fantastic squad based RTS/RPG regardless.			"

												A kooky and unforgiving strategy game a la Inglorious Basterds. Go commando with a small squad in a spy vs. spy science fiction adventure. Basic skill trees, adaptable load-outs for six classes, re-playable campaign as either Axis or Allies. Fully destructable environment; the physics are delightful and worthy of playtime just as a demolitions sandbox. Only downsides are outdated resolution settings and repetitive sounds, but there's probably work-arounds for both. Stop reading postiive reviews and get this game.			"

												Silent Storm is an older game, in the same kind of genre as X-com or Jagged Alliance. Compared to those games it is MUCH more forgiving, as long as you rescue downed soldiers they don't die.  It's set in WW2, with a almost wolfenstien twist, there's another faction with (era appropriate) power armor suits. There's more of a focus of leveling up your characters and having them specialize with certain weapons, there is a pretty good list of weapons to use too.  The buildings and such are destructable, it's a bit like x-com apocalpyse where enough fire and explosions will level pretty much anything. The graphics aren't anything home to write about and the voice acting is absolutely terrible, picking a male british guy as your character is going to elict laughs out of anyone at how corny it is.Another minor gripe I have with the game is that  it seems there's no weight limit or penalties, meaning you should always have a packed inventory.Overall, if you like the genre you should enjoy this game, while the new x-com defintely beats it in presentation I found the gameplay to be superior.

												Great game and great physics. This is one of a few bunch of games I thought would change everything in the genre. More than ten year later the games with this level of interaction with the background are really rare.I always recall one mission in wich I defeated an entire squad mining the ground floor of the building they were into.Also, the various class are well conceived and the squad dynamics works as a charm.There is a problem with the character leveling though: if you lose a character forward in the game, at high difficulty level is very tough to get a novice on track with the squad.All in all a great game, that after ten years still has more than a few lessons for the younger ones.

												A true turn-based strategy gem in gaming. Gain skills and attributes as you use them, similar to The Elder Scrolls. Blow a hole in the ceiling and climb to the next floor. Collapse a building to take out a sniper. There are endless random missions you can accept, simply by walking into enemy icons on the map. Depends on which region you are in, and what part of that region you go into, you will play on a that encounter map. However, the map still randomizes, including buildings and vehicle placement, and the number, type, and armaments of enemies on the map.Both Axis and Ally campaigns are both great plays. And while you can loot any weapon you see an enemy using, it depends on which side you picked if your base will resupply you in that ammo type. Otherwise, keep hording that enemy ammo. Great game. Tons of replayability. And it's cheap as hell. Pick it up.			"

												This, in my opinion, is one of the best turn-based squad tactics ever made, along with X-Com and Jagged Alliance; and probably one of the best PC games made in Russia. I remember playing it back in the day and it was super addictive. This game has great tactical battles with variety of different strategies that manage to be dynamic despite old-school action-points based system. It also has simple, but effective RPG system of skill progression with skill trees for each type of character. Those may seem confusing at first, but game has a high replayability value and each type of character definitely worth of try. But the best part about Silent Storm is probably its destructable environments withint the game. There's no sweeter sound than the sound of heavy machine gun fire demolishing the walls and ripping apart the house. With everything and everyone inside. Total nerdgasm.Now, we already have SS and SS:Sentinels, can we also have Hammer & Sickle? Steam? Please?			"

												Ignore the awful voice acting, dialogue and character models; the glitches and the odd crashes.When it comes together, this game is absolute gold.If you play games because you want to have fun, Silent Storm has it in spades. I personally find it much more enjoyable than even recent action strategy games like X-COM / Jagged Alliance, and feel it is a bit of a shame it gets overlooked.The combat is exciting and really tactical. The environment is fully destructable, meaning missions play out completely differently each time.Can't pick the lock? blow the entire wall up with a grenade. Hear a man sneaking about upstairs? Spray bullets through the floor until it collapses around him. Whatever tactic you would like to try is available.The character skill treee allows lots of different skills to be unlocked to customise your player further.Recommended			"

												Not a bad little game. Its an older game that I remember trying as a kid some where but it still is a solid one. I like how you can choose both sides, axis and allies, and hire troops to work with you on the batlefield. I like the base and the mechanics. Very few bugs and crashes. The game reminds me of jagged alliance and is a great alternitve however I do wish they would have a shop to where you can buy ammo or requisition it for more of a you earned the money you get to buy what you need feel rather then scavanging and waiting for the armory to populate weapons. Out side of that, that's all I really have to complain about wiht this game. The random encounters do get reptitious though and while not really a bad thing, it lowers the life of the game just a little bit. Also they should impliment a auto loot after each level or allow you to choose the loot left on the ground but seeing how old this game is, I doubt that will happen unless its modded in by the community. As its on sale I am very happy to pay 2.50 for the collection. I wouldn't of bought it at 10$ but i would still reccomend it. Anyway hope you liked the review!			"

I like the breakable surrounding, the good variaty of weapons, gadgets and equipment in general. There is always plenty of tactical options, which is good too and offers some re-playability. Also, leveling sistem for each fighter, permadeath (So, think well before doing something or save more often) and the story is not bad too. The only thing that may scare some players is that the game is pretty old. So, expect meh graphics and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution. But besides that, it's a must have if you are a fan of tactical games.			"

												Classic X-Com, Jagged Alliance 2 and Silent Storm. Comparing them to one another would be pointless, as they're all just as awesome. If you've ever liked the other two, you'll like this one.Destructible environment back when this game was made was way ahead of it's time. You can shoot through walls and with a big enough caliber and/or right amount of ammo, you'll blow a hole to the wall your guys can walk or crawl through. Entire buildings can be demolished with explosives. Game also counts trajectories for shot bullets and they can ricochet realistically, creating unpredictable and funny moments.Also worth to note that Sentinels, what the store description humbly calls an ""add-on"", is fully realized campaign with a length equal to the main one, with added economy, items and other stuff.

It's a classic X-COM style squad based tactical shooter but with a WW2 theme. Half the fun is in making mistakes - early on in the allies campagn, for example you walk your entire squad into a mexican standoff in a small enclosed space, I had my grenadier pop one out to try to clear a few of the surrounding enemy, he fumbled and blew up the entire squad. This remains fun because you always have a replay function for fails. 90%			"

												Silent Storm: This game is one of the best turn-based shooters I have ever played. I like pretty much everything in the game except for one thing...  Panzerkleins. These things should NOT have been added to the game they're dumb and extremely overpowered and destroy infantry extremely quickly( Which makes ground troops pointless). The graphics are acceptable and the gameplay is very fun. A couple of the missions are a bit annoying but overall with the exception of the panzerkleins the game is pretty easy. I hope they make a sequel to this game it is very enjoyable even considering how old it is. Sadly I have never been able to finish the game as the last mission is glitched for me.Sentinels: This game however is not as fun. Some of the missions seem very tedious and hard. All the enemies make the same sound and the money system is complete trash. Panzerkleins again ruin the game as unlike in silent storm you cannot aquire them before the enemy sends them in which basically sucks. The story is very dumb and doesn't make very much sense. To me Silent Storm is better than sentinels.			"

												Silent Storm is loads of fun. As the description of the game says its a Turn-Based RPG with a surprisingly interesting story. The story plays out as you complete missions you find documents and notes telling you of the Germans plans. The missions are non-linear meaning that every time I start A new game I get the missions in different orders or missions that I have seen before. Missions can be any thing from raiding a small village to a full on assault on a enemy held stronghold. Between missions you have a base to go back to so you can heal squad members, acquire new squad members, and rearm. There are hundreds of guns from Thompsons to SMLE mk. IIIs. In the end theres not much esle to say then its loads of fun. 9/10 "

												This review is for Silent Storm 2:This is a fun squad based game that takes place in WWII.  It is a bit of an alternate history because you quickly start investigating an incident where someone gets killed by a plasma guy (Axis side).  You have some character development options such as a skill tree you can put points into.I bought it on sale for $2.50 and it is a total steal at that price. Its even worth the full price ($9.99 I think).  It holds up well despite its age.I have not yet played the Sentinels version which is the next in the series.  I am playing that next...			"

												Silent Storm does what XCOM does, only better and more convincingly.I've played HUNDREDS of hours of the GOG version of this game offline on my old laptop.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The difficulty isn't artificially bolstered by just throwing in men with more health.Men are not bullet sponges, and a single headshot will kill ANYONE permanently.Weapons have penetration and range values dependent on their loaded ammunition type,and woe betide anyone firing a high-caliber weapon in a building containing fuel barrels.Ricochets can and will kill your squad simply by causing the entire f&^%ing map to explode.Speaking of explosions...if you can see it, it's destructible. It's the only strategy game I've ever played that has convincing levels of destruction modelled for EVERYTHING. Buildings crumble, floors splinter, that fire escape you were stood on fell into the street and killed half of your squad. Battlefield 4? HAH!Squad injuries are dealt with in a convincing way, with most status ailments treatable only by a medic. None of this namby-pamby 'healing glue-gun' nonsense the new XCOM kiddies love, oh no. Bandages, painkillers, forceps, morphine; you name it, you'll need it. It's WAR, dammit!Minor Spoilers(?):About half to three-quarters of the way through the game, you'll find the oddity that is the PanzerKlein. I ADORED them, as they freshened up the gameplay in a way I wasn't expecting, but a lot of people despised them. You can mod them out easily enough, but personally I'd wait and see what you think of them.BOTTOM LINE:----------------If you're a fan of turn based strategy games and like options for different tactical approaches, then you probably already own Silent Storm and Sentinels, possibly even Hammer and Sickle.If you don't usually go for turn based tactics, however, it'd be worth watching some YouTube vids of the game in action, as some sections can be slow. XCOM fans will probably adore it, though.			"

												I have completed this game but most of the hours I clocked up have been offline. To sum up this is a good rock solid squad based strategy game. It has been compared it to Xcom and I would say it does in some respects but more to the original classic not the new remake, and for no other reason than being a hard game to master. However once you have mastered it and built your squad up you will start to enjoy those long drawn out gun battles around one doorway and 20+ enemy soldiers! You will die, the game will annoy you with fields of vision causing hair pulling moments and you will be reloading (many many times), but once you get the hang of your squads abilities it will be an enjoyable play for people who enjoy this type of game, plus it’s not that heavy on the wallet. For those who aren’t into squad based tactical games or want something easy to jump into please avoid.			"

												One of a great game, this game is a gem, the game is really awesome for a game that has been made in 2003 and even for today, It's pretty similar to Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout: Tactics (turn based mode), Jagged Aliance and X-Com, so if you like one of those games you will love this one, especially if you love the World War II theme, turn based tactics games are really rare because there's not a lot of developers making games like this, most of the developers are making some dumb multiplayer only survival games like DayZ, Rust, Beasts of Prey and you know the list while you could play something real great which is Silent Storm Gold Edition.Seriously, I'd suggest you give it a try.There are 2 factions, the Axis and the Allied.You can use up to 6 classes (soldier, grenadier, scout, sniper, medic and engineer) but you'll still be able to use any kind of weapons with any class, you can play as an Italian, German, Japanese, UK, Russian and American, you can also customize the look of your character.Great soundtrack/music, I really mean it, the composer has really done a great job here.The environments are destroyable which is pretty neat.I would suggest it to anyone that likes tactical and World War II games, go for it, you won't regret it.If you love Fallout, Fallout 2 or even the classic X-Com games, you'll love this one.9.5/10			"

												One of the few games that I would purchase again at what I consider to be an expensive price since the game is over a decade old.I bought this when first released -- probably on discount, after gaming for such a long time and having suffered many disappointments, I resist trying to pay full price for something any more.  This is to protect my wallet from the effects of the ""glitter and flash"" that accompanies a game, particularly on its box (then) but (now) with multiple screenshots on Steam.One thing likable about this game -- there is a ton of content here.  For those unfamiliar -- it is a squad-level based game that becomes tactical and turned based whenever you alert the enemy (or when you want it to become turn-based).  Stealth in this game is key, there are very few situations in which you can run in with guns blazing and escape without losing a team member.And you want to keep your team members alive because they gain experience that can be spent on fairly elaborate skill trees.  So pretty quickly I learned (at least the way I play the game) that I needed to keep my doctor at the rear of the group.  I liked having a sniper (for obvious reasons) to cover my flank.  WIth a little patience you can position the sniper extremely well so that at a critical time in the battle his shots have a great impact.  After this, I liked having a scount and an enginer, a light infantryman and a heavy one.  THis is the combination that worked for me.The player has the option to be either on the allied side or the axis.  The missions are different depending on which forces you play.  And, because of the nature of this game, no two session will be the same.It's a difficult game and it can be frustrating.  You have to be patient.  Those bullets hurt your character, this isn't like a FPS when you can pick up a health pack in every room and boost your health.  I'd say the replay value here is medium, after you have played both sides, but the longer I waited the more I forgot and found it interesting again.Easily one of my favorite games.  Would recommend to anyone who asked. "

												An old one that still manages to be an enjoyable turn based tatical game. There are several classes of soldiers each with their own strengths and you command a squad of them to accomplish missions that involve killing nazis. There are weapon options from firearms, explosives, RPGs, grenades and melee. Each class will tend to be better with certain kinds depending on what you select to upgrade as soldiers gain levels.The downside, WWII era powersuits. How the developers turned what should be a high point into a low one is an accomplishment. Near the end you will have to use them, and they are just not as fun as having the soldiers on foot.After finishing the game I had my fill, barely touching the expansion that is included.			"

												This review is going to look a lot like any review I write for a beloved, aged franchise.First the bad:This game is old. It's shows it's age. It's difficult to work with because of it. Be prepared.Now the good:I could write pages. This game redefined squad based combat. While X-Com and Jagged Alliance were busy constructing the squad-based, turn-based combat games, this game took that construct and de-constructed it.The combination of a physics based-world combined with a turn-based mechanic, make this one of the most unique squad combat games you'll ever play. I tend to play the sniper, and there's nothing more satisfying that nailing someone in the head from across the playing field and having them fly back through the window behind them.Enemy blocking the stairway down? No problem. Blow a hole in the floor with a grenade and climb down it. Have a large machine gun? Brick wall between you an your enemy? To a weapon with enough damage potential, that's not a problem.And I don't want to spoil the surprise for those who haven't played it, but the game has much more charm than just the World War II aesthetic. It adds a dash of sci-fi 1940s era pulp fiction to it.If you've never played this game and you enjoyed X-Com and Jagged Alliance, you're doing yourself a dis-service by not owning this game.			"

												Silent Storm is a quirky title. While its WWII setting and stark palette give the impression of a Serious Game About War, a more pervasive lightheartedness comes to the fore as you play. Goofy voiceover dialogue, strangely named NPCs, and the sudden appearance of science fiction elements like beam weapons and UFOs show that the game doesn't take itself quite as seriously as all that.Unfortunately for the playability of the thing, that sometimes-serious-but-not-really back and forth also comes through in its systems design. You've got a meticulous turn-based tactical simulation, complete with ammo management, multiple firing modes with different balance of speed vs. accuracy, and wounds that impair soldier performance. Maps are brilliantly realistic, with buildings believably functional down to the bathrooms. But for all that detail, many front-and-center features feel slapdash. The AI is terrible, with enemy soldiers staring blankly into nowhere while they get shot repeatedly over several turns. Skill trees are haphazardly assembled, with tepid pinnacle skills, prerequisites that have nothing to do with their descendants, and bugged skills that straight-up don't do what they say they do. The difficulty curve is all over the place, too--hit the right partially-randomized path in the campaign and you'll find yourself steamrolling everything, or don't, and find yourself desperately exploiting the aforementioned flawed AI just to have any chance at success.For all those gripes, though, the game hooked me. I love the tension of turn-based tactical play where enemies could be hiding around any corner. Silent Storm's system of hearing vs. vision, where you can spot ghostly outlines representing something you've heard out of sight--are they really enemies, or noisy civilians? only one way to find out--heightens that mood wonderfully. The thrill of successfully cornering and defeating a difficult foe in a close-quarters hunt is a lovely treat, one that S2's style pulls off consistently. And it's worth saying that more than a few of the game's most glaring issues can be fixed with mods, if you care to pursue that route.I thus give a thumbs-up with caveats to this decade-old title. If you like XCOM, Jagged Alliance, etc., this is likely to appeal to you. But if you're hoping for something as polished as Enemy Unknown, for example, you might better leave this one aside.			"

												Silent Storm started out as an interesting tactical squad game that ended as a real disappointment for me. Initially, the character customization, range of classes, and diversity of weapons and equipment seemed to reveal a great deal of complexity in the game. Which to me looked like a lot of fun, or at least that’s what I thought…Gameplay is pretty similar to the older XCOM or Jagged Alliance games so if you’re familiar with either of those you’ll pick up the basics really quickly. The voice acting is pretty silly and the overall story for why you are involved at all is pretty minimal.After about 5-6 missions I realized that realistically, the only classes worth using were sniper, soldier, and scout (engineer and medic are both broken and useless as of patch 1.2) and anything except for single shot rifles and ‘secret’ weapons was totally useless in combat. The enemy AI has a habit of doing really weird things like crouching in high places and forcing you to start combat, but never leaving to engage you.If that wasn’t bad enough, the way the game gets you to the next mission requires that you find special clues in each mission. So if you don’t find the right clues you’ll end up like I did, stuck at a mission where I was totally overwhelmed by a sudden special enemy (Panzerklein) against which _none_ of my weapons worked. After experimenting with different approaches over an hour or two, including stealing some special weapons mid-battle, I managed to defeat the enemies…except the game announced a self-destruct sequence that I had no chance of avoiding or overriding. I decided to throw in the towel after that. I had already rerolled once before just to try out different classes and weapons and by this point the game was getting really tedious and unrewarding. It’s just not worth the self-punishment when there are better squad strategy games out there. "

												After playing over 70 hours, I finally made it to the last ""Boss"" level ... only to discover that the game has a BUG that prevents the ""Boss"" from appearing.  After a fair bit of digging, I found an unofficial Russian patch that is supposed to fix the issue -- but the patch corrupts the quality of the display and slows the game down.The game was fun for the most part, despite having lots of ""path not found"" issues.  However, I cannot recommend it in its current (Dec 2015) state simply because you can't finish it!			"

												I have always been a big fan of turn-based strategy, but this one fails to impress.Too tedious, buggy, frustrating to recommend.  Difficulty is all over the board from too easy to impossible.In the U.N. mission, I would be hidden and crouched and get ambushed by someone invisible right in front of me with an SMG.Clip unloaded, character dead.Lots of potential, but even for almost-free I cannot recommend.

												I would love to give this game a glowing review. I would love to be able to recommend it. Unfortunately my experience of this engrossing and highly enjoyable game has been spoiled by constant crashes.There seems to be a number of known hardware/OS issues associated with this game, many of which have been overcome with patches or GFX tweeks, unfortunately none of these have worked for me.Core i5-2410M8GB DDR3 RamNvidia GT550MWin7 - 64bitPerhaps I have been unlucky, but I can't recomend a game that crashes so frequently as to be unplayable.

												Bought this game because I love squad-level tactical games. JA2, the XCom games, Fallout Tactics, Xenonauts... I love them.Unforutnately, this is just another bad, utterly broken JA2 knock-off. Among its laundry list of flaws:* your troops are all too capable and enthusiastic to miss a shot which supposedly has a 75% chance of hitting, over and over and over.* no matter how stealthy your approach, the enemy magically knows where you are. Have your scout tucked away behind a sofa? The enemy will walk right up and shoot her in the head, and your scout will never see it.* the enemy can be right in front of you standing out in the open, gunning your troops down and your soldier will have line of sight blocked by a leaf, a stray bumble bee.*if, somehow you have ambushed an enemy, and you try to move a troop a single square to clear some baffling blocked line of sight issue, the enemy interrupts the movement and guns down your party.*throwing a grenade is suicide. Your grenadier WILL frag the party, repeatedly.*simply getting one's troops to move where one wants them to go is an ordeal. You will end up wanting them to die.The game is basically unplayable without constant save/loading to mitigate its thoroughly nonsensical disconnect between actions and results. With this in mind, I can't even call it a tactical game, and it takes a bewildering lack of ethics to even try to sell it as such.-8/10: too flawed to be considered a game, or even a ""public alpha"", but some of the voice actors are entertaining.

												I really wanted to like this game - a turn based WWII strategy game is a rarity.  But I was to be disappointed.The interface for this game is a bit too clunky.  The premise of the game is very promising and makes a change from RTS games but the execution was not great.  Also the difficulty level starts to spike after the first few levels even on the easy setting.  I can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I can't recommend these games (you get two by purchasing) to anybody.tldr: The game is kinda refreshing and you could enjoy them, if there weren't game breaking bugs.Good things are, that you get along with Silent Storm the Sequel/AddOn(?) Silent Storm Sentinels. Also, a turn based strategic game feels really refreshing in the times of fast paced action games.I bought them, because the games Nightwatch and Daywatch, which I really love and played hours of hours as a young gamer, are made by the same Developer and base on the Silent Storm Engine. And S² and S³ reminded me sometimes of those times and make me enjoy it partly.But Silent Storm isn't well made and has annoying flaws. I stopped playing it, because I couldn't beat the mission with the invincible Panzerkleins ( this  review  explains the issue well). Thank god, you can give up missions and go to the next ones, but no matter which mission I have chosen after that, the game froze right at the start and then you have to kill the game via terminal.I moved forward to Silent Storm Sentinels. This one feels better and modern and isn't stretched on 16:9 monitors like the precursor. But here we go again with stupid and game breaking bugs.You will get to a level with invisible enemies (it seems   everyone encounters  this bug). Even with the cheat to show all enemies the mission is still hard and nearly unbeatable if you encounter other bugs:My main hero suffers from ""Bleeding"" which means I lose 10 HP each round. Usually this isn't a serious problem, if you spend 1 or 2 bandages on him. I wasted 10 and he is still bleeding which means, he will definitely die (=game over). Another in my group got some other Penalties (those are negative effects you get by being wounded to bad e.g Bleeding) from nowhere! He was only slightly wounded and then without being attacked he got HP Reduction and Bleeding!I'm thinking of giving up this game as well and hope I can spare some others of wasting their time. You might enjoy the games partly, but most times you will get frustrated and that's not worth it.If there are questions or if you don't understand something, feel free to ask in the comments.			"

It's terrible.			"

												I usually like turn-based shooters, but this game is weak. It's no XCom. I wouldn't even have liked this in the 1990's, which I presume is when it came out based on the graphics.I had a feeling things weren't going to work out when I was in the training mission, standing literally right next to an enemy... just standing there, and I shot at him twice with a rifle and missed both times, then he unloaded his pistol at me and missed all of his shots, too. In the the campaign mission I attempted, I was outnumbered 4-1 and dropped in the middle of the woods. I was a sniper, so that is exactly what I'm not built to do. There isn't really any room for planning or strategy. You're just sort of there, and enemies start moving towards you. The board is really small, so you can't maneuver much.Even in the training, I was outnumbered 4-1 and it looks like the game compensates for a weak AI by just spamming enemies at you.I had to fight the camera. If you're among trees, you can't strip them away to really see what is going on. It's also easy to accidently start climbing over cover instead of moving around it.I didn't have a very good time here, is what I'm saying.I'm guessing this is a good game for nostalgia value if you played and enjoyed it when it was new. I absolutely can't recommend under any other circumstances.			"

												Be warned, not for every Turn-based Strategy RPG lover. Heard those key words and thought ""Hey, I love all those things, why haven't I heard of this game before?""It's because it hasn't aged well. Some people dig it, cool for them, but I didn't have the patience to sit through turn after turn of watching my guys walk, crawl and run all over the map just to discover an enemy and get systematically boned. I'd be fine if they were quick about it, but even dying takes forever. Then you spend a turn shooting back (most likely missing from feet away), and repeat.Was it great for its time, I'm positive. I was impressed as the building I was cowering in crumbled around me, and by the different firing positions my sniper took when he shot through cracks in the floor. But if you're not playing for nostalgia, aren't a WWII fan, and expecting XCOM, bring a book.TLDNR: Very slow game. Perfect if you like watching games, decent if you like playing games, poor if comparing to modern games.			"

												I understand that this is an old game and all but from that period of time there are quite a few games WAY better than this one. Jagged Alliance 2, Fallout 2 and tactics, Men of War, Commandos 2 and from more recent X-com for instance. I remember SS generating some hype back when it came out but after playing for a few hours I decided that looking at two soldiers standing in front of each other and shooting back and forth because they are both apparently blind is a waste of my time. Turns take for ever due to horrible AI on both sides and the fact that most soldiers are crosseyed and cant hit anything. It's a waste of time and money, many better turn based tactical games out there.			"

												For a title that came out in 2004 it felt way to clunky. Maybe i was expecting too much after getting more in to turn-based strategy games due to X-Comm:EU, but 15 minutes in and i was already disliking the gameplay of Silent Storm. Did the controls and features really have to be that over-complicated?Maybe it would have been more fun if i just sat through it all but i just didn't want to take that risk and possibly waste my time. It's fine if you did and you ended up enjoying it but personally i can't recommend it.			"

												People who like ""Jagged Alliance""  would like this, that is if it had any of the details and depth of that game.   Instead they get repetitive combat with a flimsy story linking the battles.  JA had a significant economic aspect that could keep you on a fairly short leash, limiting advancement and forcing you to make do.   Good guns were in short supply, ammo was hard to find and expensive.  In Silent Storm,  your supplier gives you free weapons and ammo while every enemy drops weapons and ammo.  After a few battles you have virtually everything you will ever need for this game.   Character progression is broken and many specialty items are not really worth the time.  Why lockpick when you can simply machine gun open locked doors and crates?  Enemy AI is dumb enough that all battles feel exactly the same.    AI in this game simply means ""move into visible range then move out if you have enough action points left"".    Many missions degenerate from first contact into ""lay all your guys into a line and snipe enemies as they come into your field of fire.   And almost all of them will, one after another like lemmings.   Huge piles of bodies do not deter them.  And conveniently they come one at a time so you never have to worry about being overhwelmed. It's a shame because the game system has promise but it's far too simplified to make a memorable game.   Feel like blowing ten bucks?   Go ahead - it's good enough for a few hours distraction.   But I was not hooked enough to bother finishing the game.  At least it didn't cost that much unlike that horrible xcom remake where they stripped out all of the aspects that made the original game fun.			"

Excellent 3d destroyable environment by either shooting guns through walls or explosions. Graphics are a little dated, the UI elements are a little cumbersome by todays standards, and the plot is nothing special, but the game-play more than makes up for it.Spoilers: Spoilers:My key annoyance is the shift as the game progresses from a sort of historic WWII game to including dieselpunk elements of power armor and lasers...

Silent Storm is a great challenging WWII strategy game. It really gets your adrenaline pumping when you see the destructible terrain going boom and you having to work your way around it because you had three guys in there. The character creation is, surprisingly, pretty cool. Unfortunately, the leveling doesn't work that well so you have to download the ""Skill Watchdog"" mod to get things working properly.I highly reccommend this game to those who love the Commandos game series.

												I haven't played it much yet, but I really see this as being a fun game. I like the turn based fighting and how the controls work. I usually don't enjoy birds eye view/ 3rd person, but it makes the game better and easier to control since you play as a squad of people not just one. I highly recomend this game.			"

												Silent Storm, a unique play on the world in 1943. The game puts you in command of a 6 man squad from either Allies or Axis, with you in Command plus 5 Commandos from various nationalities. You can customize your character and see them through the war till the end!Pros:- VERY unique, and VERY fun to play.- Every choice you make in the field effects the flow of battle, which can give you a HUGE variety of different strategies.- Your character's class and arsenal are nearly endless, with a huge variety of SMGs, Rifles, LMGs, Grenades the list is endless.- You have a large selection of Commandos to choose from, each with their own unique personality and class, use each to their full effect and you'll see the enemy cowering in fear!-You have a huge amount of missions and areas to discover and explore, finding weapons, gear, and new allies (or enemies) to see you through your journey (or end your journey.)- You can find a lovely secret weapon near the game which mixes man and machine into one.- This game is challenging, even at the lowest difficulty enemy troops can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and some missions can seem impossible, but with a open mind and the right team and loadout, you can achieve victory even when it has slipped past the jaws of defeat!- Mods can often fix some of the smaller problems, like Uniforms and that sorts.Cons:- Graphics aren't the best. (IF you care.)- The game can be overwhelming at the start for new players, I suggest looking up some tutorials and playing the training.- Sometimes the things NPCs say can be repetitive and downright annoying, it will take time to get used to the repeating.- The game's main story is overall what you will be doing, there is little free roaming to do aside, some random encounters. (Which are often repeats of the last.)			"

												This game is the full package as a hybrid rts/rpg game. The gameplay succeeds in fitting the turn-based combat into the context of both expansive and interior environments alike. I have experienced minor bugs, including 20-second lags inbetween when a soldier stops firing and when you can control their actions again. These aren't gamebreaking, just slightly annoying.Gameplay also fits into how you use the character classes available, from snipers to grenadiers. A branching skill tree system makes you plan out what skills to take now in order to arrive at the skills you'll need later. Personally, I didn't feel drawn into the story of Silent Storm. The story mission levels were not interesting to me, but the fact you can set up camp and walk around your virtual camp really sells the context of the game. The game really sells you are this character, which you have the option to create or pick from available templates. Granted there isn't much you can change about character actions or motives, but you can create your own stories within Silent Storm just because of this focus on context as well as a randomized mission option.I had a lot of fun, but there were just enough small details to irk me. The lag can get annoying when it happens more often with more participants in combat. You have to return to base to grab more ammo, and the little dot on the map has to physically move over to the 'base' button. I understand building context as a figure moving on an actual map, but the maps just aren't detailed enough to draw you in to the movement. See Mount & Blade: Warband in which they do movement on a map correctly. When you return to base to resupply, there's little interaction with the people who administrate your operation. You just stare at them while changing figures and items on a screen overlay. It breaks the game world interaction to the player, breaks the sense of realism and importance of your role in the war effort. Like no one cares what you do.All things considered, I'm at a strong 7 of 10 for Silent Storm			"

												I've been meaning to write a recommendation for this game sense I really got a chance to play it,(a play session that didn't end till one in the morning.) But to had done so would have meant I wasn't playing the game. A lot of people liken this to x-com or other Turn Based Tactical Squad games. And it does it well, cept for the grenade's ranges,(but there is a mod for that.) The inventory management is fairly well done, and the shooting feels nice. IF the screen shots of the game look a bit dated. It's because the game shows it's age. But while it's graphics could use a sprucing up the game play is still solid. And for me that's what counts. Now if you'll excuse me I've spent enough time typing this, it's time to get back to playing it.			"

												To put it simply this game is either great or horrendous depending on who you talk to.Many PCs encounters bugs on every level, and thats a viable reason to not reccomend the game. Others give it a thumbs down because ""it got hard on easy"", well guess what, it's hard. The mechanics on this game aren't the best and I have my own complaints about hiding (it's a little ridiculous) however that doesn't change the fact that this game requires a lot of strategy that sometimes comes with a lot of frustration. If you're up for the challenge, go for it.			"

Can't get through the door?  Blow a hole in it.  Or the wall.  Heck, knock the whole building down if you have to.Variety of weapons is good, class skills are plentiful, and give you lots of customization of your soldiers.There are a few glitches here and there, and a few wtf? moments built into the game, but there are mods out there to fix the sci-fi elements, if you don't want those.

												A must play Turn Based Strategy game (TBS), which focuses on squad tactics, and has RPG elements. I pretty much forgot about this game, until finding it on a $team sale. Glad I re-discovered it! Pros: [Partial list, just too much to include everything]Elaborate critical-hit system, which plays well into tactical decisions. Bodies as impromptu cover: May allow LOS, but block weapon targeting (reports as 0%). Physics are fun; some kills are priceless. Kill enemies by destroying terrain features, like guard-towers or even the usual tanks/barrels. Muzzle & trajectory can be altered by aiming at particular crtical zones on target! Long weapons extend muzzle beyond an adjacent friendly unit (less friendly fire). Variance or ""spread"" of rounds enroute to target,along with minimum and maximum ranges. Pathing indicator can be set as visible in settings, good for precise troop movements. Dynamic destination indicator, which displays AP amount requried. Double click for movement in real-time (in settings); priceless for simutaneous commands. Pause command is also invaluable for simutaneous commands (even to synchronize attacks).Enemies can suffer from morale issues and attempt to retreat, when appropriate. Pathing and flanking abilities of AI. Virtually every object and structure are destructible! Shooting through ceilings, floors, and walls for kills... pure joy. Enemies hiding in bushes? Throw a grenade to defoliate the area... lovely. Weather and time of day affect accuracy; night decreases visual range.  Vision and detection can be decreased with foliage and even tall grass. Enemy and friendly units are aware of sounds (player has sound and vision icons). Limited LOS information, where direct LOS has red icons, while non direct have gray. Enemy indicators can be used to aim and even jump to enemy location. AP cost & chance to hit is reported dynamically, even upon mouse-over while unit is moving!Grenade tosses are designed for units to lob them around corners. Prone position is invaluable for decreased noise, decerase detection, and increased accuracy. Rolling terrain, rather than just flat maps... one small hump can be incredibly useful. The manual is comprehensive and really shows the detailed level of game's design. A plethora of arms and ammuniton to choose from (only about 4 dozen are worthwhile). 6 character classes, but 3 are rarely desired (Show stealers: Sniper, Scout, Soldier). Various characters, builds, loadouts, and random spawn locations to increase re-play factor. Creative uses of grenades and mines: Chain reactions, path blockers, door removers....XP is shared, so appropriate units and tactics may be used, rather than awkward ones. Camera can spin 360 degrees, along with limited altitude and angle (KB and mouse). Cons: No grid overlay and toggle control, which can make planning precise movements awkward.No toggle control for tree canopy, only in settings; this is not good for repeated quick looks.No night vision appropriate to period, not even flares.No equipment to break LOS or decrease accuracyl, like smoke grenades. No range finder. Workaround: Save, shoot, check range in console (if activated), reload save. No control for units to check LOS and cover on map. No way to determine value of a unit's cover. No overwatch feature for snipers, or supression fire commands for others. No fire based weapons, or flammable environments. Tech trees are generally too costly, with some pertinent skills separated. No information regarding crtical results (activate console and check log if desired). No AoE coverage indicator. No way to speed up time, pass/eliminate ally turn, or know when all enemies are dead. Ai is basic, either camp or assault. Bad news? Assaults die one by one in corner ambush. No meter for magazine counts (unlike JA2), pop-up only, so set timer to zero in settings.Supplies and ammuniton cannot be combined/consolidated. No control over skill upgrades for reserve units at base. No battle-scape inventory screen like JA2, which makes looting awkward. Minor bugs, such as KB will issue mass commands, but not all mouse buttons do so. Some KB commands omitted, like the sniper scope's extra aim commands (mouse only).Note: No strategic layer, other than adjusting loadouts and deciding on mission order. Sci-Fi elements would be less bothersome to some players if it could be turned off. Balancing is shot with sci-fi equipment, but a player could choose not to use them. Manual training is tedious, units become overpowered, but a player could ignore training. Facing changes cost full AP every time character sees an enemy, so get ""Look for Free"" skill. Loot is not destroyed in AoE attacks. Which seems odd, but this design is so convenient. One of my favorites, so if you like one, you'll probably like the other ones too: X-COM: UFO Defense and Terror From the DeepJagged Alliance 2Warhammer 40,000: Chaos GateClose Combat, CC: A Bridge Too Far, CC: The Russian Front (larger than squad & no RPG)Valkyria Chronicles X-Com: Enemy Unknown, but only with the Enemy Within expansionDisclaimer: The pathing issues, especially with Panzerklein, are attrocious on the last couple maps. The $team version cannot be completed without an unofficial patch (see link). Be prepared for some corny dialogue, it is part of the charm.

If it's this game, even when you put unicorns and magic and all other non-sense, it still will be a good game. This game has good combat mechanic, strategic level-up system, and graphic that still holds up even for today which outweight the cons, in my opinion.Iz a gud gaem			"

												Not perfect, but solid turn-based squad action strategy. It's got tons of weapons, destructable levels, satisfying shooting, complex but believeable rule set. It is coming from 2005, but im my opinion it holds up very well ten years after release, It is still fun setting up inventories before battle, taking out overwhelming enemy force with just your 6 dudes, and then pillaging through the loot to take the best items with you as supplies or upgrades.Controls are good, graphics are fine, runs on modern systems (win 7, at least) in widescreen with couple of tweaks.

It has a few flaws - such as custom characters having a very limited audio set (six accents vs. about 10-20 for the pre-generated ones) and a few minor graphical issues but this is still a very entertaining game to play and well worth a look when the game is on offer - do keep in mind the game was originally released a number of years ago and the graphics do seem a little dated.

												One of my favorite games of all time.  If you like X-Com, then you should love this one.  It was the spiritual progression of the turn-based strategy genre when nobody else was doing it right, with important skill tree choices, squad building, and character improvements.  It's 10 years old, but has better destructible environments than any game I can think of in... well.... ever.  And not just a gimmick, something you'll actually use to realistic effect and begin to wonder why nobody else does it that well.			"

												Worth your time if you enjoy turn-based strategy games with RPG elements. Bonus points for being set in WW2 rather than something sci-fi.  Although they do nerd it up later in the game with ""mech suits"".  Shame.  Still good after a decade.  Also scores extra points for being able to play the campaign from either the Allies, or Axis sides.  There are way too few games like this.			"
