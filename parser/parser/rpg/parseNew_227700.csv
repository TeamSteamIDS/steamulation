												As of the 1.6 patch this game has swapped to, and begun the path down, pay to win. In the patch players had their stats nerfed, movement speed, HKM charge, durability, and those stats were put back in... as 1 hour consumables you can buy.All vehicle and glider purchases, outside of packs, have been changed to be rentals for up to 30 days. Besides the tutorial bike you have to wait for ""special events"" for offers that get you faster perm vehicles or chances at perm gliders.Crafting has been disabled until patch 1.8. Endgame zones we had before have also been disabled till that time.The classes have recieved massive revamps, almost all of them are a shadow of their former selves and if you are a returning player then you probably lost a ton of your progress in the migration.The game is in a very buggy state, they had been working on this patch for 9 months prior, however due to the chinese parent company The9 pushing the patch before it was ready and layoffs hitting Red5 the entire combat system they worked on over those months was scrapped and reworked 1 month before Friday's release of the patch.The old professional voice over work is gone, replaced with temp voices that were put in to cover until they could pay the VAs to do the recordings of the new script, and rerecord the old lines that were changed.The real kicker is that this was Red5's last try. If this patch did not massively succeed then the game was going to be shut down in North America and Europe. With its last remnants moved over to China.It had the opposite effect. The community is enraged. 9 months of feedback, bug reports, and warning not to push the patch through were ignored. The buggy migration code was pushed out before it was ready under orders from the parent company.Currently China is not set to recieve the patch. They are using the entire North American and European player base as bug testers before the patch and the migration code goes over to China.I was first wave Closed Beta. I got to take part in the opening moments of this game when Mark Kern was at the helm. I was there at PAX Prime the days it was first announced. I got to help crash the game, I got to see PvP, PvE, Thumping, when they were all first implemented.This game is not worth your money. I once would have recommended this game. I once got a bunch of my friends playing.What the game needed was to do as Mark Kern envisioned: push the melding wall back to reclaim the earth. To unlock more content to explore and play in as a community effort. We needed new frames to be released. Not for a massive revamp that removes frames and crippled the rest.			"

												Update: After the 1.6 update is had been made 100% clear that this game will not last very long at all. I have a feeling it will go under sooner or later so I really wouldn't waste my time on it.FireFall once allowed you to explore the land and play wherever you want. You had a nice and simple class system where you could pick up a class and start playing it without issues. You could play instances with a brand new class and no one would complain or even notice you were a low level.That world has gone. The new FireFall (The release 1 year ago) feutures a leveling system. Which forces you to play in set locations until you have gained enough experience points to move on to the next level. Even after playing your faviroute class all the way to level 40 you will be greated for many players typing LFG or LFM into chat. As they're looking for items in instances which are only available at level 40.You can no longer play any class you'd like. You have to stick in each level zone until you outlevel it. (If you get a class to level 20 but suddenly want to play a different class you have to go back tot he starting zone and play there instead)You can't really play with friends as if you are 5 or more levels above them one of you is going to have a hard time getting experience points and therefore will end up leaving the lower level behind.I have been playing FireFall for 2 years but this is where I get off the fanbus and say farewell to all my friends I have met in this virtual world.I've spent over 150 pounds on this game hoping it would someday become the shining beacon that it had promised to be. Unfortunately this beacon is yellow coloured and I don't like yellow beacons if I'm honest. If you're looking for a game with repetetive gameplay, an empty and boring storyline with a horribly boring operator talking to you every 5 seconds then this is the game for you! The AI is flawed in so many ways. The 'alien' race is weak and easily killed where as the common bandit will destroy you in a few bullets.The whole 'horizontal progression' system of firefall went out of the window and now has been replaced with 'vertical progression'We no longer travel the horizon, we take the elevator.EDIT: I'm glad so many people agree with me. Maybe this will encourage the developers to re-use or go back to some of the older assets :)			"

												I Started playing this game waaaaaay back when beta first started. So ignore low play hours on steam. This game has gone through some rough times, and 2 major and complete overhauls since they first invited people to beta. They started pretty weak... then turned it into something amazing, but far from complete. Then a bunch of whiny babies complained about it and thus left us with another Sub par major overhaul of the core game mechanics. This game used to be all about exploring where ever you wanted. Thumping where ever you wanted, grinding where ever you wanted. An actuall sandbox about resource collection, crafting your own gear out of what you collect and true exploration.Now, it's just another ""grind missions here, then move on to the next map, grind missions here, then move on. They limited you sooo much from what their 2nd core systems had. Now you have to follow their paths, do what they want you to do. Not to mention you have to grind for yer gear. Stupid RNG system with Loot rolls, really original guys... While it is a unique game, they ruined what it could have been instead of taking a risk and sticking to the amazing game systems they had.

												It takes a lot of talent to ruin a fun game as much as these devs are. I have never seen a company so focused on destroying their own game. The whole thing has only gone downhill in a way I thought impossible.Playing this makes me wish it was illegal to release games as betas.Last big update made me lose 80% of my gear and abilities with pretty much ZERO compensation for them, and the comepsation that I did get is worth maybe a day of playing.The bugs, oh god they're everywhere. They are growing in numbers and nobody can stop them.Oh, I'm not talking about the enemies there. We are still dealing with bugs that came up during the early builds of the game, and they just keep getting worse with no attempt to fix them.""Pretty much everything not loading in properly? How about we change an unrelated thing that nobody asked for.""The devs are like children trying to ""help"" their parents with something. They are so focused on adding stuff they think is cool without any care of what will come out of it.I have never before had a game leave such a bad taste in my mouth.			"

												A litte about me:  I've been playing this game on and off since closed beta..  Most of my time here is pre-steam and I've dumped a ton of money into this game (commander founder pack, vehicle packs, Beans, etc) -  I'm a long time gamer and usually pretty understanding when it comes to wipes, redesigns, and rebalances.  I've seen this game though its many changes/stages and been pretty understanding and optimistic through all of its versions.I could drone on and on at this point about the faults I find in this game, how I've lost faith in the developers I once respected, and how the game just isn't fufilling for me as a vet to play anymore... I'll spare you from that. --What it boils down to--As it stands now I feel the game has lost its soul and at its very core is just not fun to play regularly anymore.  They've disabled a lot of features (like crafting), killed ""thumping"", and just plain sucked the life out of end game.  They've done a lot of rebalancing and redesiging up until this point (which was fine) but this just feels different and as a whole un-nessessary.-- In my opinion --You'll do best to save your dedication, time, and well earned money for a game more deserving of your attention.  This game is a sinking ship.... ...The  violins are playing, and it's time to head for the life boats.			"

												When I first started playing, back in early 2012, my first impression was overwhemingly positive. Although the progression system was quite close to the current one (level based gear with module slots), the game showed enormous promise to become its own ""thing"". It started with 0.5, where the new tech tree involved a much more horizontal progression, which was less about inflating numbers and more broadifying your combat options. It also brought in a constraint system (fixed at the time), which forced you to make decisions about the gear you could equip. It sounds like a bad thing on paper, but it actually made you *think* about your character. You could decide exactly how to build it, how to specialize it. Your character was truly one you'd call your own.Another milestone passed, and the tech tree was refined in a deep, complex crafting system while the character progression focused on constraints (which became upgradeable through gained experience and collected resources). As your constraints improved, you could equip stronger, better gear (bringing some vertical progression) while making sure you could never equip all of the top quality ones at the same time.It was an ideal diagonal progression system, one that I sincerely hoped would stay for good.As for the world, well... we were promised an open, sandbox-ish world that would evolve and change through the players' actions, and for a time we had something quite close. Coral Forest used to be quite a dangerous place where watchtowers and other key points could fall to the Chosen any time if left undefended. Places like Sunken Harbor and Thump Dump could even be submerged by the Melding, and that had consequences, albeit temporary. Still, we really had the feeling that the region was the last bastion of humanity surrounded by an implacable force from another world.And most importantly, anyone could contribute to an event (ares missions, thumpers, melding tornados and so on...) and be equally rewarded regardless of his own progression.Everyone mattered.Everywhere mattered.Every*thing* mattered.So, what happened?Well, progression is now back to being level-based with slottable gear and no constraints. The consequence is you don't need to care about your character, you just pile up level after, equip that white Gun'O'Pwn because it's better than your old purple Gun'O'Whack you picked up 5 levels ago, you see numbers inflate exponentially and it doesn't mean crap because your enemies' health increased by the same factor, you follow the same jobs over and over since they're all variant of kill/fetch/escort (Yep, there are escort missions. The kind that makes you ragequit 99% of the time).The crafting system has been simplified to the point of being dumbed down, yet at the same time required several times more material grinding than before, especially when some components can only be gotten through the goodwill of the RNG.Said RNG also govern the result of your craft, so you are not even sure if the result is what you want.The old open world has been segregated into level-based areas, so players too high or too low for an ares mission, job or whatever would be penalized in the rewards gained (that's right, if you are a lowbie and want to try something challenging, you are screwed).Virtually all of the 'chosen war' aspect have been taken out of coral forest. No invasions, no incursions, a few strike teams every once in a while... the ""last bastion of humanity"" became a dull, unchanging place.With the release patch, the game changed from an innovative, off-the-beaten-track MMOFPS into essentially WoW with guns. It had a lot of promise, but instead went the generic, unimaginative way.I regularly played this game for two years and enjoyed the hell out of it. I just don't any more the way it is now.For people who never played the beta, you might enjoy it. You just wouldn't realize how good it could have been.			"

												I just realised I didn't reccomend this game. And I don't know why! (TL;DR VERSION BELOW)Firefall is unique MMO. Why? Because:1. It's really free - you can even gain pets without paying a single dollar. Just chance for pet is pretty low, but you have 100% for advanced frame YOU want after gaining max level.2. It's one of VERY rare MMOs, where there are guns, just like in good old shooters, not some auto-attack + abilities. Of course, there are abilities, don't worry, but there's even a class which has... Guns instead of abilities. Yep, 5 weapons instead of them. But ok, onto review here.BASICSGameplayGame is set in First Person or Third person perspective - you can change it in any moment. You play game as a mix of typical MMO (like WoW) and shooter (like CoD, but I'd say it's not very similar). There are 5 main character classes which you can change it every moment, you don't need to make new character. Of course every class has it's own level to level. Every frame (they're called like this in game) has it's two advanced versions, which are modifications of main one (with exception of Dreadnaught - he has 3 advances).CombatFirefall is shooter + abilities - Left Click to shoot your weapon, right click to use special ability of weapon and press 1-4 buttons to activate abilities. You can also use items from 5-8 buttons, like grenades, medkits etc. Also, there is meele under G, but I don't see many players use it. I'm a fan of it, though. Your primary weapon (each class has it's own locked to them, advanced frames can use their weapons + main frame shooty) has limited ammo, while your secondary one has unlimited. I won't say too much about them, I don't wanna waste space.Missions and worldThere are 8 main missions (more coming with new update. MANY more) which you can do in normal mode or hardcore mode, solo or in group of 5 players. You can take smaller missions from Job Board, but they're a bit boring. But hey! But what if I don't wanna do missions? No problem. Firefall is fully-open world.  You can get anywhere you want, as long as it's not a big melding curtain. Because it most probably will kill you. You can do missions, you can go to randomly-generated events (plenty of them, you won't see many during 1-9 levels, but it will change) or you can just explore world - game even gives you achievements for finding hidden locations. However, game becomes grinding your way after some time, which is sad. You can avoid it, but leveling up this way will take very much time. There are 5 locations - Coral Forest (1-24lvl), Sertao (25-36), Devil's Tusk (37-40), Amazon (40) and Broken Peninsula (Desert where nobody lives. Sad)CraftingThere is crafting in game, but I won't call it VERY interesting, rather simple and easy-to-go. You place a thumper, a device which mines stuff, you collect things from killed NPCs and then you refine it. You salvage things for research points and crystite (currency), and then you research things like new weapons, modules, medpacks using research points and CY. After you researched a thing, you craft it with more CY and iron/tungusten/whatever/refinedthingsfromenemies. Voila, you've got your gun/module/ability or medpack.Leveling upHow to level up? Well, you can't level up by messing around city. Do missions, if you have LOTS of free time. Do random events, if you want to or you don't have too much free time. Level up with other guys, there are big numbers of these. I'd love to say PLENTY, but this game is so unpopular. I hope it'll change soon. Maybe thanks to my reviev ;)But what after leveling up to 40? You can still mess around last location. You can go to Amazon, VERY hard location and try to fight with Chosen (enemies) for forest domination (yep, AI isn't best, but they'll try to capture your bases while you try to do same to them). You can go for raids or hardcore missions for better loot.STUFFClassesThere are 5 main classes: Dreadnaught, someone who takes tank role, Assault, guy all-about damage and mobility, Biotech, healer (bad at it, tbh. Dragonfly rulez), Recon, NOT a sniper, I'd rather call him light infantry, and Engineer, a painful class to play. Sets up sentries and supply stations. You'll probably choose him as your first class. That's normal, I did same. They're just too weak at higher levels, and without support... Powerful at watchtower retake.Each class has two (or three) advanced frames. After paying some money or gaining level 40 you can choose one. Each advanced frame has his own set of abilities and weapon, but they can use main frame stuff. They look like this:Dreadnaught - Rhino (DPS) - Mammoth (Tank) - Arsenal (Screw abilities when I can have gunz)Assault - Tigerclaw (Specialist of PWNing single targets) - Firecat (AoE)Biotech - Dragonfly (Healer) - Recluse (Damage + poison, healing only with BIO skills)Engineer - Bastion (Right course for engi) - Electron (Powerful support, but nobody plays as him)Recon - Raptor (Sniper with charging rifle) - Nighthawk (Sniper with bolt-action rifle)Random stuffCurrencyThere are some ""money"" things. We see here: Crystite (CY) - collected from almost everything. Used to almost everything. Credits (CR) - Collected from final box in small numbers (you gain them after some playing). You can also sacrifice CY for more CR, in exchange rate of 25:1. Used to buy things from market, self-revive or buy RB. Red Beans (RB) - premium currency. Used to buy things from shop, make your inventory bigger. It's possible to buy them, of course, but also you can request exchange of your CR for RBs. You place how many CR you want for 1 RB, and then number of RB you want. If somebody finds your offer lucrative, he'll trade it. I did it many times, safe.Character customization - You can change the way your character looks in any moment. You can change his head, skin color, hair style, hair color, even sex, why not? We haven't got a shortage of battleframes. Also, you can pay for additional customs - like helmets - or just drop them during gameplay. You have many options to customize your character, but it's not TES, expect rather a bit better-than-WoW customisablity.Graphics - Good. Very good from a distance. Beaches of Copa, forests of Redwood or Kearney's Transit Hub, desert of Sertao, lava pools of Devil's Tusk and Amaze Amazon of Amazon. From closure, it's still good, but not that good.Community - GREAT. THESE GUYS ARE AWESOME. Seriously, in my whole career here I saw only two guys being rude or spamming. New players ask questions, they don't get shouted, they get answers. There are multiple clans, I reccomend being a part of one - not hard to enlist. I'm in [WaR] and I received a warpaint from them, thanks :DTL;DR versionGame is worth any money. Best part? It doesn't need any. It's free in 100%, even pets. Has 16 classes. No auto-attack crap, you have your trusty weapons and 4 skills. Good graphics. Amazing community. Found a friend which most probably got banned... Woops.In short:Gameplay: 9/10 Good idea as for MMO, guns, abilities, open world, but too much grinding end-game.Graphics: 7/10 Good from distance, but not very good from close-up. Also, some people may not like a bit anime theme here, I'm not sad because of it though.Audio: 0/10 Aero's accent is annyoying. (Joke) But in real, soundtrack of this game is awesome. Sounds are bit higher than decent, and are often buggy. So I give 7/10Overall: 8.5/10 - Dang it, it's a free game, if I have to add this little detail it would be 9.5/10. If you like shooting games, GOTTA TRY IT!Uhh... Rating is appreciated? Thanks. Was typing it for 30 minutes.Missed something you wanna know about? Write in comment and I'll add it to reviev! "

												What can I say that would ease the pain? That it was great while it lasted? Those are the words that should be said for an awesome game that's closing its doors for the final time; celebrations of the life of a community and good game that ran for well over a decade. I had a few of these experiences. Phantasy Star Online for example was one of these, (the first one mind you. There's still Private Servers, but no point since PSO2 exists). I played a few other little MMOs here and there in my youth. In 2012, I found this awesome game called FireFall, and fell completely in love with it. It had the makings for an awesome story, awesome gameplay/gunplay, it was an MMO and an FPS combined... and something like this was new to me. Hell, it was one of the firsts... by which I mean if I point my gun at something and pull the trigger, it dies. No tab-targeting to be seen.I was a founding Commander too even. Watched the game grow during the early days of beta. You could go anywhere in the world, you could shoot whatever moved... there was actual things to do. Pretty sandbox-y for those early days. I remember spending a couple good years with this one group... well, several groups actually, although with this one community army, I could never really get into it offically... so I just operated as an outside agent. It was the game that got me to buy my first graphics card since I wasn't really big on the PC market back then... so I can thank Firefall for that. The other group, we had a teamspeak and good times. Sure it was a little rough... but I'm generally pretty chill. Good times were had, before that got broke up; this of course being after everyone else had quit... the game became stagnant due to a MAJOR flaw; the developers at Red5 Studios were rebuilding the game from the ground-up, so that left us with little-to-no updates outside of hotfixes. They'd started this whole entire promotional bit with a bus (which is sitting in a warehouse somewhere now), prizes to be given out for their Founder Packs (which were available for a good year or so), and no actual NEW content. No new guns or gun designs, no new Battleframes; nothing.Then comes a new update that kills PvP off (which was fine for me since I didn't play it anyway), which was pretty lackluster to begin with... adds some new zones to teleport to which didn't let you go very far. They rebuilt crafting, and progression to a near-unplayable level. For example.... you could have this really nice Tier 3 Plasma Cannon (Assault), but then you can't get anything else.. abilities, armor, servos... nothing. Or you could kit out your plating and become a little bit better than paper mache (READ: tinfoil), but then you couldn't kit out anything else because of constraints. Math went in and between a few people collabing together, they figured out it'd take 13.5 years to max out.... one Battleframe. ONE. Not all 15... just one.Well, come later on and after enough hell-raising, instead of fixing the stupidly-high progression requirement ceiling (they reduced it a little bit but not by much), they spend more time with their Twitch streams and social garbage such as Red 5 TV... and rebuild the game yet a second time. More waiting... more time spent... and still as friends left, I stuck with it. I stuck by them... and little did we know that Red 5 was pretty turbulent internally; all the senior staff had been fired off at this point, The9 which was the people funding Red 5 at this point had a complete strangle-hold on them at this point, and returns were being requested. They booted out Mark Kern... one of the main CEOs of Red 5 (READ: the guy who FOUNDED Red 5 in the FIRST place!!), and hired another guy to lead development for a little while. Progress got quicker, and then Open Beta hits... after 2½ years it finally hits and people are estatic. They added a new Battleframe which was pretty cool... until I figured out how bad it was. It was called ""Arsenal"" which was this hulking Frankenstein-esque junk frame thrown together from various other frame abilities and parts, made fat as an insult, and carried a pretty poor LMG with did crap-all to anything you shot at.. and its abilities were poor imitations of other weapons which didn't even last but a few seconds, a butchered Engineer ""Salvo Proxy"" called some sort of new lame ability and made its ultimate. That's right... ultimates replaced the fourth ability... which had turned this game's skill system into that of a damn MOBA's abilities (three boring abilities, one half-decent ability)... which seemed great at first for the other abilities, until they changed those too! They kept throwing nerfs about, making the enemies stupid-hard, and making us stupid-weak. No skill anymore, just the feeling of being curb-stomped into the ground over and over.Another half-year in Open Beta, and finally comes the 1.0 release... but not before yet ANOTHER rebuild of the game. Now we're reduced to levels (in which the only frame I ever was able to play; Accord Assault) insta-leveled to the cap of 40 due to all the XP it had obtained, and a semi-linear storyline. There's still open-world stuff to do, and everything. And surprisingly... my best friend decided to come back! And a new generation of people joined us in the new community I was a part of (READ: Still am, still proud. PG forever, I tell you what), and together... we completely dominated the game. The fun was back, with stuff to do and new places to visit... although those older places (Area Y; Jungle, Area Z; Antarctica) were still on hold..........Unfortunately... good times have to end I suppose. Eventually, things got pretty bleak after more members of Red 5 got let go. The9 was increasing its grip on the company from what the community could see; what with Reddit being that thing that seems to bring out the best and worst in people (though I don't use it myself; I can read, however), Various AMAs from disgruntled employees who were struggling at this point to survive (For example, Tony Reyas whom I had spoken to personally a few times while he still worked there... good guy that one.), and talks of yet ANOTHER rebuild of the game (We had gone through three-four at this point? I lost count years ago)....And so now we arrive at what I could only describe as the Chrono Trigger-variant of post-Apocalypse 2300 as far as this company goes, (if you want, you can listen to that piece of the soundtrack... it's called ""2300 A.D.""). The last Firefall Live was quite some time ago, last year in 2015 if I recall... they don't even use their studio for it anymore (which looked pretty ""repo'd"" to me). Most of the CEOs are gone now. There might be someone there but I have only loosely followed the game and the resources of the company at this point... as I've moved on. I was a mentor for the longest; still am... had life issues to take care of course, but there... there's just no point anymore in worrying about it. At this point, the forums are dead and broken (see the following screenshot[puu.sh]), the community is completely divided and broken, the devs don't bother speaking to us anymore except for FadedPez (AKA: Frank Lettieri... I salute you, you poor soul) who is already attempting to hold everything together with what appears to be some lint, some cloth string, and scotch tape.............(More in the comments)			"

												I can't believe I'm making this review, Firefall, the one and only MMO that stood out from all the others. Stood, because Firefall as it was is gone. And as the original CEO of the company (Mark Kern) said ''It's just a WoW clone with guns now''. It's not what he wanted at all, ever. Mark Kern was ejected from development. And it's precisely at this point that firefall went downhill. In the state it is now, do not even bother playing it. It's 100% like any average boring MMO.My brother, my father and myself have all loved firefall for what it was during the beta. My brother started during early alpha, supporting the game for what it was SUPPOSED TO BECOME by buying the founder pack, along with some accessories like the firefall beanie. Both my father and me started around the early-mid beta. THIS was when the game was at it's best.Mark Kern now would appreciate if the players would stop supporting The9 and Red5, and let this game die so that he may revive it again. And in the possible case that the devs would refuse to let Mark buy the game back, he is planning to make Ember, a game that would be like firefall during mid beta, the game everyone loved and the game that stood out from all others.Anyways, I deeply thank you for reading this review and I wish firefall to rest in peace if Mark isn't able to revive it.EDIT : Ember forums are up! link to it : http://forums.emberthegame.com/ "

												Some of us played this game for years, before steam release for quite some time. It took some of us months or even a year to get the best gear, weapons and abilities. But now Red5 decided to take away most of our gear and make all of it useless. All of that time playing the game, for nothing now.They also don't seem to care a lot about feedback. Really a disaster right now.EDIT: The game is dead. Devs are gone and pretty much everything is broken. Don't even try.EDIT2: Still dead.			"

												Never before in my 15 years of playing online games have I seen a game so utterly ruined by its developers. Short of shutting down the servers there isnt much more that can be done to make this game any less playable.Firefall used to be a very nice game that really only lacked in having a larger community, I would have rated it 4.5/5. After patch 1.6 where pretty much every system in the game was ruined/removed and everyone's characters lost everything (not to mention the removal of over a third of the classes) I would rate it a 1/5. New people can no longer switch between classes and they removed the crafting system entirely. What makes all of this worse is the fact that the only motive red5 seems to have for doing this is the huge leap towards monetization of pretty much the entire game (you need money to get good gear, a crafting system would circumvent that).TLDR: Was good, now entirely crap. Not worth the disk space.			"

												The end.My last review for this game:This game, was once amazing, better than any other free-to-play games. Long years ago, when this game was in closed beta, it had everything. A lot of players,living community, amazing and unique gameplay, exciting balanced pvp, hardcore pve...loved to waste my time in there.Time has passed, and with every update ,they scarred the game.Every update made it worse each time, and made a lot of players quit.It is really shame, what happened to this game-it had potential.I will always keep the best memories and experience from this awesome game, unfortunately even the bad ones, like the fact, that this game is DEAD. May it rest in peace.(Game in original stages, its closed beta had a solid 9/10 gameplay. And now? It is...dead.)			"

												Two years ago this game was marvelous, a large and vibrant open world with interesting missions and an awesome community. That community has been stabbed in the back, entire sections of the game have ceased to work (The first mission after the tutorial for instance), veterans of the game have lost almost if not all of their high levelled battleframes/rigs. With players being unable to partake in the 'story' missions the playerbase has hit rock bottom. Until a later date then the devs and The9 can pull their collective thumbs out of their collective asses there is no point playing this once great game unless you want to witness the death of an MMO			"

												EDIT: As of today a new update is in action. Said update removed 6 classes, 3 entire zones/maps, over 15 abilities, passive perks, slowed combat down to a crawl, removed crafting replacing it with 1000% more grindy korean styled tinkering, removed all the alternative fires from weapons save for 1, gave all the weapons insane spread and recoil and allowed you to spend money buy combat boosts. Yay.Don't waste your time with this. Go play warframe instead, much more reliable, fun and optimized experience.Firefall devs are hellbent on killing their game. Ever heard of a game that kicks the bucket? Well we're talking about developers ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the bucket.In summary the problems with this game are:*No endgame content, whatever exists of endgame is a bunch of repetitive dailies that lead to a dissapointing bullet sponge boss. But hey, I can tolerate that because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.Mobility got nerfed to♥♥♥♥♥♥ *Horrendous balance. 1/3 the classes in the game are broken overpowered, 1/3 are broken underpowered the remaining 1/3 is just broken.As of this update, 3 classes are viable to use everywhere and only 2 are actually fun to use and everyone who likes the other 7 gets to suck a♥♥♥♥♥♥*Reverending grind (seriously warframe has less grind than this). It takes multiple HOURS to farm a single max tier item. Now, you might think ""It's end tier, it SHOULD take a long time."" and that's good and all, but here's the problem, you got 16 classes, each class has a unique primary and 4 abilities + a core.The primary and the abilities need 3 modules each. Do the math and try to figure out how much time it takes to max a single frame.Did I forgot to mention if you want an ace custom (that is, personalized with special bonuses/stats that fit your playstyle) you need to craft an additional custom prefix for each your abilities and weapons? All that plus 5 secondaries shared among frames.But hey, I can tolerate that because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.Crafting has now been replaced by tinkering.What does this eseentially mean? Well you can no longer craft your weapons and modules and you need to find them in random drops or crates you open with keys brought from the store. (Yes because that worked out so well for tf2, dota, csgo, payday, spiral knights and god knows whatever else, the difference is that in those games crates contain cosmetics, not upgraded weapons that you will need to use)In order to upgrade said weapons and modules to make them upto raid stadard you need to spend thousands upon thousands of credits and salvage hundreds upon hundreds of weapons all paired with an RNG to have a crit tinker (that gives big bonuses) or a noncrit tinker (that gives smaller bonuses) (that you can pay premium currency in the store to get tinker tools to give you a higher crit chance) and said proccess has to be repeated for all weapons, abilities and modules 9 times. (Assuming every single tinker is a crit, if its not, you're gonn have to redo untill it is, because noncrit tinkers are worthless.)Tinkers are essentially stat improvements that increase various stats of your weapons.*Lack of combat variety. Combat is composed mainly of braindead mobs moving slowly and shooting at you as you shoot them back. But hey, combat is still fun because free mobility, jetpacks and gliders.Combat now has even less variety since all alternative fires, a massive chunk of abilities and all signature perks got axed.Yay.*The worst imaginable raid system to ever exist in the history of ever. You can only do each of the 3 raids once per week with 20 people, and out of those 20 people only 4 get 1 item that's not even guartenteed to be epic (epic meaning that you won't need to replace it down the line with something better). If you got nothing, wait untill next week do the raid again and pray that you get something this team. What this means is that you can raid every week for a straight year and get nothing. But hey, I tolerate that because jetpacks, gliders and free mobility.The raid system is now EVEN worse.You got only 1 raid, that you do once a week, BUT there is a cap on the ammount of reward tokens for it you can hold to a number of 8.So, you got 2 insanely limiting factors at once at play.So, that essentially means that you can only farm for 3 items out of 10 frames at a time, and you can't stockpile for when updates come.*Really bad optimization.  Not much to say here. It's reeeaaaaally reaally bad folks. But it's ok. I can cope with all that because the movement system is extremely fun, you can fly forever, jump around freely perform airplane tricks while still in combat, never touch the ground and still be helpful to your team and generally mobility in this game is really fun and really invigorating.Yeah, this doesen't exist anymore either. All frames took a massive movement hit as well as gliding. Infinite flight or really fast movement aren't possibly anymore.So why is this review negative? There is no reason to keep this in anymore, the game has lost most of its redeeming qualities.2 important notes.1.)Every 2 months a COMPLETE overhaul happens every 3 updates that completely change everything into what is basically a new game. So far we've had like 4-5 complete overhauls.2.)Usually, said overhaul is the for the worst. For example, in an older version of firefall you had pretty much completely unlimited and free airplane flight with minimal investment which meant everyone could enjoy it and everyone could have fun without sacrificing other parts of their build.There were no levels and all proggresion was horrisontal.In the same update you could also craft 101% ace custom weapon with you being able to tailor every single stat of a weapon however you wanted to select what fit you best.That got axed in favor of more grounded combat and the neverending grind of a crafting system I mentioned above that allowed nearly no customization.If the devs don't trust their own game why should I?Ultimately, I think the game is worth trying out just for the experience because it has jetpacks  and flying bikes. As of today, the flying bike that needed 1 straight month of grinding has been nerfed to♥♥♥♥♥♥so the developers can resell it to us for real money which they are.Last but not least, remember those pay2win boosts I mentioned above?Well, if you pay red beans, the premium currency gotten with real money or with trading, you can pay for hourly boosters that reduce the damage you take, how fast your ultimate charges, how fast you move and how far you can fly. (More jet energy, that also affects how much you can heal someone if you're playing dragonfly because your heal gun uses jet energy as ammo)In the end, I can't really recommend this game in its current state.But hey, in 6 months another complete overhaul will happen since the lead designer got canned just like the 3 ones before him, I'll see you then.

												I do recommend this game, but only because it's free to play, if you had to pay for it, I don't think it would be worth it.This game is fun for a while, then it gets a little repetitive, then it gets REALLY repetitive.In this game you're a battleframe pilot.  In the beginning you can use the basic versions of 5 unique battle frames, they each level independently and though you only have to do the main story missions once, you can replay them all you like.  Each basic battleframe has 2 or 3 unlockable advanced versions, these are unlocked either via cash shop, the player-run market with ingame currency, or using pilot tokens from leveling another frame to level 40 (max level).  The problem is that there isn't a very large variety of things to do, even at the start, there are about 4 different types of random events around the map, there are a few (not nearly enough) area missions you pick up at the bulletin boards in town, or main missions.  After you outlevel the area you're in, you move onto the next one.  There'll be some different monsters/people to kill, but essentially it's all the same.  The even worse problem is that you have to do this for any battleframe you use... There's no different story, no different events or missions, or quests... So essentially you'll do the same thing (which in the beginning is exciting but it only lasts at most a matter of weeks.) over and over again for as many battleframes you want/have.Having friends in the game to play with only prolongs it so far.

												Updated 21st of Augst 2014: New patch, new changes. They've ramped the dynamic content up a lot. For all those complaints about being 'forced' to do Jobs to exp, Red5 responded. You can now go from 1-40 doing nothing but randomly spawned missions if you wanted to. These include things like Chosen drop pods, bandit ambushes, lockbox assaults and similar. They added the mobility to Assault many were asking for, and did a tuning pass on a lot of other frames to fix a lot of problems people were having. All in all the devs have been really responsive to the actual issues. Of course you'll now see people on the forums complaining that the game is too hard now! All these enemies! We wanted a war not challenge!All in all they've been doing an excellent job of polishing up what needs polish and adding in new events and trying to work up new live events for the players.Updated the 9th of August 2014: I just wanted to update this a bit to say that the devs have remained constantly talkative in game, interacting with the community and answering questions and the like. I've gotten a chance to play with quite a few of the crew from Red5 and they are all pretty passionate people. The forums for this game are turning into a pretty toxic mess, but in game I've seen nothing but positive changes as Red5 continues to try to iterate and get the game more polished. The first few weeks were pretty rough but I've got to meet a lot of cool new players who seem to honestly enjoy the game. Red5 seems to have a direction they want to go and seem to be following it much better then the kind of random experiments they were doing before. After yesterdays Firefall Live I have more faith in their ability to take feedback and data and move the game forward.Just, you know, avoid the forums. It's pretty much the bottom half of the internet. If youtube and news articles have taught me anything its that you never read the bottom half of the internet.I've been playing Firefall since near the beginning. I want to make something clear for anyone who reads the negative reviews: They are horribly nostalgic. The 'constraints' system boiled down to 90% of the population using the same build (Max cooldown and jump jets) so they could fly around in circles and spam abilities without a modicum of skill. Regen was high and it was easy to make yourself literally invincible. The game was incredibly easy and no one wants to admit this because that'd ruin their rosey naval gazing.On to the game we have now: It's bigger. The world is really well made and has a lot of interesting locations. The different frames all feel different enough to be noticeable. You can hit level cap in a week or less if you just pay a bit of attention to how you gain exp. Crafting currently is too overtuned in that the prices are sky high, but that'll probably get toned down. (Dev's have said they wanted to start high and go down because almost no one whines about having to spend less to build things.)All in all its a really solid shooter with heavy RPG elements. There are really fun raids at endgame and the instanced dungeons that tell that main story are generally really fun. You can solo all of them (Well not the raid. At least not that I know of.) but they definitely shine with a group.Also the assault class plays like a Tribes spinfusor soldier. Huzzah to that.			"

												....where did it all go wrong?...First of all, to any of you veterans who remember me as Herostar, the mammoth who could, and the guy who made his nighthawk so fast he could keep up with the lower power LGVs, Thank you for everything you've done. And to HERD, the army I was in so long ago, I won't forget the things you've done either.Firefall was one of the best games I had ever played a few years ago. It was fun, it was open, it felt like an adventure that I could play and control. The random encounters were exciting and rewarding, and the amount of times I led the charge to defend Orbital com's tower might even match my hours on record...Unfortunately, it tanked. It's most recent ""rebuild"" of the game just.... Damn.First of all, the first release of it was so bug ridden, so mutated, so broken, that they had to temporarily disable reaching the level cap, and your Map went from useful to Annoying due to the amount of buged waypoints it showed up. It was comparable to even famous games in how broken it was, and the difference was, This is an MMO.They've patched out few bugs since then, readded the level cap (but didn't relevel frames you had. my mammoth still needs to be remaxed) and the gear was so durastically changed, I went from able to fair my own in amazon to not even capable of running missions alone. And they removed some of the best missions, and deleted or changed the lore. This game was one of my favorites. Was. now it's nothing but fond memories and burnt hopes.Red 5, where did everything go wrong? why would you do this?...The world may never know.			"

												Let me just say this.Firefall used to be great.It really hurts me to say that, and even writing this review is hard for me, but I need to say it, Firefall used to be a game where you could go anywhere and do what you wanted to progress, to fight who and what you were in the mood for and be able to explore to your heart's content.Fighting off bandits at a road ambush.Facing wave after wave of wildlife as you protected a mining drill that was gathering resources for you.Teaming up with tons of players to fend off an attack on a town that could actually end up with LOSING that town until a reclaim mission was made to fight to take it back and push back the corruptive melding that had washed over it.It was all amazing.With enough skill even your basic starter setups could do difficult missions and most of your progression was give and take when it came to gear, so you couldn't just be ""the best"".but then over time something happened, they started moving away from these kinds of freeroaming, levelless system and more towards what every other MMO was doing, every update seemed to push a little more of that charming unique factor out.now there was levels and you had to stay in your level-designated zones or else you'd either get overwhelmed or have too little reward to be worthwhile.now there was boring post-apocalypse deserts and drab dead landscapes of volcanoes, the game lost that beauty that the original area (now the place for starting players), that feel that made you WANT to explore the world and see the sights.but then it got worse.another update.this one removing more of that uniqueness, trying to cash in on other mmos of the type, trying to find audience with crowds that it didn't quite fit while pushing the older crowds away, removing features, altering the fundamentals of weapons, even outright removing a class option.but worst of all in my opinion.it removed the ability for new players to have the freedom to change classes between the 5 core classes whenever, they were locked to a single battleframe class until they hit level cap on that class and unlocked another class or variant.it was terrible.it was the point I stopped reccomending the game at all.and now, it looks like it's dead, or at least close to it.so it pains me to say it.but I just cannot reccomend Firefall to anyone anymore.it's just no longer the game that I loved, and it probably never will be.

												Ages ago, I would have given this game a glowing recommendation. An MMO that's free to download, no monthly fee, and can get any purchasable content through your own hard work and dedication, rather than cash. It was the answer to all of my problems with MMO's in general.The game was incredibly fun. All of the playable frames/classes (except Accord Engineer) were all fun to play. There was tons of different things to do. There was an active community, which was an absolute pleasure to converse with most of the time. It was good enough for me to log over 2,000 hours in it.However, the development team decided to take the game in a completely different direction in order to appeal to a new Chinese audience. Open world PVP had all of the benefits taken away well in advance of these changes, in favor of an arena PVP that wouldn't see the light of day until nearly half a year later. All of the balanced Accord frames became unusable after level 20 to support a new progression system, and the Arsenal advanced Dreadnought frame was removed from the game. What remained was a group of frames that were ultimately not fun to play after the large amount of changes to each.Currently, Red5 is not staffed. There is nobody working on the game. The plethora of bugs present in the game will not be fixed. There will most likely be no new content added to this game, save for the unlikely event that another development team is assigned to continue the game. The forums aren't even being moderated.After a lot of promise, the game is finally inching its way towards death. We just need to let it die.			"

												Firefall is a Open world 1st/3rd person shooter similar to tribes. There is resource harvesting and dynamic world events that let you feel like you're in some kind of living world.  If you like playing team games, resource harvesting, basic crafting and killing aliens and bugs then you should like this game.It's okay for a free to play game, there is time gated content that requires you to level up your stating classes to unlock advanced ones. There is visual styles like paint patterns and color schemes that you do have to pay for. You can pay to unlock advanced frames but you can’t pay to level up the equipment you use.You can however pay for XP modifiers so you can level up faster, there are random daily incentives that lure you into staying logged in for up to about an hour and to do so daily.Crafting is time gated with the ability to pay to speed up crafting.The cash shop has social items as well that don’t do anything other than in game fireworks and junk similar to making pets appear.You shouldn't waste money in this game, the developers change features and flip/flop on designs when ever they feel like it.Why is this not recommended? 3.0 2/22/2016+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Well looks like the engineer got another nerf, thanks.Oh yeah crafting has been disabled until the next update.... Let that sink in: game features are disabled post release, pending major game changes...post release...Guess this is the NGE i was waiting for...Why is this not recommended? 2.0 2/5/2016+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Summary: Game released Jul 29, 2014, 1.5 years later they decide to change major game mechanics with several classes and flat out delete one class. The game continues to decline into an accessible crap pit. Like some one running up to your bike and sticking training wheels on.Since they change almost all of my rigs and i lost of bunch of stuff they gave me a bunch of XP tokens i used to level up most of my rigs. SWG CU all over again, im just waiting to get screwed by the NGE.Need more? read below Why is this not recommended? 1.0 12/21/2015+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++From beta, all the way up to what was released, the developers decided to either throw away or parcel up systems and abilities into something that could be monetized since the game was intended to be a f2p game. Complex systems rewarding crafting systems were simplified so that more players would join.Resources are a prime example of something completely thrown away., Originally resources had quality levels. Anyone that played Star Wars Galaxies would have immediately seen the inspiration of the system from that game. You could ultimately affect your crafted equipment by the quality of the resources and the quality of those components you made from them.There is this fog that kills you called ""the melding"" that you use to be able to push back, they got rid of this mechanic and just left the areas open for everyone.. ie no work they also removed alot of the npcs from the area that you would have fought and leveled up to push it back. You didn’t have or need all of these frames, all of the specialized equipment that only the advanced frames have were originally usable by the base frames. You could mix and match parts to suit your play style.Ultimately what you have today is H-O-R-S-E when originally they had basketball. It’s not a bad game, but it was a better game that was ruined for money.They decided basketball was too risky and people might not want to play.			"

												I've only HEARD the horror stories of 1.6... And they have me deterred from even FINISHING my install for the main client itself.So, let's go over a history lesson of what the game had right and wrong from start to finish.So, in the beginning when I start playing the open beta back in August of 2014, the game kicked♥♥♥♥♥ There was so much variety it made my head spin! You could literally keep finding things to do... Thumping, fending off angry Chosen, ARES missions, Chosen Strikes, defending Sunken Harbor and Thump Dump....That ALLLL ended when the game launched on Steam. The variety of things to do mysteriously vanished, along with the sense of direction the game initially had, quelling all chances of growth slowly as time went on. The first features to be removed of course, were the chosen activities. Next on the list came resource variety, taking away literally EVERY resource, ALL 18 of them, and replacing them with Iron, Tungsten, Titanium and Uranium. The bio- and mech- resources already in the game got more additions, increasing the rediculous ♥♥♥♥ING level of farming and grinding required to even step ONE foot forward in the damned game.Move on to 1.3, things have gotten even worse with the removal of the Battleframes' variety and reducing the progression style to your basic♥♥♥♥♥level up system, going even FURTHER BACK from the Constraint system. In addition to this, the unwanted and un-needed focus of story was put into the game, getting in the way of the gameplay itself and literally ♥♥♥♥ING with the pace nine ways from a Jesus' Chicken Sunday..........................................BUT AT LEAST AT THE TIME THE ♥♥♥♥ING DEAF-AND-HALF-A-RETARD DEVELOPERS HAD A SUSTAINED IQ HIGH ENOUGH NOT TO DOUSE THEIR OWN GAME IN GASOLINE AND THEN CARPET BOMB IT WITH CRASHING ZEPPELINS FILLED WITH FOUR CUBIC ♥♥♥♥TONS OF HELIUM, PURE OXYGEN, CONTAINERS OF PURE SODIUM, AND NITROCGLICERIN AND LIQUID ♥♥♥♥ING NAPALM IN SEPERATE CONTAINERS, ALSO ALL IN CUBIC ♥♥♥♥TONS MULTIPLE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING TIMES UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A HORRIBLE DISFIGURED, SMOKING CARCAS SOMEHOW STILL ALIVE BEGGING TO BE SHOT IN THE HEAD FOR IT TO BE OVER WITH.THIS... Is what 1.6 has done, according to what I've learned. And I DARE NOT get on for the sake of my own sanity. The introduction of lockboxes, Spiral Knights-and-a-half level grinding and farming, and temporary stat boosts have milked what remains of this victimized game for what little left it's worth.In addition to that, literally EVERY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING BATTLEFRAME IN THE GAME HAS BEEN NERFED UNTIL IT IS A GOD DAMN FOSSIL DEEP ENOUGH IN THE CRUST TO HAVE SUPPOSEDLY BELONGED FROM THE ♥♥♥♥ING JURASSIC PERIOD OF DINOSAURS. AND OH MY MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING *GOD*, DON'T GET ME STARTED WITH THE INSANE, SADISTIC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T THAT IS REMOVING THE ALTERNATIVE FIRING MODES FROM LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE PRIMARY WEAPON THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EQUIPPED IN THE GAME.AND IF *THAT*♥♥♥♥♥♥ISN'T ENOUGH TO SCARE YOUR STUBBORN♥♥♥♥♥AWAY, THE ♥♥♥♥ING WALL-OF-CHINA LEVEL OF BUGS WELL DEFINITELY TRY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HORRIBLE AUDIO RECORDINGS REPLACING WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN THERE ALONG WITH EVERYTHING YOU OWN POSSIBLY BEING DELETED OR RENDERED INTO A RENTAL.This game suffers from something I call Destiny-itis. WHY Destiny-itis? IT'S THE ONLY ♥♥♥♥ING EXAMPLE ACCURATE ENOUGH TO DEPICT A GREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME BEING EXPECTED AND SHOWING ITSELF TO BE SO POORLY DONE IT DOESN'T EVEN QUALIFY AS A 16TH OF SOMEONE'S LEFT FAT ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥CHEEK.That being said.... There's literally nothing you can find you'll enjoy here more than you'll enjoy in most other games. HAVING finished my angry, relative rant to this review, I've learned a while ago, to hope for the best and expect the worst. In THAT respect, Firefall hasn't disappointed, but with the target goal of building back its playerbase, it's long since passed the point of no return with Red5 Studios being purchased by a Chinese business company. If you care for your wallet, money, sanity, time, ♥♥♥♥s, ♥♥♥♥♥, happiness and fun,... You won't EVER wish this game on ♥♥♥♥ing ANYONE. NOT YOU, NOT YOUR ENEMIES, NOT YOUR ABUSIVE STEP FATHER. NOT ♥♥♥♥ING *ANYONE*.			"

												[Disclaimer: I downloaded the game just to write this review. I played it for 3 years, many many hundreds of hours I suffered it's buggy grind. No more. I just wish to prevent you from repeating my mistake.][Disclaimer#2: This review is LONG. TL;DR version is at the bottom of the review]I am Megakoresh and this is my story in the game that set out to break the rules and ended up breaking only hearts:In Novermber 2011 I have joined the beta for ""Firefall"" that was having all the right ideas for ""fixing"" the MMO genre, fixing all the things I hated it for. It also was coming up with a revolutionary method of development at a time - community-driven development was not nearly as widespread then.Game started with a PvP component and sheduled tests twice a week. People would organize, play, provide feedback, the next patch the feedback was directly implemented and fully documented a to what was changed and why. When PvE launched in April 2012, this continued, the game was slowly improving leading up to the major patch in August 2012, when the game opened the cash shop. That patch and the systems that came with it was the biggest and the last long-term imrovement to the game. 2 years ago. The signs that the game doesn't really know where it wants to be, of mismatch between features, of the lacking gameplay and shooter component, were subtle at first, but community, has picked up fast and warned the developers of the things they needed to work on. These larger warnings were ignored, but smaller suggestions were constantly being implemented, often without considering their ""compatibility"" with the game's design, but it pleased those who posted the suggestions and created this illusion that the ""community-driven"" development was still going on, even if by now it was in fact searching forums for issues and solutions that the developers already decided on, acting them out and then claiming it was ""requested by community"".As time went by the development focused more and more on economy, [mostly vertical] progression, adding various stats and senseless enemies upon a barebones stat-driven gameplay system which meant any additional content was suffering from diminishing returns as far as gameplay is concerned. Any extra ability didn't matter because of 30 second cooldown, which, like most things in Firefall, absolutely doesn't fit the fast-paced, spammy combat. Any extra enemies were just extra-buggy reskins of already buggy current enemies and so on, you get the idea.As time went by, the players, who signed up for a game that promised to be a true MMOShooter, started getting frustrated at the continued focus on the MMORPG grind, economy, progression treadmill and ignoring the gameplay, despite consntantly trying our best and spending a lot of effort on feedback, thinking that the developers still consider it with the game in mind, not their own personal biases.Wasted effort and continued degradation of the game are sure ingredients for conflict and as the feedback started to be intertwined with [rather reasonable and polite] calling out the devs for them ignoring the feedback on the topics of gameplay and variety, we all have realised who Red5 really were, as they began aggressively defending their philosophies without (unlike the community's complaints) any evidence to back it up. This followed into more negativity from the community, which in turn has followed into.... censorship. Yep, in a totally unexpected display of unprofessionalism, seeing that the threads and voices of the ""veterans"" and people who wanted the Firefall from 2011, were being heavily supported by the rest of community, Red5 went over and simply banned the people in question, including me, from the forums, where 99% of the feedback is discussed. Following that, as soon as people recognized my name on their devstream in the twitch chat, they immediately banned me from it as well.After that they proceeded to keep making the same mistakes they were making ever since August 2012. These spanned across EVERYTHING in the game: from balancing:Weapon X is hit-scan, fast firing, high damage per shot, designed for ""skillful marksmen""; too OP. Options: make it projectile, >>reduce fire rate to increase skill level<<, nerf damage. They did: nerf damage. ""Skilled marksmen"" my♥♥♥♥♥to resources:Our resource system is too complex, but not deep enough. Options: nerf amount of resources and levels, increased the imprortance of comboing resources for different results to give players more freedom; ADD OVER 9000 RESOURCES FOR MAXIMUM INVENTORY SPAM!!!. Guess what Red5 did. And then they added inventory limits a year later because servers couldnt handle it. Pfft...to enemies:Enemies are too easy for leveled players, need to make them harder. Options: add more abilities to current enemies, add telegraphs, high damage attacks, area-buffing, make each enemy a threat and scale spawn compositions OR BUFF ALL THE HP!!!!. Guess what Red5 did.In addition they highly encouraged fanboish behaviour; screaming and flaming on forums was not punished so long as it was in favour of the dev's point of view. One of the CMs tried his best to try and bring the old spirit back, to be objective and fair, but ultimately his efforts were in vain. Still, he was the only bright spot after Red5 showed their true colours, I hope he quits and finds a good studio to work in instead. When you were just defending some stupid mechanic like death penalty (which isn't supported by this game at all, and you will see why as soon as you start playing), without insulting anyone, the devs would often ""Like"" your post, which you can guess what effect it has on a fanboi. The devs eventually hid visbility of ""likers"", just displaying their quanitity instead.Eventually most of the older players got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at being ignored, censored, screamed at by fanbois, and left. Those that tried to circumvent the game's grind through exploits after months of begging the devs to reduce the grind, were wiped and left too. The game started dying and the devs started running out of money. So what did they do? Take a wild guess fellas. They started frantically implementing whatever 2 year old suggestions (that were screamed about to them over the course of the beta) they could implement in a short amount of time. But by this point it is much too late. The game was built upon a base design for a shooter with minor MMORPG elements, but the meat and most of the bones that were added in during the development are that of a traditional MMORPG grindfest.=================================================================As a result you have a game that is an extremely repetitive and boring ability shooter, with abilities having 30 second cooldowns, adding nothing whatsoever to the variety (they scale down to 5 seconds, which in some cases makes it extremely OP, but it will require you to pay hundreds of $$$ or grind for hundreds of hours and babysit research for months to get to that cooldown). It's jetpacks, freedom of movement and very lush colourful world coupled with excellent aesthetics and graphical fidelity will provide a high ""WOW factor"", until it blows off and you realise that the jetpacks are just tools for random bunnyhopping around, with that being the only reliable way to avoid damage. It's MMORPG elements are just as lacking, with a severe lack of content, buggy and grindy gameplay and enemies and the same boring ""dynamic"" quests, that have to be repeated thousands of times.A ton of money, tears, wasted effort and broken promises; this game is a testament to the ""Never believe in 'ideas'"" rule of modern gaming industry. The community is nice though. One of the best out there, so at least that is not a lie. If you are going to play this game, it would be nice if you tried and keep that tradition. It is the only good thing about the game aside from it's looks.			"

												This game when I started playing it back in late July 2014 IT Was Awesome just what I wanted but after months of playing it. It changed, The devs took the fun from it and replaced it with nerfs and upgraded NPC damage to the point of making the game frustrating and just a grind. Now all my friends from other games that I got into Firefall have just stopped playing and some friends I met ingame Firefall just drop by now and then but most of them haven't been on for months.This is the classic mistake game that devs make, they put out a great game and then second guess it to chit, while nerfing it as they are saying they will be putting out new stuff soon. All the while players see only false promises and upgraded NPC damage that they have to use gimped toons against.Red 5 pretends to listen to players but only if it suits thier purpose as to what they want to do .!.

												Good Free game and surely, not Pay-to-Win. You can actually enjoy leveling your character in-game, with or without the help of others. But the community is very helpful if you know how to ask.Great soundtrack, cool sound effects, beautiful graphics (if you got a decent PC setup).The action might get linear after getting your first 40-level Battleframe, but after that it get more easy to enjoy all that happens around you.Like the game description says: ""... constantly changing world, deep narrative, endless customization, and rewarding player progression, Firefall will consistently deliver spectacular content that will please both PvE and PvP players"", i guarantee it to be true.

												As many posters have illustrated before, this game has taken a turn for the worse since true release. I played back in beta where the focus was on the idea of thumping (obtaining resources) and teamplay, with open world events being common such as having areas taken over and such. There was MASSIVE potential for tech tree progression, the crafting system, and development of the storyline.And that's where it all went wrong. Nowadays, the focus is mostly on grinding up to certain levels and then instancing to fight the same things over and over and over again. The storyline is bland and has made perhaps 5% progress since closed beta, and the balancing is horrendous. Each time they make a change to a component such as crafting, something becomes ""overpowered"" or easier for the community. They then proceed to nerf this, which leads to another area becoming popular. Nerfs upon nerfs upon nerfs. No real content changes, failing to understand that their new crafting is fundamentally flawed to begin with.Combat wise they made the game too much of a mix. A focus on teamplay oriented mining, or solo adventure? How about we try to do both and fail miserably simultaneously? They are just all over the place. I could rant on and on about this game, but there is honestly just too much. TLDR: This game had potential and now it's a grindfest. Enjoy for maybe 10 hours if you REALLY want to try a new class, or pay an insane amount of money for very little. Your choice.			"

												It's a fun game for the first couple of hours that you play it, while you're getting accustomed to the world of the game. Then some of the harsh realities start to hit you. The game starts you off by allowing you to choose one of several basic classes, like Assault, Dreadnaught, Recon, etc, and upon reaching level 40 (max level) with any of these classes, you are given 10 pilot points to unlock an advanced version of the class. Herein lies one of the game's irritating problems. The grind becomes very, very annoying. It's just continual back and forth between Job Boards, with a few world events thrown in like crashed LGVs or thumpers. It would be fine if it was fun, but once you do it a couple of times, the missions get extremely repetitive and tedious.  One of the annoying ways the Job Board missions can make life hell for you is by forcing you to travel long distances back and forth, and if you don't have an LGV (a type of vehicle) or your glider is on cooldown, it becomes very tedious. Yes, I understand the developers need to make money somehow, and this is clearly a way to make people consider buying an LGV, and that's fine, I just don't like it and I'm warning others. Unlocking advanced frames is extremely, extremely grindy for a new player that hasn't been in the beta for a long time and already has everything unlocked. Say you pick Recon as your starter class, and you want to unlock one of its advanced classes, the Nighthawk. Unless you straight up buy it with Red Beans (the premium currency), or from the Community Market with credits (another premium currency, you convert between the regular currency crystite <> credits, and credits <> Red Beans; it's not easy to obtain the large amounts of credits needed by exchanging crystite), you're going to have to first go through the grind of leveling up your Recon to maximum level, and then once you've unlocked your Nighthawk, you're going to have to start the leveling process all over from the beginning to level that up. If you want to unlock any other class, now you have to level up the Nighthawk to level 40, etc. etc. Simply put, it's extremely, extremely grindy.If that wasn't all bad enough, that's just grinding with classes. The grind you have to go through regarding crafting is another pain. I will say playing some of the classes themselves are fun, but the process of getting to play any of them properly is nowhere near fun.EDIT: In fairness to the game, I will say that they have done a nice job designing the actual world itself. The graphics look very nice most of the time (unless you get close to any rocks in the game, my god those are ugly). Using gliders and the LGVs feels nice, it's just the process of getting there that's a huge pain. The game's soundtrack was also very nice to listen to.			"

												Been playing since they first invited players for Alpha stage...As the top review goes.Thats pretty much it.They have changed it to the crappy generic MMO crap instead of its own idea due to players being grumpy, spoiled brats.PvP Content removed since then.I'm sure its coming back. it was removed due to a reason at first but then brought back then removed again for the same reason.PvE was pretty much was about exploration, this game had everything revolving around exploration and freedom.You had to do everything yourself. Like, everything! And it was amazing.Then everything changed when the generic MMO players attacked....			"

												I played it, I had fun, sunk hours into it day after day. got good at it too. my friend and I just wanted to relive the days from a year agowe read the reviews...we read them all...we wanted it to not be true...it can't be true......We log in and find that my biotech is gone, that the level system ""changed"" and all i have left is my recluse; my friend lost his enginer since he did not level to a new frame, he lost it all. we are given each a new frame to ""replace"" the one lost, both only level 20 we get ingame and are greeted with a bunch of mail from Red5 giving us ""armor crates"" and ""module crates"". confused we open them and get some weapons that fit our levels with some cosmetics / skins on them. i head into the inventory to find i now need to equip armour looking things, thankfully given to me by one of the crates. I notice all my resources gonei notice all my modules gone save for the few i just got from a cratei see my abilities goneStripped of all I worked for, I sit defeated. my weaons are♥♥♥♥♥♥now, my frame is♥♥♥♥♥♥now. Im♥♥♥♥♥♥in battle. All Im left with a few hundred thousand usless currency to make up what I lost apparently.So here I am, me and my friend. Rich but screwed over. This was a horrible change over a year. barely anything carried over and we are left with nothing to do except run around, shoot sh*t, level up, and die.TL:DR: Friend and I lost everything we worked for and the game was watered down leaving nothing to do.

												2016 March Update: The most fun about this game for me was how the Dreadnaught, especially the Mammoth played out with some of it's special abilities. One that stood out was the Tremors ability which for one had one of the best animations and it helped you when your mate is overrun and is down. With recent patch the Tremors and Teleportation Shot (another ability I enjoyed as it also was a helping hand in the same situation) were removed and replaced with abilities that are only useful for other situations which we already had the rest of the abilities for.The direction this game is going is not really bright and I no longer have any interest in this game, it was fun and cool with friends, but not anymore.Overall: 4/10Orginal Review from 2014 July:""FireFall have delivered many great things since it was first released (closed alpha) and I can only say the game can be insanely fun, unlike other MMOs FireFall feels a little different, it's a game that you can hardly compare to other MMOs, which is good.Here are some of the positive things that make FireFall outstanding.- Random Events. (Randomness is the main reason this game feels different and it is the feature that makes it insanely fun to play)- Graphics. (It is not realistic, it stays closer to Borederlands style than reality, which gives the whole game a better feel, more smoother and relaxing feel)- Design. (The World is very nicely designed, with places that won't make you wish to never go back to, instead, it is something you don't mind to visit thousands of times)- Enemies. (The enemies in this game reminds me to Borderlands, every single enemy looks awesome and well designed. While some are cute and fun to squash, others are cool and badass ""I'm looking at you Terrorclaw!"")- Chosen attacks/wars (Invasion aint here yet. The game is capable of showing from tens to hundreds of enemies at once, making these Chosen attacks/wars an experience you don't get in any other MMO, fighting against an army of enemies is more fun than anything I've ever experienced in MMOs, it's like you are in a LoTR battle)- Battleframes (frames are your armors and each class has a different armor. These armors are for 1. look awesome and for 2. are paintable, they are not completely customizable, but you can still put on a different jetpack or a reactor on your back)- NOT PAY 2 WIN (Yes, it is extremely rare to see a F2P game that is not P2W in any form. FireFall is completely free, there is in game curreny ""red beans"", but everything you can buy with them can be acquired in game for free)Now, here are all the negative things that bothers me.- Playing Alone. (FireFall was intended for Coop, like any other MMO and solo players will suffer the same thing with this. The game is fun for solo too, but if you play nonstop, then it will become repetitive after a week or so)These are bad changes that only early beta/founders feel as negative, it won't change the gameplay for new players.- Nerfing. (These devs like to nerf classes and when they nerf, they give hell, so it is hard to love 1 class for a very long time, if it gets a nerf the next month, cuz the best thing about it is getting too common)- Lack of Random Events. (Random Events are in it and are awesome, however, back in early beta, there were Random Events at every 100m, giving the player unlimited fun, but then they reduced the number of random events and now you only see a couple in a big area)- Nerfed Chosen Army. (Back in early beta, when there was an attack of chosens, the fight took well over 30min, everytime the chosens attacked, it felt like you are fighting the battle of the century, the legendary epic super awesome battle for humanity, those Chosens were FEARED by players, but then they got nerfed, yes that hell nerf, and now chosen attacks can be done in 5-10min, chosens' power were also nerfed, they are now just another enemy, not feared, not hated, forgotten...)- No Chosen Controlled Areas. (As I said before, back in the days, it was really hard to win a fight against the Chosen army and the game system is that the chosens can take over bases and watchtowers. Everytime I logged in I saw at least 3 bases/watchtowers taken over by chosens and I always went there and tried to take over the base/watchtower with like 20-25 other players, it was like an Epic LoTR battle, but after the devs nerfed the Chosens, everything went down, I havent seen a single base or watchtower taken over by Chosens ever since the nerf...)All the negative changes are something that is bad for founders and early beta players, but for new players, those are things that won't bother much... so those things won't affect your gameplay, if you havent experienced them in the early beta/alpha.I still have a damn good time in FireFall and this game got more potential than most of the MMOs out there. If you have read this and feel that you should not play it, even tho I praised the game like it was a diamond in the MMORPG genre, then still, definitely give it a try, you will like it and you might love it.Finally, I know I pointed out many negatives, but the positives were all something that can only improve gameplay and the negatives are something that can be brought back into the game anytime.9.5/10""			"

Original review (Improved and expanded review below)This game was so good in closed and open beta, my account is 4,5 years old created December 14, 2011 03:57, I figured I'd give the game a try again but wtf, it's just a empty shell, lackluster and just plain boring, I regret spending so much money on this game during closed beta and the beginning of open beta when it was still fun.I would suggest anyone to stay away from the game and instead play something like warframe, I don't play that anymore either, but I still do find myself coming back to that every now and then and don't feel so dissapointed when I do everytime.Please don't waste your time on this, the developers totally ruined this game.Edit:Just for the record, I've spend 200 euros on this game:Founder's Pack: Commander  Timestamp1/23/13 4:30am$100 USD ARES Starter Pack 7/11/13 1:56pm$100 USD That goes to show how great the game was, I was willing to spend that much money it was so much fun, but now it makes me sad that I have to tell people to stay away from the game, that it has become that bad compared to what it was.Edit2:Improved and expanded reviewI'll summarize the pro's and cons a bit and explain down further where necessary for anyone that hasn't played and wants a more indicative review for what to expect:Pros:+Very adjustable graphics+Great concept *1+Good balancing+Dynamic Environments+Generic enemy actually has background and lore+UI feels good, no clutter or anythingCons:-Community is spread out, same thing like in GW2, everybody is at the max lvl zones-Dynamic events get repetitive, you'll ignore them after some time-Game doesn't feel rewarding, you are grinding but you don't know for what *2-Game does very little to keep you playing, you will not feel engaged-Game has been washed out from the original concept, everything is very... lackluster *3-Not so well optimized, people still have issues on high-end machines*1 The concept of the game was great, the thing is, in closed and open beta you really felt the pressure of the enemy, you could see whole parts of the world fully under control of the Chosen, even the starter region was always under attack, I purely logged in everyday to check if we could save the day, it was so much fun liberating the entire map and then keeping it under control.You had Chosen squads patrolling in huge numbers and if you didn't stop them they'd take over control of areas, the game was remorseless it was hard on newbies because they wanted to apply the idea of everywhere is the metagame.It worked for a while, everyone could play with everyone and you could see who had been playing longer but it didn't matter cause they played together with the new people it was enticing, now it's just the same ""This area is for lvl 1-10, that one for 11-20"" etc and people don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about others anymore, it's basically what happend to WoW, before the burning crusade there was a real community, after that it became a mindless grind and everybody became a zombie with only their self-improvement in mind.*2In the beginning I the game was very rewarding, you could either grind the credits or xp and you'd get the items you want from the market that were crafted or buy a new suit, you were either saving up materials to craft parts yourself or one of the above and you would always set goals for yourself, if not then you'd play just for fun, because it was actually fun! Suprise huh?!Sometimes I'd just forgo progression to help random people thump dirt because we enjoyed defending thumpers in difficult areas or because they just needed xp and I happend to have the founder permanent bonus xp for parties applied to my account so I'd help them with their grind.*3Like I said in the previous comments, everything is washed out, the game lost it's focus on the original concept and just went for the mainstream to save it and like the others say, the company just doesn't care as much anymore about the player's opinions and thoughts as it used to, they REALLY tried to involve and informed us of everything in the beginning, that was part of why it was so great.So besides it getting washed out into just another generic mmofps the company behind it as well lost it's will to make it into something great, which is sadly sorely projected onto their game.Additional notes:I'd like to point out this video it's from June 2014:

It goes to shows how many Chosen there were when they were taking outposts and this guy is decked out he can take them on but you can see has has to output massive dmg and he's still getting quite injured even when in turret mode, you just don't feel that powerful in the current state of the game, like the game doesn't give the you oppertunity and otherwise other people won't give a damn either.This is one of my own videos to display a bug cause I used to be active on the forums back then in October 2013:

Like he says, you'd just have 2 thumpers on either side of the valley and if it was primetime or you had some daring people there would also be 2 additional thumpers actually down in the alley, you'd have like 20-40 people of the 150 people on that whole server-node in that single valley, all blasting aliens to bits in chaos, it was amazing!

												Update:The game is still on a record streak to get worse. Now they completly remake the game from the ground for the 3rd time since I play this game. Nearly all your equipment ether gets deleted or is worthless now. Also my main class, the arsenal gets completly deleted. The fanboys flamed me for hours why am I complaining, I get compensated for the losses. But sorry, that stuff is not even a quantum of what I loose now. Also I dont even have a class to play the game anymore ^^---I already wrote and deleted a review to this several times, so I wont give this game a long review anymore:- It is one of the most awesome Shooters with RPG elements and open world, I ever played.- it has a kinda interesting story- cool weapons and abilitys- cool classes- very well designed open world fights and dungeonsWhat makes this game so bad:- bugs- butchering of the crafting system- butchering of the ressource system- bugs- butchering of the leveling system- totally bad made events, that will make you hate the game- the almighty present of the item shop (you can play the game well without it, but it is just too strong)- the community- grafic optimiziation is simply not there- if your ping is just a little bit too high, welcome to hell- oh they also butchered their story as wellThey should go 2 years back and start again -.-			"

The graphics were lovely (quite a big fan of the low poly look), the game played nicely, the bosses you had to think about and strategise with your team. Then haul♥♥♥♥♥back as you were starting to get overrun at the end of the mission. I miss those days.You could fly around, change classes at will, use gliders, vehicles, mining ""thumpers""...And one of the head brass at Red5 killed it. Buried it. Congratulations you f*ck wit.

Unless you email the one person left at Red5 thats doing anything but even he seems to have gone missing.This use to be a great game, it's a shame that Red5 squandered $200 million and made this.The people blaming The9 are stupid, would you carry on development for a game that never made money? Of course not. As much as I despise Mark Kern now, I do recommend and suggest looking at his ""spiritual successor"" to Firefall (It will not be like Firefall).

												The game is officially DEAD. It was awesome back in the day, but the company funding the devs didn't think that investing on new tools was good, so they made the devs work with 4 or 5 years old stuff to make the game work. And they did, for a bit, then they started to break things, they removed crafting, thumping, all the fun stuff was gone with the promise of making it better. Instead of doing it on a test server first they brought a broken version of the game to the live servers..and a couple of months later it officially died. I was dumb enough to pay 70 euros when they first launched, never again. It was open world, tons of missions, resource thumping, then defenending the thumpers while they farmed resources, random players walking by would join your thumper defense, sometimes the AI controlled enemies would attack a base, and if lost, that map zone would be locked, and to retake it you had to cooperate with other players, everything you needed from a shooter + rpg game was there. You had cars, bikes, you could use yuour jump jets to get on the highest mountain on the map and use your gliders to, glide, and see the entire map from the sky, it was fookin awesome, with those cartoonish graphics, but it was nice. It had tons of classes to choose from too, it's a shame that it died :(The bright side, a sucessor of Firefall is on the works, Ember. Fingers crossed!			"

												I've followed this game for years-- Ever since Engineers had a blowtorch instead of a grenade launcher.And lately, every patch has successively dumbed down the gameplay to the point that the game just isn't fun anymore.Try too hard to make your game appeal to the widest audience you can, and all you'll end up doing is falling into mediocrity. That is the literal definition of ""pandering to the lowest common denominator"".Don't try to please everyone-- You can't. Don't try to please the widest amount of people possible-- all you'll do is make something bland and uninspired.Don't try to copy a successful formula-- it's been done for so long that the industry itself is stagnating.This game had an incredible amount of potential. But the publishers threw the devs under the bus and crippled the game for the sake of making it more ""marketable"".This is a tragic loss.			"

												Please note I played way more than 30 hours, I played during the closed beta for about 400 or so hours before it arrived on steam.What can I say that hasn't been said before. The game was probably one of the best MMO's I played in recent years. Well before they changed so many things that never needed to be changed. Things that made this game stand out amongst the plethora and constant releases of MMO’s. This was mostly due to Mark Kern being booted from being CEO, this is when the game started going downhill, and when some of the best and unique parts of the game being stripped down and removed. If that name sounds familiar, he worked as a team lead on some of Blizzards most popular titles. His stance on the current state of the game, in an interview via MMOBomb Originally posted by Mark Kern Via MMOBomb: pretty much a standard MMO now, instead of the simulated massive war game that I had always wanted to make”.  So it’s pretty much now your current run of the mill MMO.     Some of the best missions got removed, same with the lore, crafting was removed (which now has made thumping pretty much useless), frames being heavily restricted...and among other things. This sucked for many of the veterans that supported the game by buying the founders packs to support of what many of us thought was an amazing game (like my friends and I did after playing a long while), only to get screwed over in the long run by the new development path of the devs/new CEO. But to make this short, the game, which showed so much potential and promise, is pretty much dead now with almost no signs of changing and reverting back to what the veterans loved about it, and what made it unique. It got so bad that they were not able to pay their devs due to them not having the funds.   Though hope still remains since Mark said that if the game sees the sunset, then he’ll try and buy it back and save it, or if that doesn’t work (if he isn’t able to re-buy it), then he’ll make Ember, Firefalls spiritual successor. So there's hope that we will still see some version of Firefall in the near future. If you want to play it, I say it's worth a look, but I wouldn't invest any money into it, since it does appear to be failing. http://www.mmobomb.com/features/mark-kern-firefall-different-early-id-re-purchase-became-available/ -  His quote on the current state . Also may be a reason why he was removed. (though they come from employees that were under his leadership)  http://www.mmobomb.com/news/mark-kern-launches-petition-ember-firefalls-spiritual-successor/ - Some extra info on his new game if he can’t get Firefall   *Edit - Guess Steam hates MMOBomb.  *Update/Edit #2 - That Ember thing I mentioned, it appears it now has a forum https://forums.emberthegame.com/   If the link doesn't work (or Steam removes it), then just type in ""Ember the game"" in Google. GLHF, and I hope to so you nomads on the new frontier!			"

												When I first heard about Firefall, it was right about the time it went to OBT. The first few hours of gameplay was confusing as hell, because there was no tutorial for crafting, resource gathering, no information about the story etc. Yet, I dug myself into the game. I wanted to learn it. I poured in it around 200~ hours in open beta. After I understood the mechanics, I was simply sucked in into this world.It was a sci-fi shooter, with a moderately deep, but quite hard-to-learn crafting/leveling/gathering system. The idea, that  - a player had the choice to thump (mine) 4x4 different kind of materials - which each had a quality system from 0 to 1000 - while you had the option to explore the whole map to get the highest quality for your gear - keeping low quality for the ""level-ups"", which was kinda like the talent-system in vanilla WoW - and depending on the quality and property of the material, freely modify what you are about to buildwas fascinating. It was hard. There were grindy parts, but the whole game felt like a big cooperation between palyers. Unfortunately the story was progressing very slowy, and the content was quite shallow, while the crafting system was a b*tchslap to all those players, who thought this will be an easy game. Half year before the game came out, I took a brake from it. Then it came out, I logged in, and my heart was broken...They simplified it to the extent, that even WoW is better now in 90% of its aspects. Unless you would like to shoot-'n'-grind a few hours, this game is not for you.Until they give back the OBT crafting/thumping/leveling system, this game is a no-go for me.			"

												This game will trick you into thinking it's good, while it actually is horrible. By that, I mean there are a lot of almost saving graces. The gameplay is fun, the way frames are made to do something wildly different than most other frames is well done. But that's about where the good parts end. I let my hope get the best of me, and continued playing this and progressed quite far, so I've seen everything the game has to offer at this point, as far as actual content. I have 3 frames yet to unlock, but I think they'll probably remain locked forever, because I'm uninstalling. Let me tell you just a few of the completely broken things in this game. 1) Bugs. This game is filled with bugs, left and right. At time of writing, I cannot login, because the login servers are down- DURING A 4 HOUR LONG EVENT. Which leaves innumerable players (including myself) unable to get the rewards from said event. I wish I hadn't logged out, because I'd at least earned credit for the event. But I figured that since my screen was frozen for up to two minutes at a time (Not a problem on my end; CPU, ram, gfx card all WELL within tolerances) I might restart my computer and see if that helped. Turns out, I can't login at all now. That's just one of countless bugs which plague this game from start to finish. 2) The game is a grindfest. You can't play ONE frame. I mean sure, you get to level 40 with your first frame, ""Yay now I can do the 3 endgame raids there are!"" Yeah but not well. The thing is that to get the right perks to make your frame actually decent, you need to level up other frames. Some as high as 40, some only to 10, 20, or 30. Regardless, if you want to maximize your play experience, prepare to spend hundreds of hours grinding. This grindfest brings me to....3) The crafting system. Which is even more of a joke. For one level 40 epic item, the time spent grinding the same thumper in the same zone is maddening. Not to mention the fact that it's not just one zone you'll have to do it in, it's usually two or sometimes all three zones, for different items. 1200 uranium bars, AKA 6000 uranium ore, when you've got a chance at around 100 uranium ore average from a 5 minute long thump. That's for ONE of the materials involved. Bone fragments are much harder to come by, but required in similar numbers. Oh but you can just buy it off the market instead, right?? Lol, sure, if you feel like....4) MORE GRINDING FOR FREAKING CREDITS. Yup, the main source of credits being injected into the economy, comes from farming crystite(Warfront will get you 15-25k per hour, or would before they nerfed the drop rates). You can convert 25k crystite into 1k credits every day, and you can easily farm 25k crystite in about 1-2 hours, per day, at level 40. But 40 epic abilities? 20-40k credits. 40 epic core? 50-80k credits. So if you wanted to get those credits from just farming crystite, it would be close to a year before you could buy what you wanted to. Luckily, there are other options for gaining credits, it doesn't have to take that long. You could.... grind another frame to 40 and sell the mods from getting level 40. Or you could... grind world mobs on a thumper in hopes of an epic drop that you can sell for the credits to buy an ability for your frame. Have I made the point clear about this game being one long grindfest from start to finish? 5) The content is mediocre at best. There's really a very limited variety in what works in the game. Yes, all the frames work quite differently. On a spectrum from ""LOL you're playing THAT frame? /kick"" to ""Nerf Raptors."" I wish I were kidding, but that's how it goes. This is partially mitigated by the fact that all players can play all frames. At 10k +- 3k credits each, or buying them for real money/red beans. But again, if you want to be able to solo thump, and do bane/kana, and do warfront, you're going to need at least 3 frames at 40, probably 4, and if you want them to be perked properly, you're looking at 8-10 frames at level 20-30 or higher, some more frames you won't use at 40, but you have to level just for a perk. 6) PVP is a joke. Broken Peninsula is just that. Broken. The frame imbalances are so severe that if you don't use one of the currently OP frames, you're going to die constantly. Raptor, Rhino, Recluse, maybe a nighthawk, otherwise, get ready to eat lead salad all day long. 7) Devs are very heavy with the nerfbat in areas that don't need it. Especially droprates, which they've nerfed time and again during my time playing. I'm just glad I farmed BWA while it was possible to get more than a single green. They went from a guaranteed two blue ""necro"" weapons, plus the chance at a green/blue mod or the warpaint, to ONE drop. It might be a green weapon. It might be the warpaint. But you get ONE. Did I mention they reduced the loot, at the same time they made the instance take about twice as long as before? Nerfiest Nerf I ever nerfed. It's not so much harder, as you're not allowed to skip mobs that you could skip before. Other times, they seem to forget the nerfbat exists, like raptors, which are currently the most overpowered frame for just about every situation. Or recluses, which simply gets better the more enemies you throw at it. At some point, the recluse turns immortal, simply because of the fact it is amazing AOE damage, and gets 10% of it's damage as heals. It is just... imbalanced isn't strong enough to describe the way that the frames work. I dedicated a lot more hours to this game than is reported by Steam, simply because I don't always launch the game through steam. I've played a LOT. And honestly. I wish this game was better. But for all the potential it has, I've seen it going downhill fast during the time I've played. I highly recommend not even installing this game. The gems it has are very visible, and it's easy to get hooked, and then gloss over the ""minor inconveniences."" But the inconveniences pile up, and when they add something new... be prepared for a crashfest. I personally showed a developer a bug in warfront, soon after it was released. It was one of at least 4 MAJOR and I mean game changing bugs. This particular bug was the difference between a 6 minute objective, and hitting the timer at 20 minutes and everyone dying, and having to wait the 2:30 to attempt the whole objective over again. Which I still don't consider as bad as the bug where the entire raid's game crashes. Both of which took WEEKS to fix (if they even are fixed, they weren't consistent bugs). I've been addicted to hope in this game for too long. The current staff responsible for the direction the game is heading, and the actual game itself, are incompetent. This game is going downhill fast, and I strongly recommend you stay away from it, unless you like reporting bugs constantly in a game which is *supposed to be* released. I can't stay addicted to hope. For all the good things in it, this game is just bad.			"

												It's an absolute displeasure to say this, but this games is officialy on its last legs.Don't bother downloading it and starting a new character as one of the tutorial missions are bugged, meaning there is no actual way to complete it and progress through the game.This use to be such a beautiful and unique game with a rich and alive environment. All it is now is a buggy mess at the mercy of its Chinese Investors. Servers can be shut down at any moment.Better off turning your attention towards EM-8ER. A game being develeped by the original creator of Firefall. R.I.PLife Lesson: Never sell your IP to a Chinese Investor. They'll fire you from your own game and run it to the ground.			"

												As many others reviews are saying, do not even bother installing this game if you're new to it. As you create y our character  you will be doing sort of a tutorial to introduce you to the game. Then, as you reach lvl 10 there is a MUST DO quest that won't work no matter what you do. So you have like 15-20 mins gameplay available. Also there is no hope on getting it fixed as it seems that there is nobody working on the game. But of course they still selling 115,97€ and 79,99€ packs.......funny scammers.			"

												Firefall has a personality disorder. Its centerpiece is supposedly a world war between a besieged humanity and a superior alien civilization, but players spend most of the time roaming around engaging random clumps of indigenous bandits, mining for resources, and killing mutated fauna. There is a lack of sense about the relevancy or urgency of the war.Leveling mechanics, itemization, crafting, and questing systems are conventional and unremarkable. Narratives conveyed in missions are discontinuous, because the missions themselves are randomly sequenced. The encounter system is simplistic: most scenarios reduce to close-range engagements as enemies materialize into existence near you. Enemy AI is mediocre: No squad tactics, no flanking, no suppression, no cover. Combat is mostly reduced to jumping and backpedaling away from enemies. It becomes less about surviving enemies, and more about surviving the point-blank splash damage from your own weapons.Play it for the eye candy and esthetics, and for the easy adrenaline. Look elsewhere for more filling and better execution. Intelligently challenging PVE battles, cohesive narratives, and a world story that invites urgency elude Firefall at this time.			"

												tl;dr- If you haven't played this game before, do so right now-- while there's still a game left to play. But if you're a veteran like I am, playing this game again will just get you thinking about the ""Good ol' days"". At least it did for me.I really wanted to be able to give this game a positive review. I wanted it more than anything else in the world. It has so many good memories for me, and when I first played in the summer of 2013 near the end of the closed beta, I remember thinking that it the most fresh and innovative MMO that I had seen in a long time. (Granted, I'm sort of an antisocial person, so I tend to hate MMOs because I don't play too well with others.) But since I picked it back up a few weeks ago, I can only say that things have gotten worse since I last played, which was about a month after the Sertao patch first went live.Even then, I thought FireFall was going down a negative slope-- but back then I thought it was either just a fluke that would be fixed in the next few patches, or because I had simply burned myself out by playing it too much. But now it's become clear that Red5 has fallen so far that they can't recover. Especially after the buyout by the Chinese company ""The Nine"", (Which sounds like the name of a terrorist faction in a cyberpunk movie, by the way.) and when you take the time to consider that the members of Red5 that recieved the money basically immediately blew it all on hats. It kinda shows how little respect and care they had left for their own game near the end.As for the quality of gameplay, like I said before, it's been on a negative slope for a while, but I only just noticed how steep the slope was. The open world experience overall used to be much better. There wasn't a set level barrier between areas or even strict ""levels"" at all. The whole world was open to anyone at any power level, and you could proceed and explore at your own pace. If you ♥♥♥♥ed up and went somewhere too strong for you, that was your own mistake. Now the zones (Coral Forest, Sertao and Diamond Head) have fallen back into the classic MMO mistake of being segmented and cordoned off into areas with seperate level requirements. It really cockblocks the fun factor of exploring this game and forces you back into grinding in one spot until you're strong enough to move on rather than growing through exploration. Back in MY day, anyone could go to Sunken Harbor any time they wanted, but now it's a level 30+ zone.The quality of the quests has seen a sharp decrease as well. Except it's not even consitent. The old ARES missions that have been here since the summer of 2013, and even the first 25% of the main questline are still pretty fun and well designed. The remaining 75% of the main quest and the new open world missions, however... Well, it's obvious where Red 5 dropped off and The Nine picked up. Even based off of voice acting quality alone and ignoring the rest of the missions. The bad voice acting was funny for about 15 minutes but then it made me die a little bit inside after I realized why. That being said, the new ""missions"" are also horribly broken and glitchy. Overpowered bosses, convoluted objectives that could just be replaced with something so simple as a door key, et cetera. I was having troubles defeating a level 20 boss in my level 45 armor because of how broken he was. I've also heard complaints from guildmates (who are also veterans in maxed out armors) about the exact same mission near the end of the questline (which I have failed to make it to because of a game breaking bug earlier in the campaign). The9, convolutedness isn't a substitute for balanced difficulty at higher levels. Like I said, I wish that I could have given this a good review. I really wanted to. Despite its greatly increasing flaws, this game is still very unique, especially in the F2P MMO scene. With its true 3D movement mechanic and diversity between classes, FireFall's potential was immense. But now when I look it all I see is what could have been and what soon won't be. One of my favorite games is circling the drain, and it's breaking my heart.			"

												Red 5... what are you smokin on? I don't know what happened to this game within the course of the year i was away, but all these negative reviews made me curious. I just had to go see for myself.There were a ton of bugs to begin with, sure, but now they have multiplied. Issues from simple animations and graphics all the way to the game mechanics itself. Constant clipping, rubberbanding and horribly long loading times.Missing/broken equipment. LIterally everything on my characters have been altered to a point that the builds are no longer valid. Even content that required cash purchased no longer work or exist. This game been one of my absolute favorites for  a long time. Spent a few hundred hours on one steam account (until i forgot it's info) and then a good amount of time on this account. I was happy to have such a vast landscape to openly explore and have borderlandsesque fun with randos. However, instead of improving and fixing the experience that has already been provided, Red5 insists on 'expanding' and 'upgrading' without so much as a second thought to repercussions to the game's integrity and it's player base. The changes themselves won't deter newer players, but the inconvenience and bugs that come along with them certainly will.I guess it's time to move on. "

												A lot of the thoughts in the negative reviews are 100% correct - This is sub-standard MMO, questing fare. Get the quest, walk, collect or kill, return, repeat.However, there's something to it. The multiple abilities, the various characters, the movement with jump-packs. There is something here.I thorougly loved Borderlands, and there are striking similarities (a bit too similar in parts), but this game certainly has the base for something bigger. I'm only level 8 at the moment, but will certainly be making it to 40, and putting some money into the game for the XP boosts.I'm conflicted, but I'm having fun.			"

												They really ♥♥♥♥ed it up when they removed crafting.  Completely remove it.  ""It will be back, but better, in... 1.8  or 1.9 or so"".Yeah, right.  At the speed this thing is progressing (1.7 came in April, and nothing since then), we'll get some kind of (♥♥♥♥♥♥, I expect) crafting back in 2017.  If we're lucky.So, my interest died.Crafting, and especially thumping, was so rewarding.  You could just start, and other players (there were other players!) would just join.  And vice-versa: you could join anyone who had deployed a thumper, defend it against attacking wildlife, and get a reward too.  I loved this form of ad-hoc, sponaneous, low- or even no-barrier teaming.  I wish more games would adopt such mechanics.All that is gone.  And will likely (says my inner pessimist) never return.Other than that you have hardly anything to do.			"

												You brought me tons of joy and hours just lost in the game world. For someone like me who loves MMOS and shooters, this game really filled that void.I remember how in the early days thumping was so fun and awesome. That feeling of going up against a huge horde that were dropping in ODST-like was simply amazing and cool. And blasting insect like creatures to smithereens was harken to the starship troopers movie.And then came the so called big changes, that at first seemed to make the game even cooler, but it was just a facade. The build was released with serious issues and everything just changed for the worse.Sometime in June 2016, I finally called it quits on the game. Honestly I never felt so sad and depressed for giving up on a game. I will always treasure those memories the old Firefall gave me. I will never forget how I looked forward to the end of the day to get back home and logon to just a good time blasting away and meeting fellow pilots.RIP Firefall my old friend. We had a good run.

												this game was an amazing icon of what could've been. i started in 2014 and played for a while, then i deleted it to make room for skyrim since i didn't have the storage. i more recently came back and what has happened absolutely kills me. the devs took everything that people had once loved and threw it out the window. there was so insanely much potential in this game and it was ruined before the game even had a real chance.

												Review and tips focused towards new players, i am a beta player with over 2 years test experience in this title.----First off, you need to know that this 3rd person shooter is also a MMO experience, so keep in mind you need to grind levels and components, a lot of time is needed to play this game, and with how the system works (and a good point i might add) is that you cant just sit there and leech from other people, you physically need to participate to gain XP and credit. So be prepared for a long-lasting (but awesome) experience so long as youre someone who enjoys actually playing the game and not just ya know..sat leeching from someone or not giving a crap.***Gameplay: 7 / 10The content is good, the single player missions are good, the different variations of World events and randomly generated content work great! The only problem is, there's not enough different types of mission and it can quickly become repetetive, which goes the same for story missions, theyre enjoyable but there just isnt enough of them (yet). I highly recommend playing with friends especially if they can give you a ride, or (i highly advise) you puchase with Red Beans of ingame Credits, a BIKE. Without a vehicle this game is a looong walk simulator, but as soon as you get a vehicle and craft yourself a lot of 1-use glider pads this mobility problem goes away (it sorta forces you to get a vehicle, but thats ok they need to make money somehow to sustain these big servers).PvE Content is very well balanced and challenging, if you charge into a base full of bandits or chosen at your level, expect to get yourself killed very quickly as especially the Chosen, are a force to be reconned with. PvP is promising but ultimately, there's no balance and its only fun for the few. The classes you are allowed to play cover all the basic roles (tank, support, healer, dps etc) and the advanced battleframes (which i recommend Bastion, Dragonfly/Recluse, Raptor/Nighthawk or Mammoth for new players as these currently seem the most powerful) grant even further power to your class.They have confirmed, and are adding a lot of content in the future including a level cap rise with (confirmed) at least 2 new world-zones, so expect a LOT of good things for this free-to-play title.***Sound: 7 / 10The music feels very gripping with its orchestral quality and all weapons sounds great, you really feel the oomph of your weaponry and explosions from afar you can almost feel the vibrations from. Sound quality is excellent! Though the roaming music can sorta make you a bit sleepy. The musical score is wonderful in missions and cutscenes but the roaming music is too boring. The game's vocal content and all NPC's (and quest givers) is about 97% fully voice acted! Some of those accents though are not very well spoken, and may sounds a bit cheesy, several of the voice actors seem uninterested but overall, sound is good.***Graphics and worlds: 5 / 10 The maps look average and the systems overal graphics are well toned (character style inspired from Street Fighter 4). I wouldnt call firefall next-gen, its sorta in between last gen and next gen. It's optimized enough to run smoothly including in huge fights of 40 players and a hundred enemies at once on the screen (which is amaaaaziiiiing) but GPU Temperatures can run a little high so i highly recommend turning a few things down (shadows low or off, and antialiasing off unless your computer is an icecube). The worlds although they looks pretty, (gunna be honest here) will p### you off, as every obstacle, every mountain with no climbable surface, every tree/rock/nook and granny and just how lumpy the ground is, seems to do its utmost best to slow you down and hinder your ability to go someplace, which is why they sell glider-pads in game to make money off of you. Because of the terrible pathing in maps and how it fights and pushes you to the point of frustration when youre trying to be in a rush to go someplace, it heavily impacts this rating. The maps by design are agonizing.***Overall: 7 / 10There's a lot of potential here, keep in mind you DO have to spend some money if you want to get anywhere near end-game here because of long distance traveling and the advanced battleframes being stronger (mostly), but with the extra content coming, the community being really supportive of Firefall, and the playerbase being really co-operative and nice in game, i highly recommend this title.Remember, it's free-to-play, but if you want to get serious about this game, you will need to spend a little money OR, spend a lot of time. Recommended: Get a vehicle, unlock the class you really want to play, tryout a 100% XP boost to get out of the first 10 boring levels and BOOM! You got yourself a really fun game, with great PvE experiences, and a solid future. "

												I feel horrible saying this, but all of the other reviews couldn't be more correct. You're going to hear a lot of the same stuff from me compared to all of the other reviews.Firefall used to be one of the best games I had ever playedIt had levelsIt had lootIt accommodated so many play stylesIt had so many different pathsIt even had a full-blown story with side missionsBest of all, this was all freeThen, update 1.6 hit. Like a truck.Everything that I knew,everything that I had learned, it was all useless.They added these weird, more advanced levelsThey completely reworked every single frame (class) in the game, so everything played differentlyThey temporarily removed, then reworked the crafting systemThey compeltely changed the leveling system, so that you had to stick with a class all the way to half level, so once you chose, you were stuck with itI can't express how disappointed I am from this change, and all of the other Firefall vets/Pre-1.6'ers know what I meanIt was perfectEmphasis on 'was'If you're considering this game now, I'm sorry to say that you're too lateRIP Firefall, it was fun while it lasted			"

												What can I say... Back in the days of closed beta I was a top toer backer. The game was great, horizontal progression, which was interesting and challenging. Good class balance and actually intersting way to develop a class. Good PvE, great PvP. The game standed out from the pool of other MMO which played just too alike.But then... Then Red 5 killed this game. They take all that made Firefall unique and threw it away. Now we have ♥♥♥♥ing levels and all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, crafting is junk, gameplay is so much generic, that it is not even funny.I would gladly pay again to play this game as it was in closed beta. But this iteration? No, just no.			"

The current update, as of today 1.6, has pretty much killed the game. It removed good parts of the game, including the reason to help other players.This is a bad move from the dev team.

												Before 1.6 this was the greatest game. It was the only one I played ever since I joined. Once 1.6 came out I was really excited. But then my heart sank as I found the game to be riddled with bugs, content gone as everything went so downhill. I read a post about 'the future of firefall'. I thought they were gonna fix this problem, but no, they announce that they're gonna release it on other platforms. In the state of Firefall at the moment, I doubt this would amount to anything at all. I really hope the devs listen to us and make this game great again.			"

As well as its unique style of using abilities like in MOBA MMO's having an ultimate. Fun thing about is the JumpJets which makes you able to hover towns and climb the roof tops. It seems they added new areas! I'm looking forward to explore more areas! :') Can't wait!			"

												WARNING: This is an outdated review, I don't plan on going back to Firefall and relearn the whole damn thing so there are no plans currently to rewrite this entire review. Enjoy my rant.Ah Firefall, one of the few MMO's out there who have shown promise and does it's best to live up to it while other games   cough cough!* Destiny cough cough!   have failed to deliver and as a result developers (and publishers included) over hype it's content.Now you may ask: ""why Firefall? surely there are better MMOs out there!"" no, there really aren't. I have played Rift, SWTOR, WoW, Warframe, Runescape the list goes on and none of those MMOs have impressed me in the least. SWTOR is basically WoW with a Star wars coat of paint plagued by EA's greed and Bioware's massive ego. Rift, was 'okay' but it's still WoW with a new skin and nothing more. Warframe was 90% of the time a Dungeon raid grinding simulator plagued by microtransactions and slow progression all set to make more money, and while I am aware the devs must make money to continue development of said game sometimes it can get out of hand. And finally WoW, their business model is a dying animal from 1999 dragged into this modern world hoping for customers. And while WoW is addictive it's community is toxic as hell. If you don't know what I'm talking about I suggest looking up some of the role play. Now what exactly makes Firefall different from all the rest? Firefall is a F2P FPS/TPS/MMO with of course, jetpacks. It's setting is in the future so it's a sci-fi MMO and that all together is all the reason you need to play it. Why you might ask? because every other MMO out there is trying to be the same thing which is pretty much Dungeons and Dragons. This is a fresh breath of air within the MMO side of gaming that should be explored further, but everyone seems to be quite stupid so let them rot with their WoW clones.But this isn't enough information for you to play the game and try it out for yourself. I am explaining this from my opinion, what I should really be doing is giving you the good sides and the bad sides of this game instead of hitting on other games for their lack of creativity. Gameplay:  While Firefall's combat may not hang on button mashing a spell in multiple slots, the combat is no where near perfect. The combat is a little glitchy and tends to be awkward when fighting NPC's due to NPC's ""skiing"" around with poor animation quality. Which is yet another problem with the combat, the animations need desperate work because it makes indie zombie survival game combat look as fluid as clear water (although it isn't really that bad, but close enough.) First person perspective's animations are just as bad because the view model seems to break quite often either by random chance or exiting large frame drops, so for the most part you'll be playing in Third person. Now don't get me wrong the combat is fun enough to continue playing, but it needs help if it wishes to keep shooter fans such as myself invested.And now for the meat of the game, grinding! because that's fun right!? doing missions over and over and over and over until you get to the next level so you can go to the higher level area and do missions there over and over and over and over again it's so much fun I muted the game! Why?! why do dev's think an MMO's primary goal is to drive yourself insane? I don't want to do the same things I did with the last class until I get my next class to 40! Can you guess what you get in return for grinding all the way up to 40?  *plays drumb roll*  if you guessed more grinding then you. are. the WINNNNNNAAAAAH!!! you get to go play Warzones in Devil's Tusk with other overly powerful level 40 players and get boat loads of XP you can't use! But wait! there's more! if you didn't think tedious resource gathering was enough for you, now you can go do tedious resource gathering as enemy players eat your limbs off in seconds while watching them♥♥♥♥♥♥your family in front of you crying tears of blood! FUN RIGHT?!Here's a better idea, make the end game worth it. You tortured people all that way just to give them the same thing they were doing at the lower levels but this time far, far, worse! Let's say for example: at the end game you can now get four player special ops missions that require certain skill types such as stealth, distraction, stealing, etc and in return you can get cosmetics or higher chances of getting purple items- something atleast worth leveling to 40. Because I couldn't give a damn about how powerful my character is when all you have to do is stay in the air and fire down death until you complete X Y and Z objectives. Plus mobs can't complain on a forum about how over powered you are so I really can't care about my strength unless fighting in PVP which pretty much boils down to who has the most purple gear anyway... Storyline:  Ooooooooh boy, I am not going to have fun explaining this. I'll get straight to the point and say it's a poorly written saturday morning cartoon show. The writing is so tasteless it makes me want to dry heave!  Everything  is predictable! for example: ""jee, I hope giant crabs from space don't rain on us"" *giant crabs from space rain on you* ""oh no this was so unpredictable your  armor's power is draining and now you can't fly because reasons...Oh dear, let me bring them back up as slowly as I can."" And they do nothing to mix it up. Whatever you do when you play this game, avoid job boards unless you are an achievement hunter.The good news is the story can be ignored, the bad news is no one cared enough to make a compelling cast of characters. Yeah, you have your hot hacker chick telling you what to do and a redneck uncle engineer to add as comedy relief but at the end of the day you have no reason to care for these people. Yeah I get it, I'm not expected to care for the virtual characters, but for the sake of the player, at least make them half decent. The plus side however, most MMOs don't have voice acting at all. Of course games like WoW have shop dialogue ""oy! come to sell yer♥♥♥♥♥♥son?"" ""I buy and sell♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; ""hurry up on over here so I can buy your♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; ""I sell quality♥♥♥♥♥♥at the ♥♥♥♥♥iest price!"" But the majority of it is text, it's not like I hate reading but when the entire game has a weak plot and a crappy UI I have already lost interest at level 1. So Red5 get's points for placing honest effort into it. Final Verdict  So what are the good things I can say about this game? well it's free, you can unlock everything within the game for free if you are willing to work for it, and it has a great community as well as developers. But the glitches and the lack of content is what holds me back from speaking positively about this game. It's not like I didn't try to like this game! I really wanted to enjoy Firefall, and I still do, but it's a love/hate relationship. I have 322 hours on record as proof that I enjoyed the game enough to soldier through it's flaws and eventually write a review on it. And in return I give Firefall a 6/10, it's above 5 because it is trying to be a good MMO that doesn't constantly try to harpoon your wallet every chance it gets like most MMO's I have played. Now do I suggest you install FF right now? well, the in game music is broken, the UI is always glitching (it can even go as far as restarting your game) and this cannot be fixed via hotfix. Despite that go ahead and install it if you have the space for it otherwise move along.			"

Guess what .... everything has changed and its♥♥♥♥♥♥ Back in the day i threw hundreds at the game for frames and gliders and what not. Logged into the game only to find out everything that had made the game fun had gotten stripped. Those right click attacks with each frame, removed. All the mods I worked my♥♥♥♥♥off for, removed. The power cores I got from raiding, no slot to equipt them. I'm not upto date on what the developers have gone through with this game but holy hell, the game used to be good with potential to be great. Now its a sorry excuse for a browser game, wouldnt even buy it on mobile.p.s. to any veterans out there I ran the hooch.			"

												i remember doing countless OCT and BK runs with the same amazing people over and over and then helping out the newbs when they came into the new region untill they could fight for themselfs and held their own ground in events, everyone knew each other, everyone worked as a team. Then racing with my friends and new allies from sunken harbour to thump dump (bottom to the top of the map) and stoping to fight off invasions if there were any good times indeed. The game was very good but Red5 and their chinese overlords kept changing all the systems and in the end me and alot of others after a update came back to find all our classes reset with all gear gone and my current 45 biotech that i logged in to got forced into repluse and put back to level 1. the whole crafting system also disappeared without warning as well and still isnt back.i have lots of memories with this game since i have played heaps of it on and off of steam. i really really wanna say is a good game but since that update i cant say that. this game was the best its truly sad that this game has been screwed over the potential was limitless.

The final nail in the coffin for me...changing AEROs voice to some generic voice actor who probably isnt even a vocie actor by the sounds of it!!!

""Ummm, NOT SURE...""You DEVs, those in charge, are the biggest bunch of indecisive, no brained idiots who have ever tried to run a game, or company for that matter. How is it so difficult to plan, test, impliment then keep your hands off??? Is that too much? Idle hands? Instead of all these changes, that then get changed again during the next big update...how about waiting until its ready to go then do it!! ELITE RANKS...cant get it right the first time, so mix it up again. How many months was that planned for? did you not have meetings, brainstorming, testing and double checking...then later simply add crystite amounts and caches...why not the first time around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Im done, you can stick your free, dead and tired game up your powercore, and I hope for the sake of all the others who have wasted, or who may waste any more time on this dead fish of a game, you guys close up shop asap and leave the gaming world for jobs in anything but!

												Don't bother. This game has been reworked about four times now. Even after kicking that idiot Mark Kern to the curb, development still has absolutely no direction whatsoever.Most of the balance changes are actually decent. However, this latest update disabled a lot of features because suprise, they're being reworked. For the fifth time. Also, end game zones? Being reworked as well, so good luck finding stuff to do at max level, especially since thumping is no longer fun in the slightest.For those who played before, remember the arsenal frame? It had pretty decent firepower with its LMG, and abilities granted weapons with limited ammo to be used in certain situations. A shotgun with high damage, a particle beam for long range AOE, and so on. Its ultimate was great, my favorite one in the game. Ever see Macross? The mechs which could fire off a ton of missiles at once? Basically that, though the rockets here arc like mortar fire. And it was AWESOME!Sounds like a cool frame, right? Well, it's gone. Just removed completely because the developers are too stupid to figure out how to bolster its shortcomings. And not one single frack was given when people who loved it clamored for it back. They did offer pretty nice compensation, but as cool as the vehicle is, I'd rather have my Arsenal back. Save your time and energy for something else. This game could have been wonderful, but they spent far too much time just figuring out what they wanted this game to be... and still are! If you must try, I'd recommend not spending any real money. Let's face it, the game and Red5 are on its last legs. I'm actually surprised it's lasted this long, especially after its abysmal failure in Asia. I really don't think they'll make it to the end of 2016. Need to get your shooter fix? There are plenty of better offerings on Steam. Go try one of those, and leave this game to die. BTW my play time was mostly using the proprietary launcher, not Steam. So♥♥♥♥♥♥off with hours played BS.			"

												Let's start with the bad since that's probably the first thing many people will notice before they can adequately give it a chance:  this game is a buggy mess.  At one point in my first week of playing the social network went down for about an hour or so, so there were no squads, no local chats, no zone chats, no private chats.  That was...interesting for an MMO.  Also count in the sheer amount of times youll have to /rui or simply relog on the game and it's easy to see more than a few problems with this ""new"" release.  One other thing I wasn't particularly impressed with was the voice acting.  Some of the higher 'brass' sounds like little more than some doughboy CS developer-type guy.  Some of the voice acting simply sounds LAZY, where you expect the person you're reporting to to at least SOUND like he/she commands some sort of air of authority.  Additionally, more than a few of the accents sound forced.  OK so fair enough, this game didn't cost me anything to download but spacetime.  Despite the issues, this game has a LOT of redeeming qualities and so now we'll move on to why I recommend it.  While the level cap is low for an MMO (currently only 40; I've gotten a little more than halfway there at this point in time), Red 5 offers within Firefall a world lush with touristic scenery (the first town, Copacabana, is similar to an island vacation destination), Borderlands-esque graphics (cell-shading) and gameplay, and random bad guys including oversized bugs (giving it a Starship Troopers kind of feel at times), various rebel factions, and a cult of sorts that goes by the name of the Chosen.  In this world, the ""Melding"" has descended after a massive semi-apocalyptic event called the ""Firefall"", spawning the Chosen and as an ARES mercenary it's your inevitable destiny to push this purple tyranny back into the shadowy depths from which it came.  As someone who just hit their 20's in game, I don't know if there's ever an overall resolution towards this problem but I'm sure having a good time getting to that end point.As you level up, there are several towns for almost every level range so location diversity is never really a problem.  Each of these towns has it's own job board which supplies you with a set of level appropriate gopher/defense missions to help you level.  There's also a main string of campaign quests that you steadily unlock as you level up that add to the story of the war against the Melding.  In some of these missions you actually push the melding back by activating a SIN Uplink in the area (so THAT's what those are for!). In your time spent playing Firefall, there are several other things to do if you don't like the mainstream find/grind missions.  Several random missions occur in your local area, ranging from melding tornados (around level 15-20 it seems are the lowest ones you can find) that you have to spend some time shooting down to random LGVs and Thumpers crashing down in your area which you can save for a decent chunk of xp and resources.  Sometimes Chosen dropships like to pay visits to SIN Uplinks in towns or at watchtowers and attack/take them over, after which it's team ARES' responsibility to liberate and take back the area.Using Thumpers in itself is another gem of this game's overall existence.  Yet another choice while exploring the world is to scout out mineral nodes that randomly spawn throughout.  Find a node, call down your thumper, and prepare to defend it for the next 5 minutes while it mines resources for you and bugs are trying to destroy it.  A successful thump gets you xp and resources based on the % of the minerals present in the area you're thumping.  An unsuccessful thump sees your thumper destroyed, but that's OK!  You can just craft another one!Crafting is one area of the game that seems a bit overwhelming at first, but it actually ends up fitting into the game quite nicely for those higher teens and lvl 20+ areas.  Almost everything you pick up is salvagable, which gets you research points, crystals, and refinable materials that can later be used in crafting.Mobility EARLY game is KIND of an issue, but not really.  For the most part you'll be walking around everywhere until level 25 when you get a reusable ground vehicle, but there are some alternatives.  1-use ground vehicles drop from quests and I believe they're also craftable if you so desire.  In addition to the possibility of ground vehicles you have the entire hang gliding system which is it's own source of entertainment, not to mention a much quicker way to get places.  I especially enjoy climbing the highest mountains (there are achievements for climbing these mountains as a matter of fact) and spawning a glider pad to fly off of them.  Some of these mountains literally make it possible to fly clear across a region from one side to the other, just don't fly near the Arclight! :DAs far as replayability is concerned, you don't have to ever create a new character if you don't want to.  All the different classes are separated by what are known as ""battleframes"" in game, which one can change not unlike a shirt or some other equippable article of clothing.  Now, each time you equip a new frame you haven't played before it starts at level 1 but all the early missions are replayable for xp/resource credit.  I should also mention that starting out as a free player you only get access to the  5 different accord frames, which are the basic frames in each of the 5 different battle classes.  Here's the beauty of this particular free2play game, though:  you don't ever have to spend a dime of your real money in game to get everything there is to get, it might just take a while longer.  There is always the option of buying stuff for those that are impatient and want to try out some of the elite frames sooner rather than later, like me.  Bought Electron and Bastion on the first night.All-in-all, I do recommend this game.  It has a lot of potential.  It's very engaging; the gameplay is moderately-paced and 3-dimensional based in a wide-open world.  Listening to the soundtrack is often pretty relaxing.  This game also does have PvP, though I've spent next to no time exploring that particular venue cause there's so much other fun stuff to do in PvE that, quite refreshingly, doesn't seem so repetitive.  Even the campaign missions you unlock changes up the scenery and the objective in each one so it's not simply a generic mission formula.  It's obvious they took some time to plan the campaign missions out.  Now if only they'd spend the time to make sure that some of my local town job quests didn't get stuck loading the next objective or that I'm at least ALWAYS able to invite my friends to quest with me in a squad (I will not forget that ONE experience, but to any potential players reading this, it was just the ONCE).  Try this game if you like F/TPS, cooperative gameplay, and a decent story line.			"

												Ignore the older just-after-release reviews. Yes this game had a rocky start, yes it didn't deliver right away and yes it used to be very buggy. But the team shows true love for their game and has been constantly upping the ante and making this a game that gets more and more fun. I think the developers are doing a truly admirable job turning this game around and delivering a very satisfying and addictive game. The free to play concept is worked out quite honestly while at the same time leaves some room to splurge on a few nice extra's. Just walking around, enjoying the scenery, questing and chasing random events is a fun, and if done properly, fast way to build a few nice characters. Atmosphere is great and as a busy man with not too much free time this is a really nice way to spend a few hours once in a while. Good graphics too and runs smoothly on a proper PC.Just simply put, one of the better FTP games on steam and I'm glad to see the community is getting on the bandwagon because this game deserves it! The special events are a blast btw!			"

													A study in game design theory, Firefall is a title that is fantastic on paper and mediocre in practice.  Most of what's present is forgivable, but the primary attraction is ultimately its biggest liablity.  Ultimately, it won't appeal to MMO fans due to it's watered down questing and pve mechanics, and action fans will dismiss it due to a lack of refinement.  	Firefall's story revolves around the discovery of meterological elements that allow us to build fantastic technology, such as jet pack suits, advanced weapons, and space ships.  The goal of traveling to an Earth like planet is foiled by further plot mechanics, as the ship crashes into Earth, rendering most of the surface uninhabitable.  The obligitory aggressive alien species comes to Earth to take over, and this sets the stage for blah blah blah.   	Poorly written sci fi tropes doesn't compel a player to continue on with the story, so the game heavily relies on the action elements.  These are where the biggest problems manifest, because the actual meat of the game is mediocre at best.  The game has a one to one action component, which is unusual for MMO's as it's a genre that caters to point and click, but Firefall tries desperately to stand out.  Instead it feels like a mechanically stripped down shooter with very little to differentiate itself from the hundreds of other FPS games, and strapping a jet pack to your character does very little to help.  	The actual physics of flying feel so static and boring that it really shouldn't have bothered.  Instead of using it as a method to travel quickly from place to place, it simply allows for altitude adjustments, and has very little “skiing”, something that the tribes games were lauded for.  Strategically, it's still important for melee centric enemies as you'll jet above them and shoot as they attempt with great futility to nibble your ankles.  If an inertial effect was added to the jetting the game would be a pleasure, especially with the varied terrain.  As is, moving from point A to B in the game is a chore.	Production values crush what enjoyment could have been gleaned from the rest of this game, as the graphics, sound, interface, and general design are adequate, but that's it.  The view distance for terrain, monsters and allies is good, but up close they look pretty meh.  This is in no small part due to an unusual cartoonish design, somewhere between Borderlands and World of Warcraft, but nowhere near as endearing as either.  It comes off as generic and unexciting, with little if anything unique about it.  Enemy design suffers the most, as it isn't just dull, it only has a handful of variations.  In about 3 hours of gameplay, I had seen the same arachnid design used for about half the enemies, and zombie like enemy soldier for the other.  From the sound of a machine gun to rockets firing, to my commander speaking to the lowly civilians, everything sounds awful.  The voice acting especially is cringe worthy, with the theater commander taking the prize for most obnoxious line delivery this year.  	Potential is squandered on a regular basis in the gaming industry, but rarely had expectations been so high; a 1 to 1 action mmo with jetpacks, a pvp component, and a free to play model.  All that's left is an excellent case study in how design doesn't necessarily equate to execution.  Firefall isn't terrible, it's just a really basic, stripped down action game that just happens to have an MMO component tacked on.  Both are incredibly basic and unrefined, and leaves very little to entice fans of either genre.  In the end, it really isn't worth your time unless major improvements are made. "

It promised so much and it came so close to achieving it; but the game is dead in the ahnds of some 3-rd rate chinese publisher that is never going to follow through on the games promises.

												This game used to be the best game, period. Now returning after half a year or so, I found out that the devs have destroyed this game. They removed 75% or more of the game and are not longer replying on forums / social media since March.Parts of the map are broken, missions don't work, character system is changed (removed some characters), crafting is gone, instances are gone, most of the dynamic events are gone or broken, skills have been removed ( a lot ).The community is pretty much no longer there, as I've seen maybe 50 player max online at a time. They are all waiting for Red 5 to bring back pre 1.6.Come on Red 5, use that bloody version control and fix this game! Or if that's to hard, at least post a message, somewhere!IMHO this game is ABANDONED!(over 500 hours in this game.. shame..) "

												This is going to be a short and to the point review, so forgive the lack of flattery or filler.This game has been holding onto life by some force I don't even recognize, to be honest.I played this game back in closed beta and it was amazing and new to me. Given it didn't have much content, but it was always updating and the story was opening up. I would've given the game a 7.5/10 score.It's been a long time now and I have played a good chunk of time again, and I am sorely disappointed.* It's full of bugs and glitches that aren't typically fixed. Some are, most are not.* Updates don't always fix what's broken and they include what the community has called 'Ninja Updates' that they intentionally hide so as to try and avoid confrontation from their playerbase.* A game once made to reward skill and strategy is now just ""Who can do the more AoE damage"". Skill is no longer a thing. The deadliest and most used classes are AoE classes, aside from Dragonfly healers of course.* PvP is more or less dead. Now the PvP zone sees only the occasional battle but is more or less quiet and only for getting materials.* The game is horribly optimized. Beefy computers can see lag. Amazing connections will still see latency problems.* The phrase ""Don't fix what isn't broken"" is often seen in action.* Most of the crafting in the game is worthless. You can skip over it till endgame and not suffer for it much at all.* Just to keep up with most of the playerbase, you have to play for weeks to get daily rewards just to get VIP status to earn enough in-game currency to do anything.I tried to enjoy the game and even joined an army (guild, clan, whatever you wanna call it) and ran around with them but it was already too late. I had seen the game poisoned for me beyond repair.Now I rate this game 3/10. It's a waste of time.As far as I am concerned, the only reason this game is still alive is because they have something that hasn't been done better yet. If someone came up with a game similar to this and actually did it justice, I would probably be all over it and I doubt there wouldn't be masses of players wanting in on it too.TL;DR - This game isn't worth the headache, the time sink or the urge to pay into the game just to get a leg-up. Skip it over and wait for something better.			"

Don't let the birds get me.I'm primarily a traditional MMO player, so I was really surprised that this FPS-heavy one where everyone has battleframes caught my attention. I'm not really a fan of mecha, either. But for maybe the first 700 hours I played the game, it was great. I played mostly assault-style frames like the Tigerclaw, where the whole point of the frame was to be nimble and jump around the field a lot, with an afterburner letting you stay in the air for a long period of time. This was also key to managing a lot of the terrain easily. But after the last major patch and subsequent fixes, I can't stay in the air more than a few seconds. I can't do all my terrain tricks any more. I can't even use my vehicles the same way. And this is all intentional. Even if I could, a lot of the old storylines have changed. Sure, the scenery looks better in places. Certainly busier, at least. But the heart's gone out of it, I think.Within the game, there used to be a hidden crayon drawing, taped up behind a bookcase, from a kid who was the admiral's son. Just one of the billions of people who died in the initial tragedy, but someone whose death we knew about. It was just a small thing that most people never saw, but for me it made everything and everyone we lost personal, and served as a reminder why we shouldn't give in and let the Melding and oblivion overtake us. But, like so many other things, that's apparently been lost or moved. And dim memories of the past are no longer enough to sustain the effort in this game, especially when it appears they're no longer shared by whoever is directing this, now.The ""new"" starting story is very much on rails, and should be easier for someone who has never played it before. Some of the new story with its enhanced scenery is even pretty cool. But further along its handholding turns into handwaving away the things that matter, and now I reluctantly raise my own hand to say goodbye.			"

												What was once an amazing open world, free-roaming, badass fight for humanity's surival packing unique crafting/leveling systems... has declined into every other MMO you've ever played. Dev's can't figure out what they want to do and this has been in ""beta"" for 3 years since I joined; every other patch wildly changes core systems.Everything in the open world feels blatantly scripted and there is no longer any meaningful dynamism in zones.It's by no means pay to win, but I can't make myself support the game for a virtual hat that costs 20$! Real currency prices for everything is freakin' crazy.			"

												The beta builds for Firefall in 2012 were so much better than this current build, and by that I mean around Aug/Sept/Oct time; cuase I didn't really get to play the beta as much as I would have, since something happened to my client, it's wouldn't run or even uninstall. I didn't get to play Firefall again till it was on steam a week or so ago.They took most, if not all, the fun out of this game. The areas are level based now, I remember being able to roam the whole map just about. The random events are gone as far as I can see. No more invasions by the melting or chosen, I remember watchtowers being attacked all the time, and random invasions here and there; don't see any happening now. The crashed thumpers and LGV's are still here, but seem to be fewer than before to me.Then there's the crafting and reaserch. There wasn't any research when I was playing beta. I don't mind it, but they put in TOO much; it needs to be combined and have AT LEAST 50% of it cut out. Either that or make a lot of other ways to get reaserch points other than savalaging, or reduce the points costs as well. And what happened to all the minerals? There's nothing but sand/dirt and iron now that I found around the starting area, there used to be at least a third mineral too around the starting area.I also remember a horizontal skill/gear/weapon tree that you got a point (or whatever) to spend on every level up for a frame; that was option based, as in every level of the tree had at least two choices (such as between two weapons, a weapon or skill, booster/gear item or something else, and etc.) and you could always wait another level to get the second (or other choices) if you wanted both (or all). There was also a particular ""upgrade"" path to advanced frame 1 or advanced frame 2, so you could get to an better frame quick if so wanted, or both advanced frames.And there's durablity now, and for EVERYTHING? Wasn't in the beta and we don't need it.I'd really like to know wtf happened to this game, it was so much better in the beta when I played it. Which is usually the opposite of betas/games I've played, usually the beta sux more so then the release for a game; but not this time, firefall beta was much better then released firefall.			"

												Long time player, since early closed beta i supported the game in hopes it would change. But in all honesty it has not. All the money we used has gone to pay for there youtube channel staff do sing a longs, to there 3 GM's doing a livestream taking 5 mins to talk about the game then using the other 45 mins of the time they are getting paid to work talking about useless post about the community. (showing other players off) he gameplay itself is ok and fun, but the game is a grindfest, and gets boring really fast. A few bug fixes have been implemented for example removing the enemies aimbot system which in beta they announced it was how the enemies were suppose to behave, to a few market and UI glitches. But the game now that its release STILL has many bugs, and is not polished at all. I do not recomend this game, being a veteran player of the game. The only feature that i have not seen break in this game is there RMT system, which if it did it would be fixed asap unlike the other bugs in the game. I honestly do not know what they are doing with the money they are recieving from players but, this game is still a beta.  Passing by the forums, ive read players complety disagree with other reviewers about the game. Take mine to heart, being a closed beta player to launch, and any other honest players review. Becuase now they the ""Fanboys"" of the game are reading and downvoting most honest reviews. Try it out yourself and you be your own judge. Thank you for your patience.Best, Rundas~			"

												This is a prime example of a game with very talented developers, with horrible leaders. The game had major promise during beta, with massive world changing events in game, it was amazing! Even devs would come to play occasionally (whether with us, or as a world boss).Almost all the mechanics that made this game fun such as Chosen incursions, ""thumping"" for resources, even pushing back the melding, is gone. The game is a husk of what it once was. From what I can tell all motives to work together are gone, or just not worth it. What The9 did to the game is aweful, and now they are trying to get rid of their shares.I have to put credit where it is due, making a game like this is no easy feat, Red5 has made a powerful game engine and a beautiful game. But lets not forget who brought this game down to needing money from someone like The9.Mark Kern from what I read, has made a lot of horrible decisions, don't trust him with whatever game he is trying to make, for the FireFall fanbase. He didn't help make the game as much as he is saying. https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1tuf3c/this_is_why_mark_kern_was_removed_as_ceo_by_red_5/Unfortunatly this game seems like a sinking ship. I really hope this game recovers for the sake of Red5 and Firefall, but in reality I do not thinking that will happen and its a real shame, for such a unique and once fun game.			"

												Once apon a time, Firefall was amazing. It was actively being developed, new content was dropped all the time. The devs listened to the community. The combat wasn't *exactly* balanced, but it was good. It was innovative and showcased several new and interesting ideas.  None of that is true anymore.  It is no longer actively developed. Current content stops working all the time. The devs (such as they are) have fallen silent. The classes and combat balance now heavily favor some classes over others. And the innovation was dialed back until the battleframe powers no longer had anything new or interesting.  A change in management, and Firefall was destroyed.			"

												Let me start this off by saying I love this game and don't want to see it fail.It has massive potential yet the develepors make idiotic decisions and don't listen to the community feedback which lead to the game losing most of its playerbase.Countless bugs that players have complained about, making tickets and so on, still haven't been fixed.They kept remaking the game which didn't need it in the first place instead of just adding content to it.From my perspective it seems that they don't want us to play their game and that just baffles me.Even now when I went to play the game, it made me replay the tutorial which got me stuck in the perk screen(lock perk) since there's a 24 cooldown between switching perks.Unfortunately I cannot progress until the 24 hours are up.I want this game to succeed and grow again, but the develepors really have to step up.

												In with the old, and out with the new. Not very many people like the new update as it removed half of the things old players may have payed thousands of credits they grinded to save up for that fancy battleframe core. Nope those are gone. Most classes I had unlocked were just gone poof. The game was so much better before this horrible update.			"

												If you at all liked the tribes games, or recent Unreal games, MMOs, or shooter games in general, you WILL like this game!!! It looks awesome, runs great, & has a very cool stylized look to it... *note* when you chose a char be sure to click [customize] in the corner to choose toon options like hairstyles/color, face, eyes, voice etc. the tutorial is nice, & teaches you how to use jumpjets etc. F2P so D/L it now. Works awesome with an X360 for Win pad, AND lets you remap the buttons on it!			"

												Before the 1.6 patch or whatever it's called, i spent around 900 hours on this game, i played it with my friends and had a ton of fun! I leveled all characters to the maxlever and put the best things on them that i've had earned. Went away from it before the patch and came back...it was a whole new game and not in a good way. I remember the good times when this game was fun, but i guess that new players will enjoy it as much as i did in the beginning.			"

												I cant make a definitive decision on this game as the entire things has been turned on its head: I'll explain.When this game released, the game's creators clearly wanted a system to have class and area progression much like you see in the mmorpg genre.   they had a complex crafting system and dual currencies to support the free-to-play business model.  After establishing these, they started adding PVP systems into the game.   nothing lik factions, but instanced arena setups much like you see in class-based shooters like team fortress and unreal.  it was participative and completely optional, but had its own progression and rewards system, as you can expect in amodern shooter.   some time after this, they moved focus back to the storyline and the thin mission system that would move you through the lives of 3 main characters, represented with some voice acting and dialog.  This, also, was completely optional, once you left a tutorial area.   This is where the good times seemed to end, as after a few months, I logged in to a completely different game.   I logged in and gone were the class progression elements of classes, and imposed were new inventory limits, changes, and systems.      Frames (the suits that your character wears,)  now had more slots and gear, and the gear was relegated into level resstrictions and tiers.   Frame guns were no longer tied to the role of the class, and could be mixed and matched.  and the complex crafting system that could produce guns with a huge variety of effects had been reduced to a much smaller gear table, with a diablo-rune attachment system.   frames were no longer progresseive, but standalone and purchaseable without any requirement but currency (paid or earned.)  and the free-roaming world had been consolidated into a hub to go on various instanced dungeons.   in short: every sandbox piece of this game had been stripped and relegated into a theme park I did not want to visit.     After some research, this seems to be the result of internal restructuring in the company, that included changing enough of the design team to completely omit the original creators.  So while at first I heavily reccomended this to anyone with a decent system, I say, now, that this is just another game in the pile of theme park, microtransactive mmos with very little to drive a player to progression or exhistence.

												This game when it was first released had so much going for it.I have played since the Beta and have to say it is basicly dead now. I unlocked every frame in game have many LVG's, MVG's and one HVG. (light ground Medium ground and heavy ground vehicles) After the ""rebuild"" of this game it has gone from a epic shooter that had so many diffrent abilities that let you customize you frames any way you want, to a watered down generic broken shooter that has no redeeming qualities left.Red 5 and the parent group that purchased them ruined any chance of this game being great ever again. Since its free to play I cant say dont try it but NEVER spend any cash in the game for a group of devs that no longer care about the players sadly please.			"

												I played this game a while back and loved it, I got high level with a bunch of different battlesuits (forgot what they are called). I recently came back to this game and saw that my highest level was 4 and that I had to replay the tutorial. After about 5 minutes of playing the inventory came up on my screen and wouldnt go away, I thought ""hey just a bug, ill relog"". Turns out this was a reoccuring bug that happened at least 5 times before I decided just to quit the game.			"

												Questing, leveling, and crafting design makes this game play and feel like it came out in 2001. I can't wrap my mind around how you can design such nice combat and fun abilities and smooth movement and still try to make an old school escort and fetch treadmill. Early game is just pathetic. You could find first graders who could design a better early game leveling than a zone full of 40 long boring escort missions that are exactly the same but randomized lengths from 10 yards to 5 miles. This is the worst excuse for an MMO I've played in a decade. They should have focused on the action instead of this garbage crafting and questing that's coded with zero effort but put in your face at every turn.			"

												Firefall is a good free to play, if only he had more courage in merging MMO and FPS elements that constitute the core, would have really been able to make ends meet. I refer to the social components developed only partially and AOLA lack of an open PvP adequately contextualized: the lack of factions (the Chosen playable would really manna) and dedicated servers to clan warfare on a global scale is aging considerably a title, especially as it is a true F2P that sells for real money only aesthetic elements and boost the experience, still deserves to be recommended to all for the breadth of what it has to offer and the incisiveness of some goodies like the live event and the economic system. Ultimately lacks that degree of innovation that could elevate to something truly unique.			"

												The last patch literaly killed the game. Everything single piece of equipment you had is now unusable, which means countless hours for nothing. Losing everything is one thing but having half of the game taken down for future improvment is unnaceptable. The entire crafting system and the market are down as we speak until the next patch wich won't be up so soon since the last patch was months late. Those two features are how you get geared up and spend most of your in-game currencies on. Red 5 are unreliable,lying and sneaky developpers who doesn't deserve good people time and money.			"

												Really cannot say that I support this game anymore. It started off as a brilliant unique idea and has over the years gone through countless complete rebuilds until now it is barely the same idea. Most of the core of the game has been gutted to the point now as someone that has been playing this game since I bought into it in alpha... I am not even certain what the point of the game is anymore.It has basicly been dumbed down to zero for heavens know what purpose and to this day seems to go through some major new development direction monthly. Could it be a great game some day, at this point I honesly have to say no, that ship has sailed. Best just to avoid it and hope the devs learned their lesson if and when they perhaps decide to start a new project.			"

												I've had a lot of fun playing Firefall in the past but after the latest update I wouldn't recommend this game. They removed a lot of things from the game and are 'reworking' them before they put them back in, but I'm really not sure if these things will ever be put back in to the game. Crafting and the endgame zones have been removed and still havn't been put back in, and plenty of other changes people are unhappy with have been implemented. Everything I liked and cared about in the game has been removed. If the update ever comes where some of these things are brought back to the game I might change this review, otherwise I'd just say stay away from the game in its current state.			"

												Less than 1 hour into game and I had enough.All the bugs that put me off outright:*gimmicky movement - during second pre-quest sliding didn't work properly (character was periodically descending);*audio desync - frequent massive audio delay after firing rifle, at times also no sound from enemy weapons, just bullets hitting target impact sound;*impossible to close menu with cursor at times - it says to close it with esc - it fails to mention you are forced to look at all leveling up perks (blue symbol at left corner). Figuring that and running to second quest cursor menu again popped up and I had to franticly smash esc and n to close it. After 30 seconds of smashing it closed. During second quest before upcoming mob wave I opened inventory, closed it but cursor menu again didn't close, this time with no luck to close it.That's the first game behaving like that, all the other games work fine on my PC.

												This was once a real fun game with all the potential in the world but because of all the drama with the creators R5 since just before 1.6 and all the layoffs, people quitting and not paying their employees during Christmas (of all times) they've lost all credability.  Each patch broke more than it added and everything seems half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥from quest item drops (from killing mobs) not showing up in caves but rather on top of the mountains above to the long awaited return of Devils Tusk (which has been in game for a couple years but they ""re did it"") which turned out to be a complete mess.  No atmosphere, you walk up to a lava pit and no sounds... No events, all the quests were broke (took 20 mins for the quest giver to give you the quest and another 20 for the quest to show up on the map).  The new world event they talked up for a month before the release was broken for weeks.  All the end game raids wouldn't allow full raid groups to enter.  Not a peep from R5 about this for over a week.  It was like they just said F it there's nothing we can say at this point.1.6 came out earlier this year and the player base took a nose dive because everything was broken.  There's currently like 300 people on durring the day (that's probably generous) and maybe 600 at night although that probably has dropped since I quit playing a week ago.  It's a shame this game had potential in Beta and it just never progressed correctly.  I have never been more dissapointed in a developer as R5.  They are the absolute worse bunch of clowns.  They NEVER test anything before releasing it for years they relied on players to do the testing. And, even when people went through the trouble of testing and writing bug reports they NEVER listened to them and just released the patch with all the bugs.They just lost the crafting designer which was supposed to be their next patch (to add that back into the game) and now I've heard that they scrapped it to start over because they don't have competant people there to take over what he left them.  I mean the incompetance just keeps evolving faster than the game.  Go read their glassdoor comments from past employees it will explain how terrible that company has become since the9 took over (A Chinese company) that funded them after the moron that ran the company wasted all their cash on a multimillion dollar bus that doesn't work and started a video production company that only did some crap parody music videos in someones back yard...  You cannot write this stuff the drama is something to really take in!If you want to be depressed thinking about what this game could have been feel free to level from scratch... You will see the possabilities but probably by the time you reach max level the game will no longer exist.			"

												For someone who actually funded the game nearly from the satart I have to say I am severely dissapointed, this started as a great premise, trurned into a work in progress quirky fun game that showed serious potential, then fell appart at the seams.  Now it seems that the team working on this game have gone the way of the Dodo Birds and disappeared from the face of the planet; the game is now seriously broken all the way to the main missions glitching (Devils Tusk Broken so that on trying to enter the main mission the game crashes out completely resetting the mission at start).  Crafting, special abilities, and more have been so completely reqorked that the original players that put serious time and even money into the crafting part of this game LOST EVERYTHING because they actually REMOVED the crafting system.  Seriously, who ever heard of a game that starts with crafting and then removes it completely????  Oh wait, now you can buy the needed upgrades, and that takes time to grind out more, or you can pay for it with moeny in the way of Red Beans, or can you, event that has so many issues it has simply become not worth using.  And as mentioned, I was one of the original Funders when the game first launched, buying the best package they offered even before launch, now I feel cheated, left out in the cold, and completely ignored just like the rest of the community that still exists (all 3 or 4 of them that I might see in an hour when trying to play at times) Seriousy, how can something so good go so bad, it is like that super hot girlfirend you got married to just to find out she was actually criminally insane, dangerous and a serial Divorcer looking for the quick cash cow just to cut and run to the next chump that falls for her huge Chimmey Chunga's.  No not bitter over this not at all,  make sure you get a prenuptual before investinmg ANY time or heaven forbid Money into this title as it stands right now.For easy reference for how the community feels about this game please review this URL provided beautifully from Steam:  http://steamcharts.com/app/227700 "

												Firefall is a open-world game that is fun for the first several hours, but then gets repetitive as there is not a whole lot to do besides begin leveling the upgraded counterpart after getting max rank. The game starts you off landing on copacobana, a resort town surrounded by a beach on one side and a forest on the other. You have multiple battleframes to choose from to suit your play style, such as the assault, recon, or the engineer. With each battleframe you get to max level you can unlock a advanced frame that sports new abilities and access to a new primary weapon. The world allows you to reach max level without touching a job board do to the abunance of ares missions that are scattered around the map. They will give you as much if not more experience than doing a job board mission in a fraction of the time, however the game is a huge grindfest and gets downright aggravating at times. The gameplay is alot like a watered down borderlands mixed with warframe. You fight dangerous wildlife, rouge bandits, and the infamous chosen which is humanitys main foe. There is not a whole lot to do in the game besides grind, grind, and grind some more.  After leveling my second battleframe I tried yet again to begin leveling another battleframe, but i couldn't bring myself to go through the tedious grind for a third time.When i was reading chat, every now and then the conversation would lean toward talking about the beta and how great it was compared to the way it is now. I did not have the chance to play the beta, but then i think i would be even more dissapointed in the game like so many others who have played and reviewed this game. It is very repetive, lacks content, and is honestly a snoozefest that couldn't keep my interest. Save yourself the time and the hard drive space for something better than Firefall. "

												Wow, I really hate to write a bad review of this game as I had praised it for so long. After a resource wipe, two gear wipes, a battle frame(one I really enjoyed) removed, and a complete change to the core of how the game is played I really can't say I like this game anymore. I was a Founder, I believed in how the game was created in beta and when it launched the first time. I made friends and even joined a good guild. Currently, with all the new changes this is no longer Firefall.Sure there were some positive steps in the right direction, but there were just too many in the wrong.Back in the day ""thumping"" was the way you not only aquired resources, it was a great way to level up as well. This brought people together as it was almost impossible or the avarge player to solo the largest resource collector.I heard crys for missions, and how the crafting system sucked. In all honestly, I belive the people crying for this were trying to turn the game into something else they had left before. The Devs listened to these morons and not the playerbase that was spending money, time, and enjoyment to this game as it was. Adding to the game would have been great, however trying to add new stuff seemed too hard and was deemed easier to just redo the game.If the game alright? I don't see why not, however my faith had been spit on, dragged through the dirt, and anything I tried to work for was stripped away from me.If you have never played Firefall I would say jump in and try it out. Don't spend money though as that just seems to promote stupidity.If you played the game before, just keep moving along. Your heart will break and you may constantly say things like, ""Where's my x?"" or ""What am I playing?"".			"

												TL;DR If you are bored give it a go and you'll have some fun, but...There is no development on this game any longer. The servers will remain up for an unknown amount of time. This game has amazingly fun gameplay, an awesome world to explore, great events, truly a wonderful game however the development team began a very daring and not well planned revamp of the meta aiming to make the game more role oriented (Tank, healer, support, dps). They improved most classes, devastated some others. The systems were also supposed to be revamped and while the progression towards advanced frames is improved thats about the only thing that got better. Crafting doesnt exist anymore, farming for money is pointless as questing gets you more, lots of quests are bugged and will never be fixed, etc. The game is truly unique and I will miss it, I was personally waiting for the development to finish their transition but that day will never come. Here's hoping they sell off the rights to someone who can do it justice but they said they are going to focus on developing the IP into mobile platforms			"

												What happened? The first firefall open beta felt alive, filled with things to do and places to explore. Ares misions everywhere, no job board and a pvp you can hop into from level 1.This new open beta...Feels like running simulator 3.0No ares misisons, and the main way to get XP is through Jobs from the job board.That would be fine if..ya'know.. Jobs weren't ""Go fight a hand ful of monsters here"" ""Run 500 meters"" ""Fight 10 more here"" ""Run 1000 meters"" ""Fight 15 + A tiny boss"" ""run 1500meters back to turn in"" Rinse and repeatLets give everyone a jetpack, with hardly any boost put gliders extremely spaced out, and then make the gameworld and mission spacing RIDICULOUSLY LARGE.SOOO MUCH running without DOING ANYTHING.I preferred the first open beta. That one was ready to ship if they just added end-game content. I don't know why or what they're doing this for. They messed up the game :|			"

												I bought in to the game back in 2011 ishhh and was extreamly pleased. The game was more rigid and structed with a free roaming system for if you want hard people go here or easier go there. Now it has a system of your lvl 40 but in a lvl 20 area soooo your now lvl 20. Its a nice system to keep balance but the game is about free roaming and doing your own on a global scale. There is no more rigid areas of attack from the enemy and where you must push them back as seen in 2013. Most the good bits have been removed with a ALWAYS changing class and stats system that cant make up its mind. Also instead of a LARGE map you can freely move about the chunked it up in to small little sections that get you loading screen each time you move..... Learned fast you can glider in to them or you fall to your death....funnnnnHonestly I am tierd of waiting for them to make up there mind on how they want it to look and feel.I give it a 3 out of 10			"

												Well guess its about time for me to finally write a review. Just going to start off by saying I've been around with Firefall for ages now, all the way back since closed alpha, hell my character is still the same original one. Over the years I have seen A LOT of core game changes, like so many I don't even remember all of them. A few changes were for the better, such as when progression was sideways, you aren't trying to gain levels but work on aspects about your frames by gathering resources to use. At least to memory this was my favorite of the systems, it was good. So right now we're sitting at version 1.7 if I'm not wrong, and yet again more changes to the core systems. Battleframe cores, which wasn't something I liked all that much to begin with, are now gone and replaced with generic armor pieces.  Old modules were replaced with new ones, honestly can't tell you why this was changed. Best guess is to have one kind of module rather than weapons and ability varients, still all in all I don't know why this even happened. Entire weapon classes have been changed, and this one seriously pisses me off. Rhinos are one of the dreadnaught arctype frames that used to carry a laser heavy machine gun, it was pretty awesome, and it worked basically how it sounds, a machine gun that shoots lasers. It also had an alternate fire that was a fairly neat and useful single continuous beam. Well the new Photon Lance has all the features of the old laser HMG, but without the machine gun part. To put it bluntly, what used to be an alt fire is now a completely standalone weapon. Oh it also has a fantastic range of 20 meters which basically puts the least defensive of the slow dreadnaught frames at a very close range to the enemy. Makes complete sense obviously. Look, Firefall is my baby. It is a game that I've been coming back to time and time again over the ages, no other MMO has ever received the same treatment from me. I care about this game a lot, and I seriously want it to succeed, believe me. Just... someone out there has decided to shoot themselves in the foot in a really bad way, in the past Firefall has been amazing and fun as hell. That Firefall isn't what we have anymore, its a shame honestly. Well, with the game's constant history of changes maybe we'll see something good again in the future, but I don't think so.			"

												I was a founder for this game years ago back when it was a mmo shooter with rpg elements and an expansive crafting system. I took some time off to deal with life things only to come back to a game that lost most of its shooter elements to be replaced by meaningless rpg fodder and a handicapped crafting system. The game as it stands is a grinder with little redeemable qualities. You will empty entire clips into one enemy. You will traverse long distances to redo the same quest. And calldowns no longer work correctly.I think everyone should take the time to play this game for a few hours. It has its charms but should serve more as a museum piece for what the industry could be doing. Imagine that when I played this game religiously I was one soldier in a massive war spanning the entire Copacobana region with Chosen attacking all sectors. It was a fight where people in the chat had to determine on the fly what we would hold and what we would let fall due to manpower constraints. As a Recon, I held off Chosen at the Thump Dump Watchtower for half an hour until enough reinforcements could arrive. It reminded me of the glory of Tabula Rasa. Now you can sprint through all these areas with near impunity. There is no war. There is only the grind.			"

												** If you bought a founders pack or played prior to 2015, you can claim full store credit on the spiritual successor Em8er, which is under the new company by the old CEO of Red5.  Be warned though, he was largely blamed for Firefall's death due to his mismanagement and wasteful spending of budget and resources on extremely expensive promotional rubbish while the game was far from being profitable.Game is dead, it tops out daily at ~80 people playing on Steam.Firefall had tons of promise, I bought the $100 founders pack way way back when it very first came out.  The game was good on release but plagued with lag issues and bugs which seem to persist to this day.The game got boring because promised content updates never came, and instead they kept reworking and reworking the class/combat/item/resource/pvp systems over and over removing a lot of the uniqueness.  Literally YEARS the game going through its beta phases and being released there was a pitiful amount of content added, the first dungeon instance they added was fun but it was far too little too late.I got bored of the game quickly when it came out, and I would come back every year or two and think 'how have they accomplished so little since I last played'.

												That may be a tad harsh, but this game is still in development purgatory. Constant system overhauls and removing content to ""easy fix"" sometimes non-existent issues are very common, and its likely that if you enjoy something about this game it will be gone or completely different a few months later. What was once an open sandbox has now been molded into a traditional path of ""hubs"" divided by level. A very fun dynamic invasion system in which you had to defend outposts against the main antagonists has been removed as not to disrupt this new leveling experience. The spawn rate for what are called ""ARES Missions"" has also been reduced to curb EXP gain, along with the removal or nerfing of a few other fun events. Long story short, these developers aren't capable of taking a step forward without taking two or three back. Download it, try it, but do not get invested because you WILL be let down.			"

												As a player who has ^ much gameplay time i can say that this game was one of the best for me when i started. It was something like my world and even now i remember times i played with other players and chased objectives togeather with great enthusiasm. However some stuff have been changed negatively and screwed game up. I had tons of stuff in inventory including currencies, equipement and rare items which i've worked very hard on to obtain. Now game(it seems) has been abandoned very sadly but know that red5 can return this game and it won't be a loss for them neither for community. Now i'm pretty sad for game's current state and must say with heavy heart i don't recommend it in it now. Also i remember that there was a concept about a new area which should've been the largest of all among current ones but it hasn't been added. I don't wanna see this game dead like this :(			"

												Verry laggy, badly organized events, completely bottle necked crafting system that will allways be 5-10 levels behind your character, a shooter with all the AI of your standard MMORPG that means they get in range and start shooting with perfect accuracy they dont move unless you shoot them in the head and you need  a special perk for bonus damage for headshots i was immpressed at first for all the voice acting even on the side missions but i think thats where they spent the entire budget as this game spent years in development to be hohum on a day where the servers arnt bouncing you all over the place and if you try to change servers it just redirects you to the same problem server you were on.But after a couple weeks of frustration as you see that the higher grade crafting is exacly the same as the lower grade and quests you have to quit program and log in again just to get it to load the next waypoint you start wondering why your not playing anything else anything at all			"

												While improving stability, they have yet to re-implement the random mission spawners, they've gutted the crafting system, replacing it with near meaningless RNG crafting, and have level gated their content.  In short, they started out as a ""sandbox"" style of mmo shooter, but have now turned toward the ""themepark"" style of mmo shooter.  As it stands now, with launch but a few days away, i cannot help but feel that the glory days are already in the past.			"

												Sadly I can no longer recommend this game after recent events.  The9 has taken ownership and it no longer resembles the vision sold to us during beta.  It's a shadow of it's former self.  You can play it absolutely free, there is several hours worth of content and campaign storyline if you wish to check it out, but beyond that it's been dumbed down and several features have been removed, such as thumping for resources in which you could craft gear.  If you're looking for a shooter game with jetpacks, this would be the closest you will get.  The combat is smooth, which is a real shame the rest of it went downhill.  Do not buy red beans or items, you will be supporting The9 which no longer cares about its players.			"

												Firefall left me with an excellent first impression, and I reveled in it with a small group of my friends for a week.It presented itself with immersive gameplay, as it offered a open world atmosphere, fantastic random encounters across the map, and a voiced operator that guided you along your quests. The combat was a bit bland and minimalistic, but was decent for an MMO shooter, and allowed for a swift learning experience. Team cooperation for random encounters and bosses was encouraged, and a PvE environment allowed a friendly, and helpful community to thrive.The premium currency in this game is a wonderful thing to have to quicken the rate in which you advanced through the game, but wasn't a necessity. The art style didn't knock my socks off, but it worked with their futuristic, yet sort of leisurely, and laid-back feel of the environment. It was in a Post-Apocalyptic scenario, so I wish the game's storyline would cohere with a darker, more serious tone, to prevent the game from looking like a ""Paradise Paintball"" a bunch of pre-teens would play.What disappointed me, and led to the desertion of this game that I once thoroughly enjoyed, was the lack of apparent progression. The developers seemed to have forgotten to polish some key aspects of MMO's that made them fun. Levels, new abilities, and gear did not provide any distinct differences in playstyle, and offered little pleasure in using. The game unfortunately ended up in a grind, with run-of-the-mill quests that rewarded you with a whole lot of dissatisfaction. I wanted to keep in touch with the game, by waiting for new content, but by that time, my friends were already bored, and subsequently abandoned the game.4/10. I'd recommend this game to those with a couple friends that want to fool around for a while, but is not a game you should invest a lot of time or money in.Warframe fits the same Free-To-Play, Sci-Fi niche, and offers a better arsenal of weapons and classes.

												I've played this game for several years now, since it was in closed beta. Back then, it was a incredible game, it was unique, I loved the open world pve features the most and being new to this genre of gaming I settled right in and wasted many hours on the game. Over the years, updates were just going backwards, with every update they were removing features that made this the unique game that it was. Now, it's pretty much the same as any other game in it's genre. It's all about levelling up your characters and that's it. They took awat crafting which was one of my favourite parts. The storyline missions were gaining more and more bugs with each update, dropship transport was introduced (great!) then removed shortly after due to more bugs. At one time, this game had huge potential, it could have been so much more than it is today, it could have had a hhuge thriving future but sadly the development team messed this up as much as they possibly could.As it stands now, the game is no longer in development. There are no developers left at the company, so I'm guessing it will continue to work in it's current form until the server money runs out whenever that may be. It really is such a shame to see such a great opportunity for a game be thrown down the trash as this one has.For anyone considering Firefall, I would suggest to wait for Em-8er which is created by Mark Kern, the genuis who came up with Firefall. Em-8er promises to be what Firefall could have been.			"

												If your looking for an experience player who went through the whole story mode and beat the game. here I am! Lets talk about the game and what it used to be. Firefall used to be a game where you and a squad of your firend or people you met along the way would explore the vast world and fight side by side until the end. Getting wonderous loot and special bounties were collected and were largely rewarded, upon be finished. The game was great through alpha and beta, it was a one of a kind game, giving us the only good game in the world that was free and had no game changing elements put into the real currency market. Firefall's market was like no other I have experienced, it was a living stock market judged solely on the players. The world price of an item could change from 100 credits to just under 37 credits in just one minute if someone wanted it to. Sometimes that did happen, and the world felt so alive with thousands of players on ech server making it almost impossible to run into someone not wanting to team up with you. Players actively traded and made group agreements through the Faction system they had and still have today. Players made the cities feel like real cities interacting with the enviroment, making large scale wars against eachother in battle arenas or entire 30 man units agianst an armada of chosen endlessly spawning in the shadows. Players would make parties for each other when special events came up, For me New years was that day, 3,500 people showed up on the server to celebrate, some had their whole family playing, some were just getting on for the first time looking for friends. It was an amazing time to play the game. Soon they limited the size of the servers to reduce lag, understandable, but soon after this reduced it even more and more and more over time. Soon only 5 people could be on a server at a time. They decrease the spawn rate on monsters, made events more controlled and less loot worhty, made the market automatically reset every day, players started dropping from the game, akmost a thousand a day until only about 150 a day were online a day. When I was playing in the good days of the game, the highest it got for players, was around 30,000 or more in one day. The highest a week later was 20,000 soon it was 600 now it's around 250.Players lost interest extensively a the 1.6 update came about. anyone who has played it knows what im talking about. 1.6 was the supposed best update to the game. we were all excited until the news of what it was, was leaked. they were changing the way upgrades worked, they were removing 32 items needed for crafting. They were removing crafting all together, and they also removed most people's progress in the game. Me personally, I lost all 6 characters I had, All around levels 25-37. I sent in a report of the problem but never got a response, all I got in return were 16 cases of equipment and a forced character change. I didn't even get to choose my new character. I was forced to be sniper. I decided to deal with it and play out the game as a sniper. Just to see if it was all that bad. at about level 15 sniper is OP. now in my sake sniper is OP after level 5, I recived a gun that could deal 2500 damage and instakill anything no mater where I hit it. At level 32 now, and I have a gun that can do around 5500 damage. I can one hit kill players by hiting them anywhere I feel like. I can kill the end game boss in three hits and can't die because of my healing. It gets boring when you can't die by anything in the game and can kill everything. So I bought something for $5 a skin. though I might as well make mysel look a little more interesting if im going to join someone's squad. guess what, I never recived the skin. contacted customer support and they said they don't offer refunds. They basically told me ""Sorry yo can't have your money even though you didn't get what you paid for! Bye forever!"" and never got a response since. If you really want to play it, make sure you have at least 5 friends to play with. it makes the game fun with friends. Don't spend money ever, because you have a chance of just being robbed. In all honesty don't play the game at all. The origonal developers have stopped developing it for about a year now. the first director that was fired from directing Firefall is now making a new game called Ember. You can look it up if you like. This new game is supposed to be what Firefall was aimed to be. with the inteanded actors that were removed from Firefall. As of reasearching the forum site they made, right now they are making concept art and taking in suggestions on what they should do for the game.(EDIT):The game has become better although the problems still persist. although the game is a lot better then when I wrote this review back then.

												Like just about all MMO's out there, Firefall has is an amazing game when you are leveling all the frames and stuff, hell the storyline is legit too. However, due to a lack of a raid/group finder tool, it has a terrible end-game unless you're in one of the very few hardcore clans who are pushing pvp or pve content. The saving grace for it tho is all end-game content is PUGable atm so it's not impossible hehe. ^^ Overall I give it 8.5/10!			"

												If the veterans of this game out there enjoyed any part of it before, then don't buy the early access. Everything that made this game unique and fun has been deleted so that they could make Standard MMO: Guns Edition. They killed the crafting system, killed the incentive to get new gear from non-quest sources, killed the leveling system, killed the dynamic world, killed the auction house, and killed the freedom of choice that made this game so good. If you want to play a completely generic MMO, play one with more content. If you want to shoot stuff, then pick up a shooter game. It's plain and simple.			"

												I've never seen something like this. I've invested over 200 USD as a founder and Red 5 royally ♥♥♥♥ed up what was a unique, fun game. Make sure you take notes that people who worked at Red 5 is not to be trusted. They made an awesome Beta that felt like a tech demo, got tons of money and proceeded to slowly ♥♥♥♥ it up to the point where it is now: bugged, broken, grindy, unfun. Every time I've logged on Firefall after the Beta felt like they implemented a new level of cluster♥♥♥♥. But trying it today bordered unplayable. Nothing really makes sense as quests simply start and finish in a broken way, UI and graphics issues where there were none before, disconnects and wasted time.Never invest into Red 5 and it's chinese publisher again. A few ex-employees are gonna [fail to] make a 'spiritual successor' to it..run from it like the plague.			"

												This game use to be great before the current update. I was fond on the wepon combo's and the oddity of it. for example the mini had a shield and it was practical with the slow build up time. Now it feels more generic, and lost it's special feel. the graphics increased , but now everything is pay to play and i personally dislike it. i do enjoy the buttons to deploy thinks much faster, but now i dislike it becuse it just feels like a normal fps with space and it is pay to play. If they return the weapons to before the current update, then it would be more interesting and likable, in my opinion of course. and instead of pay to play for color or items, maybe add some repeatible missions or daily rewrds to recieve the rarer currency then just paying.

												Graphics wise the game looks great, they had added a lot more stuff to do since beta. But a lot of the things they are incorporating is going horribly wrong. They went from a pvp non-leveling system and changed it to a pve leveling system to suit F2P audiance. Yet for some reason after official launch they have kept nerfing pve aspect because of players complaining how some frames are stronger than others at pvp and now they are even tweaking more things to suit pvp. The game is in a constant state of change in which gear you think is good now, might be mediocre in the next update.I do recommend this game for players, it is a fun game if you play with friends but if you don't like a game that keeps changing things, this isn't it.

												When the game came out of beta, its developers took out the awesome leveling system and way of grinding that made the game what it was. It is now just another crappy cheesy MMORPG that isn't worth a second of your time, and even after the beta, after TONS of patches, it still feels like it's supposed to be in pre-alpha. I would seriously (not exaggerating in the slightest) pay 60$ or even more to play the game it was in the beta.			"

												Bugs and other crap everywhere.This game used to be good back in beta but has slowly diminished into thin air, the development seems to be at an all time low and i currently dont even recommend touching it. There are some game breaking bugs that prevent progression such as the ""Crash Down"" main mission you're meant to do.The controls feel fine the movement feels rather solid but at the moment the game has had a lot of the content taken out of it like crafting and thumping, rendering your old materials useless if you've still kept them. I used to play this game pretty regularily but now i'd say avoid it. It's broken and beyond repair...			"

												Firefall... was fantastic. Keyword was.I was stuck on this game for the longest time, I played during the beta and was immediately hooked. Upon release, I was even more impressed with the game, the changes were awesome and it felt like almost like a new game, but with the core fundamentals in tact. It was the best MMORPG I had ever played.However, as Firefall slowly grew older and ""new content"" was released and changes were made, they destroyed it very quickly. It's not even close to the same game anymore. There are so many bugs that needed to be addressed and never were no matter how many times you and everyone else reported them.If they one day made it how it was during the open beta or on full release, I would 100% come back to this game and fully support it. But since pigs have a better chance of flying, I will have to bid farewell to Firefall.			"

												I played this game heavily back in 2014, come back today, (04/01/2017) and the game is broken, although that may be to kind. It was a fun game back then that i put hours into, now its nothing, story breaks completely a few missions in, i've found chosen incurrsions that show on the map, but theres nothing actually at the location, the game seems to have a lot of connectivity issues now, and apparently the devs just abandoned it thankfully the original guys want to make a new game called Embers which is the ""spiritual succesor"" to firefall if they do, lets hope it can bring back those good ole days, and not resemble anything close to this mess.

Leveling is a such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the job bordes are SO repetative and thumping gives only 1/4 of mission XP. Getting a new frame is not worth the work since getting to lvl 40 is to much of a chore with it being hard to lvl.This game us ""fun"" but it had a prime time in beta.			"

Also there are signs of Firefall becoming a p2w so beware of that, if you start playing and then get disappointed eventually. Although the new player experience is awesome and 10x better than it was b4 it still bugs me how they practically made 50% of the stuff I have crafted salvage and this is not even the 1st time this happens, because there has been numerous other migrations in the recent years. The game still has potential so I shall keep my fingers crossed as long as they keep it running.			"

												This game has so much potential but random pay walls, basically not play before pay, haunt it. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that the quests/missions are not well thought out. Going 900+ meters to an objective (talk to someone) only to come all the way back (another 900+ meters) to talk to someone else then going another 500+ meters to kill 10 bugs and talk to someone else ... that's every quest that I've run into and it's horrible. Great potential as mentioned, but not well executed at all.			"

												The moment you play this game, they quickly try to get your immersed in their universe by getting you to jump straight into their story campaign. The game then quickly gives you insight to each class and have you choose one to begin the campaign. Despite giving brief desciption, you do get a sense of lost on how truely worth wild some weapons/class are more than others. In most cases, I ended up using the AOE type gun because the mobs move around so fast and I'm spinning around looking for them because they might be going after your buddies or some stranger behind you then at the bottom of your feet, you got alien roaches poking you and you don't really know until they hit you because they are small and jump at random targets sometime. Being ammo based(you can replenish it with several ways), if you're not accurately skilled at aimming, you could be ending up wasting a lot of ammo. A lot of times when I shoot monsters, the whole feel of it doesn't feel right because I shoot, they stop, twitch then die and I'm standing there wondering wtf just happened.In one quest I had to go blow up some reactors or something in some enemy base? Base is empty, I freely walked through, then random enemies spawned that I quickly took out. SO BORING. Killing Hogger was more fun.Customizing your character is a bit lack luster, I wasn't impressed at the choices they offered. Their guns, although look different when compared to the next, didn't give that same feel like when you play other games like WoW. Getting stuff like a Thunderfury even though its subpar when compared to higher tier items like warglaives, is still a great vanity and awesome weapon to have around. Firefall, to me, all weapons look and feel the same to an extent or using the same template thats altered for unique-ness sake.Didn't understand upgrading much either and I got lost pretty easily. Because its so open world, you can get lost pretty fast when you're new or just traveling is a chore unless you use the glider. I found myself bumping into things way more than I would like. With other MMO, despite being less opened, players aren't likely to get lost or get caught somewhere like between two rocks under a hut and is not quite stuck yet not loose enough to get free. With enough patience, you could find fast routes.The quest though important for certain game mechanics, seems pointless and falls off the cliff of being side tracked. Placed me in an important military group only to make me run dumb errands like finding someone's husband? Hello?! I'm a elite warrior thats going to save humanity! Ain't nobody got time for this sheez! I didn't bother reading nor care what I was getting. I didn't understand the point at all. I felt very lost, out of placed and out of context when it comes to syngery or immersion in this huge epic story to save humanity. Didn't make me want to play more to unlock stuff. For a FPS type MMOG, I don't know how well it'll do. If any of you played Tabula Rasa, I felt more immersed into that game than this one and you had to walk everywhere... EVERYWHERE! Too bad it had some short comings it didn't fix in time. Hopefully Firefall gets back on track. There's some pretty embarasing and funny bugs and glitches that im surprised they didn't fix. As of now, I'm lost, bored, not caring much about the main/side story. Looking at the battleframes and such, I don't think my time will be of any worth investing either. It's a shame. Being how old WoW is, I still considered it one of the top tier games atm and they executed it very well. Only reason it's not as popular now is because people want something fresh. Some might contest because they like their ""FREE MMO"". Nothing tops SWG, pre Combat Patch. Give it to SOE for screwing up an amazing game like that.			"

												I liked it when I started playing, I got friends into it, and I came back recently to see what had changed. Think of it like this, you just built a castle with Legos, right? And Lego comes in and removes 90% of the pieces so you're left with only yellow bricks and 2 or 3 people. Crafting has been gone for a while now, after a bit of research. Some of the classes in the videos on the Steam Page are actually removed. I feel like the map has actually shrunk? The few team things left to do are monotonous and I don't like the game anymore. So, if you want to give it a try, the shell of what is left has a lot of potential and is a great weekend high if you're looking for something to do for a few days. It looks nice, but it gets old very quick and what you do at the start is essentially the same thing as the end game. There is no development or advancement in mechanics beyond a PvP region.I believe the best thing going for this game -RIGHT NOW- is that it's F2P. It is pretty, though.			"

												To the people reviewing the game: you are reviewing THIS BUILD, not the beta previously.Having played since CBT I can safely say that this is the Firefall we were promised so many E3s ago. They finally gave up on the silly esports and pseudo-EVE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and decided that if they wanted to be a fun shooter MMO they should just focus on being a fun shooter and a fun MMO- and Firefall is both. The beta builds were infamous for being a boring, repetitive grindfest but the public release is the exact opposite. It feels more like playing an open-ended campaign from start to finish than a traditional MMO. The equipment is simple but you have a lot of control over your gear. The content is plentiful, varied, and fun. The art is astonishing, and makes the game very easy on the eyes.If you ever wanted a Borderlands-style MMO, this is what you've been waiting for.Don't buy the negativity, try it for yourself. People have every right to be bitter, but not to lie about the state of the game.			"

												I bought into the hype to the cool price of a hundred buxx. Since the founders' packs days, they've hit the hard reset on this ""endless beta"" at least two-too-many times. I have not played on over a year, and I am almost certain whatever I had since last time is gone. Resources and equipment have been bounced back and forth, and nothing lasts. Even in the first year, the $100 worth of premium currency wasn't enough to get everything they had released by the next. There were even two phases of ""old currency;"" alpha and beta Crystite. Did you log in to exchange your alpha for beta in the proper window? No? It's gone.The community was always very loose and cliquey. More than 80% of my game time is looking for a group to do literally anything, at any level. Thumping was all the rage for the first month, and by the next year, you just had random people flying around, looking to killsteal from solo thumpers. You could not escape this then, but if the game really is dead now, maybe I can mineral-farm this-here space rock in peace.			"

												The world of firefall is really interesting and beautifully designed. However that is all this game has going for it atm.I played this game a year ago and quit because it had nothing to do outside of senseless grinding (you grinded for items to help you when you grind. There was no real goal in the game and nothing grinding took you too unless it was to level up your battle frames for a new battleframe). Came back to it today and was introduced to a large amount of major bugs that completely ruined the game for me already.Bugs i've encountered from today:-Key commands randomly stop working, only way to fix this is to relog your character. Sometimes the esc menu key command stops working and you have to force close the client to exit the game... (this bug alone makes the game not worth playing, its a bug that seems to happen frequently)-Items fall through the map, some quests require you to pick up and transport items, if you throw them (which you have to sometimes if you need to pull out your gun to defend yourself) the items will sometimes fall through the map forcing you to either restart or give up the quest.-Quests dont work, (for some reason they believed that the quests in the game should not be a part of the client folders when you download firefall. Instead every quest has to load from their servers each time you want to do one, and it doesnt even load the whole quest at once, it loads a part of it then waits till you finish the loaded part till it will start downloading the next part. The problem is at times it will get stuck ""loading"" and prevent you from continuing on in the quest.-Uncontrolled enemy spawns (not a bug just a dumb decision by the devs). Enemies can spawn infinitely from spawn pods resulting in 50+ enemies piled together in areas. The only way to get rid of them is to kill the them all. The only way to kill them all is with a group of people (good luck with that though since this game has a population of 20 if feels like) or you have to be 10-20 levels higher than the enemies.I want this game to succeed i'm sure a lot of people do but i really doubt it will. They added new content, i havnt tried it yet. But the amount of bugs i encountered from 1 day of playing has already made me hate this game again. Maybe in another year if this game can somehow survive, it might be worth looking at. For now you can have a lot more fun elsewhere. "

												Why You should try with this game? I will tell You...+ It is the most free to play game EVER sounds strenght? Im sure it does. In this time when You start play in any F2P game from start You will get information: Buy premium and be better then normal ""no-cash"" players. In this game after a small amount of time You will get Crystals ( elemental currency ) after that  exchange them into Credits and in marketplace You have chance to buy ""Red Beans"" premium cash from normal players.+ Game offert 16, yes 16 classes under name "" Battleframe "". In this group You will find 3 types of Engineers, the same number of Assaluts,Biotech and snipers and 4 types of heavy minigun and tanky Dreadnaught.+ First or Third person look, You can choose however You want.+ Multipe numbers of mini and huge world events, starting on Bandit Camps and ending o7n Melding Tornados. That mean you will work with players from all world.+ Really really really expanded crafting, for me the best untill this time in MMO games.+ All dungeons were created with a brain and nice dynamic fight.+ Wonderful graphic and good optimalization...-  ...but sometimes there is a bug when player falling under the ground and only reset game help.- In world some mobs and computers are not wise I can tell they are just typical idiots ( in dungeons or special events that thing dont affect ), they react after few seconds when I start attack them.So to sum up... I would give this game 8/10 ( The best free to play MMO ) it is a pattern for all games depend on free to play model. Beautifle graphic,good animations,tens of thousand players in game,interesting like for mmo game quests,nice crafting and vibrant world. Really recommended for all players looking for free shooter.If You enjoy this review leave a hand up or comment for me:)  Just one click will make happy for all day.			"

												Yep, it's awesome. Firefall was in development for over 4 years, and the results are just amazing. As someone that found out about it in 2011 and joined the Closed Beta soon after, I have to say it's been a rocky ride. The official launch is just the beginning, and much like EVE Online back in the day, this universe will be expanding. All in all, if you like running, jumping, jetting, flying, riding bikes and shooting stuff, and getting rewarded for it, (like 'Pandora', but it's actually Future Earth) this one is well worth a look. Free to try. Free to play. Sure, there's a cash shop, and the swag is pretty sweet, but you don't have to buy a thing. f'reelz.			"

												The game feels like a joke. There's nothing to it. All the missions are the same. All the guns feel more overpowered than anything ever. Seriously, no gun physics. Overall it's a good game. But it's lacking details that make a good game great. It tries to strive for too much at the same time though. It wants you to hold it up to WoW, and all the other MMOs and say ""WOW! This is it, this is the greatest MMO ever."" When it's not.			"

												Ok so I'm not one of the people that have been in the Beta but even still I'm not the biggest fan of this game either.Allow me to explain my bug bears with this:Free to play has not been a thing I've liked in general so the only reason I even bother with it was from a friend (a Beta player) Said that during the Beta it was amazing.So we both jumped on after the it was publicly avalible on Steam and after he had played it he said that he had pretty much played a completly different game and it sucked. Quite frankly I agree it's boring, nothing but grinding if you don't want to pay for the good stuff and if you do? GUESS WHAT? MORE GRINDING! never got to do Pvp and it's never really been my thing in MMO's either but all in all, nothing special I would look at anyone else's reviews as a Beta tester and just sit there and envy the real FireFall that I was so pumped for.So yeah really if you want a decent MMOFPS? go back to Planetside 2, or better yet Borderlands since this game feels like it was copying it as an MMO and failed.

												I'll make this quickPROS- fluid movement- unique environments- not necessarily P2W- Fun with friends- Unique leveling systemCONS -REPETITIVE gameplay-Long and Unnecessary grinding- you MUST unlock story missions- Weapons all look the same - few enemy types- many BugsBy all means try the game and form your own opinion. The game doesn't feel finished or very unique in any way besides the environments. You spent the majority of your time doing the same few sets of side missions until you level enough to complete a story mission, then new side missions come and you repeat the process. The weapons all look the same and there are only 4 player abilities per class. You don't feel like your working towards much in the game besides progressing through the story. Like i said before, try the game and form your OWN opinion, I mean hey, you can't go wrong with free stuff. Hopefully the devs make changes to the game to make all the hours of grinding feel worthwhile.			"

 ---DEVS, YOU NEED TO FIX THIS ASAP!!!--- 1 Heart-broken gamer/10 So... I haven't played this game in a long while. But when I saw the Rocketeer DLC I got hyped about playing the game once more. So I installed the game again and bought several DLC Packs actually. I was really looking forward to playing my awesome Engineer once more.So I start the game and watch that awesome trailer where this group of ARES Pilots gets attacked by Araneas, amongst other things, while defending their Thumper. The trailer brings back sweet memories of all the awesome combat I've had with my Engineer. The Engineer quickly changes weapons on her wrist-mounted device and kicks♥♥♥♥♥etc. It's sooo awesome.So then I eventually get into the game only to find it almost completely redone!! (in my eyes atleast...)- The story is remade as far as I can tell... - The equipment/gear is completely changed. The armor looks reaaaally clunky and unbalanced... - But the most noticable change? I no longer have a wrist-mounted secondary gun.... I hold it in my fri**** hands... why?The wrist-mounted version was soo awesome.... why change that? That's what made the Engineer stand out from the other classes... - And the visual design on the Engineer/Bastion isn't even the same as the trailer anymore... that made me reaaaally pi****!... I mean how can you have the original trailer and not have the original visuals on the fri**** Engineer?! Not happy, not happy at all.... I won't be recommend this game to my friends anymore... not until this ""bug"" gets fixed...This is like what Blizzard did to WoW all over again.... sigh... why mess up a perfecly good game guys? come on... please... don't take this game away from me too... I used to love this game.... :(			"

												If you're like me and keep waiting for a FPS MMO, this game was perfect.  Sadly it's dying, and the lack of support hardly makes up for the free to play price.  The number of times you'll come across broken, bugged, or just plain missing content while trying to work through the game are enough to take the fun out, and the list keeps growing.  Server outages and login errors are more and more common, and the game just ""misplaced"" my 42 level character.  If you're new to the game like I was, you'll find that most of the google search results are from defunct forums, leaving you to guess at most features/missions.Despite all the frustrations (and let's not downplay that) I still think that if R5 maintained even a minimal support staff this game could be fun.  But in it's current state I can't recommend Firefall as anything but an aggravating endeavor, and the hospice care support means things will only get worse.			"

												Simply put, this game is absolutely nothing like it used to be. It was fantastic in beta... I played the hell out of it, somewhere in the ballpark of 400 hours or so. Arguably the best MMOFPS I have played to date, and I stopped playing it about three years ago. I spent money on this game, and that is something I never, ever do with free to play titles.I downloaded it again, tried to give it another shot... I just couldn't do it. It didn't even feel the same. This was after release, and especially after the most game-degrading update made to it since it became available publically. My fears were confirmed. You got greedy. You got lazy.Congratulations, Red 5 Studios. You not only wasted my time, but yours, and countless others who are also sitting here wondering what the hell you were thinking.During Closed/Open Beta:  9.5/10After release: 4/10 (after the lastest update..

												The fact it can run on a PC as bad as mine with medium quality and still look beautiful gives it a graphics rating of 10 of 10 in my opinion. I have been a Firefall player since the first days of closed beta. Anyone that tries it now wont believe that back then there was only missions, thumping (the resource gathering), and invasions/watchtower fights. They have furthered the experience one can have on Firefall through a Campaign that I give 9.5 out of 10.  The adding of leveled npcs and the leveling of battleframes will take some getting used to for me but hey, its still fun.  I highly recommend this to any serious PvE player. The NPCs get a 10/10 despite the glitches (which make it 10/10 because they are almost always hilarious). The developers of the game often play alongside the players and I have the honor of having two said developers on my friends list. Overall I give this game 9.7/10 for enjoyable campaign, fun PvE combat, seasonal events, the motorcycles (known to us Firefall gamers as LGVs), and the like. Also one more note: Have your friend(s) play with you for a more enjoyable experience. I am normally a ""lone wolf"" on some games, but on Firefall its a lot more fun and memorable with friends. I cant count how many times I stood shoulder to shoulder with fellow ARES pilots in a squad fighting the antagonist faction known as the Chosen. The game still has some issues however, but they are working more and more each and every day to fix them. Should you read this review and try it, I want to recommend you possibly look around as soon as your in for a teacher on the various functions of the game. The game isnt hard to learn, but many will have questions. Just type ""/z Hey I am new"" and people will welcome you with friendly greetings. If im ever on when you try it, I can lend a hand! Just type /addfriend Cyberwolf309 and then type /w Cyberwolf309 and tell me who you are and ill help~  One last thing is customization. You can earn and buy cosmetics for your character and frame, and use general customizations such as accent, hairstyle, etc. If you dont try this game, you are missing out!			"

												To be honest, the things that made me try this game out were the fact that some of my friends recommended it to me and that Yahtzee said that ""combat was fun"". Otherwise I wouldn't even notice it.Firefall is a futuristic MMO/shooter hybrid. After some meteorite hit Earth and everything went to hell, the humanity managed to survive, the player is some kind of mercenary, and whatnot, typical MMO stuff, or so it seems at first. The plot is actually quite good, at least when it comes to missions you take from job boards, which create certain story arcs, some of them even interesting. The voice acting is surprisingly very well-done, and it's a pleasure to listen to dialogues and whatnot. And then we get to gameplay...At the very beginning, we are given five battleframes, or classes of sorts: Dreadnaught who's slow but has tons of health, can put up shields and uses a huge minigun, Assault with a launcher that deals splash damage, high speed and mediocre defenses, Engineer who puts up sentry guns and disp-er, I mean supply stations, Biotech who heals and uses a needle gun, and Recon who's the fastest but also the weakest class, sporting a machine gun with a scope and huge range (TF2 counterparts would be Heavy, Soldier/Demoman, Enginner [duh], Medic and Scout/Sniper). Granted, those classes have ""upgrades"" or rather different battleframes that work similarly but use slightly different weapons and abilities, but those have to be unlocked by maxing out battleframe levels (they max out at 40). Fortunately, unlike other games where you pick a class and stick to it for the rest of the game, you can switch battleframes at every battleframe station. They level up separately, though.Now, let's get to the combat. You can freely switch between TPS and FPS modes (the former being easier to see what's going on around you, the latter being easier to aim). Enemies usually try to swarm you or run around and shoot you, and there are also special variations of enemies - bigger, stronger ones, exploding suicide bombers, freeze ones that slow you down if they are killed in your vicinity... this makes for a huge variety of different opponents you'll face. You can also use jet boots and jet packs mounted onto your battleframe to take off into the air and shoot enemies from there. The combat is fast-paced and full of action, and makes for a pretty fun experience.You can grind out your levels (as is usually the case in MMOs), but what I really like is the fact that there's tons of quests that can be repeated. Also, killing enemies doesn't really give that much experience points, the bulk of it will come from completed quests. This is a good thing, as grinding while doing quests feels much better than just grinding. It gives you a sense of purpose other than seeing virtual numbers increment.What is really good, though, is the fact that you will see some events going on around the area - some broken equipment ready to be repaired, other players trying to mine resources and defending the mining machine from monsters etc. Nothing stops you from joining in and helping out, and it lies in your best interest, as you will gain experience or resources of your own. That was a very pleasant surprise, as it's rare to see a MMO that actively encourages co-op.However, this game doesn't come without its downsides. The combat and gameplay might be fun, but in the end, it still comes to just grinding stuff out. At least it's a pleasure to grind out stuff, most of the time. Also, this game tends to be glitchy at points, and not all of those glitches are of the ""fun"" variety. I gotta admit, this game is still better programmed than some other ones I've seen before...Overall, this is a good MMO and game overall (which is saying something, considering I usually loathe grindfests). Obviously, the game is most fun when played together, but solo play is good, too, especially that you'll frequently come across other players with whom you will cooperate to achieve common goals.

												Set in the future this is a First Person Shooter Massive Online Role Playing Game.  Its free to play with an option to get a subscription or to buy the subscription in game.  This is not a bad game it features many dynamic events and also has the usual generic job board for more missions.  You can at anytime go and help other people doing things around the map.One draw back people claim is bad is the in-ability to join with friends...this is false....you can join at anytime by simply deciding to teleport to them.  There is a mod that was released that supposedly helps but does not....as it simply does what you can already do in game....the mod also messes up chat channels, teaming and bunch of things.Contrary to posts the game isnt very buggy...it uses high resolution graphics that are impressive thus a weak system might have some trouble...so that means the biggest complainers on steam should avoid this game.This game isnt boring and there is alot to do....although weirdly a huge percentage of the player base....seam to just wander around the low level areas.....and get mad when you go to one of the open events and help do them....as they believe they are losing too much of the reward....even though they outlevel the event anywise by alot.I found after a while it was interesting...i went to new areas and found very odd things....aliens and monsters....and found a huge amount of the player base not going to the areas....instead they where too busy in chat complaining about being bored in low level areas....ironic.Anywise i find this game fun and i think people should give it a try.  Its free to play and is different then most games.			"

												I've been playing FIrefall for a spell now, probably a little more than a month.  I was looking for a fun RPG to play, and came across it browsing Steam.  I have enjoyed this game immensely, getting to know the crafting, jobs, instances, and world events.Firefall has a lot of different stuff to do, though as many other reviews bring up, sometimes it can get a bit grindy(what with 16 or so frames to level).  That being said, there's a decent community on Firefall, and it's a lot of fun to run with other people in a squad, really letting you see the different classes work together.  The Types(classes) all feel different, and the Advanced Frames have some pretty fun changes, such as the Mammoth's ability to teleport, or the Raptor's Powerfield.It's not perfect, sometimes the job boards can take a while to load objectives, and sometimes the UI doesn't work.  While it might not be the best to say at least they have a quickfix(/rui) that usually corrects it... but hey, at least there's that.  The devs are still active, working on game systems and fixing issues as they can.  In fact, I even have gotten the chance to go on a run with a dev, which was super neato.All in all, I've really enjoyed this game's feel, from the combat which can often be intense and fast-paced, the myriad of events going on, and the variety of ways to play with the different Types and Frames.  Oh, and it's all voice acted, from all the job boards to the Campaign instances.Looking for something fun and free, give Firefall a try :)			"

												FireFall is a open world MMO first and third person shooter what is skill based. All fighting in the game, be it PVE or PVP, is all 3 dimensional as every player have jumpjets and different enemies fly or hide underground. Each archtype (class) of battleframes plays differently from each other and can accommodate a large variety of different playing styles. You can easlies be the long wolf or the leader of an army. The would is alive as missions and randomed events can happen anywhere at anytime, because of this you are always going into the unknown when traveling or fighting.There many stories to be told and found thoughout the world. Just because it seems like the end of the world people are not going to stop being people. The personal lifes and drama people have to deal with day to day just doesn't go away because the looming threat that everyone be killed at a moment's notice. Help out survivors learn their stories and maybe learn more about what is happen behind the scenes.			"

												This was a great game. Then, they ""improved it"". It is now a crap game.  The game still has bugs which have been there since release. Rather than address these, the devs completely revamped the game in other ways and basically dumbed the whole thing down.  They claim the recent ""improvements"" were down to community feedback, yet I am unable to find many members of the community who agree. Think Star Wars Galaxies if you recall that game. It was an awesome in-depth game that required at least a bit of intelligence and commitment to achieve anything, then came the ""new game enhancements"" which dumbed the whole game down so that even a 5 year old console player wouldnt be put off. This is the same thing. There's one simple rule with games, and many other things- If it aint broken, don't fix it. Or feck it up in this case. After 100+ hours of playing, I can't see me reinstalling this ever.			"

												If you like third person shooters you should most definetly give this a try. Its not a deep game with lots of intricate game play and deep stats. What it is though is a heck of a lot of fun to play. Jump in and go guns blazing. You can play for hours jumping from thing to thing but its also very easy to get in and play for little snippets since most events are only 5-10 minutes long. And Jet Packs. . . who doesn't love Jet Packs?! I keep waiting to get tired of them and just don't. I think many will disagree with me but I also find the game to be very well optimized. I can be on screen with about 20-30 other players and at 30-50 mobs with all sorts of abilites and effects going off and have very little FPS drop. The game is able to dynamically downgrade your quality to keep FPS up which is a nice feature. It could be that it is not that well optimized and its this feature kicking in that does the trick, but honestly, I'm not focused on textures when I am hopping around like mad trying to blast baddies.Its also a pretty good F2P model. You can reasonably get everything you want in game given enough time, and the time spent isn't even that egregious. The main things people will want in the store are new frames and transportation. The frames can be obtained by leveing one of the free frames which gives you the ability to unlock a new one for free and so on. The transportation is really something you need to spend money on. You can get a free LGV (motor cycle) at level 25 but thats a pretty long way in and single use gliders will just get frustrating. The company has to make money somewhere so I think this is a good trade off. The other thing to buy is cosmetic stuff but that in no way is required and is just fluff.			"

												Edited review for 1.6:The game has undergone drastic changes, and overall I find them to be very healthy for the game.  We have several new ways to hone our abilities, and grow stronger, to improve on our skill as a whole, while not overshadowing other players completely in the process.  Firefall is now a game about building yourself up for a fight that you can eventually win, and that's the fun of it.  The journey is there, and it is long.  It's fun.  It's exciting to share it with others.  And overall, I feel everyone who enjoys a shooter with MMO mechanics will love this game.The graphics are beautiful for their style, offering a unique look from the drab ""Realistic"" we see every day.  The game performs well, with constant optimizations that have made the game play well even under hectic firefights.  The gameplay is solid, with missions being straightforward, and although at times shooter mechanics can be repetitive, the combat stays fresh because you can easily switch to other classes on the fly, rather than having to deal with multiple characters or accounts.This is the MMORPGShooter that the world deserves.  Enjoy it!			"

												Firefall had so much potential from day one (but then a♥♥♥♥♥*** ran off with all the money or thats what we have been told happened) Then the game development only gone the wrong way to the failure it is today from a game that was based on Co-up in from of Thumper and tons of mobs you should protect your Thumper from which were so groundbreaking in gameplay that it was something new that has not been seen before in that scale and it just workt so incredibly good that we were so disappointed when they removed the idea that you had to thump for materials to craft gear and weapons and then they spit us right in the face bay not lissing to our feedbacks and (ruin) a great game so now us old gamers really feel we have wasted our money on what we ultimately had seen many times before! (If the game gos back to the old idea off Thumping for materials to craft gear and weapons it will win alot old players back + give us something for what we have used time, money and hard work on) Hope for the future of FF ?If I can recommend the game? Not at this point! But we never know what the future may bring!!			"

Posted: July 8, 2014
												So this is my own personal review/feedback/whatever on Firefall as it stands right now at release. At the time of writing this, I have clocked 500 hours on the release version of Firefall, along with 62 days since it went. It’s based on my last few weeks playing, levelling lower frames from New Eden and beyond, taking on Titan bosses, campaign, etc, etc. Feel free to leave your thoughts or replies here, but like I said, this is my opinion on the game, yours may differ.Review was written 9th August 2014, Firefall build V1.0.1793.Story 6/10The story and lore behind Firefall is really quite good. It’s not just your standard end of the world survival or fantasy game that 90% of the market seems to be flooded with. It’s a great change of pace, the campaign storyline, be it a little short is engaging and I find its biggest issue is the lack of real character development since virtually every character you talk to once or twice, and then never see, or hear of them again. There are a few exceptions to this, like Aero, your operator for example who you will be with your entire Firefall career and Hobbes from the campaign, The Meddler from ARES Jobs but nothing sticks out long enough, or gets enough explanation to make me care about them, their backstory, it just leaves me thinking what a missed opportunity to dive into the Firefall universe. Sure, we don’t need to know about that one random farmer you helped retrieve a bracelet or something, but when it’s a character, really out of the ordinary, like the Meddler for instance, it really would be good to see their backstory.As you progress in Firefall, the story changes considerably. You start out as a brand new player in town, so you get the low work, collect this, collect that, etc. Once you start to gain the trust of the Accord and fractions though, you are allowed to move on to higher level work, like sensitive data recovery, target elimination. The story really does do an excellent job of keeping you interested in the world, since unlike most characters, Firefall gives you loads of lore, backstory, etc about the world you are living and fighting in. Moving thought the zones, the story is consistent, and gradually builds up from simple tasks to moving on to fight the Chosen in an all-out war with strikes, kidnappings, ambushes, etc.I am really looking forward to chapter two and beyond for the campaign arcs, if the first one is anything to go by, Firefalls story is only just getting started. Based on what I have seen, I personally rate the story a 6/10. Whilst it is very fun and engaging, the missed opportunity of lack of character development and very short nature of the Campaign overall is a huge downside, once the next chapters come out, I would very much hope I can improve this rating.Graphics 8/10One of Firefalls strongest points is its beautiful world. Coral Forest has vast open beaches to rocky cliff faces, to lush forest. Sertao is a rocky desert with dust storms, mountains and small areas of forest more inland. Devils Tusk is on an island covered with lava from erupting volcanos. These are just the zones that players will travel through and they really give the game a sense of vastness and beauty. Playing on Ultra, this game is out of this world.Firefall has this very unique art style, I can’t quite place my finger on it but it’s like a mix of Manga and Borderlands and to be frank, it’s something that works really well. This game is not designed to be hyper realistic like say Crysis is, but not completely out of the ordinary, like Borderlands goes for.My only problem is in some places, textures really are stretched out, ruining and scene. There also are quite a few spots where a texture goes into another, and you can clearly see how one is higher resolution compared to the other. Now this could be down to the way Firefall streams in textures as it needs them, as a player with a slow internet connection, I cannot give the game huge bandwidth to download textures, and there is no way to just download them from a launcher or via Steam.I personally rate the graphics of Firefall to be an 8/10, the only reason I drop marks for it is because in those patches where graphics suck, it just ruins the experience for me. I would like to think in the future, we can see more detailed models, textures, etc being rolled out and any areas where it is a little off can be patched.Sound 7/10Firefalls sound when just shooting, running around, etc is average at best. Pretty much every gun of the same variation sounds the same, no matter how good or bad it is, and most sound assets which you hear early on, you will likely hear again, and again, and again.What really saves the audio for Firefall is its voice acting and its background music. The voice acting for some is really hit and miss, some characters sound really out of place, but overall they do a great job of sucking you into the world, and it’s really nice to see that a AAA MMO went for full voice acted missions, on every job, campaign mission, NPC, etc. For some, this isn’t a huge issue, but for me I really like to have the story read out and brought to life, this is what Firefall does very well.The background music in Firefall, or its entire OST for that matter is nothing short of amazing. My favourite piece is from the first campaign mission, Crash Down. Sometimes I will want to go and play that mission just to hear that music again and again! I find that even 500 hours in, I love having background music at full volume still, something on many other games I find myself muting due to its repetitive nature or just average music. I rate the sound of Firefall a 7/10. Whilst many assets are used far too often, the voice acting and the background music and OST I would rate as a 10/10 on their own. Props to the composers and musicians involved in Firefall! On a side note, the OST from buying a starter pack seems to be missing many of the music scores used within Firefall, very disappointing but with a quick search, I’m sure you can turn up the entire music score online.Continued here: http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/threads/kuros-review-feedback-of-firefall-1-0.4770821/ Review too long for Steam			"

												Were do i begin, was a big lover of this game, but only before this new update, after a month or three of waiting for them to fix the ability to just log in (yes thats right i could not get past the log on due to been stuck on a loop trying to clam lost battle frames).After finaly logging in and been able to play the game, I find that I have lost many battle frames(one from each section totaling 5 lost, which equals loads of in game hours playing upgrading etc etc), a loss of all secondary fire for main weapons(except a few that they had to keep), but for some frames/classes you now have lost the one fire method that made the class fun, (IE detonating bombs, posion and many others).  For me these are the big ones, no fun trying to aim at every target, might as well play COD or some other first person shooter...think the devs lost a lot of focus on what they had.They have also, well looks like... down graded(changed) the graphics in expotions and bullets shooting quality of what looked good, to some form of what is almost comical. Lost abilityz / equipment that owned.  By the sounds of things items purchased from real money for to own, are now only reanted( not sure on that as haven't played enough to see what will happen and wont be playing much at all).Devs had a great thing going and was kind of looking forward to new things but they should have made a new game rather than make this one crappy.  maybe in 2020 when the next change happens thay can make it more like the old and I will play again.  why do these game makes take steps bacwards and ignore feedback for a quick buck return is any body guess.   well I guess this leave me with more me time and to find a better game that the garbage they have now created.Now in saying all that you may love this new version, might be great to play if you never played the old one, there is still some great aspect to the game like jet packs and walking about shooting stuff, but its not even a shaddow of what it could have been in the derection they took...sry devs a big thumbs down from me.

												It's a good game to have time to kill until Destiny comes out. The game is kind of generic, repetitive, and has bunches of fetch quests. There is no unique story to these quests you do, you don't care about any of the characters or whatnot. You just do them for the xp to eventually move onto similar regions. The shooting mechanics are fun and better than Defiance, but still feels a bit floaty compared to other shooters. AND WHAT IS WITH ALL THESE BUGS!? They are 90% of the game's enemies!If your like me, a hardcore FPS gamer trying to get into MMOs. Don't bother with this game unless your curious. Just stick playing with Destiny when it comes out.

It sated what I desired and I was so happy with it.After a small break, and coming back at the steam update (the massive update which actually ruined the game) I was met with this.I didn't think a game could go from Amazing to Disgusing so quickly. It hurts more knowing how good it was prior to this update.Let this be an example to other devs on how to not develop a game.			"

You can see them here trying to scare us Steam newbies away from this game. Now it seems thay have simplifyed many features, crafting is one of them. Before you could mix adn match materials to effect the stats, you can't do that now which is sad.till level 24 you have to hoof it on your feet or gliders. you can either buy a bike for like $20 or get lucky and get a one use bike from a vendor that give's you randome items.Now to mine metals to craft you need ""Thumpers' there are two kinds one for 1-2 players and another for 4-5. these reward those who help defend the even if you stumble across them.I say give it a try all it will cost you is time and download.I'll update as i go along.

												Extremely fun game to play for a little while, I was fully expecting microtransactions and that's fine - if it's vanity purposes. But, this is pretty blatant pay to win/pay to get ahead with a ""VIP status option"". Huge turn off along with some buggy quest I decided to uninstall it.Personally anything that speeds up the game the earning process by doing the exact same thing some one who isn't paying is, in my book, pay to win. I realize some disagree with faction reputation gains and EXP being pay to win: but it is to me, sorry.If you're not bothered by the P2W aspect, you're likely to enjoy it if you're a FPS and/or Borderlands fan.

												I have gotten into level 28+ so this is what i think of so far.TL;DR : The game is a walking simulator early until you get into level 25, Credits are getting easier, Thumping is useless and after the area is depleted you need to find a new one that has 60% materials that's hard to find and most of your party member left when its depleted. There is no more exploring when you reach level 25, They fix the quest with 30% more rewards when finishing a quest, but it's still a god-damn grindfest. It's still not recommended at the moment, but when they already ""Fixed"" these problem, i will come back to this review.OLD TL;DR : The game is a walking simulator, getting money is hard, thumping is useless after the update, generic questline. The gameplay is fun, thumping is fun, sometimes you gotta do exploring, and the game feels like Borderlands.			"

												I've put roughly 180 hours into Firefall so far. I say so far because I can see me putting in a whole lot more. Now I can see why people wouldn't like this game. Yes it has bugs (other than the ones you kill). Yes sometimes mission objectives don't load & you have to restart the mission again. Some times enemies just vanish while your shooting them. But having played a lot of this over the last 2 weeks I can say that there is a lot more to this game which will outway the glitches & bugs.So how is this different to any other MMO? Well apart from being a FPS or 3rd person shooter not much really. It has the same go kill this for this reward quest system. It has instances. It has raids. You find better gear to increase your character to be better for end game content. You can farm missions for resources and currency. You grind to get certain items. So pretty much the same story as any MMO. Well yes. But there are a few things that make this game stand out from the others. The dynamic world events are always ongoing. You will not be left standing around very often with nothing to do. From killing death teams to fighting for control of a thumper (machine used to extract resources from the ground). There is always something going on. I know other games such as Guild Wars 2 offer world events but not on the same scale as Firefall. The fighting in this game feels great. Feels like a really good FPS or 3PS. It feels like it should. I personally play in First Person and really enjoy jumping around dodging snipers and plasma cannons trying to shoot me down as I fire thermal rounds burning everything in sight. Its a lot of fun.Thats this games biggest asset. FUN. Yes it can be played seriously in a group in a raid situation. And yes if you roll in to a group instances under geared your probably going to be getting some abuse from the other players. But if you gear up properly you and your friends can have a lot of fun blasting away the enemy using plasma cannons, thermal cannons, poison shots, grenades, bombs and more. It can get really hetic. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy MMO's. This is not a pick up and play FPS. There is crafting and researching and levelled gear which you would normally find. So if your a MMO player give this a go. Yes its rough around the edges but its always being updated, theres tons to do and in a group its a hell of a lot of fun. It's also free to play (and can be played for completely free. Only real money is used for vanity items & VIP status which gives you a xp, money and reputation boost.)			"

												for the people who has enjoyed the beta phase of this game, i'm sure they won't like this game. so many things changed from the beta phase. the manufacturing, research, resource, and most importantly no tech trees and hard earned pilot token for the free player.believe me, this game was a heaven for those who want something different, and it was when this game still in beta phase. well there is a lot of bug, and lagging. but hey it's beta phase. then why it became a heaven for those beta player, simply because the game felt a whole lot different than any MMO game u have tried so far, believe me for this one.in beta phase, red bean only used for style and fast access to a permanent vehicle, there are no such thing like double exp or vip system. but now, after u played the game at this moment, u should've realized that this game changed, red bean now can be used to pay for your winning. with some money u can instantly access an advanced battleframe, where the free player need to level up the basic frame until it reach lv 40. and yet after that they have to restart their playing time because the advanced battleframe started from lv 1 again.free player, u just wasted ur time to grinding, leveling n mining, just so u can redo it for the second time. congratz the developer just make a fool of you.simply this game changed to worse, just because the developer need money and they cant think any other way to make their player spend money on this game.

												I played this game a while back when it was in beta, and it was...tolerable. Saw it got fully released, didn't initially want to play it. My friends started playing it. I got bored. Downloaded Firefall after a week with hopes of playing games with them. The only thing we ever did was add each other as friends.Didn't wait for me to catch up in level. Didn't switch to a new battleframe (can do it at will for free) until I was the same level as their main battleframe. Nothing.The game is terrible and lackluster and a massive walking simulator for ""the first 20 levels"" as it was put to me by multiple people, friends and otherwise. They claim it revolves around ""dynamic events."" I barely encountered any at all. The Thumper minigame you can do is the only way you can have anything resembling a ""dynamic event."" Even that is terrible. No one joins in. Nothing. The only time I ever saw other players was in the main city. The game's idea of objectives (if you're doing missions from the job board) being ""near"" each other is have one objective 1km away in one direction, and then 2km in the opposite if there are multiple objectives.The art style is appealing only to those with a sense of style comparable to a 12 year old's.Overall, I cannot recommend this game. Not a single bit. How people find it to be enjoyable is completely beyond me.On a positive note, the soundtrack is good.			"

												The game has been destroyed in the latest patch (1.6).They have disabled one of the most desirable features in the game (Crafting) and by doing so leaves the people who enjoyed that part of the game so much pretty much in the dark, they say that crafting will be brought back in 1.8 with a completley new system however they should have kept the old system until then, Thumping is essentially impossible and when you actually are able to thump you get dirt and Crystite and, not alot of crystite either (40 - 200).Red 5, you have destroyed this game.

												I have gotten into level 28+ so this is what i think of so far.TL;DR : The game is a walking simulator early until you get into level 25, Credits are getting easier, Thumping is useless and after the area is depleted you need to find a new one that has 60% materials that's hard to find and most of your party member left when its depleted. There is no more exploring when you reach level 25, They fix the quest with 30% more rewards when finishing a quest, but it's still a god-damn grindfest. It's still not recommended at the moment, but when they already ""Fixed"" these problem, i will come back to this review.OLD TL;DR : The game is a walking simulator, getting money is hard, thumping is useless after the update, generic questline. The gameplay is fun, thumping is fun, sometimes you gotta do exploring, and the game feels like Borderlands.			"

												I've been playing this off and on for 2 years, it took them forever to get out of beta but I gotta say I always loved this game.With the launch on the 29th of july here they finally added and changed things that always kept me from enjoying this game hardcore. A smooth leveling experience now, less focus on PVP and PVE missions, stories and instances and a much more ease of access crafting system.the world is gorgeous the hardsuits are fun and each has a different playstyle and I would honestly call this the PVE answer to APB being pvp. if you hate player vs player but love shooter mmos and enjoy exploring..this game might be for you.the cash store is filled with quick ways to level(nothing pay to win) ease access hardsuits(you can earn them in game leveling) and tons of fun cosmetics. the only real cons I can think of, I get motion sick on my bike xD and sometimes the combat feels a little jerky. But all in all a fantastic solid game with of course the odd bug and glitch but well worth it.			"

												It's not perfect, it's not finished, but by god it's fun. Firefall is one of those special games that you'll always remember fondly, from the gorgeous landscapes to the well developed lore, and the bouncy combat to the dynamic events, it's all gravey people. You'll just have to jump in and try yourself, but do yourself a favor and do it today.			"

												This is a Borderlands type MMOFPS. It's basically a beautiful, open world play ground where you roam from job to job, while enroute being constantly side tracked with fun events that randomly spawn through the world. Every 2 or 3 levels the game moves you to a new location, keeping things fresh. Hang gliding through the sky never gets old. The core game is PvE based and highly encourages players to help each other as you pass by them. Everyone reaps the rewards as long as you pitch in. The crafting system is fun along with the mining system. Send a thumper crashing into the earth to mine resources. Refine those resources. Research abilities, weapons etc from research points you get from salvaging junk and old gear and then craft items based on all of those factors. The instance based missions are challenging if you do not get a fair amount of players on your team. The voice acting is great and the graphics are still nice to look at after almost 40 hours of gameplay.Things that I do not care for. Job board missions take you all over the map. This is to entice you to purchase either VIP which gives you a special anytime glider pad to put down or purchase a motorcycle. Motorcycles are badass but cost a ridiculous amount of real world money. There is a way to exchange in game currency for Red Beans (real world $) but as usual this takes such a grind that you would have to ""dedicated"" (a nice way to put it) to get anywhere doing it. I have VIP'd a for a few months but I also think that is a little pricey as well.The cosmetics for your player are great. Battleframes to purchase with real money look great along with accessories. All the class in the game are available for free and all are fun to play. Whether your healing or throwing down turrets or just walking down Chosen with a huge gun. There is something for every play style.This game took a beating in the reviews when it first dropped but has greatly improved since. It is free to try and definitely worth a shot.			"

												Firefall is a fairly fun game. It's free to play; microtransactions are present, but for the most part you can get items off the Cash Shop (Red Bean Store) with currency earned in game. It's a first person/third person shooter with jumpjets. The game world is interesting if you are into the sci-fi genre. I started playing when it game finally released a month or two ago, and I'm still enjoying myself. I haven't spent a penny on the game, yet I've unlocked almost all the advanced frames within that time frame. Also, the gunplay isn't too bad, only annoying thing is sometimes the enemy's movements are a bit off/unpredictable/laggy, but that could be due to my horrid wireless connection.I'll end my gibbering with a pros vs cons list.PROS:+Interesting Sci-fi world with vast room to expand (both lore/story-wise and game content-wise)+Third/First person shooter +Jumpjets!+Free to Play with not alot of Pay to Win content (A Bike/LGV is great for running around, but I believe you can get one early on now, instead of waiting to level a frame to 25)+Cash shop items can be bought with in-game currency.+5 base frames with different playstyles mixed in with a fair number of advanced frames to change it up.+Customization of your character is free (recent patch gave everyone all the haircuts/facial hair options)CONS:-Not a huge amount of things to do once you've hit max level (level 40 right now)-Glitches/bugs can sometimes be an issue (which is normal for an newly released game, sadly)-Mostly a PvE (Player vs environment) game with a PvP (Player vs Player) mode and area sort of tacked on.-Is a bit grindy ( at least your not paying for it, eh?)-Some parts of the game aren't as well balanced as they could be.-Crafting in the game is widely considered a bit of a joke and a waste of time (Recent patch has reduced the cost of some items as well as allowing for you to pick what subtype of item you want, but the reseach costs I believe have stayed the same. Less of a crapshoot, but still costly).			"

Product received for free
												Firefall was one of the most saddening trainwrecks of a game that could have been absolutely beautiful. I played since closed beta, was a founder, and spent a ridiculous amount of time on this game pre-steam. Every time I go to check back in on it and possibly come back, I hear about yet another wipe. Yet another core system change. I  played thorugh probably 3 tree wipes, weapon system redesigns, etc. They kept changing their mind on things right after people got fully used to the new system. It's absoutely unreal and if you want a good stable game that you can eventually learn everything in and not have to worry, this isn't it. Odds are they will rework an entire system every few months like it seems they've continued to do. And then you have to re-learn and re-grind. This game was so golden when it first released and in beta. I don't know why red had to kill it.			"

												This game has gone through some changes over it's long development period, but the absolute core component has remained in the game throughout, and that is the fun element. This game is just plain fun. Do you like jet packs and motorbikes? Do you like killing crap? Do you like Sci-fi? Do you like a great art style? Do you like....Hell, just play it already!They have refined the crafting and levelling process, to make it more new player friendly. There are heaps of different battleframes (classes) to procure and play. Also the developers are great, and very community orientated - you'll see them in-game playing.Oh, and it's free :) "

												Really cool and fun game. And while it might seem like it's pay 2 win at first glance it's actually not since you have currency exchange to buy all the premium currencies with basic one (well you upgrade crystalyte to credits and credits to red beans) ofcourse there's a daily limit to how many you can convert but still. Alos majoroty of the ""premium"" stuff can also be sold on exchange for credits.(I guess I could say it's pay to obtain stuff faster). Anyway overall the game feels like mix between Borderlands (graphics, questing and open world wise) and warframe considering you have multiple battleframes and only one character. I haven't tried PvP aspect yet personally but people claim it's fun so I'll take that for granted atm. As for battle frames at the moment start with 5 basic frames and there's 11 more advanced frames so there's 16 in total at the moment. Now to get advanced frames you have 3 options: 1(captain obvious): Buy them for red beans,2 buy them for credits from exchange3 level up any frame to lv40 to get 10 tech points with which you can buy the for.Now while the game is extremely fun it doesn't come without flaws. For instance jobs get repetitive and boring as hell and since the objectives get placed randomly it sometimes places them on weird places like on top of the mountains. It also seems like the game requires a bit of skill to progress since ranged enemies hurt like hell and mobility is key to not getting shot so use your jetpack all the time and don't stand still.Another flaw I noticed is lack of ""extensive"" tutorial so it might get confusing for new players there is tutorial for basics but it doesn't involve the crafting system which and how to obtain materials (besides thumping).Also 1-use items are quite annoying especially the glider pads since I tend to use them every cooldown cuz they're fun. They are reusable(permanent) ones but they're a bit expensive.Thumping to gather resources while fun at first it gets tedious when you have to wait for 5min to get that x amount of metals and dirt.Now let's go back to the fun parts. 1. Quite emersive selection of frames which involves different playsyles also you can combine skills from basic with advanced frames of same type.2. OMG jetpack. fun to use especially if you're like me and use it constantly to climb mountains and then...3. ...use glider pads to glide around like a baws.4. nice graphics really nicely done world and different settings from beaches, mountains, forests and deserts.5. Random events that happen across the map and some give quite a bit of experience (especially tornadoes)Soo overall I'd give the game about 8/10 grade since it's not perfect there are some issues and it's not next-gen either but overall the fun I had in the game for past couple of days beats all the flaws. It's especialyl fun when you play it with friends and just mess around.			"

												It's a good game that has had a troubled development history, in part because of particular member of management who is no longer with the company. The game itself is fun and is evolving. However, if you are looking for another WoW with well-defined objectives and quests, this is not your game. There certainly are things that can be goals to work toward, but how you approach the game is up to you. You are not funneled down the same path as everyone else.			"

												It sucked in beta two years ago, and it sucks now. Nothing has changed. Performance is a joke for a game that looks like a PS2 game, controls are decent, combat is fine if not basic, controls are good tbh, story is a throw away, environemts are littered with adverts for in game item that cost real money. Now back onto performance, for a game that looks this bad graphically it should run a million times better than it does with everything maxed out 1080p Ultra settings I get lowest of 38fps in starting town, and highest of 190fps... that is a massive jump. Even using vsync does not help as the game still has random loading sectons where you can tell its buffering the next area and the fps goes nuts. I have the lastest drivers and updates for my system and my system is no sloutch with an i7 4770K @ 4.5GHz and a 3GB HD7970 1150/1650 and 16GB 1866MHz RAM. I can max out Crysis 3, Metro LL, even ESO and still get smooth playable frame rates in those games that look ten times better than this game.Overall, download it and try for your self, it is free afterall but I bet you will uninstall it after an hour. PS/ I sunk 16 hours into the BETA 2 years ago and I sunk 1.5 hours into this release on steam.... ITS INDENTICAL!!!			"

												I played the game in the beginning ( beta) upon the release the game went quiet real fast. The land you walk/fly/glide/drive around in felt really empty. in higher stages. However i gave this game 3 chances again but none of my friends ever returned to the game when it left beta.  It is a pretty looking game but the community has been taken over by mostly non english chat. Missions get boring because it is always the same old story. You grind to the max leven and then use a new suit. I play the game when im really bored. Some people will be able to have a blast for hours and hours but for the gamer that is looking for a futuristic free shooter i advice other games above this one. The game has a lot of potential but devolopers not interested in the gaming community. I recommend the game but that is mostly because i dont want to give up on this game yetUpsides: nice graphics, lot of potential, a lot of different classes/characters, fun if you are already bored and want to fly around and kil some monsters after you place a thumperDownsides: boring, crappy online community, heavy grinding, pretty empty maps (unless you place a thumper), the same mission over and over, devs made a lot of promises they failed to keep.

												I played this game for thousands of hours (yes, thousands) completely geared every single character in the game to its max.....then out of nowhere they change the entire system and the literal 1000's of hours I've spent all went away. they compensated me for all my loss with gear for a single character that is obtainable within a day...the game just isn't fun anymore, despite the fact they made my time investment in the game worthless. all of the classes are completely different. this game was going downhill fast after they took out PvP queue (for no reason) and switched to openworld pvp only...where you can divebomb with a hand glider and still get sniped out of the sky by aimbotters that are outside of the max view range(I have a lot more time logged into the actual client than steam)			"

												The game is pretty solid, gameplay is smooth and responsive, graphics are nice, the ability to swap to whatever basic battleframe you want right off the get-go is a plus, however advanced battleframes cost beans(money). Play with friends.There are still a few bugs they need to iron out, like friends lists and army's(guilds) sometimes quests won't track properly, especially if you're in a squad. The learning curve for the crafting system is pretty high, read some guides.All in all, more then good for F2P. 8/10			"

												now i have played this game far greater then just 13 hours on steam since i played during OBT when there wasn't really much content at all.that being said, back in the OBT the des atleast listened to the community and actually tried fixing things and one of the big issues i had with the game back then and even still right now, was the fact that you are able to have access to all BattleFames in the game. however in order to use them you need to have a special type of currency to unlock them.that to me was a big waste of time grinding since you werent able to switch things up to make it not so bad or beable to traverse area's easier if your having a hard time progressing if you like to play games like this by yourself.Now, if you were to come to me all that time ago and ask if this game was worth playing i would of given you a recommendation, but not now, not at all, in fact if you ask me now, im will and am going to tell you to put FireFall on your blacklist of games to stay away from.The reasons I would never recommend this game to anyone now are due to the Devs not listening to the community as well as any other issues which are listed below:Every major/minor update ends up knocking the graphics for the game up so that even low proformence computers cant even play anymore.i know very well about this issue since i used to play on a low end computer at 60Fps and now there are so many visual bugs let alone blooming graphics options that remove all of the visual content except for the HUD which is the only thing that stays, and has never been hotfixed even to this day since it started 2years ago.there is still an audio bug that persists that has been there since the CBT that was never fixed as well, which will show up 90% of the time during combat, and then there is the Stutter FPS issue that happens with the Visual bug tht has been there for 2 years and not fixed either.but here is the thing, even if none of these issues happen to you, your going to be seeing a game that has a player base the has decreased by about 43% give or take, because of all the technical problems, or the increased graphics, or the nerfs or buf with something....... and then after all of that and if you still want to play if nothing is going wrong, then the last thing about this game that really gets on my nerves is the fact that FireFall went from a fun Game back in the Beta's with a thriving community helping eachother  out with questing, and the enviromental objectives, to a heavy Cash shop Oriented F2P game that is mostly centered around PvP instead of just having fun.......Honestly with all of the issues that this game has had and the fact that the exisiting player base would rather slaughter each other in a battleground arena and not have fun in the enviromental world and make new friends all the time is what has made me and so many other players stop playing a game that was such a delightful concept.Not only is firefall not worth even trying, it dosen't even deserve any mention for awards let alone any awards even if it did get any			"

												Don't let my low hours fool you, I easily put over 500 hours into the beta that wasn't on steam. The beta was what got me into this game to begin with, the world was fun, different, and as dangerous as it was beautiful. movement was smooth and satisfying, and nothing could compare to fighting your way up the tallest mountain to find a wing pad to glide across the beautiful terrain.But everything changed after new management took over. The game is now a World of Warcraft like grind fest that just seems to fold into its own butt. Entire areas of the map are level restricted, and it takes so long to level up it's more rewarding to look at screenshots of the different areas than rather than work to unlock them. If you would like to see the game that made hundreds of thousands of players waste away their free time before the new management ruined the game the original dev has a petition going to gauge the interest in making the spirtual successor for the original firefall here: https://www.change.org/p/crixa-labs-make-ember-a-spiritual-successor-to-firefall?recruiter=562901777 "

												Firefall is nothing short of a beautiful mix between the FPS and MMORPG genres.Given a choice of 5 basic Battleframes (Assault, Engineer, Recon, Biotech, Dreadnaught), you are then dropped into a beautifully-designed post-apocalyptic Earth. As you progress throughout the world in-game, you will then take on all sorts of quests, ranging from high priority missions from the Accord High Command to menial tasks for random NPCs. Most of the missions might seem like your standard cookie-cutter ""Kill X creatures"" or ""Go to Point Y"" quests but don't let it fool you. Every quest is voice-acted and comes with a good storyline (especially those quest chains) to back it up. Upon reaching the current level cap of 40, you are then given 10 Pilot Tokens to further unlock ""specialized"" versions of the various basic Battleframes at no cost at all. For example, the HMG-toting (Heavy Machine Gun) Dreadnaught is the standard Heavy Battleframe with the right balance between offense and defense. There are additional variants of the Heavy Battleframes such as the heavily-fortified, PHMG-wielding (Plasma Heavy Machine Gun) walking fortress that is the Mammoth, or the slightly-less armored but extremely deadly Rhino Battlemech that packs a punch with his HLMG (Heavy Laser Machine Gun). Each Battleframe has a distinctive feel to it and one of Firefall's great qualities is the ability to switch Battleframes with utmost ease, ensuring that a character is able to play the various classes without the need to create a new character.Weapons and skills are what makes the classes and Firefall cuts no corners over here. Various weapons (primary and secondary) and skill modules can further be complemented by attaching weapon-ability and skill-ability modules tothem. Feel that your rare PHMG (Plasma Heavy Machine Gun) needs a higher rate of fire and magazine size? Feel free to choose from a wide range of Rate of Fire and Extended Magazine modules. Feel that your Shield Wall skill needs to last longer and have a shorter cooldown timer? Attach the modules that will increases your skill's rechange timer and skill duration. The list does indeed go on and on.Dynamic Events are also another one of Firefall's best areas. As you go about your daily life in-game, don't be surprised if a Melding Tornado (some kind of Tornado-looking portal that brings forth hostile NPCs) pops up nearby. Before you know it, you and many other players will be at the frontlines of the battle, trying to stem the tide of enemies coming at you while attempting to destroy the Tornado at the same time. Oh and that is only one of the many dynamic events. Enemy-led invasions of key installations (watchtowers) or even direct assaults on cities are also to be expected at random!Crafting is also present in this game, with acquired resources being used to craft a wide range of items such as Weapons, Battleframe Cores, Skill Modules, Enhancement Modules for your skills/weapons. Due to the fact that one character is able to put on many Battleframes, there certainly isn't a need for multiple characters. As a result, you will be able to craft every single thing there is to craft. That's right - EVERY SINGLE THING!The game uses 2 main forms of currency (Crystite and Credits) as well as 1 premium currency (Red Beans). Crystite is what you get as quest rewards, loot and the like and is used for repairing Battleframes, Crafting and purchasing items from NPCs. You are given the option to convert Crystite to Credits at the ratio of 25 Crystite : 1 Credit (capped at 25,000 Crystite or 1,000 Credits daily). Credits are the currency used on the marketplace in-game for trading and buying items from your fellow players. Red Beans are the premium currency which can be bought with Credits or real-world money and can be used to purchase items from the micro-transaction store.With a beautifully-rendered world, good solid gameplay, wide range of weapons and customization options, Firefall is no doubt one of the games I have enjoyed to date. It brings about the best of both the FPS and MMORPG worlds into one wonderful package. It being Free-To-Play is simply the icing on an extremely tasty cake.			"

												For a free-to-play shooter, Firefall isn't honestly that bad. So far I've been impressed and have been more into playing this than Advanced Warfare (I got both at the same time). The game is open world and full of things to do, giving the player hours of enjoyment. One thing that I love about the game is aesthetics, which most games (especially in the triple A industry) don't have. The colors green and blue are quite common. It's nice for some producers to understand that we don't all want maps or overworlds that are obliterated. A large undevastated world awaits people. I wouldn't say it'll make your jaw drop, but you'll notice some other colors in the world.The combat is a little wobbly with the game lagging or freezing for a brief moment. However, as long as your internet is decent and your computer can run the game semi-well then you shouldn't have an issue. Now, I mentioned AW for one reason. Both of these games involve vertical gameplay somewhat. AW you have the extra jump, and in this game you have a jumpjet (I call them jetpacks). It makes it fun when you need to avoid an enemy, so you jump around him like a queer fairy lighting him or them up. The combat is interesting, but quickly turns into a grind, as most mission involve you going to a location to kill something or escort, or rescue. But all of them involve you killing something.As for the pay system, it's overpriced. After a while I decided to look into some outfits. I picked out the Bandit eye goggles and the straw hat. 240 Red Bean total, or to put it in easy to understand term, $25. No, not going to happen. You can earn virtually everything in-game by grinding it, but it'll take some time.Overall it's a good game. 7/10 "

Boring.There was a really cool event with pushing melding front back for a limited amount of time, where is it now?There was more content and action in beta then in 'finished' game.			"

												Played the beta last year and quit because how boring and repetitive it was. Saw it was on Steam and decided to give it another shot. Seems in the year they changed a bunch of stuff but ultimately i still think its an absolute bore to play and way too damn repetitive. One would think being open world would make it fun, it doesnt. There is just no real clear sense of direction. Your running back and forth in each level range hub taking and completing quests from a job board. Also lets not forget to mention you have to level each frame (class) from 1-40 separately. EACH frame. Even the premium frames and i believe theres a total of 16 different frames. Now i know most peoples response to this is ""You have to level each class itself in other MMO's."" Well yes, thats true, but most often the quest line is different for each class, or at least parts of the questlines are different. Ultimately i just dont feel the game is worth investing any time or money into. Your better off looking elsewhere.			"

												It's alright but suffers from an intense lack of variety after level 8 (of 40) in each class you get your final ability and the rest of the game is spent doing the same thing over and over and over again. The end game raids are chaotic but the classes are all too independent and theres very little incentive to actually work together the ""instances"" are even worse there are only a few and theyre almost identical to the rest of the game. Theres little variety in environments and I'm not sure why the second area(of three) is supposedly in brazil when its clearly designed as a depiction of the American West, Overall the emphasis on gunplay and movement enhances the early game experience but by the late game starts feeling more repetitive than any other MMO combat model I've played(theres a reason most shooters are only a few hours long and rely heavily on prescripted events). In the end its alright but as with most MMOs unless you turn it into a social affair youll run out of enthusiasm for it long before the developers intended for you to. In the end I'll recommend it Just because its free though I wouldnt advise spending any money on it.			"

												I have spent a lot of time in the (long) Beta of Firefall before the official launch and have enjoyed the game always even though it has changed a great deal. The Red5 developers are good at listeing to feed back and fixing bugs - so please use the Firefall forums and in-game bug reporting to give your feedback and report bugs.Even though Firefall is now officially (July 15 2014) no longer Beta it still will be always getting better and Red5 will always be looking for your input I am sure.This is one of my favorite games. It has very low technical demands to run (my current system is from 2006 and still runs it fine), and the community of players is very supportive and helpful. Game play is great with lots of frenzied action and informal group play. You don't have to join an Army to have fun playing with others, and the dynamic randomly generated events give things to do for solo and group players both. There are things for you do to solo, and just as much if not a lot more to do with others.It's free - so try it out!			"

												Tried to play it, Netcode is so bad everything seems to jump around, cant blame my connection too much as I can play other action based MMOs with little trouble (wildstar being one of the newer ones) I live in australia so normally I am used to a little bit of lag but ahving every player/ npc rubberbanding everywhere is just bad.

												At the time of writing this my counter says I am at about 47 hours. However I have been playing this game since beta in about 2012. So when writing this review I want you to know that I have had some time with this game.For those of you that don't know, Firefall is an MMORPG/FPS with optional 3rd person view. (Nice to have both honestly.) In terms of look and feel its kinda like Halo and Crackdown had a baby then sent it to WoW School. You may read that last sentence and say ""but...I...how..."" Just trust me on this. A lot of gameplay will feel familiar and natural. Much of the mechanics will seem very familiar as well if you have ever played an MMO like WoW. One unique aspect is that each ""class"" is a wearable suit (called battleframe). Some are meant for getting up close and minigunning your enemies to pieces, others are more like snipers, picking off enemies from afar, still others are more utility like and meant for enhancing yourself or your team. Each frame levels up like a class would, but you don't have to roll another character to be a different ""class"". You simply change your frame. I like it because it means you don't have to roll alt characters and no need to worry about rebuilding rep or doing a bunch of pre reqs all over again. It's still your character that the people know and trust, you just changed your outfit. This may not apeal to people that are big into RP (something I do enjoy) but it's great when you don't have to grind everything all over again.So what else about this game? Well, If you've made it this far, lets jump into the pros and cons. Pros:- This game looks great! The art style is unique but awesome!- Combat takes skill, but isn't overcomplicated- Customization. While fairly limited, you don't usually feel like you look like everyone else.- There is always something to do! I mean this! Always something on your map that's relatively close. Usually it involves shooting things- It's not terribly grindy. Rarely was I sitting there going ""please just ping already....""- Free to play. Yep you don't even have to buy the base game, you can just download and give it a whirl!- Gun play with badassery. Yes you shoot things a lot. But you also get abilities that make each frame feel and play differently- Player base. The community has been really fun and friendly. It helps that the game isn't designed to be able to cast blame, but people genuinely want to work together to accomplish bigger things.- Its genuinely fun. It's not deep thinking fun. But run around with friends saving the world fun.Cons- It's small. They do a good job of making it feel big, and they have just added more content areas, but its sill kinda small.- Slightly glitchy. Overall, the game is really well polished, but occasionally there will be a glitch messes up your interface or send you trying to figure out a mission location for a half hour.- Free to Play. Yes, I said this as a pro, and its true.But you know why its bad. I will say it's definetly not pay to win, but that sweet paint job you want...$$$- Build timers. The crafting system is fairly in depth IMO, but its not instant unless you spend $$. Don't spend time building or researching at lower levels (you'll level too fast) and always try and keep something in the oven.- Limited starting frames. There are 5 base frames, all of which are viable, IMO. But you have to level up to get tokens in order to unlock more. Unless of course....$$$In summary, this really is a good, fun game that I feel like is starting to find it's stride. It's fun enough that it keeps pulling me back and I have a blast. Yes you have to throw down cash for certain things, but its a ""free"" game. And if you enjoy it you should be spending some money to support the game, especially if you are getting novelty items to go along with it. (BTW, if you do decide to pay, I recommend buying a DLC pack because you usually get more bang for your buck.) Hope to see you in game!TL;DRIt's a fun game that looks great and feels well polished and definetly unique. Its F2P but its not Pay to win. Good times to be had!			"

												Do you like Global Agenda? Borderlands? FPS? TPS? This is the game for you. You can play either in First person or Third, and both play smoothly.  The gameplay is wonderfull, its not overly hard like Global Agenda, but you will share your fair part in death.  The graphics play smoothly on any settings, yet on worst settings the game still looks... good, suprisingly, the paid for currency does not, I repeat DOES NOT, run this game, if you want the paid for currency, you can trade the normal currency in game to other players for it, most of the marketplace it completely run by the players, it is honestly a great game. Plenty of gameplay, open world, shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, randomly occuring missions that only take about 2-mins to complete but still reward you hansomly for it, and the leveling system... its sexy as hell, you can choose one of 5 main specilizations, Dreadnaught, Assault, Recon, Robotics, and Biotech, once you reach level 40 with one of these, you unlock the next teir class within that specilization, with an average of 3-4 different classes within each specilization.  The crafting system is complex, but simple at the same time, simply melt down some scrap gear, research some new gear, craft some new gear, and vwolia, it takes some time but thats all really, the drops in the game are pretty well ballanced, the gear for any class works well, no one class is better than another, only sad thing is, there is not a Melee based class/specilization, im looking forward to the game getting one... Among all these things the game does have some problems... the gameplay feels quite repetitive after some time, leveling a fame aside from the first one you chose is no fun what so ever, the story seems quite linear so far, hostiles are boring and reused, limited areas to explore, ect ect, past all of this it does it quite a long road ahead of it, it could get quite better. honestly go play the game yourself, but all in all i quite like the game, i hope it does improve though...  6.5/10			"

												This game has a lot of potential to be a great game, but it falls flat in many ways. For starters, from what i have seen the only way to unlock the character classes outside the basic few requires the premium currency, which there appears to be no way to earn in game, locking you out of over 10 different classes. Quests have you trek for stupidly long distances on foot, then take almost a minute to load the next objective for you after you get there (and the next objective is a mile away). The ""random"" encounters and events are very predictable and can be camped all day for an easy grind. Enemy movement seems very buggy, as they'll sometimes slide around at high speed, and other times walk normally. Weapons feel bad to use, just generic hitscan pew pew rifles and such. The game does look decent however (as long as you don't go off the beaten path, then you'll be greeted by low res textures that would've been disgusting even in the 90s), and the resource gathering and crafting are fairly enjoyable, but not enough to make up for the game's shortcomings. 3/10, such a shame.

												I am an alpha supporter and founder purchaser of this game, I have played this game straight from the main site itself hence why there is only 72 odd hours on steam. I have poured thousands of hours into this game. I am directly comparing the game now to what it was in the past. I love this game and cannot believe this has happened.The game is technically ""free to play"" but because of recent changes I cannot recommend it for anyone. Because of shifts in management and terrible desicions on implimentation of game mechanics, Firefall has changed wildly from what it used to be. Massive server wipes have claimed maps, items, abilities, and characters.Audio files over most of the game have been corrupted or completely wiped, this means sound effects are either gone or rarely work. Npcs were previously professionally voice acted, that is all gone now, and the few times things are voiced now it is done badly.Server lag is now rampant, along with huge numbers of glitches, and disconecting. Crafting was removed and the market as a result has been almost wiped out.Items, abilities, and frames players had were removed without compensation.Update: All the stuff above is still a large problem but some fixes have been introduced, the most noticable being the character models don't look like rag dolls anymore.I am still going to error on not recommending this for the time being because not enough has been fixed.FINAL UPDATE: IT IS OFFICIAL THE GAME HAS BEEN♥♥♥♥♥♥♥TO DEATH BY THE SUITS. THIS GAME IS NOW DEAD FOR REAL!!! DO NOT WASTE ANY TIME WITH GAME CAUSE ITS♥♥♥♥♥♥AND THERE IS NOW NO ONE LEFT WORKING ON IT!The only good reviews for this game are from when it was in beta and BEFORE the company was sold to souless ♥♥♥♥s in suits.The developers and administraters have all left to work on the game that this was SUPPOSED to be. So everyone forget about this game and go here to show your support for people who are actually trying to make a game for the PLAYERS and not just a money press for all the loyal fans.https://forums.emberthegame.com/- "

												So far the game seems good fun, definitely worth a spin. It is a bit grindie. Nevertheless it's a shooter/mmo and you do get some satisfaction on shooting at monsters and bandits/aliens.The questing stories while not the most original are still interesting and some will keep you pushing the game till high hours.The critics are way too harsh especially considering the lack of quality on mmo's you have out there.Truly free to play, no pay to win walls. Uses the same micro transaction system as Neverwinter Night.There is a lack of players on early zones and the learning curve is steep when it comes to all the functionalities.			"

												I played this for countless hours during the Beta, in which it wasnt available on steam. But it was still very fun and had alot of content coming in (and out) all the time. But to the points, or the pros and cons.Pros:-amazing campaign-Many new and old areas to explore from the beta-more content coming!-really nice graphics for a F2P-Fun community that is helpful and nice.-massive seamless areas! -random missions that appear out of nowhere.-alot of different classes and branches of those classes to get into (you can also go between any class at any time!!!Cons:-can be a bit empty and boring if your nto looking for something to do-some of us Beta players are stuck in the level 1-5 areas at start and we are levels 14-40-if you venture too far you probably will be decimated.But with all of that in mind, i'd give it a rating of 8.5/10. It is enjoyable but i miss some of the beta features. but oh well, its out and its great!!			"

I like to ride around the beach or desert area. (motorcycle is best part of this game :D). OST also good for fight or explore. Combat system well thinked and balanced. Story is interesting even main line or just little side quests.(HALO/WOW/Battlefront/Hellgate London mixed up nostalgic) I hope get more attention lately ... this game is deserved. "

												Pros: The combat still has an intuitive vibe to it still -meaning- the gameplay predominatly plays like an fps before anything else, creating a Tribes feel to it. It also has much more exploration due to larger content increases.Cons: The mechanics such as crafting are really simplified to the point where the only harvested minerals you recieve from crafting from lvl1-20 are basically raw earth, iron, tungston and crystite. There is a lot of traveling around which would disencourage lower leveled players; however there is a transit system.This iteration of the game is really casual; however, it still makes unique differences to clasical MMORPGS mechanics such as combat and travel. It lacks in complexity, making it easier to learn, but leaves the player empty because progression is slow and learning stops at a certain level of play. I would still recommend this game solely for it's combat. ie: jet boots mixed with gunplay. It makes the grind somewhat bearable at least to level 40 for one frame.			"

												This game, so far is very fun to play.  Your skill will dictate your progress and rewards.  Perhaps, your rewards more than your progress.  Sometimes, the two are inter-connected.  It's possible to be in the same place as another player experiencing the same objective.  Yet, because you didn't contribute as much to the battle, your experience will be lower. You'll recieve no reward.  In some cases you may not get anything.  This feature ends the idea of someone being carried by the team -""Riding on the shoulders of others.""You decide your level of involvement.  That being said, I can understand one's desire to level up to the max as swiftly as plausible.  Don't do that.  Take your time.  It's an open world game with much to do.  There's no reason to do everything as fast as possible.  You have to get your videogame foreplay on - Yeah, I said it!The game has bugs up the wazooo.  This is true.  What I've experienced are clipping into a rock and having myself auto suicide - not cool bro.  The other problems are weird interface bugs mostly tied to selecting items in a stats screen -Sometimes nothing works, WTF man?!When a game is fun you can tolerate a few bugs.  It remains to be seen of they will be fixed.  I hope that they are. I like the crafting system in the game. I also like how that system makes it feasible to make almost everything you have the option to purchase either via real money or in-game currency.  You don't have to pay to play or pay dominate the world. You can purchase a VIP membership that boosts your XP and other features but the game also gives you a free daily boost for 1 hour so that's sugoi.I hope that the world gets bigger and better because I really like it.  Did I mention that I really like the day and night cycles.  Somethings the atmosphere is very pretty.  Firefall is a very beatiful game.  Sometimes the view and the lighting can give, ""FarCry"" a run for it's money.  But then the character models in this game through me off a bit.  They look like poser models to me.  It's not that bad but it leaves me with a little, meh in my mind.   I know that a game like this is very challenging to make and maintain.  They did a good job despite some internal tumoil at the company.  As a designer, I know that this business is not a walk in the park.  It's hard work and you want to keep it fun.  If it's not, then what's the point of it all?  Money as creative impetus never lasts and it looks like they had fun making many parts of this game.Red5, you guys gotta get back to basics and have fun.  It's the only way that the world you have created will continue to florish.  It's paramount to make it the game that you want and hold on to it.  You can't be everything to everyone.  You can be everything to yourselves.			"

												This game has come such a long way in such a small amount of time- Red 5 has taken on adversity head on and triumphed. They have attempted many different things in their beta before setting in stone what they were finally going to do with Firefall, and the result of this approach has paid off.This game is the most addictive game I've played in years. And I'm likely going to play it for years to come.There's so much to do in the game- there's open world missions that just spawn in front of you, there is also a job board, there are instanced raids and quests, there are mini-encounters. There is open world PVP. Bikes to race with. Gliders. Did I mention jetpacks? With 16 battleframes to choose from, and more on the way, and the ability to customize each to your liking, there are unlimited ways to play the game, catering to a vast array of playstyles. I could say so much more, but really- just try it out. You have nothing to lose. The game is free.			"

												I've been playing this game for 2 years and 4 months and it came a long way. I can only pick a few games which developers have been so forth coming, talkative and able to listen to a community like ours (during beta). I could only name another few games that i've been involved in where we were so close to the developers, and they made it a point to roll with the community in terms of feedback and gave their interpretation to that feedback in a subsequent update.So you know about firefall right ? You can simply visit the store page for more information, but from what I've seen I can make a few  good points of this game.Progressing:You have about 16 battleframes to choose from. You can choose only a few if you're picky about your game style (as a support or, healer, sniper or tank), or you can choose to level up many of these frames and join in on the massive world in battles with the game style which you think is right for the specific battle at hand.Customizing,You can customize how you look ingame, (in the 24th century you can even change your sex, allong with the rest of the usual suspects, body/hair color, battleframe color, some logo's etc....Crafting,It's completely OPTIONAL!. You'll be able to just play because firefall is foremost a shooter first!. You'll earn new rewards as you just shoot away and do quests/missions. But if you want to specialize in certain craftmanships you can do it and make your awesome weapon, to use for yourself or to sell on the market!MarketFirefall has a market where - if you don't want to craft, or if you want to earn some money - you can rely on to get supplied. Dynamic content:You can literally wander in this vast world and do ares jobs/missions, then as you are doing your duties for the Accord, you stumble upon other dynamic adventures that you'll have to solve such as crashed objects that arrouse wildlife around it, coy transportation raiders, people being trapped, criminals on the run for the Accord and much much more.Global events, invasionsAnd if that's not enough, there are organized massive events in this game which take place from time to time and invite everyone to contribute to the global war against te... umm I mean the chosen!.In Firefall, you participate at your own level, sometimes in a squad, sometimes solo, sometimes in a hefty fight against a boss that will make your neck stiff. These titans will be for the hardest of the hardest (or so Nostromo says.. well at least I think he says that)You can travel the world on foot inbetween missions, or benefit from gliders and vehicles to soar high above the sky when you go on your adventure. Everything is possible. Now don't become chosen jawbones!			"

												This game has so many bugs, and so many shortcomings. It's also the most fun I've had in an MMO. I don't really even know how to describe this game. It's had a crazy long open beta, a lot of bad press, and an incredibly rough development. It still manages to be a unique diamond in the rough. I bet it will have a ton of bugs when it comes out on the 29th, but give it some time. This game is amazing despite adversity, and I have a feeling it's going to keep on getting better.			"

												Hey, guess what... Thats exactly what happens when you eject people off from early well received development, do a 720º loop and dont even know where to go anymore. Oh man i remember when this game got full support from the guys at the youtube channel called Extra Credits, simply showing how great the ideas were from a game developer point of view.I also remember the hype from seeing such cool looking concept arts of people thumping, fighting world bosses, driving insanely cool vehicles, doing stuff that actualy affected the WORLD MAP which was 99% open (well, actualy those 99% would translate on about 1% of how big the world was suposed to be).As witch doctor would say, ""it's about to pop"". Glad this is finally over tbh, having like 10 years to develop a game since 2006-7 is pretty bad enough already.			"

I have played many of the recent F2P MMOs and not F2P MMOs (excluding WoW because i love it so much) such as Guild Wars 2, Terra, Rift, Aion and such, and Firefall hooked me up so hard! The first time i played it (actually not the first, because i have 2 years old account and probably played the alpha in 2012 but forgot about that game until recently) i sinked like 2 hours in a row (not a lot of games can make me do that!!!)

												This game has so many bugs, and so many shortcomings. It's also the most fun I've had in an MMO. I don't really even know how to describe this game. It's had a crazy long open beta, a lot of bad press, and an incredibly rough development. It still manages to be a unique diamond in the rough. I bet it will have a ton of bugs when it comes out on the 29th, but give it some time. This game is amazing despite adversity, and I have a feeling it's going to keep on getting better.			"

												Once upon a time, long long ago....Sounds nice and familiar right? Not so with Firefall. This game is a far cry from what it was supposed to be. For all you veterans that go back to .6 days or earlier, I salute you and call you my digital brothers. .7 and .8 beta was the absolute prime of this game between the horizontal progression, thumping for materials (S3 that 999 copper!!) and the significant depth and customization of the crafting. Allllll....all of it gone. Listen folks, I stll enjoy the game because the story is fun and the world is still the same. Pick it up, play it through once and pretty much put it away for good. So may bugs in a ""lauched"" game. Butchered the lore. I was able to adjus to a level system and at first even got over the removal of thumping and resources. But the destruction of the crafting system, the audio never matching up to the cinematics, the laaaaaaa...a.aa...g....gggg. Oh and the fact it barely sees 200 poeple on the server...(s?) anymore shows how The9 has put this game in the ground. So long awesome gaming memories.Thank you for the hundreds of hours and great friends I was able to find online that I still game with today. I was one of the original Commander pack backers of this game and played it before it ever saw Steam. It 'was' worth it all. Now time to move on.I don't care about the hate I am going to get I full support Kern and Ember. Bring back the glory days of a successful open world shooter mmo.			"

It has been going downhill since the Steam release...I played this game since it was in the beta. (Had to get a new account though bc I forgot the user data and such :') Back then it was absolutely phenomenal - the community was one of the nicest and most helpful out there, every other update brought something new and even things like crafting and such were handled really nicely (Yeah, back then the crafting stuff wasn't disabled yet :I)Whenever you'd call down a thumper and somebody else happened to come by, they'd ask you if you need help and if denied, would just go on their way. Now, thumping is pretty much useless anyways because they removed 90% of the minerals available through it. Now, you either get ignored (bc it's useless), or some f**kers come along even if you tell them to beat it.It feels like every time you fire up the game now something stops working - from not really dramatic things like your camo, excuse me, Warpaint being the wrong color to actually game-breaking things like quests not starting or NPCs not spawning/ escort missions that won't register you finishing them etc.By now the game is kind of a hot mess and it's a shame really. I'm aware that R5 went through some financial trouble and ended up being bought up by the same Chinese company that has the WoW license over there (ask the Chinese WoW players how they feel about them) and that even before that, there just weren't a lot of devs left to even be able to patch out all of the bugs and glitches.I'm really saddened to see the game go in this state of affairs, since I thoroughly enjoyed the Beta and even here and there when it would work, I had fun playing the ""Steam/Public-Release"".But right now I'm not even sure if they're going to leave the game in limbo and just shut down the servers at some point or if they're going through with ""making it a mobile/console game"" like they explained in Red5's last ""News/Update"" post on the game's site. I've been told that until they figured out the legal stuff, the servers will remain online, kind of like in limbo. One of Red5's laid off employees (By the name of Robin) is the only one that's offering support for the now drastically cut down player base, and there are only one ""shard"" per game region left (which are all hosted from California).I re-downloaded this game to spend some more time in this world that I had such fond memories of, before they possibly shut down the servers for good. So right now, I can only recommend this game to long-time, passionate players (like the majority of people left) that just want to enjoy the remaining time this game will be accessible at all.			"

												ALMOST the perfect FPSMMO. The cel-shaded approach to this class-based shooter makes the game bloom with color and awe as you fight through a world where randomized events are constantly popping up. This game has everything, crafting, class-mechanic-diversity, dungeons, and random events. It's just one of those games you log into and suddenly it's 8 hours later. it's not perfect, there's some bugs and glitches that can be made more irritating by the lag, and if you stay too long in one place the randomized events can start to blend together as your brain zones out, but for a free to play this is worth every second you're in the mood to give to it! Here's a short little review I made for it over at Digital.Flash.Fire	  in case you wanted to take a look at it before you dive in!

												Don't waste your time or money on this game. Even if you do enjoy it, there is a game breaking glitch which has effectively killed it as early as level 10. You'll hit that in thirty minutes, easy. The mission Everything is Shadow is an instanced mission and from the looks of it they've shut down the servers for instance missions or some nonsense like that. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, do not bother with this game...Simple as that, really... If you're an old player who got pass this point, congrats. You can keep going... Maybe... But new players? You're out of luck.			"

												What made Firefall amazing was its uniqueness compaired to other mmo's out there. I am sorry to say that invision of firefall has been lost to the past. The game use to be a sandbox shooter, with interesting crafting, decent story, and a incentive to work as a group.The crafting system was complex and one of the reasons the game was unique. Depending on the quality and type of materials used, would change the quality and even the proformance of the item. It also had tons of unique resources to back up the crafting and a neat way to get those resources. That neat way was ""thumping"", that involved calling down a enormous mining drone called a ""thumper"", and protecting it while it mined. There where even clan thumpers that need 5 or more players to protect.For content there were missions all over the map and random spawning events. Through out the day there would be large events that would pull hundreds of players in to complete. Unlike most mmo's there was no ""quest system"", you leveled by just contributing in events, thumping, and missions. For story there was instanced dungeons that you would party up to complete.The classes and weapons in the game where also cool and unique. Most of them still are with some minor edits.Now to the game in its current state.The ""sandbox"" do what you want leveling system they had is gone. Replaced by a extremely bad questings system that is still has major bugs. Many players getting stuck at level 9 do to a bug.Crafting and resources have been completely removed.  Though there are still thumpers for mining there are no longer resources in the ground. Crafting is just gone, replace by a looting and reputation system.On top of all that, most if not all of the original dev team have either left or been fired. I have played over 600 hours in the game and still love this game. But in its current state that seams to only get worse by the update, I do not recommend anyone play this game. For anyone that remembers what the game once was, there is a project call Ember being made by Crixa one of the original devs. That is trying to make a game with the vision that firefall once was. If you care to see that game please show him some support.			"

I loved Firefall. I really, truly, did.But after years of changes, it's not the game it was.I have a lot of time in this game, a lot of memories from playing it. I leveled every frame to 40, kitted them all out. Crafted my own gear, got a full custom prefixed loadout on my Rhino, got supremely lucky and netted a pair of Celestial Wings. I met some really amazing people in Firefall, had a great time hanging out with my army in teamspeak.I joined when the game first came up on Steam, summer of 2012, after following the game since the first concept art appeard on the internet. The world was beautiful, the art and design bold and striking. The community was friendly and strong. The sounds were amazing. The distant pounding of a thumper, the crisp report of an assault rifle, the whine and hum of jetpacks. Movement was free and unconstrained. Jetpacks opened up a thousand possibilities for combat and exploration, gliders made for amazing screenshots and travel unlike anything else I'd seen.I played heavily for a year or so, then left once I'd reached endgame and the content had run out. I'd done all of the instances countless times, farmed Bane, Kana, WF, Miru when it came out, ground HC campaign tokens.I came back, years later, to a game which bore little resemblance to the one I'd left. More reminiscent of a Nexon MMO than the vibrant world I remembered, I didn't find any of the magic that pulled me into the game left. Countless changes had rendered hours of effort worthless, the community was virtually nonexistant. The game was more grind-oriented than I'd ever seen it. Most of the things that made the game stand out were gone or had been rendered irrelevant. Players who I'd run raids with had been offline for months. I played for a few hours here and there but it was pointless.I sincerely wish things had gone differently. This game remains one of my favorites. I may have joined after the golden age of the beta was over, but I still got a good bask in the sunset. Now, with the game seemingly dying, with devs being laid off and rumors of an impending server shutdowns looming large, there is little or no reason to start playing.This review is less of a review, more of a eulogy. There was a lot to love about Firefall. While it was up it was easy to stand back and hope for updates, roll my eyes at the changes. Now that Firefall is coming to an end, I have realized that I will miss it greatly when it leaves us for good.Goodbye, Red5. Goodbye, Firefall. "

Despite the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ polishing, tons of bugs and suicidal-quality updates I still wanted to come back and play some more. I even sorta liked that hated 1.6 and, hell, I admit, I sometimes want to reinstall it and give it another go, but... It's like beating a dead horse.It truly pains me to admit that the game is dead, buried by the very people who gave it life for some time. It pains me even more to give it thumbs down, but that's all it deserves in its current, absolutely deplorable state.See you on the other side, Firefall.			"

												The drama behind the scenes is affecting the game and the community. Game is ruined. 80% of the content has been removed from the game. When You hit max level....then...thats it. They also removed half the classes and perks so everyone more or less ends up the same. Crafting is gone, resource farming is gone there is absolutely nothing to do if that was your thing. The greed of the company trying to adapt a game for all platforms completely ruins gameplay. Instead of having one great platform game they end with less than mediocre multiplatform. If this game wasn't free to play, it would be long gone.			"

Quests are broken at numerous places, some of them just plain don't work.I gave them a month just to see if what I suspected was true, and several of the ""bugs"" are dark design patterns that go away once you subscribe.I really wish this game was run by competent executives, because it is not.

												This game is riddled with bugs.The current devs pulled content from the game, locking playable areas to a very limited 2 zones.They then rereleased an area as ""reworked"". Nothing works. Missions dont work, mobs tend to reset randomly, npcs spawn inside the terrain, and land objectives do as well.It is nearly impossible to progress in the game without doing the pvp arenas, which yield a small portion of your needed exp, because doing missions is impossible.

												I remember the good old days in the open beta. Firefall was so, soooo good. I was really hyped for it. Played in the open beta with a radeon hd 7770 (Which sucked♥♥♥♥♥ but ~30fps was good enough back then). After a while (2014) I upgraded my graphics card to gtx 750ti. I got back into firefall, which was on steam and loved it more, because of higher settings and ~60 fps. This was one of the best F2P games I played back in 2014-2015. I loved to level up and get new gear and unlock more classes. The quests were fun too. However, up-to-date basically the devs have abandoned the game. It's literally unplayable, because of no updates, bug fixes or maintenance. Such a sad ending for a very good game. That's the sole reason I wont recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Don't play it.To expand a bit more on why you shouldn't play this game, for starters the Dev Team abandoned the game. This means no more regular updates/bug fixes, events, etc. Because there is no dev team, the single person who is keeping the server up has kept the instance servers off. This means you can't progress through the main story after the first mission. This also means you cannot get your Advanced Frame after you hit level 20, so you are level capped at level 20. (could be 30, can't remember correctly)It really is sad because it's not a bad game by any means, in fact I think it's a great game, or used to be a great game. I don't see this game being brought back to life any time soon, and I wouldn't keep false hope on the game coming back.			"

												Once they got rid of the 5v5 PvP lobbies, the game became utter garbage.  Their excuse was to ""Focus on the PvE elements of the game"" and that they would eventually revisit PvP.  They did honor their word by introducing the PvP zone -- unfortunately it is and always has been utter trash to play.  There is nothing fun or rewarding about it.  This game will probably never be as good as it was when they had the team deathmatch games you could queue into -- they were fun, the game was surprisingly well balanced, and it was very competitive.  Could have had an enormous community surrounding it with all of the good they did with that particular portion of the game.  Unfortunately the PvE could never be good enough to replace what they've thrown away, so I suspect this game will just wallow in obscurity for the remainder of its life.There was so much potential early on...

												So many of you probably have heard of this sob story from every other reviewer but I am going to tell my story anyhow.I played this game since it went f2p in 2014, back then it was fun, fast paced and gave a sense of freedom that not many mmo's have delievered on. But since then it has gone down hill: the developers were fired, a new company that almost screwed over WOW is now in charge and the game has been left in a state which is frankly appauling. I gave this game up when this began to happen, I have fond memories of this game and I will continue to like this game as it was, not as what it has become.As for anyone who is looking for a good F2P MMO I unfortunately have to say that in that market most games are dead or dying. Firefall is just another game that was screwed over by buissness and greed, it falls into place with other games like Wildstar and Archage.If you want a good MMO, go sub to WOW, I have been playing it for a while and with legion it is great to get involved and join the great community.Hope this was helpful and I do feel sorry for anyone who missed out on this game back in its glory days.

												 I definately recommend this game for people who enjoy the Boarderlands games, its a 3rd person/first person shooter that has been stuck in beta for a while but it making huge strides with massive content upgrades and very interesting game mechanics including ""thumping"" for resources which is basically a massive drill you summong down from a dropship to mine resources from the area.  Firefall also intergrates an intricate drafting system dealing with your Battleframes. Try it out its Free to Play not pay to win.			"

												If you're looking for a new Shooter, a new RPG or a new MMO, I urge you to give this game a go... it's FREE so you have nothing to lose!I haven't been captivated by a game for such a long period of time since LoL. Like, LoL, this is a AAA quality FREE TO PLAY game. This game is funded through micro transactions in the form of cosmetic items for your character and small boosts to resources and experience. To be clear, it is by NO means pay to win.The up coming changes/updates to this game will take this to the next level. In addition, having the game on Steam will give New Eden (the world) a much needed transfusion of new players.Firefall has a fantastic community that has helped shape the game and it will show! See you in-game fellow Pilots! HUZZAH!			"

												The reason I'm down voting this game is that I constantly keep getting disconnected from the server and it's only ever in two places throughout the game - At the very start when I click ""enter mission"" or at the very end when I'm talking to the POI to finish the mission off. It really annoys me when it happens at the end. For some reason I keep all my rewards and gear from the ""finished"" mission, yet I have to do it again because the disconnection happened before it registered that I actually completed it :/I'm kinda disappointed. The gameplay and art style is something I would happily play for a good haul. If they ever fix said issues, I will gladly not move from my chair for a few months.			"

The devs were all fired and probably the only thing keeping the servers up is a contractual obligation.  Don't believe me?  Check the official forums.

												First off the game has no challenge.  It's basically a futuristic UPS simulator.  Run from point A to point B helping distraught family members over and over again.  There might be some fun to be had in the instances they offer.  Maybe there would be the slightest hint of a challenge there. The problem is you can't get into the instances.  They say your squad does not meet the requirements.. ok.. but what are the requirements? They never tell you.  Maybe they don't exist?  The devs removed PvP stating that it was too challenging for the player base.  This game is in alpha at best.  Don't waste your time.			"

												FREE TO PLAY done RIGHT!Most people talk about the grind of the game... yes, there is a grind. Name one MMO that does not have a grind of some fashion... go ahead... I'll wait... That's right, you can't! So while this game has a grind, it's a LOT more satisifying because of the gameplay itself. The fast paced, skill based shooter mechanics are wonderful and help keep the game entertaining. The people that complain about the ""grind to unlock advanced battleframes""... they are doing it wrong. Simple as that. While you can spend money to unlock them, or level up to Level 40 with each of the battleframes... you can also buy them off the Auction House with credits you earn in-game. ""BUT THAT IS A GRIND!"" ... not really! You get a mineral called Crystite that you can directly exchange for Credits. By the time you reach level 15, you can EASILY have enough credits to buy an advanced battleframe. Look under the ""Unlocks"" tab, they are typically 4-6k credits. At level 22, I have 18k credits. Sell what you dont need.... convert to credits... DONE! In half a day of playing, I have unlocked 4 advanced battleframes. You can also use Credits to buy ANYTHING that you could spend cash on. DO NOT LET PEOPLE FOOL YOU because they didnt see the information right in front of their eyes.Yes, questing consists of going to a Job Board, accepting a quest, and turning it back in. This can feel grindy, but remember... name an MMO that doesnt do this? The difference is that you also have world events going on almost 100% of the time. So jump in and help defend or attack a location. You don't even have to be there for the full encounter... just kill a few things and you will get FULL credit for completion.  Leveling is incredibly fast if you get into the habit of actually looking at what is going on in the world around you.The customization options in this game are AMAZING! You can freely switch the way you look, your battleframe's colors/patterns, your cosmetic gear, etc... at any of the ""New You"" stations or Battle Garage (located in every quest hub, city, and outpost. They are everywhere!You can spend money... or you can simply look at what the game has to offer... You can buy ANYTHING and EVERYTHING with in-game credits. You can sell EVERYTHING. And everytime you complete a Job Board quest, you get a token to take to a slot machine for bonus prizes... some of which are worth quite a bit!I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. This is game isn't perfect and it is not for everyone... but if you like fast paced shooters with an amazing open world and the ability to jump in and out of encounters, plus being rewarded for helping other players... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! "

												This review is 2 hours into game.What I dislike about most of modern day MMO is that getting past starting area is not as easy/fun as in WOW. I wish more games would take the approach in a way that atleast when I look at areas specially the newbie zones they be bit easy to traverse through - I kept on flying to timbaktu trying to get to the marker that my quest showed. Same reason i never liked WILDSTAR too the starting zones were just too confusing to my taste - ofcourse you are suppose to read the wall of text that follows the quest but most of us don't do that. I never really cared about lores or story really. The games should ease in player and then throw them into more complex terrains to traverse through later on.Maybe i just don't like steampunk/sci fi lores. Also early zones there is vast unexplored sea area but don't think you can go into deep waters.On flip side - gliding is fun till it lasts. Jetpacks is fun. Sniping was fun but you don't kill anything one shot even if they are well within your level range.And from looks of it this looks like Pay-2-Win or atleast make your life easy scenario - which is most of MMO these days. This doesn't appeal to me much. But I would like to say this is probably the better version of FPS/MMO genere out there. The review will be updated as I try it more.			"

												2 Years ago this was a decent game, now it is nothing but a big collection of bugs and crashes.My new Firefall experienceAfter logging in 4 times before it actually let me into the game i noticed that it had deleted all my stuff and my charecters, bit of a pain but whatever its not a terribly big deal.Get through the tutorial and start doing the startup missions, the ones that are required before you can do the open world aspect of the game; only the last part of the first begginer mission has a bad script. So me and the other 6 newbies that were there to do the mission just sit around trying to enter the mission area over and over again, then finally something different happens! The game flips out and logs 2 of us out of the game completely.Later i learned that they had removed the crafting system, they made 'thumping' obselete and 90% of the stuff that made the game unique had been removed. Oh and they made the 20 man 20 minute raids that used to be really poular absolutely worthless.It almost feels like they were trying to make the game fail.			"

												Horrendously underrated. FireFall is an addictive MMOFPS with a mixure of elements from Borderlands, Sanctum 2, an a little bit of Section 8, and while it doesn't deliver on the best aspect of each one, the way it meshes together is really great, and adds for a fun experience. The way people get together whenever a mission pops up, while not original (I heard Guild Wars 2 has a similar mechanic), is a blast, which raises it above other F2P MMOs, and the gun combat is engaging and satisfying. Progression feels genuine, and more often than not, FireFall does NOT feel like a free to play game, though there are times when it does lose that illusion, such as a store window popping up for ""red beans"" and cosmetic items.

												Been playing the Firefall beta for just about 3 years now, and it has certainly come a long way! When the closed beta first began, there was little more than instanced PvP on a single map, and Red 5 has slowly but surely fleshed out a MASSIVE and incredibly detailed game world full of activities and adventure.This is not your average shooter, nor is it your average MMO - but rather a truly sandbox world in which you are free to explore and tackle any activity you desire, whether that is completing missions from an ARES Job Board, roaming the world in search of wandering encounters, harvesting minerals while fighting off huge waves of enemies via the process of ""Thumping"", tackling campaign missions which help tell the story of the world around you, or jumping into a squad with friends and participating in some high level open-world PvP.Starting with the default 5 battleframe archetypes, you will gain access to advanced frames over time which fill more specialized roles. Your character can jump into any of your unlocked battleframes at any time, allowing you to change your playstyle to suit your mood or desired activity. You will level each battleframe individually (similar to leveling a character in a traditional MMO), finding, purchasing, or crafting gear along the way.There are 5 man instances (complete with a ""hardcore"" mode for high level characters), 20 man end-game raids, and as previously mentioned, a massive open-world PvP zone to explore.For fans of first-person or third-person shooters and action games, I highly recommend checking out the world of New Eden. It can be a bit daunting figuring out what to do at the start, but stick with it, and join an Army early on, so you always have people to play with. You'll be having a blast in no time!Good luck Ares 3-5.			"

												For those of you out there looking for a god MMOFPS this is not for you. This might as well be WoW with guns. Firefall is extremely grindy as it has moving from Point A to Point B doing mediocre, pointless quests. In the game your supposed to be a baddass soldier defending the last of humanity against an insurmountable enemy called The Chosen. And for atleast the tutorial part of the game it shows this pretty well. But immediately after the tutorial is over you become nothing but an errand boy. In a fact many missions simply have you passing letters or info to different NPCs, yep thats right. And in all the time i've played this game besides the tutorial I never once fought The Chosen not a single time didnt even see them on the map. And all the NPCs have stereo typical accents and extremely shallow personalities and you dont care about any of them. And like every other typical free-to-play it tries to ♥♥♥♥♥ out money by punishing those whose dont buy the deluxe version or buy ""Red Beans"" the ingame shop currency. For example if I wanted to get one of the Advanced Battleframes as they call it would have to either grind for dozens if not hundreds of hours doing repeated boring combat (It mostly consists of killing gangsters or bugs that is it) and quests all the while listening to completely forggetable NPCs. OR I could buy the battleframe for a  low price of 9.99$! The crafting system is mediocre at best and adds even another level of grinding onto it with you having to collect many various resources and components by either killing enemies or defend mobile mining equipment. Also even once you have all the ingredient you have to refine them which if you happen to have alot can take to upwards of an hour to do so. Then theres the research tree which is literally completely horizontal and can take literally days sometimes for higher tier stuff. Now the world while large and can be at times interesting is HORRIBLY textured unless your on the highest settings. But most of the time your to busy to notice anything about it as your constantly being shot at by enemies. And since the world is so large its hard to get from location to location. Each location you go to is usually on the other side of the map and there is no easy way to get there unless you take one of the ships you have to wait for. Which is pointless if your doing a quest as those have you 99% of the time running as far out into the forest to locations you've already been to. Now the weapon and abilities are probably the best aspect of the game as many of them can be quite satisfying at times. But the only reliable way to get them is through the god awful crafting and research system. I dont recommend this game to anyone you are far better off using your time to play something else. And as a person who played the beta for dozens of hours it pains me to say this game could've been something and those who also played will know what im talking about. But this game as it stands now is nothing but typical MMO that fell in line like most of the rest.			"

												I downloaded this game with good hopes, and when I finally started playing it, I lost all hope. This game is 8GB of glitches and bugs.     Most of the quests are simply walking from Point A to Point B, then killing either 5 People with spikes on thier heads and arms who were chosen for something, or killing 30 Crab-Bug things that spawn with different abilities such as the power to commit suicide and slow you down for all of 3 seconds, and usually there is a group of about 5 to 10 Able-Bodied soldiers with Guns and Armor more powerful than yours that are sitting there acting like a civillian and the quest says ""HELP them kill 30 Crab-Bug things"" yet if they do ever decide to move thier arms up to the gun that is mysteriously floating infront of them and KILL SOMETHING, IT DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THE QUEST THEREFORE IT ISN'T HELPING AT ALL! Half the time when you have to kill a large amount of things they barely spawn and when they do the soldiers decide to move thier arms up to the mysteriously floating gun infront of them and kill it before you do and then you don't get to make ANY progress towards the quest and it will take about 10 minutes just for the Crab-Bugs to respawn and then they kill them again and basically from there on it's basically the same thing over and over until you get enough kills to finish the quest, and then it's back to Point A (usually on the other side of whatever town your closest to) and then you get barely any EXP and it takes about 20 more quests like that to get to the next level. And that's just the questing system.    The main reason I even slightly wanted this game was because I heard my friends talking about Motorcycles and Hang Gliding and doing this thing called ""Thumping"" where they have to defend some sort of mining rig while waves of mobs are thrown at them. Hang Gliding was probably the best part of the game in my opinion, Except for when you even slightly look up your thrown at the ground and your hang glider gets destroyed. You can't even get a Motorcycle until level 25 or apparently if you buy some DLC then you can have it from the start, along with an infinite use Rainbow Hang Gliding Pad. Also, you can't hang glide unless you step on some sort of magic pad on the ground that gives you a hang glider. Did I mention it takes a couple hours of questing to level up?    Another problem I have with this game is the NPC's. The Soldiers will wander around dangerous areas and act like civillians, and the civillians will walk around safe areas acting like they are holding a gun whenever they aren't and acting like a soldier.    And also, the character customization is awesome! (No it's not) Everything is free! (No it's not) And everything totally doesn't require some form of VIP currency! (Yes it does)    I think you should take my advice and NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! IT IS NOT WORTH IT! IT IS VERY GLITCHY AND BUGGY! Unless they take a Hot Iron to the game and Iron out all the bugs, I'm never downloading it again.			"

												Firefall is a shooter FPS, or TPS if you so choose, MMO. I apparently only played two hours (and really, those hours felt a lot longer than that!), but that short time was enough to convince me that Firefall wasn’t the game for me. The overall quality isn’t that great, graphically the game isn’t impressive, the voice acting is atrocious, combat is basic, missions are repetitive and boring. Why bother then?My first gripe with Firefall falls on the graphics, and perhaps even more on the aesthetics. First off, the game isn’t that beautiful. It really isn’t. It might resemble Borderlands, but that’s just from far away. What really annoyed me was the character design, like World of Warcraft meets Gears of War or something, but with way uglier faces. Seriously, some of the guards in town barely have something resembling a human face.Trying to get into the mood of game is made further impossible by the horrendous voice acting. In the first mission, the tutorial mission, planes crash and pilots say something like “going down!”, etc. in the most bored tone possible. It’s right out of a MST3K or Riff Trax show, but while it might be fun for a short while, it will become cringe worthy since the plot of the missions comes in the form of audible conversations.Combat is completely uninteresting: there are enemies, shoot them. The problem is even more apparent when you have to deal with it during the missions. Go from point A to point B, fight monsters. Then fight another wave of monsters. And then a few other waves of the same exact monsters again. Rinse and repeat. How is this supposed to hold my attention? It’s not like there is any difficulty to it too!On a positive note, you can switch character classes easily, but each needs to be levelled up separately. Jet packs and glider wings are a nice way to get around but the world isn’t beautiful enough to go off exploring. It’s functional, nothing more.If some people find Borderlands boring, then Firefall must put them in a coma. And if you don’t find Borderlands boring, then continue playing it, because there is nothing to see here.			"

												For those of you out there looking for a god MMOFPS this is not for you. This might as well be WoW with guns. Firefall is extremely grindy as it has moving from Point A to Point B doing mediocre, pointless quests. In the game your supposed to be a baddass soldier defending the last of humanity against an insurmountable enemy called The Chosen. And for atleast the tutorial part of the game it shows this pretty well. But immediately after the tutorial is over you become nothing but an errand boy. In a fact many missions simply have you passing letters or info to different NPCs, yep thats right. And in all the time i've played this game besides the tutorial I never once fought The Chosen not a single time didnt even see them on the map. And all the NPCs have stereo typical accents and extremely shallow personalities and you dont care about any of them. And like every other typical free-to-play it tries to ♥♥♥♥♥ out money by punishing those whose dont buy the deluxe version or buy ""Red Beans"" the ingame shop currency. For example if I wanted to get one of the Advanced Battleframes as they call it would have to either grind for dozens if not hundreds of hours doing repeated boring combat (It mostly consists of killing gangsters or bugs that is it) and quests all the while listening to completely forggetable NPCs. OR I could buy the battleframe for a  low price of 9.99$! The crafting system is mediocre at best and adds even another level of grinding onto it with you having to collect many various resources and components by either killing enemies or defend mobile mining equipment. Also even once you have all the ingredient you have to refine them which if you happen to have alot can take to upwards of an hour to do so. Then theres the research tree which is literally completely horizontal and can take literally days sometimes for higher tier stuff. Now the world while large and can be at times interesting is HORRIBLY textured unless your on the highest settings. But most of the time your to busy to notice anything about it as your constantly being shot at by enemies. And since the world is so large its hard to get from location to location. Each location you go to is usually on the other side of the map and there is no easy way to get there unless you take one of the ships you have to wait for. Which is pointless if your doing a quest as those have you 99% of the time running as far out into the forest to locations you've already been to. Now the weapon and abilities are probably the best aspect of the game as many of them can be quite satisfying at times. But the only reliable way to get them is through the god awful crafting and research system. I dont recommend this game to anyone you are far better off using your time to play something else. And as a person who played the beta for dozens of hours it pains me to say this game could've been something and those who also played will know what im talking about. But this game as it stands now is nothing but typical MMO that fell in line like most of the rest.			"

												Played this game alot during it's closed and open beta, and I've gotta say they've changed alot of stuff since then. Alot of the changes are pretty nice too.  The beta was a glitchy, buggy, repetitve(thou still could/can be), and kinda boring due to not having any content in the game to be involved with).  Since my few hours or so playing on the steam release I do gotta say....thank god no more half pants battle thongs on my bastion battleframe chick! lol (you beta guys know what i'm talking about). Anyway, here's my pro's and con's so far for new players interested in Firefall...PROS:-Beautiful graphics and not too tolling on mid-grade computers-Action based combat system (no point and click)-Rewarding Dynamic Events-Simple crafting system (All depends on the person, some people like more complex crafting, I just find this one easy to learn and use.) (CRAFTABLE MOTORCYCLE AT LEVEL 25, AFTER DOING BOARD MISSION IN DREDGE CALLED ""In the Wheelhouse"" *hint hint*)-Guild Wars 2 style market system (trade in-game currency for cash-shop currency system)-Storyline/Personal mission progression added to the game since beta ( looks like they might develop more story later on)-Voice Acting for every mission and dynamic events (note: some of it is a bit amateur, but hey...i've heard worse in dubbed anime)-Leaching from squad thumpers don't hurt the thumper owner now-NO pay to win cash shop grabs; this one is an important one i look at when hopping into a free to play mmorpg. I'm a heavy pvper and the first thing i look at is, is the guy with the fatter wallet gonna kick my♥♥♥♥♥  This game avoids that 100%, everything in the cash shop is all cosmetic or getting cooler looking  and faster moving mounts and gliders and VIP boosts which just helps speed up leveling and crafting processes.-NO restrictions on free to play usersCONS:-Server stability could be a little better (we'll probly see some fixes for that soon; this could be due to busy servers)   exampes:  -occasional long loading time for missions  -occasional rubber banding -Gets repetitive at times-They are still working on balancing issues between battleframes for pvp-Farm heavy when focusing on crafting-Currency exchange: Red Beans(cash shop currency) can be bought with Credits(Marketplace currency) at a minimum of 100 Credits (Which doesn't bother me personally, but could have some more freedom on that depending on the playerbase economy)-3d modeling on characters could be better aswell as some of the cosmetic customization-Limited content compared to other mmo's (more content in the future i hope)-Able to unlock another battleframe only by getting a battleframe to level 40, using red beans, or buying the battleframe off the marketplace for a few thousand creditsThis is now my final review, now that i've put a good amount of time playing the released game.  I really enjoy this game personally and see much potential for it to develop into a bigger more grand mmo.  Keep in mind that this Pro's and Con's list was made for new players that haven't played beta. There are many things I miss from beta that I personally wish were still in the game, but who knows, maybe they'll add some stuff back in later. Anyway...I highly recomment this game, it's great for what it is. Especially if you're looking for a free to play game that doesn't restrict you heavily unless you got a fat wallet.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and please rate the review as you see fit.

												Horrendously underrated. FireFall is an addictive MMOFPS with a mixure of elements from Borderlands, Sanctum 2, an a little bit of Section 8, and while it doesn't deliver on the best aspect of each one, the way it meshes together is really great, and adds for a fun experience. The way people get together whenever a mission pops up, while not original (I heard Guild Wars 2 has a similar mechanic), is a blast, which raises it above other F2P MMOs, and the gun combat is engaging and satisfying. Progression feels genuine, and more often than not, FireFall does NOT feel like a free to play game, though there are times when it does lose that illusion, such as a store window popping up for ""red beans"" and cosmetic items.

												Even Defiance is better than this.  Generic and linear questing with poor, cartoon graphics and character models straight out of the 90's.  This game was created with a small budget that in the early days was mostly spent on hype, and even the extra funding and new direction hasn't saved it.  One to avoid.			"

												game lost all worth when it lost all multiplayer team based combat of any kind.word of advice: don't make a game without a plan or the courage/confidence to actually stick through a real idea.  But then again, if you DONT HAVE a real idea of your own and are living off the remnants of the dreams of games from the 90's, then you get FIREFALL as is.planetside 2 or warframe- still superior product: to a degree.

												This game is absolutly amazing, I have played games similar to it but none quite as good as Firefall, there's more freedom in it than the games I have played, and a better membership of players as well as if one of the servers goes down you simply go to another and wiat for taht server to come back up or jsut simply stay on that server, and with the ability to make addons for the game like let's say a interface that tracks your placed items health, it truly is quite a unique game.

												This game could have been a open world sandbox skill based shooter with Massive PVE battles, skillfull PVP, and amazing story. Then 0.5 happen an the skill aspect began to fate away, and then hackers began over running the PVP. Then they added 15 frames removing the ability to customize your frames, and adding a grindy unenojable progession system. Then the game just turned into a stupid AOE spamming party with 2 seconds CD on abilities that would last 6-10 seconds. Lasty we have this a game with feature that are all poorly designed, very grindy, boring instances, unbalanced PVP that full of hackers, and with zero sandbox elements because of the new leveling system forcing players to stay in area that fit there level an following the dull mission board story line. My best time playing this game was when they first added the chosen war system which made chosen come out of the melding, and take over watchtowers an towns. I would be heading to a town after gather materials thumbing an as i was heading back i would see a massive chosen platton just walk out of the melding, and starting capturing watchtower. Now chosen invasion are scripted events that happen ever so an so hours an weather you win them or not they don't affect anything. An the gameplay so boring, and easy now i can solo a Squad 3 thumber with max level enemies. When they first added thumber soloing a personal thumber was brutal most people could barely fill it to 50%, Now enemies would be lucky if the health of a squad 3 thumber that being defend by one player falls under 75%.Overall if you really want to enjoy this game beg the developers to reset the game to 0.4 or 0.5 (if you can stand the stupid poorly designed Tech tree progession) I personal liked 0.5 the most the tech tree was stupid, but the gameplay was great.

												To start these off I played since the 2nd wave of beta, I am a VET of this game. It does and was always suppose to play like a MMO Borderlands. But reading some of the other comments some people do not feel the same way, so Im giving my views on the key issues people are talking about below. I hope you all atleast try the game and judge it yourself not what I or some one else says.Well I played more then some of these most helpful reviews. I will be honest and will be fair I played sicne the 2nd beta wave. Since then I played 5 differnt games called firefall all were great some were better but this lastest one isnt bad. I like the levels give the game some direction (Some people may not like direction but it helps the most of us out imo). I love the new crafting system anyone seen the old one would of died trying to figure it out, sure some of the things have long research or build times just like ESO so log on put some thing on the cooker go to work come back bam its done! Yo umay want to plan ahead with the crafting system which some may see as a draw back but you dont have to afk  smelting like other mmos such as WoW. The class system, I have most of the classes but I do prefer the odler way of getting classes, but now you max a character then get a new one or farm one out with credits (In game currency) which isnt easy but isnt hard either after you do it amny time it may get old but take it slow enjoy the game dont rush it.You get a free Bike if you do the right quest I had seen compalints about it but if there giving them away (Mid/late game) dont complain about them selling to those who ""want"" it early game since they have a decent taxi systemj early game making bike not a need but a want. When you ""need"" a bike is when you get the quest for it. I enjoy the game so I told them to shut up and take my money but every one is differnt its worth a try.Hope you enjoyed mt review and I hope to see you al lin the world too!			"

												UPDATE:  Skip to the end for impressions on the new War in the Amazon content and faction changes.I'm coming up on 400 hours of gameplay in this fellow, so I suppose I should write a review of some sort.   Much has already been written about Firefall, and while I recommend the game to anyone looking for an action MMO, I almost feel like anything I say would hardly encapsulate the game because it is always changing and shifting (with a major endgame area to be debuted in the next few weeks after I write this).I suppose what most people want to know when reading user comments on this game is: is it actually free to  play or is it ""Freemium"" nonsense where the game is basically unplayable past a certain point without investing lots of money?  Well, I can definitely attest: this game really and truly is free to play.  There is no content behind paywalls and while real money can, in theory, buy you better in-game equipment and such, everything in the game can be obtained, in some manner, through gameplay.   Now, I won't lie....paying for the VIP membership is probably the smart course for a player who enjoys the game, but the game is not unplayable without it.  People who spend lots of real money for in-game currency to buy stuff off the player market will have an advantage in PvP, I won't lie, but as PvP is an entirely seperate part of the game, the PvE kinda benefits from having some people with purchased items.  Having said all that, here's my brief pros/cons rundown:Pros:-Interesting variations in gameplay and playstyle based on the class you choose.-The perk system allows interesting synergies between different classes since the different classes can actually share most of the perks that you earn from leveling.-The game only uses ONE character who has access to all of the class ""Frames"", which makes sharing equipment easier and helps with leveling frames that are around the same level.-The singleplayer ""jobs"" actually bother to try telling a coherent story about the setting and background of the game.-A healthy amount of open world content that gives players a break from just doing jobs to level their frames.-Once you complete major milestones in the game once (like unlocking new areas etc.) the stuff unlocks for your successive frames, so you have more freedom and options with your lower level frames as you get further into the game.-Large-scale open world events allow for fun, co-op play with other players without being too exclusionary for lower level or newer players (although there are some basic level limits on certain things).-The ability to ""thump"" (mine for your own crafting resources) adds an interesting, self-initiated activity to the game.-Players share exp and loot for open world events in a very fair manner and no one player can either take all the rewards or prevent other players from getting their rewards either.Cons:-The game balance, in terms of overall difficulty, is problematic at times and is always being tinkered with.  (as I write this, major updates to how combat functions are being planned probably to be implimented in the next month or two)-A fairly good chunk of the usual bugs and glitches that large, open world MMOs have.  Some are generally fixed fairly fast, while others have been around for ages without hope of being fixed any time soon.-Getting around the world can be awkward and slow even with vehicles and gliders and other assistance.  One entire section of the game (Sertao, the world for characters lvl 25-35) has no means of quick travel at all except to go back to the exit/entrance travel points.  -The ""advanced"" frames are sometimes very superior to the normal, free, counterparts, making the base frames a little on the weak or disadvantaged side.-The major server events do not happen with anywhere near enough frequency, in my opinion.  All major events at this point only occur once an hour which can sometimes make areas of the game very barren of content depending on the time of day.-Special open world content rated for single players is not even remotely able to be finished by solo players, and often requires several people.-The in-game crafting system, while very useful and functional for character up to about level 30-32 becomes so insanely grindy and impractical in the later game that there is almost no point in using it to supply characters above lvl 32 or so.-Some of the instances and special missions have serious issues with what kind of loot they reward.  This is slowly being improved, but right now it is often not worth the time it takes to do some of the more advanced, end-game instances and such.Like any MMO, there are players who take a lot of things about this way too seriously and will often have a negative effect on the overall community, but anyone who just wants to have fun taking out some bad guys and maybe joining some large-scale events will find a lot to like here.  Just be aware that a lot of content and features have been added to the game over a relatively short period of time, so things are always being tweaked and modified.  The community, in general, has been very positive and the strong focus on PvE means that most players understand the benefits of helping out each other.  If, however, you are looking for PvP, Firefall might not satisfy you much.  While the game has an entire world set aside for PvP, it suffers from a few major problems; mostly balance and the fact that not many people play in those areas.  PvP will probably undergo major changes as well in the coming months, but right now I cannot reccomend Firefall for people who want the PvP aspect as a strong element of the game.Damn...it's almost impossible to really get into everything in this game except to say: just give it a try for a bit and see what you think.  The community is usually pretty helpful and I always try my best to help out newer players.  There is also a strong ""mentor"" system in the game where players get appointed as mentors.  A few of the mentors are jerks, but they get weeded out pretty fast.Oh, and one more thing...the game is very playable with an Xbox controller (support for which is built-in) but you will have to fiddle with it to get it where you want it.  There are a lot of hot keys in the game and it's not possible to operate the entire game witn a controller, but the bulk of the game (running around and shooting things) can be done very well with a controller.UPDATED STUFF:  So, not long after I wrote this, Red 5 did indeed add the ""War in the Amazon"" content and a new faction system, which changes some aspects of my review.The Amazon is a new region of the game geared solely towards high-level, end-game characters (the game says it's only for level 40 players, but I think level 37+ could probably handle themselves OK)  It's difficult to describe the region if you are not already familiar with the game, but to summarize it, it's basically just a place for lvl 40 characters to go nuts because there's nearly constantly combat.  It's a lot of fun, but as usual, one of the downsides is that the rewards are not that great and you need a lot of people to take over the region.   The new faction system is amazing and gets rid of so much of the grind.  Instead of having to slowly earn faction currency to buy things, you now just permanently earn reputation and can buy things with crystite (which is the standard currency) when you reach the appropriate faction level.  No more spending days of your life just trying to buy some high level abilities or weapons.			"

												To the surprise of everyone who has ever previously heard about this game, what's left of Red 5 studios actually managed to turn this trainwreck around and make it into a good and complete game less then 8 months after the schitzophrenic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a CEO, Mark Kern, who was almost singlehandedly personally responsible for the game not making any development progress in 3 years of beta, was fired.Firefall now has coherent and consistant design, along with a truly massive increase in content. It's like a mashup of Borderlands and Planetside. Definitely worth playing, it's free after all.			"

												Been playing this game since closed beta, and like all closed beta things change. The game play is very addictive, and if you got money to drop, id say buy an advance frame (about 10dollars) once you figure out what basic frame you like. And go from there.This is a true FREE2PLAY game. You do not need to spend any money if you do not want to. But it helps the game thrive, if you do. Everything in the game can be bought off the market, including the RedBeans, (Real Money Currency). The leveling system is like most MMO minus you only have one character, and use battleframes which hold the levels on each frame.The crafting system is coming along, i would assume it will still being tweak after the 29th, but once you figure out salvaging, and research points, you will be crafting in no time.Firefall feels like a true living world, and a game. If you tried it during beta, i'd recommend you give it another shot. "

												The name is accurate now, for it fell, and it is most certainly burning.Ignore my hours, as I actually have played this game off-steam.Firefall is a game that has been plagued with bad decisions for some time now. Almost as long as it's been losing players, in fact. Slowly, but steadily, the game shifted from amazing me with its quality, to instead amazing me with just how terrible the devs could prove themselves to be. It's kind of like most shows on TV these days, with the only exception being that you don't come in with the expectation of it being terrible from the get-go.With the most recent update, the game finally stopped clinging onto mixed-quality limbo and dropped into the flaming pit of no return, screaming in agony with Electronic Arts, Activision, Ubisoft, Aeria Games, Nexon, and Perfect World Entertainment. Purchased by a Chinese company, Firefall was pressured into pushing out an update that wasn't even ready, and my goodness was it ever not ready. ""The update that killed Firefall"" as the community calls it, has essentially taken what little good there was left in the game and thrown it out the window. Or rather, that's what I would say, except they actually did that quite some time ago, so really what's going on here is they dragged the game back in, decided it wasn't dead enough, so they then drove a knife through its heart and threw it from the roof instead of the window, then finally ran out there with a hammer and hit it once, just to be sure. In one single update, this has gone from a good free to play title with a few flaws to ""how not to run an F2P 101"".No quality remains. You can salvage more from the debris of a nuclear apocalypse than you can from this game. The only thing between this game and death is the server being shut down. If you are a new player debating whether or not to play this game, I STRONGLY recommend you decide against it, for all you will be doing is wasting your bandwidth, harddrive space, and time. There are many other F2P games out there, and at this point, almost all of them are better than this.Even if you much prefer tormenting yourself with repetitive gameplay, bad design choices, and bugs, you'd still be better served with the latest CoD title instead. Because this game is so bad now, that even if you were - for some reason - wanting to play a game that was bad, you'd still feel that this was too terrible for you.			"

												Firefall. A name that means bugger all, yet is still easily insulted. Firefall is an FPSMMORPG and maybe some other letters of the alphabet with lyrics within songs that suspiciously remind of you of♥♥♥♥♥♥ What kind? ♥♥♥♥ed if I knew, the blue kind that comes out of Aranhas. The crab-like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s within this game. You could even add RTS genre if you were commanding the monsters against the worthless human scum-- Which sounds like a much better game.Anyway, Firefall is of a genre that even when abbreviated is longer than its actual full name. But at least games no longer have fifty seven digits after them, or enough colons to make a hard drive dry heave into the jet-blasters.Oh, right, Firefall. The story starts after everything interesting happened, where the terrans, no not those ones, discover a space rock, made a ship from it because they suddenly know what space rock does, And then smashed it into the planet for plot! Well, that's my guess at least. They don't really explain why the ship crashes into the earth. Either way you were hired to use gun on bandit. Possibly smash it in the face- which is actually a more viable strategy than the guns that might as well fire BB'S. Unless you're the assault where the BB's shatter. Though, there aren't really that many bandits, it's mostly the wildlife because that's suddenly more dangerous than human with gun.Actually, everyone whinges about these space f*cks that invade earth or whatever, but you never see them until about 10 hours in, or perhaps the story quests that you only have within the first area. But who cares about the story? Well, Me. The sole patrionist of Single player. Though the story is fun, I guess. But again, it's only in the first area, so there's nothing to interest you after the first area.Too many negatives! I need to put my smiley mask on and dance around this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥pretending to look I know what I'm doing, I mean until I find a good spot, like looking for carrot within vomi- I can't use that analogy because that's not hard to fin- OH I FOUND ONE! The class system is probably the best part of the game. There are five classes, 11 more that you can unlock either by dinging to level 40 with one class or using micro <Dry heave> micro transactions. ""But wait!"" I hear you say. ""I thought you were going to talk about the good parts?"" Oh,♥♥♥♥♥♥ right. Well, you can change class whenever you find a station. You essentially change clothes, but whatever ♥♥♥♥ing reason you forget all your old skills and abilities or whatever. You do keep all your crafting <dry heave> stuff. What is it with MMO's - Wait, with ANY game now days that includes crafting. You keep all your weapons too. Though for some stupid ♥♥♥♥offing reason you have limited inventory space eventhough you have to keep everything for every single class ever. And to finish the game 100% you have to play the game about 16 timesI've managed this long without mentioning Navi- I mean the Goddess- I mean cu- Oh f*ck it, Aero. It's your decision on whatever you call her. Perhaps a French/Russian Navi who likes reminding you how what a ""great job"" you did ""taking out that bandit camp"". F*ck off Navi, I was hiding in the corner sucking my thumb because I was an engineer who was only good for hiding behind his turret, and demanding it to do all the work.Though if you've ever played the game, you would be yelling at me that it is pretty. The game is split into three sections, Coral forest, Desert, volcano. You can already see where this is going, can't you? The game starts out beautiful, and then suddenly Brown. Brown everywhere! Like you mixed all your colours together and threw them against the monitor. I actually quite enjoyed Firefall in Coral forest. It had the story mission, beautiful areas, fun missions and you didn't want to hang every character you met.You then get to the second area which is a pain in my♥♥♥♥♥♥to navigate. You get a vehicle at the start of the area, which is nice, but what the f*ck is that going to do when the rest of the game mostly has canyons? There are also consumable glider pads which make navigation that much more fun from higher areas, but I swear the canyons were designed to be big enough for you to not be able to fly over. It is as if they do not want you to get to your destination. One town genuinely has been walled off so there's only one way in.So previously the game was in all the colours of the rainbow, which enjoyed dancing across the room, jumping into your eyes then f*cking your ear lobe. You then enter desert land, lava land with so much brown you would confuse it with a modern FPS. OH WAIT-- "

												A thin, empty, boring, and pointless game of go-there-kill-that in which the only goal seems to be progression for progression's sake; hit the next battleframe level and research the next weapon level, always for miniscule, uninteresting stat increases. I played across four different areas and reached level 11, and I think that's giving it more than a fair shake before declaring it DOA and uninstalling.There's a fairly solid platform here for a game, but right now that's all it is.  Let me know if they implement a reason to care.			"

												I can't get over how clean this game is. Everything seems incredibly accessible, tightly packed and gorgeous. A few UI hiccups and the normal MMO bugs like odd mob spawning and lag seem to be worked around so it's not too bad.I played a bit of closed beta so I'm glad to see this game finally released, I'll update my review after I get a few more levels and hours!*Edit* 17 hours in and I'm addicted. I've been craving an MMO and FF far exceeded my expectations. I wish it was a bit more FPS than MMO but I can't complain. For a f2p, this game is tight. Better than most current MMO's.*57 Hours Edit* Well I'm almost level cap and I'm excited to play a new class tomorrow for the actual launch. I'm thinking engineer but I want to hit 40 to get a pilot token and unlock Dragonfly.I'm upset there's hardly any low level pvp, and I'll give a new edit after I hit cap and kill other people. I'm excited, but almost 60 hours in and I'm almost level cap with the 25% bonus experience, I'm very sure that there's not enough choices when it comes to grinding to get to cap level without VIP status. So while I want to say it'd be an extra 20 hours of grinding, it's even worse than that, because there's hardly enough missions after level 20 to get to the next level appropriate zone even with the Exp Boost. You'll probably end up running around, looking for ARES missions, crashed lgvs/thumpers and tornados.Unless you just want to Thump all day with people. It's a damn good thing that's actually fun to do.			"

I certainly think they will fix it soon. Pretty large world and varieties of missions. But one thing is that the vehicles don't have many types. I think it only consists of a ranger and a bike.

												Pretty good game. Not for the lone wolf-type players. (usually). Seems to be, a little lack-luster in the concept-area (post-public-patch that is), but the ideas and concepts that are present prove quite satisfying. Me being terrible at everything FPS, this game is rough for me. Though some call this an ""RPGFPS,"" I would simply say it's an FPS with a decent story. Character customization is simple, but enjoyable. Not much -more- effort other than the option -to- customize your character is apparent at the moment. (a.k.a. no customizing hair under a particular hat you like, no customizing your ""undersuit"" that goes under your Battleframe). Not deeply customizeable, yet as I said, the options available have been of amiable satisfaction to me. Enough to enjoy the game.In all sincerity, do NOT approach this game as a die-hard FPS. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This game was not INTENDED to be a die-hard FPS. For those of you that have those split-second reaction-speeds and superior reaction times, this game might be a bit of a breeze for you.Most importantly, this game is STRONGLY based on community. Something I LOVE about this game. It's the only real reason I can/come back to, this game. Alot of good players on this game that enjoy both investing themselves, as much as helping others.My rating on a scale of 1-to-5?2. (maybe 2.5)Most definitely worth playing. Maybe even worth a couple of bucks to buy some fun in-game material.(This rating is opinion-based, and comes strongly from the stand-point of an RPG player. Not an FPS player).			"

												Not interested in a full review? Well here you go: This game is awesome, one of the best developers (if not the best). Can't see any pay-to-win either. Is pretty grindy, but hey, it's an MMO. Just try it.I've been in beta for nearly 2 years. This game was in beta for an eternity, because Red 5 actually wanted to release a good game, not like many others today, releasing half-finished/broken games.Nearly every game system/mechanic has been overhauled a dozen times, which, in my oppinion, shows, that they really want to find the best systems for this game.The developers really listen to the community and are overall just awesome.The game itself has awesome graphics, has a customizable UI and allows UI addons.The story itself seems solid so far, but further episodes are not out yet. Most of the missions are replayable instances which are actually really fun. They also feature hardcore modes with all enemies at the maximum level.The level cap is set at 40, though there are 16 frames (which are kind of like classes) that all have to be levelled individually. To earn experience you either do the mission instances, ARES Jobs/mission which are comparable to repeatable quests in many MMORPGs, do open world events or thump. I'd recommend getting some friends in, since higher quality thumpers (for better resources) and high level ARES Jobs are pretty hard.What is thumping? It's basically mining. You call down a thumper which attracts enemies and has to be defended by you. Once it's full you recall it and get resources, which are used for crafting.Crafting is one of the major aspects in this game. It's one of the ways to acquire better gear. You can also rely on drops, but it will probably take quite some time to find, what you're looking for.The areas are vastly different, you will encounter pretty much everything from frozen to desert, with according enemies.If you're ever bored, just go around and explore the world.The nice thing is: You can go nearly everywhere on the map, no matter the level. You will probably be dying a lot in the high level areas, but it's not all about levels... if you are good at the game, you can also handle high level enemies. It's skill-dependent up to a certain degree.The movement is also very unique in Firefall. You can walk and run, of course, but there are also Light and Medium Ground Vehicles to transport you faster. You have jumpjets, which are like jetpacks. You have enough energy to go about 3 seconds into the air, but it quickly recharges. This system allows for advanced movement. Another way to move around the world are ""gliders"", which will launch you a few meters in the air and give you temporary wings, allowing you to glide through the air. If you want to go from one major town to another, you can also use the Dropships, which are free. Just enter them and wait to arrive at your destination. You can also directly teleport, but that (at least right now) costs a ridiculous amount of money.There are 5 different types of frames, each with 3 (one with 4) different frames.-Assault, which is focused on mobility and damage. The primary damage is a type of plasma cannon, firing a ball of energy, which explodes on impact.-Biotech, the healer/poison class, has different primary weapons, depeding on the frame you choose-Dreadnaught. Tanky Machine gun dudes. One of the frames has many different weapons, from shotguns over SMGs to Assault Rifles.-Engineer, which has a short ranged laser/tesla gun. Supported by his own placed turrets. Can also deploy health/ammo stations, making him a supportive guy.-Recon. Sniper. Depeding on the frame, you can have an auto-sniper or charge rifle.But just because the Biotech for example can heal, that doesn't mean that you don't deal damage, every frame can also survive alone, if the player has some skill, but grouping up is of course more effective.If you like supporting others but are afraid that you can't play alone - don't be afraid, you can. Also, you can always group up with some random people around the world.Each frame type has the ""basic"" frame and 2 or 3 advanced versions. Once you hit level 40, you can unlock another frame. The advanced frames have some advantages, making them mandatory, if you wanna go all out on Firefall, but if you just want to play it casually, you don't have to do it - the advanced frames are not even 1.5x stronger than the basic ones.As I just said, if you wanna go all out, you'll have to use the advanced ones, because levelling frames will unlock new perks. Perks are passive abilites which you can equip. Perks cost a certain amount of points, depeding on their tier. You have a limited amount of points which depends on your level, so you have to choose the perks that fit your playstyle/frame best.Each frame also has 3 skills plus one HKM. The skills are only limited by cooldown and cover nearly everything. Place turrets, heal teammates, poison enemies, burn them, shoot stuff at them, get more defense, etc.HKMs are kind of like ultimates. They have to charge up (by doing damage) and deal massive damage or provide a massive buff.The game has a marketplace, where you can buy and sell cosmetics, pets (which have no effect), gear and even Red Beans (real-money currency)! Some people may argue, that it's pay to win, because you can buy good gear with real money, but it can also be obtained by playing the game and as stated before, gear/level isn't everything. You also need skill.Also the launcher is quite notable - it uses none (in the Steam version)! It actually updates itself via the Steam-update-system! There are not many MMOs out there which do that...There is also Open World PvP, but I haven't tried it yet. If requested, I will add few lines about that. The ""problem"" with it is, that it's not really balanced, so people of level 40 will have a major advantage over low level players, making open world PvP a type of endgame content.Raid bosses are also available at level 40, but since I'm not at that level yet, I can't review those.Overall an exceptional game, with many unique mechanics.The early levels may be kind of boring, but for me it got more fun, the higher level I got.Now for the bad things. The ARES Jobs are all pretty similar and repetitive, consisting of much running around and can be pretty tough at higher levels, if done solo. Also there are some bugs, but I haven't encountered anything game breaking yet.If you dislike repetitive questing/grinding* until you reach the level cap, don't like dynamic events or different/unique gameplay Firefall is most likely not the game for you.*There are many ways to earn experience, but the most consistent and thus fastest for most players are the repetitive ARES Jobs, or instances which will probably get boring if you do them over and overWanna know how fast you can reach the level cap? 50-90 hours, depending on skill, playstyle, solo/group, boosts and such stuff. But after reaching the level cap you still need the perfect gear, of course... and levelling the other 15 frames.The first ten levels will take probably 5 hours10-20 my guess is 10-20 hours20-30 I'd estimate around 20-30 hours30-40 will need 40 or more hoursThese times are assuming that you're new and don't have boosts or anything.P.S: It's probably even faster now, since they increased the spawn rate of dynamic events and rewards for ARES Jobs.If you have newbish questions about the game, there are many guides on Steam. The official forums have some nice information as well (you might also want to visit them to get some addons). And finally there are ""mentors"" ingame, people who volunteered to help by answering questions. You can spot them by the green leaf in front of their name.Anything I forgot? Want more details on something? Let me know!			"

												Firefall... It's a mix of 'whoa' and 'eeh' kind of game. I can't quite describe it with precise word, but that's how I feel. I, for one, quite liking the lore. They even have timeline tree and a comic series to give you insight why the world you are in is a FUBAR.- The gameplay isn't really bad. It's like what you expected. Guns, someone died, loot.- The currency system is well thought out, you can't be a poor guy, because currencies are interchangable.- The quests... It's uuh... pile of mess, to put it kindly. I hate that random events on the street.- The leveling system. After you go to the top level (40), you can replay all that mission from level 1 with new frame. Nuh-uh. NOPE. NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY I'll retrace myself from the first quest. It's not called grinding, it's called a chore, almost slavery.The reason I still give it thumbs up because I (maybe you) really enjoyed the first half of the journey. After level 25, the novelty is gone.			"

												Firefall is the MMO worth playing. It is free to play. You do not have to pay to win, but I would advise a player to at least  buy a glider and bike for traveling purposes. While you can get both without having to pay, it is worth the early investment for time.  I use the glider probably as much or more than the bike. The advanced frames (classes)are unlocked by maxing your level on the regular ones, or you can buy a new frame with the in-game currency. Most real money expenses come from cosmetics an short xp buffs. You don't need them to do well. The classes are all useful in one way or another. The ""Thumping"" in the game is very enjoyable. Thumping is a way of mining, which is basically a ""Protect this drill and kill everything that tries to eat it"" game. There are invasions where the enemy Chosen will try to take over a city. There are real consequences if you let them do that (no access to quests/vendors in the area until it is retaken). The storyline is also worth looking into; it will enrich the traveling and questing experience.			"

												If you have ever played Global Agenda then you must try this. Firefall is everything and more we wanted from GA. and for the rest of you which have not played GA. if you like OPEN world freedom, in this game the sky is the limit. FPS or TPS shooter with a very sound and improving dynamics of gameplay. Crafting/ Refining/ Research... it has it all. open world instancing and an open party system make aiding a player rewarding not for just them but you get a portion of the turn in as well. even though you werent there from the start... you get a lil thank you for your aid. it is free to play once it launches on the 29th. I have been in game since closed beta and i can say it has come a very long way. Red5 does, for sure, know what there doing and listened to there comunity. please check this game out.			"

												Great idea, badly executed.Sadly due to the many changes and the long development, nothing feels really finished. And it seems they have rushed the game out because they ran out of money.Guns feel weak, enemies are simple and there's a lot of noticable delays. Game doesn't look that great either, though it's not bad looking.Can't recommend this to any one.			"

												ive been with this game since beta. it has pretty much only gotten worse more grindy enemies more bullet spungy.its like playing borderlands with a full crew enemies have too much health and your weapons dont level fast enough. in addition to that they kept changing the leveling system every few months so whenever i decided to give the game another chance i had to restart my characters even after leaving bets. no i have levels but none of the things that would normally get me those levels and items ive had just dissapeared whenever they changed something.  honesty it just doesnt feel good to play anymore. it was functional to begin with and ok to play not too grindy boring or anything and then it went down hill.

												I've been playing Firefall since early closed beta. Its a game I keep coming back to even after other games have distracted me and then lost my interest. Firefall is uniquely brilliant, and some of the most fun I've had in a shooter.The game is free. Totally free! It supports itself through sales of cosmetics in various forms and convenience, almost all of which can also be acquired with in-game currency on the marketplace. There is no Pay2Win here at all!It's a beautiful world to explore and you will love the sheer amount of mobility you have. There are dropships, ground vehicles, gliders and jetboots/packs to cover all of your terrain traversal needs!I cannot recommend this game highly enough!			"

												I highly recommend this game. It gives a thought of a beautiful place, the music, THE GUITAR, naw bruh, I'm kidding but still, this game is definitely good to play with. Experience whole new different places that you have never seen before! Live a life out there, fly by guiders, futuristic because of the outfits and gears, villages.... The nostalgic <:) perhaps I spelt it wrong.....  It's like living in nature, having competitions between different players, some maybe rhetorical or repetitive but do missions and continue storylines..... Storylines are interesting to follow for most people which I believe and MANY MORE!!!!! That is why I believe this game should be recommended to all because it gives nature experiences basically. But it all depends on opinions, opinion dependent. :DDDD			"

												This is a fantastic MMO. I love it. Rather than telling you about abstract qualities however, I'll just give an example of play. So this is what happened to me. I began in a richly detailed and populated city wearing a BattleFrame. I moved over to a terminal and got a mission from the local post-apocalyptic authority to help find a lost girl. I moved over to a glider-pad, was launched into the air and with a sonic-boom was projected forward with wings extended. I glided (under my own direction) down to a ridgeline before arriving at a bug-infested canyon. I proceeded to blast and grenade my way to gory victory by engaging in both horizontal and vertical combat before my ‘operator’ told me to start looking inside the bugs for the girl’s genetic material. Awesome. With no genetic material found (she had not been eaten), I was directed over the hill in search of her SIN ID. That was went I came across another player managing a Thumper (basically a piece of mining equipment). She was holding off scores of bandits trying to steal her stuff. Back to back we fought, dropping goons all around us while exchanging instructions and words of encouragement. Achievement and experience were flashing before us as we looted the looters. Nothing was stolen or claimed and everything was fair. Finally, with a cinematic boost, the Thumper launched into the air and I was rewarded. She thanked me before I continued my mission. I found the lost girl, finally, who had simply run away from home. As the mission was random (or at least I think it was) she happened to be in the middle of a nest. The ground erupted around us and the fighting began, as I struggled to save her. Turns out a convoy was being attacked nearby too so the result was a three-way firefight that got even more complicated when a team of three other players turned up. The gun-play was amazing and everyone had a great time fighting off the staggering number of critters that were involved. That was when I returned to base and began crafting. Let’s just say that the fun continued long after this.The graphics are amazing, the quests are dynamic, the gameplay is solid and the community is supportive. Seriously, buy this game now.     "

												I started Firefall up for the first time and accidentally spent 6 hours on it. At the lower levels levelling up isn't too much of a grind, especially if you end up wading into a few fights above your level. The game looks good, the environment is interesting and makes you want to explore a bit and so far the 'jobs' or objectives I've been doing have been holding my attention. You get a bit of backstory about the world you're in with most of the jobs, which is nice. You pick up knowledge about the world you're in as you go along.Fighting the chosen (the bad guys) can feel a little overwhelming and frustrating as, if there aren't many players around you can get swamped pretty quickly, but the other players seem happy to get stuck in when they see another player in need, whether is't with a swarm of critters or a platoon of chosen. Decent bit of fun for no cost. Also, you can dance.			"

Currently the game is NOT PAY TO WIN. It seems to generate money off Boosts and cosmectic items. Very good so far. Some stuttering and audio issues when going into new zones are of course always going to happen in these big MMOS.Pros:Tons of different classes to playNot Pay to winCosmectic item buying onlyGliding is pretty funCombat system is really fun. Guns have different abilities. Some can aim down and some have cool power attacksLeveling up system makes you feel as if you actually achieved something.Intro mission throws you in at the deep end and let's you have fun.Cons: Seperate currency which you can't get for cosmectic itemsCan't login with steam account YouTube Video + Review, Many points raised with Gameplay  "

												Ah Firefall, I remember my time with you. It was a pretty sweet ride while it lasted but it's painfully obvious now that the fun is over. What was once a fun ,albiet glitchy, but nonetheless worthwhile game simply degraded into a failed sandbox shooter with MMO elements. I recall the time and effort I but into this game expecting to feel that all my hard work had payed off. Leveled 2 of my best frames to the max, taking every single minor detail into account to maximize both for whatever endgame had to offer. Hell I even cracked and spent 60 bucks to get a limited edition pack at a fraction of it's intended price to get acces to all frames available and a nice in game vehicle.But then I noticed that there was generallly less and less of what I expected and wanted of this game there. The main story involved has a very open ended conclusion to expand on but they just left it on the backburner. The noticeable grind to get other frames up to stuff, let alone to aquire them with packs or purchases was a pain. And the glitches still persisted and flourishes without any form of workaround or patch. But I think the final nail in the coffin for me was the fact that the other areas outside of the main story area had little to offer except for side quests. No expansion or real improvement to make it feel like you came a long way aside from arguable tougher enemies. So I uninstalled and left everything behind. From what I'm hearing about the last update I was better off with it anyway. A true shame that something with so much potential can just die from such trivial if not avoidable things. Ultimately if your new to this game and wanna give it a try, take it with a grain of salt.			"

												I've been in Firefall for a while. Been interested in it since the infamous presentation at 2011 PAX. Not too long after that, I got in Closed Beta in one of first invitation waves.The game really had potential. Unfortunately, throughout 2012 and 2013 there were some catastrophically bad decisions that were implemented in game. I've completely lost interest in it, so I took a break in 2013 and rarely would check up on it.I've tried it again now that its officialy out, and I've gotta say: I'm amazed. They have completely turned the game around. It finally feels good, the design and mechanics make sense and are fun. It finally feels like it did over 2 years ago, and it feels good.Firefall is definitely one of best F2P games out there at this moment.			"

It does have a bit of bugs here and there but other that that its an awesome game. I recommend this game if you like open world 3rd person shooters and want the online community their with you. You can make friends or play the game alone like me. Its really fun in the best ways.			"

Now this latest version just killed it all, thumping only gets you crystite, grinding gets you killed, it just went downhill so fast.Please bring back the FF we know and love.			"

												I've been in Firefall for a while. Been interested in it since the infamous presentation at 2011 PAX. Not too long after that, I got in Closed Beta in one of first invitation waves.The game really had potential. Unfortunately, throughout 2012 and 2013 there were some catastrophically bad decisions that were implemented in game. I've completely lost interest in it, so I took a break in 2013 and rarely would check up on it.I've tried it again now that its officialy out, and I've gotta say: I'm amazed. They have completely turned the game around. It finally feels good, the design and mechanics make sense and are fun. It finally feels like it did over 2 years ago, and it feels good.Firefall is definitely one of best F2P games out there at this moment.			"

												So I skipped out on my beta invite for this game because it came around the same time as the release of a game I was more interested in, and forgot about it shortly thereafter. In hindsight I partially regret it because there were obviously perks for being an active beta participant.. but then again, a lot has changed as the game seemed to have been way different back then. That said, I'm a poor judge to point out any pros and cons between the two but regardless, I do very much like how it is now.My personal impression of the game is that it is a lot like Borderlands in terms of the overall setting, environment and combat. The main difference of course being that this game offers a large open world instead of party based instances. Anyone familiar with MMOs in general should know what that entails to.. but to make things interesting, the game features dynamic events around the world which anyone and everyone can participate in to haul in some extra rewards during whatever it is you're doing at the time. Not to say that this has never been done before in an MMO but Firefall in specific does wear it quite well.Really, if you need to know more you can easily look it up yourself or just give it a try as the game is free-to-play. Which instantly brings up the popular question if it's 'P2W' on which I would argue that it isn't. This because there's no real major advantage for spending real money and everything can be acquired through in-game methods. If that's not enough, the 'IRL' currency can also be bought with in-game currency so the only thing gained by paying is saving some time. If you consider that a win, that's your own prerogative.Anyway, I definitely recommend giving this game a try as I think it's great and would love to see it get the success it so deserves. If you like the Borderlands setting as much as I do, you'll most probably like it. ..if not, one may also compare it to Planetside or as some people have mentioned.. Halo. The team working on the game, the so-called Rangers are great as I myself just now had a swift and pleasant experience in receiving some support. That in itself did not influence my opinion of the game, but it was the incentive that got to me to writing this. Cheers to Red 5 Studios.			"

												You know, I haven't played this for too terribly long but here is a first impressions. It is similar to Desiny and Defiance combined. This game has a lot of potential. Thay being said, most of it is just that, potential. You can't go underwater which is disappointing, it feels like there isn't enough loot at all, even trash loot to scavenge or sell, and I don't even think you can just sell it but the salvaging system helps that. Also, you have to build or pay for a one use vehicle that disappears. Considering the distances you travel, it'd be better if it stayed with you. It did a lot of things right though.There is a decent crafting system from what I can tell, the salvaging system seems legit, being able to mine resources is awesome, decent gunplay and adding jetpacks (even if they are lacking) and having such a huge world. Now if only it was filled more with creatures that just roam around.In conclusion, i'd try it, but i wouldn't blame anyone for not liking it			"

												So far this game is one of the best blends of a FPS and MMO that I have seen. The Dev's are on the ball, listen to player feedback, are constantly adding new features and content, and actively particiapte in the community - including special events where the dev's play as the bad guys in a fun PvP/E mashup. There is crafting, progression, and end game currently, and it looks like it's only going to get better from here.It does have some negative points, but most of them are either being worked on by the dev's currently (engame content, PvP,etc), are being planned to be workd on (crafting, repetitiveness, etc.), or are a matter of personal taste.

Check out Em-8ER if you want to see the spiritual successor to the game when it was good.This was the best game I have ever played in beta stages, solid 10/10.  My girlfriend even loved it(what a blessing)!!!Then the patches happened.  They removed the best working parts of the game and changed the progression system in favor of lazy people.  Now, I can honestly say that the first timer Unity games that are released on here are a better choice.Sure it is free to play, but it is currently a waste of your time.  I played this for over 400 hours according to my other game launcher, most of which is before I merged it to my steam.			"

												Note:  I have played this game far more than my steam hours show ( I am surprised it shows any at all since I rarely launch through steam).This game is a flawed and incomplete masterpiece.This is a third person shooter / online rpg that does a great job at making interesting classes, an incredible job of creating a world that feels ""alive"", and an exceptionally fair f2p model.  You will want to play through the areas again and again with your lower levelled classes, as they are all enjoyable.  The world is overflowing with events, and though standard questing has been added it can be ignored in favor of endless events (thank goodness, because the questing kinda stinks).  I have never felt pressured to spend money, though I have (once, on a good deal for a respawnable glider).  All classes can be unlocked by levelling your other classes, and the in game currency can be exchanged for the premium currency.The game is beautiful, bringing a vibrant outlined look with a sci fi setting that somehow feels right.  Inspirations from the Tribes series are seen in the jetpacks, the art design, and the class design.  The music is similarly beautiful, particularly the ambient synth tracks and the mournful piano melody.  Sound brings the same excellence in quality, though occassional bugs have me hearing an object producing static instead of the intended effect.For the problems, though, which do exist;- the game continues to have bugs.  It is a large game, so it is to be expected, but I feel like they should be worked on some more.- the game used to have very limited content.  This has since been expanded with more events, more zones, the main storyline, and the quest system... but the storyline and quest system kind of stink.  As such you will likely find yourself focusing on doing the event missions over and over, and even though the missions are random and will have different enemies and objectives, they will take place in the same locations.- the grind.  With one of the (many) revamps of the game mechanics, the focus was changed from crafting focus to levelling focus.  To get the most out of your frame, you will need to level up several frames.  Right now it seems to me like the perks you get for levelling frames are not so powerful as to force you to level them all, but are still coming off as rewarding.  Others may feel differently.- slow updates.  The game does not seem to have enough people working on it to pump out updates at the pace of.. pretty much any other game.  I assume this is because of their overly generous f2p model, which basically lets people have the game without spending a cent.  Maybe I will stop being part of the problem and spend a little more on it.- finally, it must be said that the developers of this game have completely revamped the game many times.  Now that they consider the game ""released"" I do think it is less likely that we will see another complete rework of the game, but it is worth noting that there have been some extreme changes several times since the game became playable.To wrap it up, this is an amazing game that I think must be played.  It is the type of game that you fall in love with and then end up resenting for not being as incredible as it could have been.  Just do not forget that it is still pretty incredible even with the shortfalls it has.  If you ever thought Tribes would make a good PvE game, or thought that a shooter could make a good MMO, you need to try this game.  If you just like co op, you should try this game.  If you like open worlds with tons of events, you should try this game.  Really, give it a shot already, the whole thing is free.			"

												I played this game back in Alpha and Beta.   To be completely honest i did not find it entertaining fully understanding that it was still being developed.  After a few months of some patches and fixes i got back into it, to see how things were.  It had got a little bit better.  I found myself with nothing to do, this was in early 2014.  So I waited practically a year now and decided to give it a whirl again.  I knew there had been many major updates and over hauls.  From then till now.Then.  I couldnt play it.  Idea was great the game played great, but lacked content and drive.Now.  I cant stop playing.  in the last two weeks just launching from steam i put in 80 hours and loving it.  Thats is not including the non steam hours i put into it.Take backs.Too many complaints about the crafting and resource system made them simplify things.   Major Bummer in my opinion.  The old crafting system was Very Complex and had a strong learning curve.  That particular feature was great.Too many babies that didnt want to put in the effort made them simplify it.  8 year olds can craft now.  In the beginning there were loads of kids playing.  Im talking whiney, moany, suckin on the teets babies.  The Matureaty level for the players was UGH.  Not even joking.  Hated it.But ill tell you what.  Since all the changes Us older folk have been able to appreciate the progress that this game has gone through.  It is very playable and entertaiing now.  All i can simply say is try it.  Its free to play, and if you dont like it you dont have to play it.  put in about 20 hours or so  get a feel for it.  Then make ur decision.			"

												I had been playing Firefall for about 2 years in Closed and Open Beta before it came to Steam.  In that time a lot has changed.  I used to think the game was beautiful before I upgraded my video card.  Now I can't believe my eyes.  I used to like the fact that the playable world was big.  Now it's more than 4 times as big.  I used to get a kick out of going from missions to mining to dynamic world events to watchtower defense to full-scale invasions because I could play for hours on end without doing the same thing twice.  Now there is so much to do that I haven't even done it all.With a single character you can trade out at any time between 16 different battleframes (basically different classes), focusing on whatever playstyle you choose at that moment.  If you're not sure what to do, then just go do anything; it all gives xp, it all gives loot, it all gives currency.  If you really have no idea, there are job boards in every town with a variety of short missions.  If you don't feel like doing anything in particular, just explore.  The scenery is gorgeous and varied, the music is incredible (I once spent several minutes sitting at the login screen just listening to a favorite track), and the community is generally talkative and quite helpful besides.Mix all that in with a rich storyline from Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game), and you have a winner.  Also, there are 2 things I almost forgot to mention; first, every frame has jumpjets and access to gliders.  From a mobility/travel standpoint, this is pretty big.  Every time I go back to Borderlands, I find myself wishing I had a jetpack.  You really do miss it when you don't have it.  Second, this is the most Free-To-Play F2P game I have ever played.  99.9% of what's in the game can be obtained with in-game currency.  As for the other 0.1% (which mainly consists of the larger vehicles), it has been confirmed that most of it will be available for crafting with in-game currency in a future update.  You never have to spend a dime on this game to be competitive (or pretty).All in all, this was my favorite game of the past couple years, and one of the best and best-looking MMO's that I've ever played.  Definitely worth your time.			"

												So Last time I posted a positive review.  You can see it here http://pastebin.com/Apz8Myfd but now I am doing a huge 180 based on highly opinionated reasons.I've played since closed beta and have trudged through the hell that everyone has talked about with optimism.  I can still play the game as is how I have been doing it (which is the wrong way) but that is beside the point.  With the recent sacking of the original developers--multiple times--enough is enough.There is no real point to compare a game from beta to present, especially one that has gone through major changes as much as this one has.  One before official launch, and I can't count the in between because I refuse to do so, and the Devil's Edge update...all fundementally erasing previous gamestyles to the point of re-learning the game.Yes the Beta was great, I'm a huge Tribes 2 fan....that is why I played in the beta.  Over the course of the years, the game became less skill and more easy-to-button-spam kill--which is why with the last recent update I went ""screw this, I'm just gonna use the melee weapons they gave us--ps...it was fun to do that.That melee only challenge is still something I can do in this game as is...as a pet project.The truth of the matter is what has happened.  Red5 may have a controversal history that even I don't know much about--nor really care--but the recent event of them all getting sacked is the final straw for me.  I will be optimistic for Red5, but the publishers and multiple developers that keep forcing them to make a game they didn't want has to stop.  This ALMOST happened with my favourite game (Guns of Icarus Online), so I happen to kinda understand the hell developers have with the game and publishers who just want money...Sorry FireFall, you were a great concept, but it's time to finish your grave.

												sadly i fell in love with this game when i started playing before 1.6 update.it was awesome that i had 5 battleframes to play (all we get is one charecter before 1.6), so i played how i wanted with my friends.missions had random spawn points, you could take the same mission and do it in diferent places.you had to level a battleframe to max to get point for a premium battleframe.it was fun to fight the brontodon king, it was hard to kill and as a world boss it was needed many players to kill it.soo many other good things like crafting, thumpers and events.all is gone now, no more joy to start the game, a bug in the remake of the game made me get all premium frames with out any work, the brontodon king is weak and predictable,and no one fears it any more, i would die 20 times during BK now it looks like he does'nt wanna kill you.crafting is gone, thumper only gives money and helps to load an world event that is too easy to even care.missions are not random anymore, are more linear and boring... why would i keep playing firefall? no more level up to get frames, level up to get stronger? i dont even know my char anymore, firefall was alive, now its just a zombie...

												What to say about this... First of all, I am... Sad, truly and deeply sad. I was one of the first 500 in the game, and was a commander tier backer. The 100 dollar tier.I would play this nearly every day before it was even on steam, for many hours. It kept me entertained, kept me coming back... Then, the money nation attacked, of course. Capitalism is a tool for improvement, but when you care too much about the money, and not enough about your product, it becomes the bringer of ruin. The Chosen have won here, men. Humanity has fallen, and our battleframes are all broken. Godspeed you magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. In retrospect, I had a hell of a lot of fun with this, it was new and interesting when things were still actively being developed, of course. The game had... So, so much promise. So very much promise that it could be something absolutely wonderful, and for a time... It was. Now, however? It's gone. May we find a brighter future for humanity.Commander MalachiteMG signing off.

												Ah Firefall, I remember my time with you. It was a pretty sweet ride while it lasted but it's painfully obvious now that the fun is over. What was once a fun ,albiet glitchy, but nonetheless worthwhile game simply degraded into a failed sandbox shooter with MMO elements. I recall the time and effort I but into this game expecting to feel that all my hard work had payed off. Leveled 2 of my best frames to the max, taking every single minor detail into account to maximize both for whatever endgame had to offer. Hell I even cracked and spent 60 bucks to get a limited edition pack at a fraction of it's intended price to get acces to all frames available and a nice in game vehicle.But then I noticed that there was generallly less and less of what I expected and wanted of this game there. The main story involved has a very open ended conclusion to expand on but they just left it on the backburner. The noticeable grind to get other frames up to stuff, let alone to aquire them with packs or purchases was a pain. And the glitches still persisted and flourishes without any form of workaround or patch. But I think the final nail in the coffin for me was the fact that the other areas outside of the main story area had little to offer except for side quests. No expansion or real improvement to make it feel like you came a long way aside from arguable tougher enemies. So I uninstalled and left everything behind. From what I'm hearing about the last update I was better off with it anyway. A true shame that something with so much potential can just die from such trivial if not avoidable things. Ultimately if your new to this game and wanna give it a try, take it with a grain of salt.			"

												ever since the devs released the last big patch, the game has been broken and seemingly without any support. The playerbase seems to be non-existant and the bugs are more horrible than ever. I would have recommended this game in the beginning of the year when things sort of worked and crafting was still in. The devs don't seem to care for the PC community any more and only release minor patches that literally do nothing. Don't waste your HD space or internet for this game, nothing but NPCs populate the wastelands.			"

												I used to play this game a lot, it was fun to just ride from one side of the entire map to the other. I then had a break to play some other games and came back to something i can only describe as a bug-fest. After the 50th try to login i finally got into the game, i had to do the basic tutorial again which is fair enough. However, after the jumping tutorial the first basic mission i had didn't even let me start and so the rest of the game wasn't even playable. Because of this i decided to just run around for a bit and i was still plagued with bugs, sinking into the floor every few steps. So unless red 5 gets all thier♥♥♥♥♥♥together, don't play it.			"

												 I started in the Closed beta years ago. Before It was put on steam i had hundreds of hours into this with a big group of friends and I. That is until the directors attacked. Used to be actual free roam going where you want when you want. Now it's level based... They took a game that was perfect and we loved it. It's all I ever played. Then they just♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it. Making it the same as every other action MMO out there. It has nothing special anymore. Most of us old firefall players will be moving to Em8er. They accept your firefall founder status there.			"

												TL;DR: Firefall was once a great great game, still have some great 3d combat mechanics with the jetpacks and dinamic fights, but since the launch been suffering and right now is slowly dying with a incomplete story and no dev team working on it.Played this game a lot during the beta, awesome, wasn't really a story wasn't a problem, it was pretty awesome and dinamic combat mechanics, crafting and resources mechanics too (""thumping"" or using giantic drill to mine the ground after resources and defend that machinary till the ""thumping"" end was one of the main mechanics and really fun to do, while rewarding too as you would use those resources to craft new better gear), the game was just incredible to play with friends no matter how simple some aspects would be.It wad a really really long beta (years), with more than a few changes since the start, right on the launch a lot of the game was changed a LOT, more like modern MMORPG, same cenario and story based on it, not bad, but pretty diferent and weird to play after being used to the old way, went away for a long time and about 2-3 years after tried again for missing the dinamic combat and the fun of thumping. I went back and played for a few months before getting bored and dropign it.The combat is still pretty fun, dinamic and awesome, and the storyline isn't great but it's good enough (for while it last, somewere on the way to the end at mid of the last map avaible now, the story mission just stop and leave you hanging with a lot of just presented and unanswer questions around), mostly sad the crafting is gone right now, with a promisse of getting back maybe in the future, but leaving getting gear limited to doing the side repetable (random) missions and daily stuff, what also made thumping pretty useless except for getting fast exp, as right now it only give money instead of resources. So around the end the game become just grind for gear and level other classes running around doing ""dinamic events"" like stuff or repetable missions, the only real endgame being 2 or 3 raids and time to time some big event that as far as I've seen and hear from other people playing for longer usualy break and stop happening for weeks till the devs fix it.As a side short info about the dev studio, Red 5 was once a great studio with great ideas, the beta went between hell and heaven cause their old kinda crazy (not in a good way) lead, but they someway worked hard to make things work and the game be great. As I could dig later when I started playing again, somewere between that moment and now almost all of the original staff were fired or leaved Red 5, and last year all Red 5 dev team was been fired with no one being on it since.

												I am not someone who writes reviews or complains about anything really. But I believe everyone deserves to know (especially those of you who are looking for a new game to get into), that this game will die. (Trust me, I'm not being dramatic)The direction the developers have taken has completely ruined a once brilliant piece of work(In my opinion one of the best games that was available). It was a masterpiece that checked all the boxes any respective action MMORPG player desired.The community was once vibrant and could only praise the staff for their efforts.I think we all have experienced or atleast seen this exact behaviour in a game studio, where the upper echelon skews the creative vision of the game, this could be due to many factors and predominantly in the F2P world it is financial struggle.Some players say if they bring back the old systems that they will return. Thing is the devs won't bring it back and the players would not play concurrently or at all even if they did as the player base in now tainted, if they decided to make such an extreme change as removing crafting and focusing on real money purchases over content, chances are they trying to recuperate funds. This could very well be their swan song.Dissapointing. "

Also game is now very buggy, so repeating quests, because something stopped working as it should is on daily basis. Only way of to short the travel time, the LGV, that is awarded from quest In The Wheelhouse, also available AFTER you get on level 25, is currently broken and its not working, so no speed up for you. Also, taken from theirs website """"In the Wheelhouse"" - not receiving a blueprint -> We are currently investigating this"" posted on Jul 15. So their are investigating it to todays day (20 days so far). The dynamic events are boring after time aswell, because its always ""Do the same thing in different location."" I really dont recommend this game, because its fun maybe like for firsth few hours before you get bored.			"

												I really want to reccomend this game, but I simply can't. At first it felt like this awesome new MMO, with all sorts of pretty areas to explore, cool designs on the character models and intresting weapons to use. But after that, you get to the gameplay, which I can only describe as boring. Basic ""run over here and kill 10 enemies"" quests over and over again without variation. Walking to the quest areas is chore itself. They arent simply a couple feet away from the safe area, the quest areas are generally 500 to 1000ft away! With the only mobility being the glider at the safe area, you still gotta walk all the way back! Very little fun to be had with this game.But it's not a pay to win game, i'll give it that.			"

												Firefall is a fun game to play, when you're actually playing it. When you're wandering around the world aimlessly or waiting for quests to load or when you run out of jet fuel right before you get over the top of a mountain, it's a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Firefall has had a massively troubled development history and basically seems to have been pressured by the investors to release the game in an unfinished state.So, the game feels unfinished. The content is for the most part monotonous and lacking much in the way of imagination. Things that were good about the game in beta have been butchered and new players without stacks of prior resources are going to have a ROUGH time levelling up their first character.The basic mechanics behind the game are rock solid and it's great moving around and shooting things. Unfortunately every recent change they've made has gotten in the way of doing this and I can't really recommend trying with it until they do some MAJOR (and I mean major) fixes. I enjoy playing it, but I wouldn't wish it on a new person without the same resources as I had having played the game during its Beta.			"

												Almost a good game. I played it quite a bit for over a week and thought this would be my new main mmo. I level my Recon class to level 12 and decide to pony up some cash for a game I was enjoying to buy one of the advanced Recon battleframes, the Nighthawk. I do this only to find that YOU do not level, your battleframes do and an advanced frame starts over from one. So a week and a half of playing only to go back and start missions over from 1 in the starting area. No game designer in their right minds should think that is a fluid, intuitive or acceptable form of progression. I've never left a bad review for a game in my life but this design just blew me away at how ridiculous it was. It's disrespectful to the time and money I invested in the game. I will not start over while playing the same base class, that is ridiculous. Uninstalling.			"

												I initially played Firefall because I was intrigued by its premise...but I was unfortunately unamused by the execution.  Standard gameplay largely consists of being tasked to go to a place, shoot at things, then go to other places to shoot at things until you return to the place you started.  Often these tasks consist of multiple jaunts of 400+ meters of travel and all this running quickly becomes dull even with the jetpack your character is supplied with (The jets are primarily for upward mobility rather than lateral movement).  While there do exist ways to expedite the time involved in travel by way of gliders and temporary vehicles (With, as I understand it, permanent vehicles available at level 25?  Apologies if I'm wrong in this regard as I was unable to keep motivated to play to that point).I personally experienced combat as the Engineer frame and was rather unimpressed with it overall.  The frame's primary weapon is a dual purpose beam weapon that can damage enemies or repair friendly structures, but I found myself having to expend 60% or more of my weapon's ammunition on targets on a fairly consistent basis in spite of receiving weapon upgrades at a fairly decent pace.  This was made more unfortunate by the fact that you can only carry a maximum of four full reloads for your primary weapon and this led to me mainly using my secondary weapon.  The engineer frame starts out with a shotgun as a secondary and I just found the weapon outright appalling.  I found that I had to pretty much be point blank and dead center on a target to deal a worthwhile amount of damage to any enemy.  Later I switched to using an SMG as a secondary weapon.  It had better accuracy at range but I quickly found myself having to reload its 65 round magazine multiple times to deal with enemies of equal level using an SMG that was of my level.  The saving grace to these secondary weapons is that your ammunition for them is infinite...but in practice they seem to be rather weak in utility.I can't speak for later game but the game rather quickly lost my interest early in, and if a game cannot hold interest through the early stages that speaks of a considerable flaw with it as a whole.  As it stands now I cannot recommend that you spend a considerable amount of time playing Firefall, though if you simply have some time to kill and space on your hard drive you could do far worse.If nothing else, give the game a few months to get on its feet before making any real investments on it.

Levels don't matter, you need to make enough currency (which is extremely slow to get, even at low levels) or do it the quick way with real money to get different armors which mean different skills. I saw probably about 10 different people in that time which isn't great considering the game just launched. There's no reason to play with others that I saw in the early levels.			"

												Very, Very buggy. Glitches that sometimes prevent you from advancing further in the mission, major graphical glitches and Pay 2 Win. The community can be helpful at times but it is extremely fanboyish, even if you point out a bug they instantly turn hostileCrafting is complex and a pain, by the time you get the needed supplies for a item you have researched (crafting is in 4 stages, collecting raw materials, Refining, Researching Then Manufacturing said item) you have already passed the level where it becomes useful.The Marketplace is also overly complex and not helpful, there is no tutorial to help you for it and it goes something like this; To sell an item you need to create a sell order for said item so someone can pick the order up and purchase the item for credits (the player currency) or you could fill in a buy order where the person who wants to buy something puts in a order for someone selling to fill it (no one ever creates legitimate buy orders that is not spam like 500 of 1 item for 1 credit)There is no fast way to travel early in game unless you want to spend some money IRL to buy a permenant vehicle so the only way you can travel without reaching level 25 (which takes roughly 30 hours of pure gameplay for a new player) or using 1 use, bad vehicles which you have a chance to get from slot machines is to buy one of the games packages for XX amount of 'Red Beans' which is a currency you buy with real money to purchase just about anything, even advanced versions of the default classes for 100 beans each, which of course, is a rip off.You can convert Crystite (a material you get from refining, killing, doing missions etc etc but you use for crafting) into credits for 1:25 which is only useful to use in end game when you are making too much Crystite or have no use for it as you have researched everything you need. However there is a conversion max you can do each day (i believe it is 1000 however im not sure) and the same you can do for Red Beans however it is much more credits to convert for a single Red Bean.You can buy 'pilots licenses' from the marketplace which gives you access to the advanced classes that you can purchase with credits however it costs roughly 2000 credits for a single license on average as they do fluctuate which adds up to roughly 50,000 Crystite!Please note this review is not complete and I did not have sufficent time to complete it all in one sitting, I will add more to it in further detail at a later date			"

												This game used to be fun, circa 2014.  Now, it's just a mess of a game that has gone in a very strange direction.  It's almost like the Devs can see the inevitable sinking and are just purposely blowing the ballast on it so that it goes under and they can move on to other projects that much faster.The newest overhaul just didn't make any sense.  I logged in after not having played for awhile and was completely lost.  Where did my lvl 40 frames go?  Where were my resources?  What is happening?Play it because it's free, but I wouldn't spend money on it.  Firefall is the Titanic, and the latest major update was the iceberg.  It's taking on water fast.			"

												Fun yet boring...The game is setup pretty well at first glance. Good environment, good background story, nice praphics and a very good soundtrack. And when you start playing for your first couple of hours the game feels very good as well and seems to be a lto ot fun. That is until you've played a while, have hit level 15 or so and see the repeting of missions starting.Firefall uses 'Job Board's to give you missions. Sadly the number of different missions is pretty limited. This results in missions starting to repeat themself, though not literally, but you will see the same kind of objective on new places and an other sugarcoat around it.Skills and progression is an issue as well. You only have 4 skills and at level 8 you alreayd have them all. At that point you'll only be working on upgrading the skills itself. Either through research & crafting or by grinding vouchers to buy them from NPCs. Research & crafting really takes forever, while vouchers drop you back in the repeatative mission grind.On a positive note, the cash shop is not Pay2Win. There are no game breaking items in there, and you can obtain the cash shop currency (Red Beans) from in-game grinding. With that, cash shop items are tradeble, and you can find almost everything from it on the auction house.			"

												I have played Firefall Since first day of open beta. Saw alot of changes, good and bad ones. But recently i decided to check on release and i was totally dissapointed. So, if you liked complex old crafting system and good rewarding thumping in pockets - then move along. Nothing for you there. So here's my impression and feedback.- Game became alot more friendly to new players, also alot more easier- Crafting got simplified as maximum as possible. You don't need to worry abough energy, weight and stats. You just craft pre-defined items every time.- Thumping now can be done blindfolded. Resource veins is a total mess - there is a huge lack of resource quantity. So thumping is a pain now really.- Battlframes. Have levels now - takes ages to grind. Gear got simplified as well. No more servos, jumpjets and platings. Just core and weapons. Also repair pools are gone and now gear is permanent and can't broke. You can repair it as much as you like. Right now you just grind the best gear and that's it.Missions. New field missions are just the same as ARES just another name. Slight imprivement tho - voiced dialogs and some kind of a story. Still boring.- Currency and Market. Biggest con for me. New currency been added - credits. Once per 24 hours you can exchange 25k CY for 1k credits. Now you need credits for everything. Prices are rediclous. White metal and purple metal costs the same. Very frustrating to use. Crystite became almost useless.Again - just my opiniion and impressions as old player. Right now alot of things are broken\not working as intended\missing or w\e. Some changes are just weird\stupid. Honestly after i played for a bit i just feel that i don't have any desire to log in back. I know things most likely gonna change. I loved this game, really. And i don't want to bash it but this just plain redicilous.You still feel free to try.			"

												Although i've only played around 3 hours of this game so far i find myself lacking a motivation to play this game, maybe its the seeming same-ness of the things ive done so far mostly rescue most of which is defend for x amount of time or go and kill monsters, even the general story seems very weak at this point.I would not recommend this game however theres plenty people who im sure would find this to thier tastes.

												Im not to far into the game yet, not even lvl 20. However this game seems pretty freak'n awsome...First off im really glad to see an mmo move in a fresh new direction, i'm also glad to see the shooter genre being worked with in a new light. These two very popular game catagories havent seemed to chage much at all since mmos like Guild Wars 2 and the more recent Tera Rising which unfortunatly lacks a little depth. Even less evoulution has come from FPS (first person shooters) and 3PS (third person shooters). I have yet to play Destiny so i cannot comment on how it may have changed the shooter genre, but i have played a wonderfull 3ps mmo called Global agenda and let me tell you, was that game fun. Global agneda died out quite awhile ago it seems, even with rumor for a remake. But from what i have experienced so far, Firefall gives a very similar feeling to Global Agenda.To be honest i was first sceptical of the MMOFPS Firefall. The screen shots depicted bulky looking character models and an impression of just another delevoper failing to reimagine the mmo genre -I was wrong. It started on a night like most, I was dwindling on steam browsing for a new mmo to play, because for some reason i just couldent get back into playing WoW. I decided, hey what have i got to lose by atleast trying this new game? ahhh but first let me check youtube. And wow nothing but beople complaining aobut things like the inability to pick up multiple quests and finish them all at once and even more so about how long the game took to get out of beta. Sifting through all the hate i realized that DIFFERENT is exactly what i was looking fore. I have come to absolutly love that i can only do one quest or ""job"" at a time in Firefall it makes the game feel more real and immersive for me. Each Job has new and unique fully voiced dialog with multiple characters and a suprisingly intricate story depth (per mission, or town set of missions). However there arent too many to do per town, city, station, or whatever you like to call it, this is totaly OK! because there are things happening all over the map, that in most cases can be joined at any time without the need to group or even started on your own to take on the challenge of soloing the game. Oh, and might i add all of these random occuring events are also fully voiced and do a good job at making you feel like you are a high tech, bad♥♥♥♥♥space cowboy.All in all what i mean to say is i like the direction this game is going. Fire fall gives all the feelings of both an mmo and a console game, the artwork and graphics are beautifle while not needing immense power to support them, and the questing/ PVE of this MMOFPS  has kept me entertained more than any other MMORPG with the exeptions of GW2 and WoW wich i rarely play either of the two any more. As far as PVP goes i am reluctant to say i can not yet report, i can say however, i cant wait to hit lvl 40 and run off into that open world, no rules, anything goes pvp island i have heared about.P.S. Could someone please explain to me how this game is completely free? im entirely baffeld at how such a nice game requires no money to play. I understand Firefall uses a type of micropayment like LoL's methods, but LoL has a very lage user base buying things like skins and wards. Firefall doesent seem to have an extencive list of really cool stuff to buy. "

												I loved this game and I hate to add some perspective but I still see it listed as Mostly Positive on the reviews, it went from 90% positive to about 70% positive all with the release of 1.6. Don't let my 500ish hours on record fool you, I played back in closed beta and before it came out on steam my character had literally thousands of hours on it, I don't use the steam client anymore either because it seems to be more buggy than the stand alon release.Short Review:The 1.6 patch made it so that new players were locked into a single frame (class) which in most MMO's wouldn't be an issue but Firefall was about freedom to swap classes at will. They changed almost every class from the 1.3 standards and weakened every stat on them. Crafting and high level zones (DT & Amazon) are currently suspended. Thumping doesn't yield resources but a small amount of crystite (in game currency). The new tinkering system requres credits which you can buy with red beans (real money exchange currency) and crystite (at 25k CY for 1k credits), originally credits were listed as the player to player purchase currency. PvP is back, but only one map and game type. Most vendors are broken in Sertao (30-40 zone now). Instances are broken into several types: Standard level and Challenge level seem to work fine. Hardcore (lvl 40) missions are 50/50 as to if it will launch for you. Hardcore Operations are buggy on launch and some times don't launch. Raid (yes singular) doesn't always launch and currently has a bug with the final phase so it's 50/50 if you'll be able to complete it. They took out 3 other raids: Baneclaw (expected to return in 1.7), Kanaloa (no return date yet) and Warfront (no return date yet). The Red Bean store went to rentals over purchases, thus you only get to rent the nice bikes then have to pay again next month. So in conclusion they took away most of what make Firefall Special, removed 70% of the content, and made it so if you do buy into thier game you get nothing in return.Long review:Pro's:Free to play - if you don't buy beansAbility cooldowns are very shortCon's:All the frames feel similarvery little diversity in play stylesfeels like every other shooter on the market with slightly better jumpsno more ZipZaping the chosen, they are no longer confused by mid-air acrobaticsCover is the only defense against chosen fireno craftingno thumpingno new player frame switchingbuggy quests (called jobs)Hardcores rarely work rightOperations rarely launchOnly one Raid, takes about 30 mins.I can't even play it anymore much less recomend it to new players. The game went from alot of fun to a pointless grind with real world money sinks. It feels like they are running out of money and trying to get the player base to pay for further development, the parent company The9 is ignoring player feedback and focusing on the Chinese Console release. From the direction the game has gone I would expect that the game will be shutting down in the US EU areas before long, players are leaving in hordes, the bad reviews are piling up, support tickets are getting stupid responces to bugs. IE they have 2 inventory tabs Inventory and Account Items. Account items are apparently character bound and character specific so account items not showing on all character on the account is ""Working as Intended"" which seems to be the responce to 90% of the strange bugs. the other responce is ""We're working on a fix.""Understand I waited a month hoping they would fix the bugs they introduced, no luck. After over 3 years of playing I'm leaving firefall at this time, no further red bean purchases, no futher PTR testing, I'm tired of the crap they keep pulling. Goodbye Firecat, Recluse and Bastion. The rest of the frames good riddens.			"

												This was once an absolutely brilliant game with an amazing list of features. Sadly those times are long since gone.. stay far away from this game. Supposedly they have no developers left and the last that was heard of the Chinese company in control of this game was that they were investing in some cashmere stock weirdness. Oh, and the game rarely works correctly anymore. When something breaks it usually stays broken for weeks or outright never gets resolved. Not likely to get a hold of support either, or anyone really. Save for the lone guy they seem to have working his butt off to keep the game online.Here's the most painful part of it all: I want to like the game. I just can't bring myself to do it when it is left in such a poor state. Stay far away.			"

												I've been with this game since 2012 and for 2 years and thousands of hours of gametime I loved it, it wasn't best game around but it was aiming to be there. In 2013 it was apparent there is internal turmoil .. by the end of the year CEO was removed by board and publishers took over. I'll spare you the details, but they slowly made sure game and studio behind it aimed for the gutter.There is still hope however, founder and former CEO whom publisher kicked out is gauging interest in remake that would follow original vision under brand ""Ember"" please sign the petition if you'd like to see game we were promised and hoped for, game they took away from us https://www.change.org/p/crixa-labs-make-ember-a-spiritual-successor-to-firefall?recruiter=562901777 "

												I have fond memories of this game in the past, and returning after an extended absence I could not control excited me greatly. Little did I realize that I was setting myself up for an equally massive letdown.1. My character class is now effectively worthless in PVE after a blatantly unfair patch.2. A lot of my items were replaced with vastly inferior gear.3. The crafting system is offline.4. The servers are very unstable.5. Character classes I was eligible to unlock thanks to a previous purchase are now locked.6. Support is impossible to contact due to website downtime and website errors.7. I can't even file a bug crash without getting a fatal error on the bug reporter app that pops up after a crash.8. A lot of content was cut instead of fixed and it shows.9. Many achievements are now completely impossible to obtain.Just don't bother. I'll be forced to remove the game from my library in the end. I'd rather lose this game quickly then suffer hoping that it will be repaired and rebalanced. For a player who actually paid for some of the content in the past that is now missing, this leaves a rancid taste in my mouth and I must now brush my teeth an additional time for the night.			"

												Poor choices in development and management led an incredible game to its degeneration. Big changes that regularly came after a few months the equivalent of gear-resetting (and gear is all that matters in this game), irking veterans of old and rookies getting used to the system. Despair-fuelled moves during last winter has cut any possibility of recovery from the festering problems that have encrusted this shriveled company.It's dead, Jim.			"

												Got this game back in closed beta and bought one of the founders packs long before it got added to steam. Then, I would have recommended it, now, it got utterly destroyed by asians. No, im not racist towards asians, but god they cant make MMO's for♥♥♥♥♥♥ The original company, RED5, sold it and now its your stereotypical asian style mmo complete with grinding the same repetitive missions, once you hit the level cap of 45, you get a new level system with no cap. The got rid of the awesome crafting system to put in the whole ""chance upgrading"" thing that you have to buy things off the cash shop to increase its success rate. I come back after 6 months and now it has those stupid♥♥♥♥♥chests you get as a reward and you have to by the key to open in from the cash shop. This game screams ""♥♥♥♥♥♥asian cash grab MMO"" now. Its free to play and the story (thats change like 6 times) is fun to go through, the world looks awesome and the sounds are great so i dont thing you;d lose anything playing if you dont have anything else to do, just dont spend money on it or try to sink alot of time into it.

												The devs have been fired and the servers will either be taken down or become so heavily broken/hacked that the game will be unplayable within weeks so spending any cash on the game now is just giving it to the dodgy Chinese owners who hammered the final nails in the game's coffin. Also, anyone who gives money to Mark Kern's latest project should be aware of what they're going in to. Find the reddit post regarding his firing; Google is your friend.RIP Firefall. You never achieved greatness but you were enjoyable enough. Hopefully some day, somewhere, I'll find a game that takes your affection for poorly-localised 80's anime and open-world MMOs with a high degree of freedom of movement to its logical conclusion.			"

												Oh man, where do I start?  IN CASE YOU DON'T WANT TO READ:IF YOU'RE A RETURNING VETERAN: DON'T GET ITIF YOU'RE A NEW PLAYER: DON'T GET IT  A long long time ago, I was bored, and as was the will of the Internet, I happened to stumble apon a closed-beta version of a game called Firefall. Now, this was cool as all hell, and I scraped together $20 to buy a founder pack and make my way into the game. After the tutorial, the world was yours to explore. Of course, there were side and story missions, which I chose to partake in.Cut to a couple years later, a slightly more cooler me, browsing the Steam Free to Play section. It has been long since the Age of Firefall, when I played almost every day. I had moved on, mostly because I didn't have anyone that I knew personally to play with.Then, while browsing, my heart soars, tears well, as I have just stumbled on to Firefall(again). My boredom meter dropped instantly down to -100, and I began downloading the game through Steam. I grab my besterest friend and slammed him into the bandwagon, and then we were offered a few blessed years of happiness and prosperity(I almost said peace, but then again  someone  had to be on the end of our guns).Then... at our peak, we were slaughtered. Update 1.5 had just released, and so had the demons. The changes were acceptable at first. Ninja swords as melee weapons? SURE! Portable health packs? WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ NOT? However, in this case the bad outweighed the good. Bugs, new, complex systems(that were NOT user-friendly), the revocation of our most loved battleframes, only to be tempted by XP or a new frame, and all around generic MMO trash surrounded us. They beat us down to a pulp, chewed us up and spit us out. Now the Age of Fire has long been extinguished, and Firefall is now nothing but a conduit for nothing but evil and bland MMO elements.  There is salvation, fortunately, because where there is evil, there are heroes are willing to combat it!  https://www.change.org/p/crixa-labs-make-ember-a-spiritual-successor-to-firefall?recruiter=562901777 BEFORE I FORGET,  This hero  used #MakeFirefallGreatAgain in their review and I literally could not finish this without using it so thanks for that, uh, also I stole the link from his review, so again, yea thanks bro(its a noble cause though)  "

												TL;DR and Pros and Cons at bottom.Firefall is an interesting and diverse take on the FPSMMO genre of games, allowing a player to take on many different roles, and exploring team dynamics in a way very few other games have mastered. Each squad member will find themselves useful and needed at one point or another because of something that only they can do, and that's one of the things that makes Firefall a beautifully executed game. However, it's certainly not without it's faults. There are several instances where the game will become a long stretch of repetitive mission grinding, or thumping for resources. It can be excruciatingly annoying when you have to grind just to level up your character, doing missions that are essentially 'go here, press e, go there, kill these guys, etc.' The game does redeem itself however. Some of these missions you find at ARES job boards actually have fairly interesting stories and characters interwoven into them, making the repetitveness worth it. For example, a job at Sunken Harbor had me laughing quite a bit at a character known as the Meddler. Her personality was so over-the-top ridiculous, that it was hard to NOT love her. In addition to the job boards, the game builds upon the story through campaign missions which can be played at any time, so long as you meet the minimum level requirements. Some of these campaign missions will have you traveling into dangerous territory in order to save a crashed dropship pilot. Others will have you escorting a cart carrying broken equipment. Even more will pit you against seemingly endless waves of enemies as you desperately try to keep your foothold in their territory. That's what makes Firefall beautiful. It's an incredible experience, and I highly recommend you jump into this enthralling universe.TL;DR // PROS AND CONS:Firefall is a very different take on the FPSMMO genre of games, and is well worth your time.PROS:Massive worldGreat graphicsPlethora of random eventsDiverse classes allowing for incredible team dynamicsTons of weaponsPlayer-driven economy system via the in-game MarketplaceOtherwise, ridiculously funCONS:Can be extremely grindyMissions found on Job Boards tend to be repetitiveSomewhat steep learning curveOVERALL RATING: 9.5/10			"

												(This review is outdated by a year, read other ones.)Let me make this quick and simple. There is some appeal to the game, but it needs work. Quest are repetitive, mostly fetch quest. This becomes annoying as any mode of transportation is locked away until the second area of the game, and that's about 30-40 hours in. Research is a bit too much with no explanation. Bad tutorial level. Bad textures. It's a game you should keep you eye on, but as of right now, avoid it. Gameplay is interesting, I'll give it that. Needs work.			"

												I played the game in beta, but I took a long break, and only recently came back to play it on release. I never got too attached to a specific build of the game, but I did play enough hours to wrap my head around it.On paper, it sounds like a good idea. Marry shooter mechanics with some MMO questing and skill progression, and you'll have people coming in droves!In practice, it's got some shooter chops to form the foundation of a game. Each basic class gets a different kind of primary weapon, and your choice of secondary gives you a bit more room to play with. But the MMO half of the experience is so threadbare, and feels so soulless, that I was always aware I was grinding. Grinding for weapons, grinding for gear, grinding for cosmetic unlocks, grinding for a blue version of the EXACT SAME green item I already had!And I had enough. I never did hit high level content on the release build (got to about level 20 with my subclass frame), but what I played was such a sucking void in my time spent that I couldn't help but put the mouse down at the end of a session and ask myself...""WHY? Why did I just do that for two hours?""Some people might consider games in general (and grind-heavy MMOs in particular) to be nothing more than a time sink. But  in other cases, there's something to maintain a player's interest, whether it's the world, the lore, the art, or even a player class that just hits all the right buttons in your brain.Ultimately, with Firefall, you get all of the illusion of MMO progression, and none of the distinctiveness and originality that you might get in an actual MMO. And frankly, if you're at that point, wouldn't you rather just be playing a plain shooter?			"

												           5 Thing About Fire-Fall that are obviously annoying or1.This game gets VERY repeditive, all you do is go out and kill things, escort people, gather supplies, fight off enemies while protecting a point, trying to find missing people, and pest controll.2. Your parter that calls you boss all the time and has an odd mixed accent that you can never tell where she got it from, just from her talking all the time on every mission gets mildly annoying and repeditive, half the time i swear they took words she said and put them into a sentence then make it sound like she actually said that through editing.3. ALL and i mean ALL of the boy npc are based off the same base modle, it is painfully obvious.4. For the first 15 or so levels all you fight are ahrenas, sculvers, hissers, giant flying bugs, and bandits. The bandits seem to be over powered compaired to the normal sculvers and ahrenas, at the lower level mission to kill black forest gang members they can kill you very easily without having to put up a fight.5. Now this one might not be as bad as i may put it out to be but Free to Play MY♥♥♥♥♥ As you progress you see other players with cool colors and armor and vehicles, but to get that you need what Red 5tm calls red beans witch is in game premium curency to buy things with, like a Rocket powered motor-cycle that costs 175 red beans witch equaits to roughly 25 dollars (USD). Now for the armor color, The colors and patterns are pretty cool not gonna lie, but you only get 3 free base color cobonations when you start the game they include, a completely white suit, brown with green accents, and a lvery light blue with different shades of that same blue all over it. Now your wondering about other colors and patterns, well they all cost up to 50-75 red beans that roughly equaits to 10-15 dollors (USD) each. They also have head gear, hiar/facial hair , classes, weapns and armor, all at rediciously high prices EXAMPLE. head gear 50-100red beans (depending) , hair/facial hair red beans 50-75 (depending) , classes 200-300---> 45-60(USD) red beans (depending), weapons and armor 75-100 red beans.This hopfully shows that the cool things you see in game all come at a price you probably wont be willing to pay.         I respect your own opinions about this game, but i stand by the fact that it is a very kill, kill ,grind ,grind, uniform sloppily put together type of game and you would need to put a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of time and effort into the game to get to your overall goals or get very far.

												The good: this game had (and perhaps still has) potential.  The gameplay is intended to be fluid and fairly rapidly-paced.  The questing (other than campaign quests) is fairly 'lite' on the story and I enjoyed the possibility of 'leveling' the same character in different roles in a way that made sense.  Red 5s stance on cheating is delightfully straighforward.  There are plentiful simple semi-randomized quests with middling rewards.The bad:  There were several quests I could not finish due to bugs.  There was a quest with a node in 'deep water' (think damage zones) which, once you used, you took damage until you died (which then teleported me two zones away to a different respawn point).  There were two quests that sat at ""loading next waypoint"" (or the equivalent, I forget the exact wording) the quest wouldn't progress, and relogging cleared the quest from your active quests.  Finally, as Acidule mentioned in his review, the tuning for enemy advancement is rather awkward.  You usually fight packs of 3-12 mooks at a time, and a large pack of equal-level ones will kill you.  I feel like if their net code was better, this would be less of an issue.  (I run off broadband with sub 15ms ping and 90/25 mb bandwidth so there is no shortage on my end).  A further point brought up in another review is the decidedly monetized feel for a lot of what I would consider fairly basic things.  Inventory isn't an issue at relatively low level (although with all the different crafting materiels I could see it becoming one) but purchasing more slots requires use of the cash currency.  As do most of the permanent travel options.  I wouldn't have expected the vehicles to be such a big issue, however there is *SO MUCH RUNNING* needed that I can only feel they are trying to perform the same ""2nd-class citizen"" action that has ruined the appeal of so many other F2P games.  There is a big difference between ""freemium"" games where you get either cosmetic or minor benefits and ones that feel 'gated' by the payment requirements.Bottom line, if this game was still listed as being in beta, I could be much more forgiving of the flaws and bugs.  I may give it another shot in a few weeks or months to see if there are any improvements or fixes... Then again, with all the various MMOs and other F2P games to play, I might not.			"

												As a beta tester , I like the game better now . Though I wish they brought back the huge amount of resources but the game is more polished and overall looks better . 1. Ares Jobs are far better then a huge amount of repeat missions which the game used to throw at you in beta . You can choose when to begin and when to abandon . The good news is Ares Missions are still around but in a smaller number.2. The levelling system is much easier in my opinion to figure out . Now exp directly levels you up and as you go up the ranks your base damage and health will increase independantly from your loadout .Now for the bad1. Advance frames are hard to get now compared to beta . You either have to get to level 40 or bargain over them on the market .2 . Cystite / ingame currenccy is hard to get now . Salvaging seems like the best bet but in beta you could convert resources into cystite . I hope they bring this back .Overall great game with a few marketing / ingame currency problems but in no way is it pay2win .			"

												A solid game with its up and downs. It went through a developer hell (you can research if you want to know) to arrive at its current state.You are an ARES agent equpped with a battleframe. There are 5 classes of frames each with 2-3 advanced subclasses. Assault, Dreadnaught, Engineer, Recon & Biotech are the basic ones available right away. To unlock an advanced sub-class frame you need to level any already unlocked frame to 40. Alternatively, you can just buy a pilot license with cash or purchase one off the player market. The latter method involves a decent amount of grinding as in-game currency is harder to come by than usual.The game game certainly has its charm - the colourful world, a few interesting personalities, fresh combat. But all of that is balanced out by the monotony of grind once the initial novelty passes, the somewhat boring crafting system and a rudimentary player economy.While the release version is quite OK there are some things that turned to worse since closed beta. The game's resource and crafting system went through many iterations, some more in-depth than the others. At present you can only boost any one base stat of your frame with mutually exclusive 'cores'. I see this as a huge step back as before you were able to boost most stats by crafting better battleframe components. Jumpjets allowed you to have a better, faster boost, plating gave you armour and health/regen, servos were responsible for run/sprint speed and jump height and so on. Weapon and other gear crafting has gone through some dramatic changes as well. As the game is right now, crafting anything except the highest tier gear is pointless as you'd have to grind for resources and, chances are, you'll sooner get an item drop comparable to the one you're looking to craft.If you want a few hours of fun the game will deliver, but beyond that it turns into a grind-fest to get to end-game of which there is very little. Keep an eye out for future content updates. Hopefully, those will improve and expand Firefall.			"

												Just want to point out I've been playing since 2012 and steam hours are just from the steam client.Whatever you do don't use the steam client. For some reason it is filled with more bugs than the client from the actual website.Firefall wise, this game is pretty awesome. I feel bad for the new players though because you only get to choose one battleframe and you can't change unless you pay money or get it to level 40.  In the beta you started out with all the accord frames and had to unlock the others.Gameplay wise it is fun, you can switch between first person and third person, glide around, grind resources, quest, craft, get pets, and play different classes. The crafting system is intense and requires you to ""thump"" for resources.Thumping is basically an auto mine feature where you guard the thumping device from constant waves of enemies that get harder and harder the longer you ""thump"" or mine for resources. This is what you will be doing for a really big portion of the game. The only downside to this is that it can get really redundant and boring. Just take a break and do something else and go back to it!You can also join other players in thumping and recieve a portion of the resources they are thumping. The bigger the thumper the harder it will be to defend it. It doesn't take away from what the owner of the thumper recieves so dont be afraid to hop in and help. Free xp and resources! Can't complain.The red beans are the cash shop of the game. Pretty well balanced in my opinion, I think the battleframes are a little pricey at around 15 dollars per frame. Each frame cost 100 beans (or get a frame to level 40). 50 bucks will get you 4 frames (450 red beans) because you get bonus beans for buying in bulk so obviously the more beans you buy the cheaper the frame.  If thats all you buy then basically you have bought yourself a game anyways so do your research and pick 4 frames to love. Or just get frames to level 40 and unlock them yourself.All in all it is fully free to play, no pay to win, fun, and DON'T GET THE STEAM CLIENT! GET IT FROM THE FIREFALL WEBSTSITE!			"

												Hi-Just wanted to throw in my two cents.  If you like Borderlands or other FPSs, this is well worth a try.  It's truly free-to-play; you can play this indefinitely without paying a cent- you will not reach a point that you have to cough up money for.  Leveling will take you a bit longer without buying VIP membership (which boosts XP and some other things), but it's not all that big of a deal.  I have friends that have played for over 100 hours without buying anything.  Plus, you can buy the vast majority of items with in-game money if you want to put the time in.The big draw for this is the fun of leveling different classes, and developing gear.  There is more end-game stuff to do than in Borderlands, for instance.  Don't get me wrong... the BL franchise is my favorite by far, but you reach a point where you have everything and have done everything.  I found that in FF, there is always something to do, if you adjust yourself to wanting to do it.  If you can find a few buddies or join a squad/ army, the possibilities increase.  The MMO feature allows you to meet new players, if you want to, and go from there.I've read the negative reviews, and most of them seem to come from disappointed beta players.  I came to the game just after official release, so I can't really speak to what is was like and what may or may not have changed.  There is a grinding aspect to the leveling, but more so because there are 16 frames to level up, if you want.  However, it's no more grindy than BL, with the increasing level caps and having to repeat Vault Hunter modes several times.So, I'd strongly recommend giving this a try.  I continue to be surprised that more people haven't tried it, but I suspect it's because of suspicion about the MMO feature.  I felt the same way, but I gave it a try.  What game have you played that you can play for a year or more and still find fun things to do in it?GraniteHead1			"

												So far I’ve played this for a hour and a half or so. It’s good for what it is, but it’s not my thing.


YouTube™ Video: Firefall - part 1 (first impressions) 

			Views: 93		

			This game is Firefall by Red5 Studio. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanovichZ1/recommended/227700		

I didn’t really know anything about this game before today. So I wasn’t sure what to expect. When it said FPS MMO I thought maybe that would mean it’s sort of like Planetside. But it’s not like that, so far it feels like a cross between WOW and borderlands. Gameplay is primarily PVE. I’ve pretty much only played solo so far. I mainly found myself taking one quest, travelling to a location, killing a set number of hostile aliens, picking up an item and returning to the quest giver. Unfortunately for me after having played WOW and borderlands before it felt very ‘been there, done that’. Especially with having to travel by foot to objectives, why would I want simulate walking? But it still feels better than what I remember WOW being like which is the main MMORPG that I’ve played. I really wanted to just to get stuck into some team PVE instances or PVP matches. I did participate in what I think was a matchmade coop PVE instance. But I didn’t have a lot of time to look at that today which sucks, because it actually started to get interested once I reached that. There is supposed to be PVP as well but I didn’t have a chance to experience that today. After a little bit of research I found how you’re supposed to add yourself to the queue for that but it didn’t work for me. And I haven’t found any information about when you are able to do that. I can only assume that I need to progress further in order to unlock PVP matchmaking. One feature that I did like in this was the jetpack ability, that’s a cool if limited way to move around.Initially I felt that the graphics were actually below what I expected. I felt maybe the textures weren’t that detailed. I really got sense that the game is geared towards being able to support action on a large scale i.e. large scale battles with a large amount of players. But actually after playing it for a while I felt that the graphics aren’t bad at all. The cutscenes and dialogue in the beginning I didn’t really pay a lot of attention to because I really just wanted to get stuck into the game. So I can’t really say much about the lore and the storyWhat are you getting with this game. It’s sort of a Borderlands like experience that costs nothing. If you really like MMORPG games this might be right for you. At this stage I don’t know how restricted you are in the long run as non-paying player. But hopefully you are not put at an extreme disadvantage if you don’t invest money into the game. I would have liked to have just been able to engage in PVP combat right from start. If I get around to it I want to do more on PVE instances and PVP matches in this game hopefully do a let’s play on it/add more to my review. That’s all I have to say about this game for today.Click here for my YouTube gaming channel			"

												I read a bunch of reviews saying this game was pretty bad with the new update it got. I decided to give it the benefit of doubt. Worst mistake ever. I don't have much time into this gaame because it's pretty much unplayable. There's a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bugs that just slow down my game to a slide show and there's an unholy amount of lag (may be my fault). When I started the first mission I somehow got stuck in a floor. All in all, this is a terrible game that needs to be fixed.			"

												As you can see I've not played much Firefall. Why then am I writing a review? And why would I not recommend it? After my 5th attempt the Tutorial continues to bug out, not just for me but everyone who was in the tutorial with me based on the chat. It gets you about 30 yards from the starting point then throws up an invisable wall and no one can progress beyond it no matter what people tried. Relogging caused it to reset the tutorial (including upskippable intro) and the bug continued. Highly annoying as the game looks promising beyond the tutorial, but in it's current state and with my current experience I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone as there isn't even a game to recommend with that bug in the way.

												As a beta tester , I like the game better now . Though I wish they brought back the huge amount of resources but the game is more polished and overall looks better . 1. Ares Jobs are far better then a huge amount of repeat missions which the game used to throw at you in beta . You can choose when to begin and when to abandon . The good news is Ares Missions are still around but in a smaller number.2. The levelling system is much easier in my opinion to figure out . Now exp directly levels you up and as you go up the ranks your base damage and health will increase independantly from your loadout .Now for the bad1. Advance frames are hard to get now compared to beta . You either have to get to level 40 or bargain over them on the market .2 . Cystite / ingame currenccy is hard to get now . Salvaging seems like the best bet but in beta you could convert resources into cystite . I hope they bring this back .Overall great game with a few marketing / ingame currency problems but in no way is it pay2win .			"

												It´s a promising fresh game. It feels a bit like Borderlands and Fallen Earth in one. Good Grafix.Pretty grindy at present, but fun to play with friends. Even tho the game seem to have been around for a long time, it seems that the dev´s are close to the community and constantlychanging things. PvP has been taken out to be revamped and re- introduced.World Events used to be a lot more present in the game. "

												A solid game with its up and downs. It went through a developer hell (you can research if you want to know) to arrive at its current state.You are an ARES agent equpped with a battleframe. There are 5 classes of frames each with 2-3 advanced subclasses. Assault, Dreadnaught, Engineer, Recon & Biotech are the basic ones available right away. To unlock an advanced sub-class frame you need to level any already unlocked frame to 40. Alternatively, you can just buy a pilot license with cash or purchase one off the player market. The latter method involves a decent amount of grinding as in-game currency is harder to come by than usual.The game game certainly has its charm - the colourful world, a few interesting personalities, fresh combat. But all of that is balanced out by the monotony of grind once the initial novelty passes, the somewhat boring crafting system and a rudimentary player economy.While the release version is quite OK there are some things that turned to worse since closed beta. The game's resource and crafting system went through many iterations, some more in-depth than the others. At present you can only boost any one base stat of your frame with mutually exclusive 'cores'. I see this as a huge step back as before you were able to boost most stats by crafting better battleframe components. Jumpjets allowed you to have a better, faster boost, plating gave you armour and health/regen, servos were responsible for run/sprint speed and jump height and so on. Weapon and other gear crafting has gone through some dramatic changes as well. As the game is right now, crafting anything except the highest tier gear is pointless as you'd have to grind for resources and, chances are, you'll sooner get an item drop comparable to the one you're looking to craft.If you want a few hours of fun the game will deliver, but beyond that it turns into a grind-fest to get to end-game of which there is very little. Keep an eye out for future content updates. Hopefully, those will improve and expand Firefall.			"

												Just want to point out I've been playing since 2012 and steam hours are just from the steam client.Whatever you do don't use the steam client. For some reason it is filled with more bugs than the client from the actual website.Firefall wise, this game is pretty awesome. I feel bad for the new players though because you only get to choose one battleframe and you can't change unless you pay money or get it to level 40.  In the beta you started out with all the accord frames and had to unlock the others.Gameplay wise it is fun, you can switch between first person and third person, glide around, grind resources, quest, craft, get pets, and play different classes. The crafting system is intense and requires you to ""thump"" for resources.Thumping is basically an auto mine feature where you guard the thumping device from constant waves of enemies that get harder and harder the longer you ""thump"" or mine for resources. This is what you will be doing for a really big portion of the game. The only downside to this is that it can get really redundant and boring. Just take a break and do something else and go back to it!You can also join other players in thumping and recieve a portion of the resources they are thumping. The bigger the thumper the harder it will be to defend it. It doesn't take away from what the owner of the thumper recieves so dont be afraid to hop in and help. Free xp and resources! Can't complain.The red beans are the cash shop of the game. Pretty well balanced in my opinion, I think the battleframes are a little pricey at around 15 dollars per frame. Each frame cost 100 beans (or get a frame to level 40). 50 bucks will get you 4 frames (450 red beans) because you get bonus beans for buying in bulk so obviously the more beans you buy the cheaper the frame.  If thats all you buy then basically you have bought yourself a game anyways so do your research and pick 4 frames to love. Or just get frames to level 40 and unlock them yourself.All in all it is fully free to play, no pay to win, fun, and DON'T GET THE STEAM CLIENT! GET IT FROM THE FIREFALL WEBSTSITE!			"

												This game is pretty good. I will have the CONS & PROS in detail.I'll try to update this when I can. For now it'll be recommended to try.PROS-Storyline is pretty good if you pay attention to it. (Though I haven't for various reasons)-The world is amazingly set up. The world is by far, the most unique world I've seen in any game.-Questing is actually fairly good. You don't have to stay in the same area that long if you don't wish too. (That I've experienced)-You can create an Army (Clan/Guild).-Graphics are amazing. (Usually I don't look at the games graphics, but I must compliment this one.)-You can actually move & resize some of the interface components. -You can customize the character camera and more. (Moving the 3rd Person FOV.)-Can switch from 3rd Person to First Person at anytime.CONS-Limited character customization. (Though I'm sure they're working on it, but for now this will stay in the cons.)-Grinding can become repetitive. (But it is fairly interesting because of the setting.)-Armies don't have much for customization. (Ranks, Permissions, Etc. I do suppose they may be working on this but for now it'll stay in the cons.)-Is computer intensive at times.-Graphics glitch out when using ALT + TAB. (Best to run in windowed if you plan to multitask otherwise everything will turn black.)-Interface needs some work. (Primarily more options to customize. (Can't resize/move Minimap, or the Main Bar.)			"

												Very good, fun game. I've heard a lot of criticism about it, and frankly, I don't see it. Here are some of the major problems people have with the game.1. Transportation is only available after level 25 - While true, what you have to realise is that that is level 25 on one class. There are a total of 16 classes, meaning that level 25 is relatively early in the game. In addition, I've only been playing Firefall for 36 hours, at this point, and I have leveled one class to level 23, another to 15, and the other three basic ones to 6/7. So, it doesn't actually take that long to progress anyway.2. Pay to win - This is absolutely not true. Because of the way the currency system works, you can convert in-game currency to Red Beans, which is the paid-for currency. Therefore, it is possible to earn any item you want just by playing the game. Yes, it will take time and effort, but the alternative is for everything to simply be given to the player, negating all semblance of progression. Not to mention the fact that most of the things that you buy with Red Beans are vanity items anyway.3. No variations on weapons - I put this claim down to people not playing the game long enough. While yes, each class has only one type of weapon that they can use, they do vary somewhat. For example, the Assault's weapon is a plasma cannon, with an alt-fire of a shotgun-style blast. Around level 18 or so, I found blueprints for a version that spits fire instead - it keeps the feel of the Assault's weapon, but with a slightly different twist. In addition, I am now level 23 on the Assault, and I haven't found a replacement, so it's definitely paid off.4. No variation on abilities - This is basically the same problem as the above, but I didn't want to write too much in one section. I've heard some people complain that at level 8 (when you unlock your 4th ability), you don't get anything new. This is far from the case. You unlock new abilities at level 15 and 23, which means that you will need to switch out abilities and try new things. The amount of levelling between these abilities is such that it gives you a chance to try the new abilities and playstyles, without letting the game stagnate too much.These are the 4 things I've found to be the most common 'downsides' to the game, and personally, I don't think they stand up. My belief is that people who complain about this game do not understand what the game is about. Firefall is *not* a normal FPS. It is a MMO, first and foremost, which is why I do not understand why people complaining about having to work for their rewards. I do not claim to know everything about MMOs, but Firefall doesn't feel particularly grindy to me. Personally, I think people judge Firefall as an FPS first, when it is an MMO. The majority of people that I have seen bad reviews from have judged the game around level 8-12, without giving the game a chance to show it's diversity.Obviously, this game will not be everyone's favourite, but it is for me. Also, for people who say that the game has become worse since beta, I played this game during beta, and it was too complicated for my taste. Firefall is currently in a much more enjoyable state.			"

Try the PTS version before this Because it will have updated more than this will until its finished.Melding is cool and all but I hope the game doesen't die off soon I think it still has some potential.

												In short: Customize your frames, craft your own weapons and burn arachnas.+ 10 points for jetpacks, controls are very intuitive and fun.Been playing this for almost 3 years. Perfect for casual play. There's some grind as in any game of this kind but the difference is FF's grind is not mindless.The world is dynamic, events pop around all the time, there's always something to do and the devs are pumping more content regularly.It has bugs, and the servers are wonky occasionally. A little bit of patience and /rui seems to be enough for most problems. There are some addons on curse and on the official forums.The community is mostly mature and helpful. Don't hesitate to ask for help in /zone chat.The Lore is very interesting, there's an official comic on FFs site.I suggest this game to anyone who wants to enjoy some action in good company but can't invest too much time.

500+ Hours invested into the Alpha/Beta/Pre-Steam releases.+ Fun with friends. - Feels like a slow monotonous grind without company.+ Pay-to-Progress, not to-win. - Have to grind for days to trade enough in-game currency for even the cheapest cash store items and boosts.+ Multiple classes and varying abilities and play styles. - A few of the secondary classes are exactly like their base classes apart from one or two abilities.+ Dungeon instances are well paced, challenging, and very rewarding. - The end game ""raid"" content is lackluster.The removal of PvP Arenas in beta was when I stopped supporting Firefall 100%, those were the most fun out of all of the content being tested.I give FIrefall a strong 3.5 out of 5 - in it's current state.

												As someone who spent quite some time in this game and who has all Battleframes on level 40 I can say that i do not recommend this game. Firefall has a sad past but since the recent patch it seems like the actual problems have just begun: Short: they just disabled  50% of endgame content, the game is full of bugs, there is a new main story that is even worse than the old one and you can't even finish the campaign since the recent patch as there is a plotstopper bug.Combat actually got better, but all weapon secondary firemodes with one or two exceptions got completely removed. Level cap will be raised soon so don't bother coming back and grindding the ""endgame"" stuff, makes no sense.It seems like the devs just want to get rid of their whole community. They even introduced a new INCREDIBLY GRINDY crafting system with random outcomes so that you can spend millions of real-life money to re-roll the stats. They already completely reworked their core mechanics once without much success. They just failed to add ONE new battleframe since the games release, NO THEY EVEN TOOK ONE AWAY!!!!This game could have been a shining star on the MMO horizon, but bad decisions completely ruined it. Like completely.It's free, try it. But I warned you.			"

Product received for free
												I...I've always wanted this game to be good, the cinematic trailers, the hype, and you played the game for the first time in closed beta, you thought to yourself man this game world is amazing, you can fly around, you can explore everywhere if you try hard enough. The only thing limiting you to seeing more of this world is the giant purple wall of melding.  Back in beta this melding is what controlled server populations as well as explorable game world. It'd slowly creep closer and closer if players couldnt hold back the hordes of chosen, and then that server instance would eventually die to the melding.  This was the game i was introduced to. this beautiful world to explore and see and ignore all the player gameplay because ""hey its still beta they are still tweaking things, who cares if voice acting and model animations are incredibly robotic, combat is repatative unless you play assault, range means nothing when quests have scripted ambushes so theres no real reason to play the recon advanced classes.  engineer classes have this weird dinner plate thing with lack luster weapon models and lack luster weapons that could easily just be tertiary weapons.  I dont even use the Tesla, i have my engineers using two secondary weapons (an assault rifle and the RPG) because the tesla is just flat out lame.  Maybe if it had a cone of effect or somthing that didnt just make it a shiny looking assault rifle.  But again, tangents. All these tangents are the built up frustrations of one player,  Red 5 has kept looking at the big stuff, new maps, new monsters. but they have constantly overlooked the little details that really flush out a game.  the bones are there but it has no muscle.  Combat in general is pretty boring unless you are fighting random mobs out in the world, because then you can use your own combat playstyle to the best of your ability (but assault is pretty much the best combat experience in the game currently), Game models are great looking normally, but some animations are just...unnatural.  quests are still served best cold and alone, with no one acknoledging them.  then theres the fortress system, it wouldve been somthing like Wildstar's, but we don't know if they even remember talking about it.basically, we are all waiting for a bigger company to buy the game and use it as a quick cash bull, maybe revitalise the game world as we grit our teeth through never ending grind of producer run gaming industry.

												It's a good concept and all.......but it gets very boring very fast.Not enough diversity in what you need to do.  And I can most definitely see heavy influence from another crappy game (I won't give it's name) which was a TPS and went F2P.And my opinion on crafting......useless.  Can't keep up to date with much useful.  Crafter items need way better stats or unique bonuses.The game starts looking okay when you see the price......but it just is way too boring.Maybe within a few months the devs will flesh out it's direction to something better.

												So, another free MMO is on the market and why should you even try this one?You can view Firefall as a bledn of Planetside 2, Borderlands and a bit of Global Agenda.As such its a lot more of a shooter than your basic MMO, which if you like shooters is REALLY GOOD!Althow it is an MMO it doesnt feel like it, it feels like you're actualy playing your standard co-op game.And it mostly does that through the excellent voice acted missions that you get through a Job board.Now, the missions may not always include you doing something very different every time, but the game makes you care about what you are doing. Are you helping a mother find her son? Are you helping some civilans getting food?The game atleast says what you're doing and that can instantaniously makes you care. And the voice acted bits aren't shoved down your throat like in The old Republic, they are just some messages that you recive and they dont hinder your gameplay.But unlike in the old Republic, your character is silent and doesn't talk at all (they do even joke about it).But let us talk more about the combat. As i said, the game feels more of a co-op game, and even in combat that is clearly visible. Your main source of dispercing damage is your GUN! That means that combat is more Borderlands-esk and even the enemy variety is closely similar to that of Borderlands. But you also have 4 abilities, 3 that you use and have a cool down and the forth ability charges through combat.But besides your regular missions Firefall is also structured to have a more dynamic feel to it. You will find your fellow players gathering resources and some side-mission, which you can ither start yourself or help your fellow soldiers in the field.The gathering of the resources is especialy fun, since it is more of a team oriented thing and you and your friends are besacly just mowing down bugs and enemys as they come coming towards you.There is also a crafting sistem, which works like your usuall crafting sistem with some twists (i have never seen a lot of the crafting sistems in other MMOs). Firstly you need to research what you want to make, and then actualy make it. Fearly basic, but the hard part is actualy juggeling your resources/money.I have mixed feeling on the business model. The devs sure need to make money and i belive they might have actualy been able to get a functioning sistem into their game that is not really pay to win. In game, you can buy red bean coins with real money, that in turn allow you to buy special items from the Red Bean store. Most of these items are luxurious, like a bike (you can make one yourself for free to) and some other cosmetic items. The only problem i have is that the giant gameplay changing item, the one that allows you to play different classes (battleframes) is (for me) kinda costly, since you can pay 10€ just for another run in the game with some different abilities. But its not as bad as it sounds right now. You can actualy earn those Red Bean coins ingame, for free! You can excange your basic money, to credits (which are used for the marketplace) and then those into Red Bean coins. Sure the excange isn't exactly linear, but you can earn the Bean coins without spendint a dime. How ever, the time it takes you to aquire even an usable amount of Bean coins, so it is still very harsh, but hey, you can speed things up with spending money and supporting the devs.In short, Firefall is in my opinion one of the finest MMOs and if you liked Borderlands, Planetside 2 or Global Agenda, you should give this one a look. The begining few levels might be boring, but after you get into the game a bit it just takes off and unlike some MMOs that have you just spaming some abilities you can actualy have tons of fun here!

												Firefall is one of my favorite MMOs.  If you like the feel of an open world environment (like most MMOs) and like third or first person shooters I recommend you give Firefall a try.My fav features:Movement.  Just getting around in the game is very fun.  Motorcycles, gliders, jump pads and personal jetpacks!Dynamic quest system.  Repeating a quest does NOT mean you will go to the same location(s).Open world content.  Imagine you are fighting some aliens for a quest and more (aliens, bandits, critters, etc) show up unexpectedly, due to random public content/events.  Time to react or die.  You have to think on your feet and be aware of your surroundings.Crafted gear is useful!  A large percentage of the gear I use was crafted by my character.One character, multiple battleframes (classes).  This means that your inventory and crafting is tied to your character, NOT your class.  So your battleframes level independently, but that cool level 20 submachine gun of doom you crafted for your main battleframe is usable by the battleframe you have reserved for playing with your group of friends (once you get that battleframe to lvl 20)Free to play which means it should be easy to get your friends to try it.You can buy things with actual money, but it's just cosmetic, quality of life, and fun items.  NO Pay to Win.It's very common to be knocked down and have a complete stranger come by to revive you.Playing with a group is fun.What I don't like:Software bugs.  Not a ton, but they are there.  Note:  vendor support is responsive.Lot's of good changes coming in an update soon (maybe in January).  Check out this video for a summary (and some laughs):  video link "

												I was in the beta for this and it really had hopes burning high. It has some really interesting ideas to it and if one is a diehard fan of third-person shooters you might like it but it is dogged by problems.I rate F2P model as fair, there is no content that affects gameplay that cannot be acquired in a reasonable amount of time without paying and there are purely aesthetic items can be bought with real money alone, though the appearance of characters can become a little generic I don't see this as a problem.The game is buggy though, possibly more so from the beta days as it's virtually unplayable. Missions stopped updating in my mission journal, one stuck at loading next waypoint, the tutorial mission bugged out and remain in my journal with the last objective even though I completed it the day before.The server was very laggy, at the last login it was continually beeping with a server lag warning and other players were getting this same message. Even outside of these warnings, lag was a constant companion.I don't recommend this game.			"

(who says it's PayToWin is wrong .. anything you get with RedBeans - ca$h - you get it FASTER)Play the game alone or in group , it's fun either way...			"

I very good and over looked aspect of this game is the fact that you can change the look gender and basicly everything about your char FOR FREE unlick alot of MMO's where if you want to look different you have to pay or make a new char *Cough* Maple Story *Cough*ConsIm not going to lie though this game has alot of bugs but I belive in the people at Red 5 will fix these the major bugs/flaws are you can only pick up 1 quest at a time (May just be me being used to other MMO's)There is alot of space in between jobs			"

												Fun open world MMOFPS. Beautiful environments, great graphics, fun gameplay. Couldn't ask for more from a game. Especially a free one. If you played in beta absolutely give this game another chance, I understand that most games don't change very drastically from beta to launch, but this game is the exception. When I played in closed beta there was basically no content. You started out crafting and thats all you did the entire time. Guard your thumper. They've changed it COMPLETELY. They've added dynamic events constantly goin on in the open world, a massive open world PvP map, tons and tons of quests and probably a ton of stuff I don't even know about. It takes a lot to impress me these days when it comes to MMO's but Firefall has definitely done it.			"

Oh! theres also a campain that you can do. the grind is getting to the proper level to do the campain. anyways in just a few days i already sunk 22hours in this! its great. i have not tried pvp, but i have 0 interest in that sort of thing. as far as pvp goes its not pay to win!

Bonding together with over 40 players to try and stop an overwhelming invasion, more and more enemy reinforcements showing up while we barely manage to contain  the heavy cannons from firing. And just about 2 minutes before the onslaught ends, they break through and destroy the SIN connection. commander shouting ""Get the hell outa there we have Melding incoming"", as a Blue wall of Death approaches what's left of our squadron. Turn around and boost for are lives , and the sounds of the game stop. It's just the beaten defenders, fleeing in a hail of bullets.Never has a defeat felt so awesome. We were beaten for the day, but some of us would live to fight another. Comrades falling left and right, with no time to save them.

												After playing a considerable amount of time in this game it's at its death knell. My friends list is empty, the areas a vacant and going back to the lower areas would be nice to do so if there where players to play with. Because of the hype when this first came out it was full and across several servers, now it's been merged down to one and I'm lucky to see 100 people across different shards. If this was 2 years ago, I'd be more optimistic. I always try to keep this frame of mind when playing any game, especially ones that's from a smaller developer. The changes to the game in the latest patch killed the game. The 1.4 version of the game was vastly superior. Since it's free, have a look at the environments. They're awesome and have presence.			"

												I played this when it was first playable, about 2yrs ago or something and it wasn't fun... but it was in Alpha.I played it today and was very IMPRESSED.  I've been playing MMOs for about 10yrs and Firefall reminds me of one of my favorites, Global Agenda.  I'm tired of tab-targeting like in WoW and SWTOR.  I now prefer games like World of Tanks and Naval Action where you have to aim.  Firefall does that as well.  Graphics are good, if you like the Borderland look.  Gameplay is smooth and I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of other players.  Fun game and killing bugs makes me feel like I've entered Starship Troopers!Definately recommend this game.			"

												I've played this game since Open Beta and absolutely loved it. Made some really good ingame friends too. The community was awesome. If you needed help with a mission you just had to ask in chat.I'm not going to repeat what happened with the game. I think there's a number of posts that that say it better then me.I still have hope for the game (in terms that someone will buy the IP from the9 and do a roll back) but as it stands it's not even worthy of standing in the shadows of it's former glory.Final thoughts - We will always love you Firefall but we just don't recoginse you any longer and for that we're sorry.

												To summarize what's written below: Developers are working on porting this game to other platforms and I would strongly suggest to wait until it is done. With the way the game looks now I think the game will shut down before that happens.So my experience with this game is a little mixed. I tried this game when it first launched for a few days and I thought it was good. There were lots of players, monsters and random battle events (I didn't know why they were taking place, but they were fun). I didn't play it at the time because at the time I had 6 other games on the queue and I got pulled in by 1 of them. Now  I came back to try it and it changed a bit in terms of gameplay (not a bad change in my eyes), but it degraded significantly as an MMO: Some stuff got removed/disabled. I don't want to list it all, but take my word for it: It was there and now it's not. Few bugs (minor bugs; most of the time gameplay doesn't suffer) At least low to mid level areas are empty: No players and almost no events. I feel like I'm running in an empty map most of the time. Developers are working on porting this game to PS4 and ""mobile"" platforms. To me that means that until the PS4 (and other) versions are made the game will be frozen and playerbase will keep decreasing. "

It does this whenever you move out of where it thinks you need to be.It's horrible.  When it decides to have bugs, it will be bugs that own't let you play.  You'll have menus taken away from you, quests will be removed from your menu part-way through them.Friend and I had to remake characters just to get to level 10.Kill this game with fire, report it until it is dead.

												I have spent a decent amount of time in the Firefall universe and from that I can say Firefall is a great game thats addictive for a long period of time. There is no need to use real life money, most of the items you can buy are cosmetic, vehicles and advanced frames(classes). Once you hit level 40 you can purchase an advanced battleframe for free. The more max levels you have you get a 10% exp increase that stacks for your battleframes that arent level 40. Sadly the late game isn't really that good yet so you will end up doing repetitive level grinding with different battleframes. Over all I would give Firefall 7/10			"

												This game is alright, I enjoy it. There are great things about it. You can have multiple classes and switch at any civilized area. You have the jump packs, and the Gliders which allow for long distance ""flying"". There are Bikes, Mining (Thumping), and you can do it all in a Squad with your friends. It's also truly Free to Play. You don;t need to spend any real money unless you want to be a VIP player. Or you devote hours are quests and convert what you get into Red Beans (VIP currency). I wouldn't recommend doing that though, my friend spent several hours trying to get enough stuff and only got 28 Red Beans which is practically nothing.There are issues I have with it. There's VERY little campaign, as in you get a campaign mission every few levels. The missions are pretty straight forward, you go somewhere, shoot some people, and then go back to where you started. I also believe the game was supposed to be originally PvP, but I've only seen that in some much higher level areas. Which brings up another problem: the maps, while very large, are few. There are around 6 different maps (I can't remeber I can't bother to check).The game has potenial to be something great, its just not there yet. You could play it, you could not, but I've enjoyed it somefar. Though I admit, playing alone is boring as Hell.			"

												I haven't played this game in a while, but I think I should say, that I played when it was in Beta, when everything was simple. It was what WoW/GW/GW2 had to offer, but syfy, simple to get a grasp of, AND f2p. But I had noticed that when I did play this again, that everything was a bit more difficult to understand, and get the grasp of.  I noticed, if you were a vet and had higher rigs (Even beginning rigs) for the most part, combat was easy. I remeber the Choosen normally was taking watch towers left and right. Players had to constantly take them back; and taking them back wasn't all that easy. But when I played I could basically 1 man take a tower back with engineer.And for it being easy, almost all the events(Bosses, raids,etc.) were extremely easy to complete, you only had a bunch of people there to just get some quick and easy loot. But when I started playing this in 2014, everything about it was a bit challengeing and I think thats what most people liked, was that it wasn't easy to do everything, then that one patch came or something and then anyone; Experienced, or new could be able to 1 man any event or enemy. So, I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone, if it was back when it was in beta I would've def reccomended this to anyone who asked about this, but now I don't think anyone should play this game till they do something about it and try to bring it back to the way it was back in beta.

												This game has an awesome ""mass effect"" feel with the combination of 3rd person fire fights along with skill and power usage. I think the system for crafting is very adaptive and balanced considering the amount of advantage to be gained from a crafted weapon. The only complaint i have is that you have to get a frame to a max level before unlockign the next frame, this will force someone to play for months on a frame they dont like before getting the one they like. I hear rumur they will be fixing this and i hope its true. Either way the game was good enough to spend some money on.			"

												Firefall is a great MMORPG for it being Free to Play. Unlike most F2Ps, it doesn't act like a Pay to Win, rather Pay for convenience and cosmetics. It has an excellent crafting system, but it takes a while for the items to be completed. You can, however, pay 1 Red Bean, which is the game's paid currency, to instantly complete the crafting process. You aren't required to pay for Red Beans, however. With using the game's common currency, Crystite, you can obtain Credits, and convert those credits into Red Beans. You can obtain nearly everything in this game without spending anything, which I would like to see in more games. I didn't think this game would've changed much from the Beta, but it turns out that this game finally made it's way out of development hell. Replayable missions, great combat mechanics, fun dynamic events, good loot system, beautiful open-world, this game is really good and I think people should at least try it as it is Free to Play.			"

												JAN 2016 update:So after a year of no updates, they have completely changed the game again. Up until December 2015 it was actually looking promising. Then they decided to ♥♥♥♥ up everything again, because apparently the devs can't go more than 6 months without changing everything. They removed all the weapon alt-fire modes just to slap on ADS on everything and turned down the run speed so the game is slow as hell. All the passive perks that made the frames different were removed because they were too confusing? What the ♥♥♥♥ Red 5?  Firefall was a promising massive open world shooter with arena PvP, now it is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crafting/economy based MMORPG with no PvP. Another game killed by its developers. It seems they fixed most of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! No more gear breaking permanently, crafting and resources have been simplified, and although it not Arena PvP there is Open World PvP in the game now.Biggest issue right now that I see is inventory slots. I had 700+ items in my inventory since the last time I played last summer/fall. The item cap is at 155, so the first hour or so I was just salvaging junk to get under the cap so my character could move, and I spent all the Red Beans (ingame currency) I had left on buying item slots to get up to 235. Having the cap start at 200 and go up by 25 at same prices would be better.  "

												The game itself is great. There are pretty nice encounters and dungeons with fine voice acting that i liked. Bosses are fun to kill and PvP is also enjoyable.. Shooting MMO is something kinda new and this one is from the better ones... BUT... The loot policy in this game is TOTALY wrong. Imagine 10 hours raid in WoW with nothing but green drops. Yes, thats Firefall. They try to slow down players progression that much, that is unacceptable. The fact that shooting game isn't for relaxing (like WoW mainly is), it makes raiding more fun, but you also feel more tired after an hour raid for example... And if you find totaly nothing (No DKP / token system) from that raid.. i really mean NOTHING.. you are pretty disappointed and you feel like you wasted your hour. Every single patch they do follows this loot policy... like a week ago they added a new patch with new dungeon. It was fun to play, again.. i enjoyed it. The dungeon run took me around 40 minutes with other players and guess what i got from the last boss as only reward? Green item. Thats it, 40 minutes wasted, i don't want to do that again.Raid timers reset at wednesday, people usually login just to do time-locked raids (where you have like 10% to get 1 purple item, which is the biggest chance you get in this game) but today, there was like 10 people wanting to raid in the whole EU server. After the last patch, where devs promised ""changes to loot system"" but players still got screwed, most of them just left the game...The game is dead, no playerbase and im leaving too. Great game killed by series of bad decisions and horrible loot system.			"

When I met the Devs at Gamescom some years ago they were eager to listen to ideas and criticism but as more idiots joined the company criticism was banned from the forums.

												I´ve been playing this game quite a few month now, since I bought a founder pack in the very beginnig. And I must say its the best MMO in a long time. Even so they changed alot in the process and you gotta start over a couple of times, I´m quite satisfied with the state its in right now.Its rare in any MMO for having so much opportunities. All the Battleframes for example. Even if you dont wanna spend any money on the game you got 5 frames to start with and once you leveld em up you can unlock even more frames.And if you get bored by one frame (which doesnt happen if you choose the right one for you), you can just switch to another frame.You got alot of quests, missions, weapons, skills, areas and pvp just to name a few things.The game takes quite some time to explore and find all the features in the game, but seriously who wants to finish an MMO in one week? :)You dont even have to spend money to level up faster, coz with a group you´re allways leveling up no matter if you got the xp boost or not.All the new missions are fun too and the worldmap is alot bigger then in the beginning. The game isnt as complex anymore with all the diffrent resources gone, which some people like and some hate, but its easier to understand if you´re new to the game.So all in all the game is awesome and was definitely worth the 100$ for the founders pack and I´m spending another 100$ for the Digital Deluxe Edition coz in my opinion I had alot of fun in this game and will have in the future:)Try it out, if you like it support the game^^			"

												I was a open/closed beta test player for this a lot of years ago, and it was interesting, fun, and demanded a lot of your time. (Cant Recall which, Never checked the profile for a long time.) When you ventured outskirts, there were generators that were able to expand the zone from the death zone BUT temporarily. It demanded teamwork and patience to move about, but also intense because you couldnt stay in a zone for a long time. Mining was profitable on those places as well but when that timer hits zero, you better haul♥♥♥♥♥back to the main area. Hell, there were defense events that get everyone SCREWED OVER when that deadly globe expands fast to the location or town you were trying to protect.  That I remember truly. It was intense as I constantly did that with a few more people. I loved that immersion.After a few years of that, on my absence I came back yet again, but the normal version. It was weird, It changed its mainframe system so something about Skill points and Gears. That was odd. I played a few more but stuck on the first major locale since I was just bored and wasting time, doing Tower re-takes, missions and you name it. Then I took a break again and decided to check again. R&D was screwed. You cant use them since they were broken. I noticed a few trying use Thumpers to mine, but since that was broken, What would BE THE MEANING OF R&D? Its just a waste of space on invetory and a system that was good to invest in.I did a few missions and said ""Eh."" but never gave me that same taste again. I wonder if it's just wore me out or I'm not into this sort of thing, but If I wasnt, I wouldnt participate and play that early. I'm really sorry for something such fun to play solo and with friends, became rather down, I'm sure other's reviews can explain better than I am.  "

												Effectively dead. Zero support, the 1st mission zone-in button has beee broken for 6+ months (after maybe the 6th account progression reset). The dynamic scaling texture/LoD system is broken, making it look worse than it did 2+ years ago.The servers go have gone down multiple times without warning, most recently for for 2+ weeks (dec 2016) with not a single comment from whoever is left of the PR/dev/publisher teams. A great concept. Open world third person shooterplayer versus dynamic AI invasions and calling down ""thumper"" mining rigs for resources used to craft and repair gear). Ruined by whatever happened since it his public alpha, 3-4 total progression overhauls, cutting of seemingly complete gameplay mechanics and the introduction of MMO/RPG style level-gated content where previously the core difficulty came from enemy mix and respawn/event frequency.

												At first myself and a friend enjoyed this game, it felt a little like borderlands in it's aproach to fps. Then they moved servers. Ever since then this game has been unplayable for us, and we have a stupid fast internet connection (65mb/s), but the lag is completely unbearable. This game cannot stabilize for anything, the latency is horrid and you can't do anything without it taking 2-3 seconds for the character to do it. For an MMO that's bad but for an fps that's a fatal flaw. The game was marginal when it worked well, after the server move it is worthless. I'm really sad about that as I have been looking for an fpsmmo. What a let down. Don't waste your time.			"

												Perfectly described by this equation:(Destiny - greed) + fun Halo melee + (Borderlands - cel shading)  X huge maps = Firefall It feels remarkable to enjoy all the things that attracted me to Destiny without all the things that annoyed me about it, and to enjoy it all for free!The combat is a blend of the three games I mentioned, and every character has a jetpack which can be used to dodge attacks or fly over enemies.The last comparision that comes to mind is the Unreal Tournament series, because of the beautiful landscapes and degree of mobility you have (including glider pads & bikes).I'm up to level 10 already, have been able to equip my character with wolf-emblazoned yellow armor and hipster shades, and I somehow have a bike now... definitley not feeling that this game is pay-to-enjoy. Plus I've gotten some good gear in my random wanderings and occasional mission.You can switch your class at any time (or even your gender) but I find that the Dreadnaught was a great experience to start off with, for its ability to blast enemies away and its forgiving amount of armor and ammunition!Have fun m80s			"

(yes, they are not all the same speed, but that is no surpirse, like in real life :D [prior to 1.6, i didnt test the speed of other, slower bikes i have, could be wrong now])here is a nice little video i found to demonstrate this nice feature:

Posted: December 29, 2014
												This game feels in every way like an upgrade to Global Agenda, which could be good or bad depending on your thoughts about GA.  People who do not know any better will liken Firefall to Borderlands or Team Fortress 2, but this is really inaccurate since the design of those two games is so basic by comparison.The world is open and explorable via jetpack, which speaks to the kind of player that I am since I absolutely love the exploration aspect of big games.  The combat is repetitive at times superficially, since that is how FPS games work (even though I play mostly in third person), but it never seems to get stale to me since you have variety in how you level.  You only need to create one character since you switch classes as needed, like in Final Fantasy XIV:  A Realm Reborn, which is a feature that I wish more developers using a class system in game would implement.  The crafting system is deep and useful at pretty much all levels, mounts are available immediately because of the size of the world, and the world itself feels quite dynamic, even in towns.  A cash shop does exist, but it is not pay-to-win at all since it provides only vanity items or other items / unlocks which you could earn naturally through the game, either by buying with credits or completing requisite criteria.  The contentious unlock from what I have seen is advanced classes (an engineer can become a bastion, for example), which you would normally unlock by levelling a core class to level 40.  However you obtain it, you still start that advanced class at level one like everyone else, though.Some obvious faults which you notice within a few hours of playing:-You are let loose into the world immediately, and if you do not adhere to the loose tutorial to learn fundamentals, you may very well feel like there is just so much going on with so little explanation.  Because the world allows you to stray from the tutorial, you probably will, and you will miss out on very important mechanic information as a result if this happens.  I ended up going back with a higher-level character to do it just to learn some basics which I missed.-This huge world is divided into also huge sections.  There does not seem to be quick travelling by default from within one large zone.  If you expect a hearthstone or something similar from other MMOs, you do not start with it; there is also no guidance on how to come across one from in-game tutorials.  It does exist, but it is not a right.-There is an inconsistency with many in-game models and their dialogue picture counterparts, where the models end up looking nothing like who is supposed to be speaking to you over your communication unit.-You may run into an endless ""loading next objective"" wall when doing job board missions.  Sometimes it resolves itself in five minutes or so, sometimes it does not.  Exiting the client has not resolved it for me before, so I have found that in this instance, go do other world events in the mean time.  Maybe it will resolve itself.  Since most of the game's story comes from job boards, you may see why this is a problem if you wish to follow the story.-Some objectives for world events do not update properly on your screen.  This is most commonly seen with crashed thumpers, where it consistently says that it is 0 / 5 parts needed to repair, no matter how many parts are brought to it.  That event does correctly end when five parts are brought to it, but the progress never shows.  Reloading the UI does not fix this.-Some on-screen effects, such as poison, may also never go away.  This includes the audio to accompany the effect, even when you are not afflicted by the condition.  Reloading the UI also does not fix this.-Load screens can take ages, and this is solely on the developer's end.  No loading in huge areas once you get in, but the loading TO get in can be 5+ minutes at times, sometimes less, since the loading appears to depend on the servers.-No player name filtering...I would prefer not to see idiots named SACK420 and xxTotalxDarknessxx in my game.-Other bugs exist, and from what I understand, the devs are not quick about addressing them.Oh, and the game is 100% free; you are by no means required to pay anything for the full experience unlike other ""freemium"" games.  This is, to me, the best free-to-play game right now.  It has full voice acting, visuals similar to Sanctum 2, much to see and do, and no entry fee.  The option to give money to the game in support of future content is unobtrusive if you do not care to pay, while such a fee is simultaneously low enough per month to be comparable to any other big MMO's subscription if you do want to contribute.  Just as how I would like to see more class-based games use Firefall's design in being able to switch classes as needed, I also would like to see more subscription-based games having 100% of the content available for free with perks for subscribing which do not skew the game so much in their favour just for paying money.tl;dr There is much content for zero dollars for RPG or FPS enthusiasts.

												Why do I reccommend this game?-Great visuals-Fun exploration-Nice class customization and freedom to swap between them.-Battling for territory against NPC's (Even though it may be a small feature)-varying scales of battles with NPC's during events, may require you to work together with others-Great game to play while listening to podcasts.What I (and you might also) dislike about this game:-Repetitive missions-Needs to give more incentive to us players so that we will WANT to max out our reputation with other factions and complete repetitive missions and events.OVERALL, its a nice game that I would play while listening to a podcast or at a time where I just feel the need to get a quick game in to blow off some steam after a bad day. If you plan on dedicating a good amount of your time, and money, to this game I suggest joining up with an ""Army"" and making a few friends that you can run around and have fun with ingame as it seems that this is the type of game that can quickly turn into a boring chore.I SUGGEST the developers look at updating the game with things such as adding more diverse missions and events, maybe even player specific events, perhaps have more interaction between the player and the various factions to give more incentive to gaining their trust, or even allow the player to choose to gain the trust of the more evil factions. Anything to get rid of the repetitivenness currently plagueing the game, lest it divulge into a themepark MMO.If I had to score this game, I would give it a 5/10. It's your average Free to Play MMORPG.			"

												I have a dream that one day the devs at Red5 will pull their heads out of their colons and realize they had an amazing open world MMO with a major fanbase and growing interest in the title. Now that they've stripped almost everything that made Firefall different from all the other boring oversimplied futuristic MMOs out there, I have a hard time recommending it. Now its okay, midly above mediocre when it's working and not lagging or crashing to desktop.Red5 chose conformity over diversity.			"

												I think that it verges on fraud that this game is still listed on Steam. A year or two ago it was a great game, but the publisher laid off the entire dev team and there is no support or on going development for this game. DO NOT buy any of the DLC for it. As I understand it you can't level a character past 10 because the quest line you need to progress has been broken for months.The only reason it's still up is to try soak money from people for a busted product.

												As a game developer, this is the perfect story of what not to do to your game. Back in beta, the only complaints anyone had were I want more content and bug fixes, and just look at it now. They removed content, changed the style of the entire game twice, changed the focus several times, spent funding on promoting the hell out of a game nobody wanted to play anymore and sytematically fired all the original staff. At one point this game had remarkable, shining reviews. At the time of writing this, it's 30% Positive! Who knows the ultimate fate of Firefall? It's hard to hear, but I believe it's dead. Fortunately a spiritual successor to this game how it was intended to be, back when it was my favorite game, is already under way. Find it here: http://crixa.io/emberthegame/ "

												Perfectly described by this equation:(Destiny - greed) + fun Halo melee + (Borderlands - cel shading)  X huge maps = Firefall It feels remarkable to enjoy all the things that attracted me to Destiny without all the things that annoyed me about it, and to enjoy it all for free!The combat is a blend of the three games I mentioned, and every character has a jetpack which can be used to dodge attacks or fly over enemies.The last comparision that comes to mind is the Unreal Tournament series, because of the beautiful landscapes and degree of mobility you have (including glider pads & bikes).I'm up to level 10 already, have been able to equip my character with wolf-emblazoned yellow armor and hipster shades, and I somehow have a bike now... definitley not feeling that this game is pay-to-enjoy. Plus I've gotten some good gear in my random wanderings and occasional mission.You can switch your class at any time (or even your gender) but I find that the Dreadnaught was a great experience to start off with, for its ability to blast enemies away and its forgiving amount of armor and ammunition!Have fun m80s			"

												its dead.do not even try it!its dead.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------old recommend counter from the time it could have been on the way up! :(but it wasnt...-----------------------eh, what to say?i like! :Di have to counter all those bad revirews after 1.6!yes, patch 1.6 did some things i dont agree with (like changing gear, abilities, and wapons to get the PvP to work better), but the following updates adding up to version 1.9+ are going to fix that! i hope ^^ btw.: the old areas are coming back, with higher level cap for us to enjoy! and the crafting i think, yeah, something like that :)its like early access after years of years of beta and release, its constantly changing and evolving. if you dont like change: that game, for now, is NOT for you! try it maybe next year, after... 2.0, but try it! its F2P god dam* it! xDedit: oh! and bikes! you like bikes (chopper)?Firefall has mounts that are diferent than other MMO mounts (horses, things to ride/drive to get around faster)they perform like real bikes, they accelerate, have gears, they crawl up hills, they go fast downhill, you can crash (stop at things, you dont die or get off your bike ^^), jump over ramps, and you CANT jump around with them like a rubber ball or a pogo stick...!!!its one of the things i like most about the game, its crazy i know, but its great! i rly dont want to see any more of those: ""riding speed +100% or 150%"" things again! (yes, they are not all the same speed, but that is no surpirse, like in real life :D [prior to 1.6, i didnt test the speed of other, slower bikes i have, could be wrong now])here is a nice little video i found to demonstrate this nice feature:

												First of all, I don't write reviews because I'm not expert at games. However, I really do love this game. I love it, I love it,  love it. I can proudly say this game is highlight of my steam gameplay experience. This game had just so much potential and it gave this feeling that cannot be expressed with words. I love Firefall.Edit: Don't even play the game. The review below was what used to be good. Now, you probably won't even find more than 50 players online. It used to be so good. But everything changed. In a bad way. I don't even know what to say, It is just so bad and broken now.Still, in my opinion this game is still extremely good. The story is amazing, and so are the battleframes.(Edit: change all verbs to past tense if it isnt already.)On to my review now.Firefall is about how a group of meteorites rained down on Earth. The event is called Firefall. Humanity discover this cool material that can provide plentiful of power. So the decide to build a starship to visit a planet, Alpha Prime. They activate some warp drive and tear up a hole in space-time. Aliens come throug this hole and is trying to invade Earth. You are a pilot called ARES 35 with the most annoying NPC that tells you what to do. You pilot a battleframe, a war machine that can do like anything. Your goal is to defnd Earth from the enemy, but the actual goal is to level all the battleframes.I haven't played a lot compared to other people, but this game is actually free to play, not pay to win. The amount of freedom a player has in game is extremely vast. Firefall is a MMO that actually has a challenge soloing quests and activities. This makes it very frustrating at times, but if you type into chat Looking For Group (LFG) you would get quests done easily. This is a fun part about the game because why solo when you can co-op?The way players move around is very unique. You can use motorcycles, gliders, or even take a transport ship that wanders around Coral Forest. The best part is that every battleframe(class)has built in jets. Im talking about jetpacks to climb rocks and hover around. The maps are so large that you can just roam freely around all day with your jets.Weapons are unique to classes(Eg: Plasma gun only for Assualt classes+Advance frames for Assualt). I started off with an engineer because TF2's engineer can easily take multiple enemies down and I thought that firefall's engineer would too. Turns out that it does too. After maxing out my engineer I wanted to be more offensive, so i went with the Electron, the engineer's offensive advance frame. I can't describe how perfect they build each and every one of their frame. Plus you don't have to get an advance frame from the class you previously used. You can be a Biotech(medic) and then change to a Nighthawk(Advance frame for Recon). This adds on to the game's freedom.Here's the downside of the game.So after the storyline, you can unlock a battleframe(There are 16 battleframes) and continue to farm for modules for weapons and the frame. You can go to the Amazon, a level 40(max level) location that requires you to take territories and raid NPC enemy bases. Doesn' sound so bad? Only the best of the best with powerful mods and purchased items and hundreds of hours of grinding for weapons can survive there. Basiclly you have no hope there unless you plan to invest 500+ hours doing hardcore missions. Then there's Broken Penensula, a desert PVP arena that again, the best of the best will win.New updates are glitchy and the game is quite unpopular, but just enough people to keep servers up and keep people playing in group. I have't played this game in a while and the main reason to that is because yes, it is a good game with a good storyline, you visit other areas and fight the enemy according to levels, but no because after you max out 1 of the 16 battleframes, you are farming to level the next battleframe. This makes replayability extremely low. They howevr have cool features that do keep people grinding. I personally farmed for 2 battleframes already. Cool features, but gets etremely boring when played consecuitively.Recommendation: You should try it because it's fee to play, but most likely after some 30 hours of gameplay like me, you might stop playing. I still strongly recomend you playing the game, with a friend would even be better, but just know there is massive grinding afer storyline. If you like the style of warframe, borderlands, or fallout, then give it a try.Shoutout to you if you read this all. I thought it was an interesting story but it sucks now.And shame on you if you skipped all the way to the bottom. You're not cool (jkjk)			"

												This game fell real hard. it is mearly a husk of what the game used to be several years back. A few major things were removed such as crafting for instance. the crafting tree was completley removed, causing mineing in the game to become usless. this ment that crafting was replaced by a random loot system, including our best friend ""crates"" wich required a puchased key. this is a shame becaus the game is a blast to sit down and play, but it is no longer as rewarding as it used to be.

												This is one of the best games that I have played.. ever. It recently came out after years in beta, and when you put the few things that need fixing up aside, you are left with an incredible game. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fantastic, and the community is nice, and very helpful overall. I truly believe that this game is going to blow up one day, and get incredibly popular, and its better if you start sooner rather than later. If you still don't feel comfortable with getting this game yet, at least give it a try, because it's free.			"

												The game looks fun, on the surface.Once you enter the world of Firefall, you'd think you'd never want to leave, right?But once you realize that it's Pay To Win, it ruins it.Who would want to pay for this crap, when you can just play Warframe, which is 100% better than Firefall, and offers better gameplay.Parkour, many different classes, everything CAN be earned through the game, I have earned almost everything in the shop just by playing, and NOTHING is rental, unlike Firefall.I suggest you avoid Firefall, and play Warframe.1/10 Stars, this game could've been great, but yet another Organization ruined their game with P2W ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The 1 star is for the vehicles, I liked that, despite it being rental.But no doubt Warframe will have vehicles eventually, I mean, we don't need it because we can run insanely fast and run along walls.

												I stopped playing this after major changes to the game. It was a pretty nice game though. You could play with different types of gears, and playstyles. The game itself looks nice, but it's not exactly an open world. Also for dungeons I didn't understand any of it. There's a hole in what should be party making. I also didn't experience anything like a clan or guild or some sorts. That was very disappointing. The questing was alright, sometimes a bit dull and you keep running all over the place, while getting attacked by monsters all the time. There were events too, but I never really saw an announcement so I never knew what to do with it. I mainly did normal quests and leveled up several gears. Theres not really anything else I could do, because I didn't understand it too much. Hence why I quit this game.			"

												Review: When I first started playing this game I was amazed by the scale of the world. Red 5 Studios offers a fantasy sci-fi world that is set on our home planet Earth. The environment is tranquil and the music fits perfectly depending on the situation and time of event. After several hours of playing the game, I felt refreshed because there is so much to learn in this game. Below this paragraph is my break down of the pros and cons.Pros: Questing, cars and bikes, looting, collecting/gathering minerals and other resources to craft battle frames and more, music, scenery, day and night time cylce, emersive environment, and last but not least, a game with full potential in future expansions and patches.Cons: AI seems a bit dull and can be too easy, character graphics seems out-dated, gliding is decent but needs more control of altitude and sometimes a bit more freedom so people can relax by enjoying the scenery at night or day time just to fly, limited to rarely any tutorial throughout the game (I have to ask questions in chat), and last but not least, slightly hard learning curve for people new to massive-multiplayer-online shooters.Overall I would give this game 6/10 for people who play similar games like this one in particular and 8/10 for people who hasn't experience an open world shooter. You need a decent PC to run this game. I would highly recommend a decent laptop or custom-built computer. By decent, you should be able to run Planetside 2 with decent frame-rate.My funny joke for those who play this game often: Legend has it that a recon (a buddy of mine) is still flying sky-high on the tip of a thumper that launched at 100%. To this very day that you're reading this review, he's still flying! Some call him heroic, others an idiot. xD "

 So much promise delivered so poorly. Love the graphics and gameplay of this game, it has so much promise, yet delivers so poorly. In my opinion, it should still be solidly in BETA as it is obviously not ready for full-release, even now. I like the way it caters for those who want to research, scavange and build, but also those who just want to purchase in-game with real-world $$$. Pity it crashes frequently and sometimes freezes the PC completely. Little lagging on server, which is nice. Can't play with friends as we ended up on different servers. Unfortunatley, until these issues are fixed, more CONS than PROS. Although it is fun (when it works), I can't in good conscience recommend this game.			"

												Constant terrain issues, middle of the road graphics, and a general lack of content take away from a game that claims to focus on gunplay with a lack of interesting and unusual guns, in point of fact there are 16. No pvp from what I could tell, it's been removed, repetative, lackluster quests that have a modicum of voice acting. On the plus side, it's free if you want to be stuck in the 5 basic frames that you'll have unlocked at the beginning, the flight mechanics are genuinely fun, and the environments are down right beautiful. Wait for this game to get more content. It may become the shooter it claims to be someday, time will tell.			"

												First off I would like to say that I really think that there should be a middle ground between the thumbs up and thumbs down. My personal opinion on this game is pretty neutral. As for why I put a thumbs down on this review it felt like right thing to do at the time. Alrighty then, here is my review.Okay, before anyone says anything about the steam timestamp I want to say that I had been playing Firefall since the closed beta had really kicked off at some point just after 2010. The game is fun for if you want to go kill things and the visuals are good. I even put many many hours into the game. However, even though it has a certain amount of good things going for it there are a certain amount of things that happened to make me feel like I won't reccommend it. Am I being unreasonable? Maybe. I know it's just a game, and the developers can do whatever the like with it. But to be honest, I guess it's more about how dissapointed I am with where the game has gone since I started playing it.First off, to understand where I am coming from I need to say some things about the beta and how the game had really changed from the initial designs when the game first started out.Starting out, I thought the game had just about everything going for it. You had the different kinds of battleframes which you could switch back and forth from with no penalty costs, the begining tutorial was pretty good in introducing you to the idea of having to kill the bugs and the chosen, and in getting you to try and collect the resources by ""thumping"". They even had a pretty fun setup for doing team matches and deathmatches. After a while a new update came out and took out the medic battleframe and changed it into the Biotech. It really affected some of the playstyles that you had come up with at that point. Which was okay since it was something different and it just took a bit of getting used to.Later on, there was another update that added assault fights with the chosen and those were fun to. They even upgraded the battleframe system too and it looked cool and was fun to use.But, then things started to change when the Founders packs showed up and the Bean market started. When I first heard of it I thought that it could be cool, but when it was enabled it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. Starting out, the prices were pretty outragous. While the first tier of the the founders pack was around the price of a new game and would have been okay the higher ones were kinda rediculous. But even worse was the Bean market and it's prices. I remember that one pair of cosmetic goggles was like $5 and higher. While I understand that since the game is free to play they needed money to keep it going it was just like ""Wow, are they kidding me?"". I put up with it because for me the rest of the game was still fun to play at that point and things could change.Change they did. After a number of months after being inactive because of being busy, I logged back in just before the game came out on steam. The tutorial is completely different and even parts of the map are different. The Bean costs are still way too high and I don't think its right to charge people that much for cosmetics, especially since from what I can tell it is pretty hard to earn beans in game.The parts that bugged me the most though is how the Battleframe system has changed, and how it penalizes you with a cost for if you want to change your class.I don't know what happened to make them end up putting those changes in the game but it kind've ruined the experience that I had with them.I personally say that you should download it and try it for yourself to determine what you think about it. You can't always solely rely just on other people's reviews to determine if you will like a game or not.			"

												There are games worse than Firefall, but the only reason it is there is because it has no competition.It was not always like this. Beta Firefall was an alright game, with its flaws but also its charm. The original contraint system and the crafting meant there was an actual open world, fully explorable from start to finish, no level gating. Thumping was fun, and even a player in stock gear could be useful for more powerful enemies.And since launch, you can feel the call of money. The game is not even pay to win, because there are very few worthwhile items in the store and every single one is overpriced. The game progression went to the usual boring level system which locks content out for new players and makes 80% of the world useless for higher level ones. Crafting is now as stereotypical as it could get, and half of the materials are useless. There is no content to back up the game either, 2 raid bosses with pitiful  rewards (3 items at most for 20 people) on a SEVEN day cooldown, all missions are the same, and the grind is omnipresent. Gear customization is also extremely limited and the Power rating system is easy to undestand but extremely limited.Visually, the game has a rather basic art style, which has a nice render, and the soundtrack is amazing, however, the technical side is awful, bugs are everywhere and the optimization is non-existent which make the game lag horribly when the action is clogged.And let's not talk about PvP that is borderline broken, be it for playing (You can't even enter it unless you make your way around it and even then it is very slow and painful - also this bug was supposed to be fixed in the most recent patch but is not) or class balance, which is... inexistant.Good points :- Graphics style- Soundtrack- Combat is funBad points :- Bugs everywhere- Painful grind- Endgame is almost inexistant- PvP broken- Has actually devolved			"

												Going into FireFall, I was not someone who had read much about it prior. I've been told the game was shown as early as 2011, but the initial release wasn't until 2014. That can cause some people to go into it with a bad taste lingering. The game play is very much so still in an open-beta feel, but it is very playable and refreshing. The endgame content is there, but it's going to improve once the PVP system (there is open world PVP) is improved. The servers seem laggy for some, but I never have an issue. This game is F2P and you really can play it that way. It's more of a Free to Play, but Pay to get things done quicker. It's definitely worth the download and deciding for yourself.			"

												90 % of the negative comments are complaining about grinding and the game's getting boring in a while. And I want to address those 2 things.Now I can't claim I've played it all, and I am sure there might be some pattern breakers out there, but every game has some form of grinding to it. How otherwise would you discern the players that have spent hundreds of hours playing from the ones that spent only a few. At least here in Firefall you can chose your grinding grounds as it isn't specified to a certain single mob you have to kill over or so. Anyway I dare you to think about most MMOs nowadays and then honestly claim they don't have some form of grinding, I dare you! And about that ""game gets boring"" thing. Those are players who never played co-op. Playing this co-op with friends over any form of voice chat is just awesome. The laughs and the giggles. Changing tactics and the way you approach things while you play is priceless. Keep that in mind when you decide to play Firefall. And discard the trolls' opinions, because no game is ever good enough for them.			"

												This game ROCKS. Me and my brothers love it. The game has changed a bit over the last 3 years but I like the changes. Its not going to be for everyone. The only bad reviews you will see are from people who played in beta and don't like the changes. They made changes to make the game more fun in my opinion.It has a few issues they need to work out but the game is worth a shot. I mean the game is free to check out.Its better then PS2 any day of the week.It has really cool events and we have a blast doing thumpers. Thumpers are how you mine for ore and it can get crazy.Picked up the digital deluxe to support the game because its a really good deal and worth it. Good job RED5			"

												There are games worse than Firefall, but the only reason it is there is because it has no competition.It was not always like this. Beta Firefall was an alright game, with its flaws but also its charm. The original contraint system and the crafting meant there was an actual open world, fully explorable from start to finish, no level gating. Thumping was fun, and even a player in stock gear could be useful for more powerful enemies.And since launch, you can feel the call of money. The game is not even pay to win, because there are very few worthwhile items in the store and every single one is overpriced. The game progression went to the usual boring level system which locks content out for new players and makes 80% of the world useless for higher level ones. Crafting is now as stereotypical as it could get, and half of the materials are useless. There is no content to back up the game either, 2 raid bosses with pitiful  rewards (3 items at most for 20 people) on a SEVEN day cooldown, all missions are the same, and the grind is omnipresent. Gear customization is also extremely limited and the Power rating system is easy to undestand but extremely limited.Visually, the game has a rather basic art style, which has a nice render, and the soundtrack is amazing, however, the technical side is awful, bugs are everywhere and the optimization is non-existent which make the game lag horribly when the action is clogged.And let's not talk about PvP that is borderline broken, be it for playing (You can't even enter it unless you make your way around it and even then it is very slow and painful - also this bug was supposed to be fixed in the most recent patch but is not) or class balance, which is... inexistant.Good points :- Graphics style- Soundtrack- Combat is funBad points :- Bugs everywhere- Painful grind- Endgame is almost inexistant- PvP broken- Has actually devolved			"

												Game had the potential to be pretty cool. Graphics are pretty, combat can be fun ( has some big firefights), classes have different cool abilities. However, it lacks a lot of things to do in game. You pretty much just go back and forth from job boards doing essentially the same thing: killing either bandits or monsters, and/or collecting crap. Thats it. Scenery hardly changes so you really start to get tired of looking at the same jungles and swamps and crap by level 20. Customization is essentially crap, no skill trees or anything to make your dreadnought different from other ones. Most the basic cosmetic customization costs money, and theres no customization for armor besides paint, so you'll look the same from level 1 to 40 unless you want to pay to change your color a few times. I'd skip this one, it looks and sounds cool but gets boring after a week or so.			"

												I stopped playing this after major changes to the game. It was a pretty nice game though. You could play with different types of gears, and playstyles. The game itself looks nice, but it's not exactly an open world. Also for dungeons I didn't understand any of it. There's a hole in what should be party making. I also didn't experience anything like a clan or guild or some sorts. That was very disappointing. The questing was alright, sometimes a bit dull and you keep running all over the place, while getting attacked by monsters all the time. There were events too, but I never really saw an announcement so I never knew what to do with it. I mainly did normal quests and leveled up several gears. Theres not really anything else I could do, because I didn't understand it too much. Hence why I quit this game.			"

												ConceptAlien world. Band of fighters working for a government figure sent to liberate it from natives. GraphicsSpot on. Little tearing here and there but at least its not Battlefield 4. Lighting is a nice touch. Addition of flashlight adds suspense to some parts. Jumping animations work though are a little stiff. Mob animations react correctly to terrain regardless of water/rock/grass/wood etc. Humanoid animations are correct, with little tearing. Updates bring more polished animations and UI tweaks. Gun animations appear as you think they should for each weapon. Reload for each weapon is nice and adds to immersion.SoundAmbient sounds add realisim to your surroundings. Mob sounds match mob types. Humanoid mobs have realistic sounds as well and are varried enough so you don't get bored. Ship sounds are correct as well (whooshing, gunfire, etc.)GameplayEasy tutorial tells you all you need to know to get started. UI isn't hard to get used to and makes sense. Guns offer a little variety but nothing that pushes any limits. Dissapointment comes with class choice as they all feel similar, offering little in the idea of team/group/squad play. Jumping mechanic is fun for harder to reach places. Odd perches can be found for (almost) all encounters as long as you have a weapon equiped for ranged combat. Mission board is a little tiresome to keep comming back to all the time. The addition of a UI based bounty system would REALLY spead up game play, though it may remove the need to head back into town. Leveling mechanic is fun though I didn't play long enough to max out any character. The ability to swap characters on the fly is a great addition as it removes the stagnation that occured in the early stages of the game.OverallSolid experience. Very little polishing needed at this point. Extra content is comming down the pipe and will add longevity to this already fun diversion.			"

												tl;dr: The bad parts of an MMORPG are present, but they are outweighed by the positives of an FPS and addicting gameplay, in my opinion at least. It deserves a try, at least. 7 out of 10, I had fun with it.Firefall is basically what you get if you take Planetside and Guild Wars 2, then stick them in a blender and hope for the best.The game is an F2P, MMO, FPS in which everything goes to hell all at once and now you, the player, must go around in power armor with a jetpack fixing problems and blowing up aliens/bandits/giant bugs.The game itself has MMORPG styled objectives for missions, which is somewhat of a bad thing, because it usually is just ""Go here and shoot a specified number of enemies"". The gameplay is fairly fun, however. I enjoyed myself, but other people may not. Its free, so you might as well give it a try to see if you like it.			"

												Going into FireFall, I was not someone who had read much about it prior. I've been told the game was shown as early as 2011, but the initial release wasn't until 2014. That can cause some people to go into it with a bad taste lingering. The game play is very much so still in an open-beta feel, but it is very playable and refreshing. The endgame content is there, but it's going to improve once the PVP system (there is open world PVP) is improved. The servers seem laggy for some, but I never have an issue. This game is F2P and you really can play it that way. It's more of a Free to Play, but Pay to get things done quicker. It's definitely worth the download and deciding for yourself.			"

												So, you like Borderlands, but you also want to have a team of more than 4 players? Well, you can have all this and more! With a graphics style making small nudges towards the Borderlands series this game can be difficult to run at best, it needs some optimization. The devs also need to improve the quality for their server connections and UI to CHOOSE WHAT ZONE TO JOIN! Other than the key UI pieces that are missing, gameplay-wise this game is great, it can get tough if you get too close to an area that is too high level for your current Battleframe (Hmm, where is that other game about frames that are used for battle right now?) in all honesty as I play the game it becomes more and more addictive because of the fun elements that this game brings to MMOs in general.Due to the difficulty to get the game to run on less powerful PCs and the patchy server connections I’d give this game a 7/10.

And I would have to say, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO IS INSTALL THIS GAME IT IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME!And from here on I'm probally going to be rather rude because how much time and energy I wasted just trying to play this game. So this game was incredibally frusterating with out even geting to play the game. And first of all internet is a bit slow so it took me 2-3 days to load ... I first tried installing it on steam but once I got done with it the ""redhand error"" would come up. after trying to work around it it came to the point the game would not open the launcher. I then tried downloading it from firefalls site and the launcher would crash very 10 minutes.. I tried the other full download which i had to chage browsers to get it to work which it also stoped farly often making me take about 10 hours longer. even fter all that the same error would come up then seems the firefall folder was empty so I can't even find the launcher or try to make any of the changes... and trying to run it again just made the thing ask to unintall it or do close it. So this game just has a bunch of crap keeping it from actully playing the game which really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off I even tried bothering with this annoying as hell game.

												This game is all about farming because it lacks content, I got to lvl 27 and few times had to redo everything because there's nothing to do. I love idea of the game and I enjoyed this game a lot, but meh...why did they rush it's release ? it's missing so many crucial things to make this game beautiful			"

												Firefall may be gone and not what it was planned to become as an end product but a new game is on the rise as it's spiritual ancestor. If you love FireFall as much as anyone whoes played it before it became ""WoW with guns"" then please support the release and upcoming game called Ember.			"

												I would not recommend this Game if you are looking for Fun.This Game is a mess. I had a hard time not trying not to run in Bugs .. most annyoing Bug is the messed up Terrain which makes you fall through the Ground and getting stuck in the Ground. The Classes are not balanced. I played mainly with a Recon, but since some Jobs are just way too hard with a Class who go no Armor i focused on Thumping (Mining for Ressources while defending) and picking up crashed Thumper/Bikes. Sometimes there are Chosen spawning attacking something .. if that happens, rush there cause you kill 1 or 2 and get a ton of xp (~30k xp in 2min) .. too easy. Mainly you play solo (if you got no friends who play with you) cause the Chat is dead. The Pilot Tokens you need to unlock a new Frame (Sub Class) are avaiable as soon as you reach lv 40, otherwise u need to invest around 12$ each frame. If this Game gets rereleased in the next 2 years i might try it again, but for now its nothing i want to play.			"

												I still owe Firefall a review after 300+ hours of playing. I guess it's time to do it.My concept of Firefall in a nutshell is ""three Cs"": cozy, comfortable, and casual. It is a small world of several islands of life amongst an ocean of sinister, death-bringing dark energy.  You won't be lost amidst huge wastelands like you do in Planetside 2, for example. Nothing is far from you, and quite soon all the whereabouts will be familiar to you - as if it was a humble village where you spent your childhood. The bright and sunlit Coral Forest will be a place you'll always want to return to.Game creators invested a lot of effort into making Firefall friendly, easy, and fun. You'll constantly feel their care for you - just from the moment when they'll give you a personal bike at the very beginning, so that you would not have to waste time running around on feet. It might even be demotivating a bit: you've just started, and you already have everything you basically need.It's a game where you can come to and find some activity to engage in for an hour or two. Or more. There's always something going on. A minor mission. A zone-wide event. A huge three-staged operation. A mining enterprise. Whatever.That's what Firefall's appeal consists of for me. Other things you might be interested in knowing:- This is an MMO open-world sci-fi skill-based shooter set in distant future.- The game mostly consists of PvE content. Principal accent is made on players' cooperation against said environment; in most cases, solo playstyle is possible as well.- Open-world activities are randomly generated in certain spots. The selection of possible mission types is not very rich; seeing how the same mission develops differently each time is a more likely source of fun than the diversity of missions themselves.- Everything can be achieved for free. Any thing that can be bought for real money can also be bought for in-game money. With donations, you only get things faster.My basic advice is the same as for any other free-to-play game: it never hurts to give a try. Enter this world and see if you like it.			"

												The end-game content is really low end and makes it hard to want to lvl another class to lvl 40.Soloing throughout this game is very possible but at times very difficult.The game support is very good and the community is very nice as well.The development group is very interactive with this game and sometimes has events where the developers log on as event bosses.All and all this is a good filler game right now to pass time but does not have enough content to be a consideration for a serious game.I enjoyed the game but was dissapointed with its end game content and became stale after a short time.

												Farewell my old friend. 2 years of my life i spent playing this game, making friends and having loads of fun. I began losing interest when version 1.6 was released this year, but still hoped for a bright future. Its Very unfortunate to say that this game is Officially dead and Red5 is sending out ""goodbye"" emails to previous veterans. Steam needs to update this page badly, DO NOT PUT MONEY INTO THIS GAME. Servers are getting shutdown very soon and its very possible they will not be giving out refunds. Sorry for the news guys, but its finally over. Another title ""Ember"" is being kickstarted right now. Its basically Firefall 2, with a lot of original devs from Red5. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ember-forums-website-art-videogames#/ Been a Great run and Thanks so much to everyone for the good times. 10/10 would play again.-XenoWaffle			"

												I love this game. It's awesome. I started playing Fire Fall about 3 years ago. Like many people I was dissapointed iwith the direction it seemed to be taking. The crafting was impossibly difficult to understand, thumping was getting old, aand I decided to waiot until its official release to give it another shot.There are some minor issues, but don't let these distract from the truly awesome game that Fire Fall now is. With the release to the public, this is not the end of the development. It is the beginning. Red 5 plans on continuously updating FireFall with new missions, new enemies, and a progressing story line that who knows where it will go.The world is massive and growing. the gameplay is challenging and the Campaign missions keep you motivated to level up by completing jobs and Ares missions. While these may seem to some a bit repetitive, they are the tasks you complete to play the real meat of the gameplay which is the campaign missions.The crafating has been revamped and although I am just now starting to explore that aspect of the game, I already like how it's implemented. It makes sense without having to google it, and the many battleframes available with their own unique weapons offer different ways to strategize.NO PAY WALL. This isn't some freemium game meant to trick you into committing time into a game only to slam into a poorly implemented pay wall. There is NO pay wall. The stuff you buy is cosmetic, the abililty to upgrade faster will appeal to many, but for those not interested in spending a dime, you won't be committed to grinding endlessly to up your experience. there's some grinding but I find it quite well balanced and not a chore to complete but rather a nice way to really get to know the world.Some minor issues are inconsistent quality of animation, some of the early missions are a bit annoying and overly simple, but once you get to about level 10, things really start o get interesting.If you played this game before and gave up on it, you must really give it a try. This is not the game from beta testing, this is a seriously awesome game that I look forward to spending many hours  playing.Excellent job Red 5!I have approximately 99 hours logged in so far, and just hit level 21			"

												First I'm not used to mmos.  I played this game alone for 10-15h and found it ""really not bad"". Univers setting are pretty cool. (I dont like medieval fantastic things, so that probably why I never really tried any mmo).Gameplay is cool. Multiple classes that you really feel are differents.Story ? hmmm I can't tell, I pretty much didn't care about it. But one of the NPC has a cool voice with nice accent ... (sorry, can't tell that much)Visuals : clearly not  ""top notch graphics"" but it's fine enough. some models are clearly♥♥♥♥♥♥ some are good. The general univers is kinda nice to look at. It's always a pleasure to get a look at the full panorama when you're on top of an high mountain :Dsound ?  bah... I can't tell... I muted the music after 1-2hours because I prefer to listen to my own spotify playlists while runing aroundf2p/p2w ?  seems fine enough. Played the first 20h without investing. Was good enough, but a lot of time ""wasted"" in walking around.  then I decided to give it a ""retail price"" and put 50€ in. Bought some way to move around and ... It was worth it :Dother : pretty good lag compensation management. I was looking for a game to hang out with a friend who went in china (I'm in EU) while chatting over mumble. Was pretty easy find a place to meet and join the same squad,... It will probably be our new place to hang out, drink, speak and kill some monsters around :DQuick profile of what I usualy play/like : FPS  (not military ones) solo or multi  (tf2, bulletstorm, borderland)			"

												The game provides you with a moderate open world to explore, but thats about it. (3 level restricted maps. 1 pvp zone and a handfull of mission maps) Its extremely easy to level up. You can do it solo all the way to 40 or with a group, it doesnt matter. In the end it should take you no more than a week to hit 40.Once you hit 40 you have a few options.1. For every class you get to 40, you get to unlock one advanced class. In which you can get that one to level 40 and unlock another one. 2.You use your level 40 and do the same 2 end game missions with a small group and hope you get good items for your end game build3. You can participate in some utterly broken PVP where people fly around and spam their AOE weapons and destroy the other classes with no AOE and cant hit fast moving targets.When it comes to skills, you get to use only 4 plus an extra 2 that you can change out ones you dont like. And with an advanced class you can use the 6 from the basic default class, but thats about it. Not alot of variety.This game lacks serious content for a game thats been around since 2012 and will end in extreme boredom for any serious gamer. Don't get me wrong. this game was fun for a little while, but it got boring fast.			"

However the amount of problems I ran into in the first like 10 minutes was ridiculous on top of the fact apparently they moved the servers so everything is SUPER laggy...I really would have loved to play this game more but the lag and the bug where the boss didnt even show up for the fight just made me have enough I am going to stop playing it for a few days maybe check if its any better or worse but I would not recommend this game at this moment.

												This may be my first review. This game is awful enough that it deserves it.Tried playing this for about 6 hours, ran into so many bugs during the time I actually needed to recreate my character twice, and finally ended it when we (friend of mine and myself) were repeatedly refused to enter a mission, and were disconnected a few times instead.This game has no place on the market, free or not. It's not playable. Do not download this game. It is an utter and complete waste of time.While in game, we noticed very very few players, the market had a very slim amount of items, there were basically no random camps or spawns anywhere on the open map, and the game heavily limits what you're allowed to use by what class you choose.Absolutely could not recommend this game to anyone. The production team should be ashamed. Steam should remove this from the store. Awful.			"

												Firefall is an amazing journey.  Graphically appealing, all the right FPS elements a decent job with gearing and skills and even has a pretty compelling meta-story.  But the harsh wash-rinse-repeat nature of the questing eventually wore me down and I could not bring myself to login.MMO all suffer from the ""collect X from Y"" model of questing.  Its the really good MMOs that make you forget you are doing that very thing that command a large client base.  Firefall is not very successful at this IMHO.  I eventually tired of logging in to do this everyday.Come for the journey but be prepared for the destination.			"

												I was a founder for this game because I wanted to play it so bad (and it was the only way to ensure becoming a Beta player).It was a great game which had some of the best gameplay I've ever played in a mmo. WAS. tldr; I can't force myself to re-learn how this game is 'supposed' to be played every bloody year.....It's a game that I'd enjoy delving into for a week or two for 2-4 hours a days until I tired of what was currently available (or I had unlocked), set it down for a month, then have nostalgia for the fun gameplay and pick it back up again.Eventually I had played enough that I had leveled up my favourite battleframe (the Raptor), and this was way back in the good old Beta.Which was awesome, I had fun running around terrozing the wild life and finding some chosen spawn points (not really an incurision or invasion at that point). It. Was. Fun.They hinted at these new awesome battleframes (dubbed ""Tier 3""), which I wanted so much. So far each frame had opened up a plethora of differing gamestyles and I was excited to see what the next level of specilization would bring (maybe a cloaking short range recon?) to the battleframes.Eventually I got tired of waiting for these to come out so I took a break. Time passes and I come back online to find that everything has changed; character progression, crafting, thumping, materials. Ugh. okay. That did give me more to do, but it seemed to just muddy the waters more than anything else. Now instead of being able to focus on enjoying playing the game my way, I've now got this need to start grinding away at these other aspects of the game to get my goodies.Which... Okay... Beta. What did I expect? That I'd be able to make some meaningful progress in this game? Maybe not in Beta, I was resigned to the fact that this would probably happen once it was released out of Beta... Sadly, it did happen. Patch 1.0 Everything changes yet again.... Okay, now I've releveled and relearned how the battleframes, equipment, and abilities work. Whooo? I've sunk hundreds of hours into this game... And after releasing from the Beta I still don't have my bloody Tier 3 battleframes? W.T.F.Okay, but they did include some story, I could try it....Since then... I've managed maybe 65+ hours in this game. I've had to ""relearn"" how this bloody game works too many times to do it once again. Then....Today.I read about patch 1.6>_<WTF!?Now patch 1.7Sooo.... the only new battleframe that you have ever released? You removed? The fact that I had finally acheived the mystical 900 power rating for firefall and could do some endgame content, and then the next time I open my game up I'm back with only level 20 equipment and my guns are now all un-modded? Ugh. Not again. But... okay, I'll give it a shot... wait, you've removed all the original battleframes (after level 20) and the only new battelframe you've released you've now removed? WTF!? I've been wanting to play as a Tier 3 battleframe since the end of the first year of the Beta. Now that I'm not in beta I am stopping here. Why would I keep playing a game that keeps wiping my progress and forcing me to adopt something else? Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and stop re-making this game. Maybe, I dunno, release the next level of frames, don't just♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone's equipment and force them to grind out a whole new set. that isn't new content. Matter of fact, the majortity of this overhaul reminds me so heavily of the beta it hurts....>_<			"

												This was a game that I originally attempted to play about two to three years ago when I saw the yogscast play it. I never managed too and forgot about it in a day or so. I found the game again and was exstactic to play it at last, and when I did, I was sorely disappointed. The gameplay is what you could guess for an MMO but what really stood out like a sore thumb was the lag, technical difficulties (such as the world not rendering or deep water on land.) and freezing. Also the game was a far cry from the one I saw the yogscast do.All in all, not all to fun. But if you can iron out the kinks perhaps you'll get some enjoyment from it, but personally I don't recommend it.			"

												I played this game a while back and hated it, decided to give it another go recently and I'm glad I did. There's a strange lack of open-world MMO shooters, but this one has still managed to mostly slip under the radar somehow, and it's a shame because it's a pretty decent game.The core gameplay is pretty simplistic, but it's reasonably challenging for the most part without relying on being grossly unfair, and the ""big gimmick"" of being able to jump around with your rocket pack while you shoot at enemies from above works fairly well, with most combat taking place in big open areas that allow you to make good use of the environment. Although the basic combat never really changes, the five basic battleframes that you start out with have enough little variations in weapons and abilities that they feel pleasingly different from each other, with the advanced versions building out on the basic ones to accentuate a particular playstyle.There's not much in the way of equipment, but just about everything can be upgraded and modified by adding modules, so you have quite a degree of freedom to tweak your loadout to suit you. Unfortunately you can't really modify the appearance of the battleframe itself other than paint colours and patterns (most of which are locked behind a gambling/paywall) but there are a decent enough number of options to customise your character, and there's a good number of customisation options unlocked without having to pay extra so you shouldn't have much trouble making your character look how you want, and you can re-do your character's appearance at any time for free.The levelling curve has been smoothed out considerably, and you can quite comfortably keep at an appropriate level to progress through the campaign quests without having to take time out and grind for excessive amounts of time. The plot is paper thin, but the quest text is mercifully unobtrusive, to the point that you'll probably miss most of it if you're not paying attention, leaving you to focus on the important business of killing everything in sight. Even with what little expositionary dialogue there is, it does a decent enough job at keeping you interested in the world with a mixture of one-off quests, short chains that lead you around a particular zone, and longer quests which tie multiple zones together and reveal a little bit of backstory, together with a much longer campaign quest chain that will keep popping up all the way to the level cap. There's also countless random repeatable quests which pop up randomly in the world, and zone events pop up fairly frequently that break up the monotony of questing and grinding.There's no avoiding the fact that it's a F2P game, however, and the game's certainly not shy about reminding you about it at every possible opportunity. To its credit though, there's very little which is essential to the game that isn't available for free, and as the premium currency is tradeable in-game it's possible in principle (although very, very tedious) to grind your way to anything. In any event, most of the premium content falls under the categories of pure vanity items (battleframe paint jobs and decals), slightly better versions of things you can get a free version of (vehicles and consumable items) or convenience (XP bonusses, or instant unlocks for advanced battleframes).Ultimately, the core gameplay is entertaining, there's plenty of content to keep you interested, everything looks great, and while the F2P mechanics are everywhere they don't utterly hamstring you like so many games do. Definitely worth giving it a go.			"

The fact that I had finally acheived the mystical 900 power rating for firefall and could do some endgame content, and then the next time I open my game up I'm back with only level 20 equipment and my guns are now all un-modded? Ugh. Not again. But... okay, I'll give it a shot... wait, you've removed all the original battleframes (after level 20) and the only new battelframe you've released you've now removed? WTF!? I've been wanting to play as a Tier 3 battleframe since the end of the first year of the Beta. Now that I'm not in beta I am stopping here. Why would I keep playing a game that keeps wiping my progress and forcing me to adopt something else? Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and stop re-making this game. Maybe, I dunno, release the next level of frames, don't just♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone's equipment and force them to grind out a whole new set. that isn't new content. Matter of fact, the majortity of this overhaul reminds me so heavily of the beta it hurts....>_<			"

												I've played it a bit, it's fun, found out about the prices on the marketplace, 45 actual, REAL US DOLLARS for a 2-man vehicle.This is a fun game, sorta, but all the missions are so ♥♥♥♥ing dumb, like you have to kill a robot that constantly regenerates heatlh, while being chased by DOGS your not supposed to kill, dafuq? The story is slightly better from my experience, also you have to reach level 40 to use advanced characters, then you can only pick one, or buy another one for 12 US dollars, ok actual game, but the repetitive GRIND and inhuman prices turned me off.Final rating: 6/10			"

												So I have 40 hours into the game and so far it appears to be a good game. I love the crafting portion of the game and the refining of crude materials to be used as the base for more complex items. The server stability is not the best, but it is far from the worst also. This past week end it was impossible for a squad to stay together. The server chat, friends list, quest reward system and general NPC interaction was broken.  Today (Tuesday) the server keep rubber banding and dragging back to where i wAS 5 secs prior.I like the reward for logging every day.  you getting bonuses for experience or gather of resources based on consecutive days of logging in and playing. Once you miss one day, it resets and you start building up again. The FPS feel of the game is right and the graphics are beautiful. The enemies are challanging and the gear earned as rewards are good enough to carry you through without crafting at all. Travel is a bit challenging but even that is a sort of fun challenge in that you have to glide to your next location. It becomes a game within the game to make it without landing short. There are lots of regional events that spawn in that typically get all those int he area involved and the rewards are satisifying enough for you to stay involved in the next one you see pop up.It is early but so far I think Red5 has a winning combo in FireFall. Overall score is 4 out of 5 Stars so far.			"

												Alright you aren't going to like this review just to warn you.This game friggin sucks, it might as well be called borderlands 3. It's everything I hate about mmos, no customization, grinding stupid quests(get me 10 rat skulls so I can make a flux capacitor.) No real indepth crafting.Maybe I'm spoiled, maybe I'm used to sandbox games, but this game just doesn't do it for me. I didn't get a chance to try the pvp but that's because I was so bored by the time I figured out what I was doing I just stopped playing.Boarderlands 3, thats it, play it if you like borderlands or facepaced shooters, but stay away from it if you are looking for an mmo to try.I can't even compare it to an mmo really, it's an mmo in the sense borderlands had a baby with wow, but then it inherited none of the wow traits. I don't get why this game is even being made, it's just some rehashed mumbo jumbo with nothing new to spice things up. During my time playing I didn't find anything that made me stop and say ""cool"". It's was like I was being tricked into playing because I was wearing a mech suit. The voice acting is terrible as well.I will try this game a bit more and perhaps change my review. But I am unimpressed thus far and it takes quite a bit of harddrive space up for what it is.			"

												I have played over 3,600 hours on Firefall and have enjoyed every minute of it. Right now I am missing it terribly.I think I am addicted to it and am in the midst of withdrawel symptons,  since I can not think of any other game to take it's place, and keep trying to log on, but have not been able to since the first week in September around the 9th 2016. I began Firefall when it was full of variaty in missions, maps, spontaneous occurances, crafting, armour, and weapons. It had an excellent story paced just about right to fit with all the different things to do, and many forms of travel over the various maps.  There were a multitude of ways to meet and overcome obstacles or battle. Firefall had no limits or was the closest to a no limit game I've ever played. It was full of choices and freedoms.The art and color were beautiful within the Firefall world (and on each character) which made exploration of this world a continuing adventure.  Although I must admit it's cartoony style did at first give a somewhat childish look to it which caused me some concern about gameplay.  However after the first couple of hours of play through this colorfully beautiful world, I found the world and it's gameplay to be a remarkable experience. (Over which all concern for childish look and play rapidly disappeared.)But the problem became that all the game began to disappear little by little, then so rapidly it was impossible to keep up with, until it was to late to believe the changes were to be for the better.There are a lot of monsters in games. We battle and overcome these monsters on a daily basis and we become quite good at it.  But I want to know what monster totally destroyed this wonderful game, this work of art until there was nothing left not even a back door allowing us to return to it's wonders. Talk about hate.......someone must have really hated this game to have so competely destroyed it.........and leave it with not a single breath of hope.I could go on but you are probably bored.  So I'll go cry a little more to myself and try to forget.			"

												It was fun, once. And at the time I thought it just needed more content. But since then, with every new mission type they nerf an old one that used to be fun, make the progression system even more punishing. Hell, in the last update they REMOVED A CLASS from the game. Primary weapons used to have two fire modes, now they have one. The amount of enjoyable gameplay they have REMOVED from the game for NO REASON significantly outweighs any improvements the game has accumulated over the years.And it just makes me feel betrayed. Why bother to play, they'll just reset your progression in the next patch? Why bother to unlock the frames, they'll just remove them. Why farm when the resources will be deleted? There's nothing this game can offer you, because all the devs do is take it away again and again to try to eke out just a little more money from their dwindling player base.But now even the whales have left. Look at the gameplay stats. This is what happens when a game with so much promise is released into the world to be enjoyed, only for the devs to continuously change EVERYTHING without improving ANYTHING.Maybe you'll have fun if you haven't played it before. But don't spend money on it. And for the love of god, if you have played Firefall in the past, DON'T COME BACK. It will just make you angry, and sad.Edit: I know I've played more than Steam says I have. At least 60 hours, albeit most before the steam release.			"

												Not recommended for returning players in all honesty, they screwed this game up beyond levels. New players however, wont know the difference obviously. Though they will have a fun time untill they hit the bugfall wall. They completely changed the game. Not for the better. My rhino is pretty much useless now unless you enjoy aiming a boring laser beam within 30m. The movement system got nerfed the same way that warframe nerfed theirs. Much slower, and you now have to camp like a ♥♥♥♥♥ to surivive. The class that supposedly was a tank has now the most damage. And people are straight out blocking all your shots with their moving thunderdome. Oh, and ofcourse you got like 6 blocking thunderdomes, because everyone plays mammoth because its op.The amount of bugs are unreal, and in all honesty some bugs should be fixed within no time. Not just annoying side bugs, but also alot of critical ones. Raiding? have fun trying to even get into the queue with you group, and if that works, there is a 80% chance someone dropped out. Forcing you to do it all over again just to be fair to that person. As far as ive seen about 60% of the campaigns arent working, and the ones you can queue for are absolutely redicioulous. The bosses do no damage at all, while the adds can simply 3 shot you. This game wont even remember your armor paint & decal. If you simply joined a raid you can customize it all over again. As alot have mentioned aswell, its all about tinkering now, and getting boosts. The tinker system has been used for so long in other games, i never thought red 5 would go down this road too. With this update they took everyones items, promised us we would be compensated. All my frames were pretty much full gear. Now i only have 1 fully geared. Some people spent more time in farming items than me. Like for instance the lancer bike which takes a good amount of time to get, and its simply gone now. Some people are still playing and claiming to be smart in making good investments or by kissing moderators butts. They just dont know yet its all for nothing and they will never get anything back. Its not even worth the time to get anything at this point since L45 and L50 patch will drop IN LIKE 6 MONTHS.in all honesty its a update in progress, but i think they are already losing to many players. And there are posts from players that proof that the game is dying, with a current 800ish playerbase and dropping (which used to be over 2000). Well at this stage, it deserves to die.			"

												Lag killed this game for me. Add the fact that the game has a Chinese server, but we can't just switch the server, only. Noooo, the whole game has to be in Chinese so I can actually play properly.Graphics are colorful and toony, though the lack of variety in the character customization put me off. Males all look like muscle-bound Neanderthals, and Females have tiny hornet waists.In all honesty, I can't recommend this train wreck of a game, sure, I'm not making a detailed review, but the fact that the game is unplayable due to latency issues prevents me from actually experiencing what this game has to offer.

What it lacks currently, however, is compelling gameplay, clear paths and rules, all the while falling into the greatest threat to an emerging MMO: overcomplexity without overexplanation.

												As of writing this review I have only played the game for around 9 hours. I am in love with it. This MMORPG that is ALSO F2P is 100% worth the whole $0 you have to spend to get it. I am most likely gonna upgrade to digi deluxe or starter sometime in the near future just because of how AWESOME this game is. Red5 did what most can't. Make a good MMORPG that isn't too rediculous in any form. I LOVE THIS GAME :D and if you are still skeptical I recommend watching twitch.tv/kinggothalion he mostly streams Borderlands 2 but he will occasionaly stream Firefall so hang out in his stream and check it out!

												I played Firefall for a bit back in the Closed Beta stages before it came to Steam, and I have to say, back then it got very repetitive real fast, an absolute grindfest to even get a semi-decent upgrade as well as quite the confusing gear management system. And for that reason I stopped playing for a few months, during said months A LOT of patches and updates came out, amongst them were some major ones that overhauled a lot of things. The one major thing that brought me back was the overhaul to the crafting system, or Manufacturing system as it is in game as I personally like that kind of aspect to an MMO. Before there was a whole lot of various minerals that you needed to collect just to make a single component, ergo the grindfest as well as pretty much needing a decent group of people to thump (You use a ""Thumper"" machine to extract minerals from the ground, but it attracts all sorts of mobs to attack it which can then be destroyed, pretty much a defend the objective mission) who are willing to be there for a couple of hours to gain the needed thousands of resources as well as travelling from place to place checking for said minerals. Now it is comprised of actually researching what you want to make via research points which you can earn by Salvaging items you get as well as manufacturing, along with some Crystite, the in game currency. It also had some much needed changes to progression in the game like actually having a proper leveling based system with essentially designated leveling areas of the map like in World of Warcraft, which many of the older hardcore players dislike as they believe it takes away from the freedom of it being Open World and in a way they are right but at the end of the day it is a system more friendly towards luring in new players so they don't get lost as to what to do without bombarding the chat with ""What do I do?"". I have yet to actually experience the endgame due to not actually being top level, but as well as not even knowing about what the actual endgame is...Aside from that, the game looks beautiful and runs smoothly, the gunplay is different and in a good way, you can essentially switch classes or Battleframes on the fly depending on the situation.It's definitely worth a try considering how much it changed along the way of testing (for the better in my opinion) as well as it being free to play and in no way pay 2 win at all. But what I would suggest is actually trying to get a couple of friends in on it as well as it seems like in the long term it will be much more fun playing with friends.			"

The open world is beautiful and a joy to explore(if you have a vehicle that is), the different batteframes and their various abilities are really fun to use in combat. The only thing I disliked about the game was the lack of player interaction, since I wasn't in an Army I often felt alone in the world since there isn't any real reason to team up with others other then the many different open world events that randomly generate throughout New Eden.

												It makes me angry that a good game went south. The quote below is from Red 5's wikipedia page.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Since July 2016,[14] all of the Red5 development team, including the Community Manager FadedPez, has been fired. Remnants of the Red5 crew have joined together to develop the new game Ember, which is based on the original concept of Firefall (Pre-The9),[15] which is based in the universe of their table-top game Crixa, of which both are being developed by Crixa Labs, a company led by Mark Kern for making it. As of now there are no official statements regarding the future of Firefall from The9, but it is confirmed that the servers are still on, but the authenticating servers for new players are not.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game was easily on my list of up and coming favorites. It still would be had their wikipedia page not spelled doom for their product. I have the game installed, and was enjoying it earlier today. I suspect, to my sadness, this game will soon join video game heaven with Star Wars Galaxies. RIP my friend. You will be missed.			"

												For those that need an honest review from the perspective of an honest player, feel free to continue reading. Firefall, by Red 5 Studios, is a more futuristic take on the post-apocalyptic setting that is famously loved due to the Fallout series. The game focuses on different ""battleframes"", as well as a decent assortment of weapons to take out different kinds of enemies that have been altered or have been taking advantage of the plot leading to present day.You are designated ARES 35, passing the ARES initiative and is known by many alike as a mercenary. The story goes that a ship feeding off a substance known as crystite has crashed and caused what many call M-Day. The Melding, a dangerous curtain of energy fatal to humans, has allowed an alien race known as the Chosen to attempt an entire assimilation on Earth. As ARES 35, working with a military presence known as the Accord, your primary goal is to see the end of the Chosen's assault and restore Earth to it's glory once again.Now I have played before the amazing 1.6 update, as well as during it, so I can tell you about the improvements as well as the cons that come with it. It used to be hard to get anywhere on FireFall due to the lack of tutorial, as well as it was hard for many that play alone, thus not many have been able to complete everything at the time. However, many improvements have eased the stress for solo players, however you will still need assistance from time to time.The battleframes you can choose are as follows:- Assault: Your typical DPS/somewhat-Tank frame, using a Plasma Cannon that can deal massive damage directly to a target, however considering the weapon isn't hitscan, you are bound to miss. It is an AoE weapon, so you don't necessarily have to be completely accurate to deal damage. You're also equipped with abilities to improve your mobility and damage capabilities, such as Meteor Strike and Shockwave.- Dreadnaught: Your typical Tank frame, focusing on using the shield on your mob-shredding minigun/gatling gun to mitigate damage. You are also the bulkiest, which is heavily improved by abilities such as Heavy Armor and Absorption Bomb.- Biotech: Medic, medic, MEDIC! That's right, your Healer archetype frame is the Biotech, capable of healing allies and damaging enemies alike. With the Smart Blaster, you can deal AoE damage, and you have abilities to keep yourself and other ARES pilots on the field alive, with examples being Healing Generator and Heroism.- Recon: You can agree with the Sniper from TF2 with this frame by telling others that sniping is a good job, mate. The Recon frame is focused on being away from the front lines, picking at important targets to allow your team a job well done. Using a modified assault rifle with zoom capabilities, you can eye on your prize and pick them off with ease. This also helps with the ability to throw Remote Explosives and call in an Artillery Strike if need be.- Engineer: So I heard you like erecting sentries? You'll do great as an Engineer. Being the jack-of-all-trades, the Engineer doesn't excel at all, but doesn't fail at all. Your main offense and defense is via the strategic use of deployable buildings that require constant repairing via FIRIN YER LAZOR. This laser heals buildings and damages enemies, so pick your poison. As well as deploying a sentry on the field, you can also drop a supply station to replenish health and ammo, and don't forget the best toy in your arsenal, the Anti-Personnel Turret. Jump into that bad boy and shred some aliens!Pros:- You can choose from one of 5 battleframes. During pre 1.6, you could freely switch between the base frames, but it would have made it hard to level up all of them when you start off. However, to make it easy to level up, they limit you to the frame you chose when you created your character.- Before 1.6, you needed to have either paid Red Beans for a chance to used an Advanced Battleframe, or have reached level 40 with a frame to get a token necessary to get one. Now, you simply need to reach level 20 to receive a mission that allows you to choose an Advanced Battleframe based on the base Accord battleframe that you chose. For example, if you are an Engineer, you would have the choice of the Bastion or the Electron. They let you test both of these frames before you make your final choice (personally, Bastion is a freaking beast).- Instead of boring you to death by forcing you to read a board in order to find a job to do, you can now talk to specific NPCs around New Eden to get jobs to do. You can do jobs that help you find out the legacy of the previous ARES 35, or you can try to help a corporal by knocking some sense into him. The choice is your's.- Being in an open world can lead to risk or reward. Look all around New Eden for stuff to do, from extracting materials via thumpers to defending the Skydock from a Chosen invasion. If you want to rock and roll with lots of players, get your backside to Stonefall for a confrontation with a brontodon bigger than Dame Edna.Cons:- If you're far from the US or EU, you'll most likely have latency issues, thus impairing your ability to whup some butt and take names in the world of FireFall. We're still waiting for a server near Australia, but one can dream, right?- Some enemies in the game are downright broken to the point that you'll outright get destroyed by them solo. If you have no friends that play FireFall, and have issues partying up to deal with these broken enemies, you're gonna have a bad time (fight me, Sans).- The game, while not being completely Pay2Win, does have P2W qualities in a few places. Looking good, for example, is one of them. I do want to win at being stylish, however you'll have to convert crystite into credits to buy from the market, and currency conversion has a limit regardless of if you're VIP or not (as far as I know).- Some elements in the game can glitch and break, much like every other video game in existence. For example, as I'm doing this review, Skydock is bugged. We'll have to wait for a patch or a maintenance to hopefully fix this.I recommend this game over a number of FPS games available on Steam, but not all. FireFall is a very strong contender in the F2P game battlefield, and only the proper updates can make this game soar.			"

So far it feels like the only way you can die is from falling.

The grind is real in this game though so keep that in mind.2 years of content can be found inside my YouTube playlist if you are interested in getting some ideas of this game.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA82B75710B73F0A2 "

												Firefall has been through some rough times. I started playing in April 2012 and have seen the game change many times. Not every change has been one that people have liked, and months of progress have seemingly been tossed out at times. Not a few months ago I was of the mindset that Firefall was a dead game and nobody should bother playing it anymore. However, I don't feel that the game should be discounted yet, though. The launch patch will be Red5's final shot to show the world that their game is worth playing, and I feel that they might really pull through this time around with all of the things they've shown to the public so far. Launch looks to be the biggest and boldest update they've put out, from what they've shown in their ""Path to Launch"" series of blog posts on their site. More than tripling the size of the playable game area, adding in craploads of new creatures to fight, generated quests with dialogue, going back to a leveling system, removing permanent breakage of items, and many other changes that people have wanted for awhile.Give the game another shot come launch! I've been pleasantly surprised so far, and I'm sure I'll continue to be as I finally get to see what the game looks like at launch in the next few weeks. You may be surprised what you find, too.			"

												I just linked this game to steam.  I have played hundreds of hours, not the small amount shown here.  This game was once the most promising MMO I have ever played (and I have played a ton of MMOs).  But poor leadership lead it to a really bad place.  A guy named Mark Kern was at the reins.  He created a masterpiece but destroyed it and wasted the company's money as he grew bored.  He has since been fired, but a lot of damage was done.  I will never touch anything with his name on it again.The funnest thing to me was the PVP, A real FPS mmo with jet packs and a great variety of weapons that all feel good and different. The maps were designed very well. But good ol' Mark ripped it from the game because he had a cry baby fit (that was years ago). Soon they are brining the pvp back! I can't wait.  It is a TON of fun!As for the PvE side, It's pretty good...  The gameplay is smooth, the combat feels good.  The graphics aren't great for today, but they aren't terrible.  Thumping is a fun event where you call down a mining drill to collect metals while being swarmed by various enemies who are attracted by the sound of the thumper.  You have a small collection of thumpers, small ones for solo play and large ones for group play.  Thumping alone is worth hours of fun with a large thumper and a group.  There is also a story line and quests for leveling as well as some world bosses, events, and 5 man dungeons.  The difficulty of the game is just right, Its easy, but get too cocky and there is a good chance you will get swarmed and killed.Firefall is a fun game, It has all the right pieces, It's all up to the development team to put them together to form a masterpiece.

												I tried the game for like less than hour? and I was forced to quit afterwards due to a lot of annoying bugs and glitches. I liked it in a way that when you fix all the bugs and other problems its perfect for me! A huge MMO where you can interact with a lot of players, You can do quests together, you can climb rocks, use your jetpack from here to there. Its like borderlands with a twist of other games, but sadly problems are there to ruin it. I know its P2P but damn! its like its still in beta. Theres a lot of bugs like the main menu freezing picture, MAJOR AUDIO DESYNC. 2 background music playing at the same time, multiple NPC talking to you, etc. Also theres no character customization at the beginning? or am I supposed to do that later at the game? or was my game bugged out? Running the game in ultra high but still i get jagged edges, blurry textures, etc. Also I always get a lag spike and getting delayed actions in some ways, I don't know if its my internet or the server. Also, it would be greater if theres another server. Players are all crammed up in 1 server! You don't know anymore what will you do with the mission. I expected more from FireFall, considering its been in Beta for quite some time and I think a lot of players paid for the closed beta which should make the game better. Well I guess I should wait for a couple of days or weeks to get a better quality of the game.I would recommend it IF YOU ARE PATIENT with the updates, fix, etc. I guess for now thats the condition, but when all problems are fixed, well I would really recommend it to those who are fans of 1st/3rd person shooter, jetpack action, MMORPG, with a lot of weird stuff games!

												Great game! Have only played a couple of ours, which is not enough to rate an MMO on... However what I've seen and played so far it looks great!Great graphics, fun shooting gameplay. So far it seems the things you do spend real money on are cosmetic changes.			"

												So, this is a don't recommend, but it isn't wasn't a bad game really. Allow me to explain.There's this other game, called Defiance (launched April 2, 2013). It's essentially the same game. Now, since Firefall was launched July 29, 2014, you'd think it would be better... well, it's not, it's... just different.Similarities: Both third person MMORPGs ""Something"" happened that made the Earth as we know it. This ""something"" transmutated the fauna / flora. There are different classes for your character. You can level up your character. There is a tech tree. There are weapon mods. You can upgrade your characters personal equipment. There are bugs. Why always bugs. Anyway, think 'bug like extra-terrestrial animals'. There are multiple areas, as per any MMORPG There are quests - again MMORPG. You play an alignment where the locals don't take too kindly to you. But you earn their respect by not being a turd, and helping them. There's a local presence by the world wide millitary, then don't like you much either... look you get the idea.Differences: In Firefall, you're an ARES pilot - in Defiance, you're an ARK Hunter. In Firefall, there's the option of being an Engineer. (yay!) You can place turrets etc. In Firefall, If you get in too much water, you fritz out your power armor. <insert no swimming sign here> Ummmm. They call their in-game currencies different names :D Oh! In Firefall, you can jump out of the zone-transportation-dropshop. Always fun. :)""Ok, so they're the same in almost every way. Why the negative review?""Good question. The quests in Firefall are often buggy. The way points are sometimes funky, and sometimes downright unhelpful. And it's because of this, that I've hit the don't recommend.Beyond that though, it's ok. There's not a huge number of players, but enough not to be lonely.-- edit--After writing this, and reading some other reviews, I've found out some extra information. I haven't played this game in the last 6 months, and during that time, there was an update. ""The update that killed Firefall"" is apparently what ""the community"", who I didn't know existed, calls it. Either studio that made Firefall or the game as an entity was purchased, and the update of doom was pushed out, prior to being ready.I don't think I'll be revisiting this game, as I would like to remember it as it was, and not as what I'm seeing represented in the reviews / on the internet.

												Very anxious to see this project in its launch phase, it's been through a lot of changes during beta, but given how ambitious the concept is, couldn't have been any other way.Seeing the world of FireFall expand, from the first testing days when we were waiting for PvP matches in a tiny courtyard, to the rich world it has today, was a really nice journey.Definitely give it a shot. If you like shooting things in the face only to stop once in a while to stand in awe at the beautiful scenery around you, the game will get you hooked.			"

I haven't played a game like this where it is an open world and you can get lost in all the content and get sidetracked for hours playing random events and encounters. I first thought this would just be a game i play once in a while, but this is becoming a game that would become my go to game.			"

												I've been in Firefall sine the start. Alpha, Closed Beta, Open Beta, and now, the Launch. And i'm still here.There are ups and downs, there are goods and bads. And for those who have give up on Firefall, maybe you can give this one an another shot.A massive beautiful world, big bosses, plasma balls, lazers, lots of bullets, power armor, jetpacks, glider wings, open world events, such as a Melding Tornado or you'll get picked as the Chosen Deathsquad's Target, or Chosen Invasion, team up with other players in the world, defend the town that the Chosen are trying to take over.Also, you should totally check out the Firefall Community http://forums.firefallthegame.com/community/Give it a try, maybe you'll like Firefall ;) "

												I will send out a Recommend for this game....It has a really good Fight(combat) system! Really big open world.. and one thing I have found that I miss from MMO's is I want to walk west and you you but your only a level 5 you can still go in the 10-15 area, granted you will die.... but still open world!Likes---Open world!Solo playing... It's hard so a even on like and dislike.... you can play Solo and still get far but if you want to have fun and enjoy a lot more of the game[like most MMO's] Get friends and join a guild.... anything to join a combat group..Dislike--- not much really only thing is you need friends to help you on most of the missions or your really good at hit and run! Different styles of game play, based on what battle type you pick... Heavy, Assault, Snipe...etc...			"

												And the third and probably last big change to Firefall has came. And together with it, the last patch too probably.I'm a Firefall Player since 2011 I guess. This game changed a lot. And for me, change isn't a bad thing at all. I liked some of the changes they made since the game had part of Copacabana and mobs dropped Tires as loot.But this final game. Isn't for me anymore. And I've waited to this 1.7 patch to remake my review of the game.The state of the game:+Firefall have amazing combat/movement mechanics thanks to the core of the game being a Shooter.+New user experience is good.~PVP is feels good with some Battleframes.  ~Mob AI is good when it wants to...-The Story resembles a Power Ranger movie... yeah, it's that bad now. (sorry team DX)-Questing feels familiar and not very satisfying. Fetch and all.-Raids are filled with bulletsponges, the Boss Raids are also the same.-Crafting is gone. (their first crafting system was amazing though.)-Big events happen hourly in each map, but its there at least.Should you play it?Yes. It's free and as i said, new user experience is quite good. Exploring is cool and even better with friends to goof arround.Should you keep playing it?Nah, Red5 isn't going anywhere with this game. It will probably shut down pretty soon.I still love this game with all my heart. Made a lot of friends in it and joined multiple ""Armies/Guilds"" in the game. But i'll don't want to be here to see how it ends.Thanks to BRASIL, TrBr, Barcode, -AI-, [NEON], BWL and T.ROCK Armies for the home and the fun they provided me.Thanks to you that read this review and experienced the game because of it.And lastly, Thanks Red5 and ex-Red5 buddies.Your game is forever with me. Thank you again for this amazing experience, hope to see more from you all in the future.			"

												Man, people are being harsh to this game. Do you want to play a free open world shooter? Give it a try. It's free. The staff on R5 is friendly and working on the bugs / glitches. In my opinion this game is only ""grindy"" if you sit there and do the same thing all day. You can quest, do random world missions, thump for resources, and do a variety of instances. This game shows a lot of potential. Yes right now there is room for polish, it has been developed by a small company (red 5) and this is currently their only / first (I think) project. This game has gone through some major changes since its inception. It is almost a completely different game from what it was back in the closed beta.This current patch is only a couple weeks old and as such is still getting ironed out. Why did they wait a release a whole new game two weeks before launch? I have no idea. But for the price it's still hard to beat. "

												There should be a middle of the road button, but i will up rate it because its different and not ALL bad.Cons:I've been playing on and off for a few years now and as it stands there does'nt seem to b much changed and or added to the game.  They've redone the UI a few times both ingame and the crafting menu's.  The skill shots are are one of the biggest flaws of this game.  Most of the time your fighting endless waves of TINY little critters that are just more of a hassle to hit then begin and actually challenge.  You never actually care about anything you do, the missions are generic go here do this, talk to this guy go get this stuff.  Begin so open and so free to b able to reroute to something else creates allot of inurgency for your current mission/job.  Besides the random missions that can happen around you the whole game centers around thumping (collection resources) which is either extremely ez or over the top difficult.  Ai is pretty stupid, its only with sheer numbers do things become a challenge.  There are many other things i could rant about but i will wrap up with this last bit.  Traveling yes you should explore and there are ways to get to other areas quickly.  But even with the ability to fly/glide/ride a bike you will still be thinking i wish there was a faster way to get to where i'm going.Pros:Variety, ranging from what your doing and how your doing it there is many ""diffrent"" options.  I think there are 20+ different frames you can chose from and change at at hub.  Snipers, enigneers, medics, heavy gunners everything is here  the other 15+ are a mashup of these previous frames. Anyone interested in lore this game has a wealth of it, the story is pretty great i'd like to see where they go with it.  ITS NOT DEFIANCE, now for some of you this could be a good or bad thing but the jumpacks make this game open up SO much more.  Delv down into deep caves or climb the highest mountians in the area you will love flying around from place to place.  As of 7/26/14 this game needs allot more polish for me to throw some money at it, but its certianlly worth a try.  You will either b a lifer or you will not b intrested in it at all.  Just be a responsible player and give it 2-3 hrs before you uninstall it forever.			"

												If you saw this game years ago at E3, and are only first trying it, you won't be disappointed. It's a fast-paced first-or-third person shooter with RPG elements. However, instead of choosing one class per character (and having to start a new character to try a new class), you get one character per account, and can switch freely between any of 6 basic ""battleframes"" (the class-equivalent) right from the start. ""Advanced"" frames are unlocked by taking any of your available frames to level 40.Every frame has a jetpack or jumpjets, which seriously opens up the already huge world for even more exploration. Also, combat is truly three-dimensional, which presents new challenges as well as opening up new possibilities.For long distance movement, there are gliders and motorcycles available to players. Some maps even have a dropship flying around like a city bus. Complete with waiting for it to show up!Having only a single character per account means that you only have to research crafting skills once, which is good because the crafting system is the game's weakest point. Not only do you have to pay increasing amounts of ingame money and ""Research Points"" to unlock higher level gear, you also have to pay again for each degree of rarity!That's correct: you bloody well have to research the same lvl 20 gear four times (white/common, green/uncommon, blue/rare, and finally purple/very-rare), you then have to do it again at lvl 30, and AGAIN at level 40, paying exponentially more for it each time. Worse, there is a STUPIDLY large number of highly specific catagories of gear.Weapons are broken up into primary (which are frame specific with their own separate level/rarity reserach trees) and secondary (any frame). Then there are frame abilities, each frame having its own research tree.Oh, but wait! The frame ""ultimate"" abilities are called ""HKMs"" and are researched separately from from the regulars! Then there are about 8 different types of battleframe cores, each with its own research tree.Finally there are the upgrades, which are broken up between weapons and abilities, then broken up again into three main colors. AND EACH ONE OF THOSE IS ITS OWN DAMN RESEARCH TREE!*huff* *huff* *huff* So yea, the crafting system has some serious issues. Fortunately, you can get away with completely ignoring the crafting system and either earn the gear you need from missions vouchers for vendors, or hit up the in-game marketplace.To sum my review up: do I recommend this game? Yes, I do.			"

												I played this game a while back. For some reason I deleted it then I remember it. I see the recent reviews are mostly negative then I realise what had happened. R.I.P Firefall I wish I could play you again but alas you have been ruined.Honestly I miss this game already it's gameplay was solid all I remember bad about this game was the occasional crash and glitch. I hope this game shines again.			"

Product received for free
												I really tried to give this game a try once more, but I was pretty disappointed. I created a new character (Since my old one reset.) Tried to do the tutorial but the game kept lagging (not performance lag) and made it pretty much unplayable. It felt like the tutorial missions have no end, all there was to do is follow checkpoints (it was really hard to reach them with the lag). That was like, two days ago; I just tried to give it another shot, thinking maybe the servers were just laggy for a day or so. Today I could not login at all, so instead of playing the game, I am sitting here giving a negative review about it. Just bad devs, the game concept isn't so bad.Checkpoint Simulator 2016 - I do not recommend this game in the current state.			"

												Note 1) The majority of my actual time in game comes from before the game was on Steam, so my Hours Played is not accurate.UPDATEED REVIEW - Post 1.6 Patch -In my initial review of this game, I said that the game itself had changed drastically from what it was before it came to Steam, and with 1.6, it's gone and changed all over again. And not for the better,There's just too much that's changed for me to recommend this game at this point. Even more so give how crafting has been disabled until patch 1.8. Meaning a large portion of the game is simply not there for me to comment on at this time.In the end this has become a game that. while I like a lot, I can't recommend in it's current state. Far too many things from the old, pre-Steam version are missing, things that made the game dynamic and enjoyable (like Chosen incusions that could change the map).If you want to try it out, go for it. But as someone who spent time in the Beta, the game, while still fun for me, is just a shadow of what it was and what it should have been.			"

												Probably the best Free 2 Play PvE game out there that offers customisation, large maps with incredibly scenery and of course actuioin packed gameplay, so far I've loved it although due to the maps being so large you will need a vehicle which you dont get by default and the grind in this game is through the roof; for xp or for materials to builds say 1 epic item! But all in all a brilliant game!*EDIT* Red 5 Studios ♥♥♥♥ed this game, try it out it may still be good, but for us veteran players they ruined everything with that 1 patch.RIP firefall  2012 - 2015			"

												Having an absolute blast playing this game.....was never into MMOs but this game is great....its like COD advanced warfare meets Elders scrolls online.....i would recommend even if you dont like MMOs or First/third person games you should still give it a try, there is literally a ton of stuff to do i this game, there are some minor bugs i encoutered but it had a very small effect on my experience with the game. I started playing yesterday and i to my surprise im already 12hrs+ into the game and FOR ME that isnt normal.........Play it and feel more than welcome to add me to your friends list Bwiggzz.Just a side note....i noticed that there are some negative reviews about the game, which is fine, however, because of the reviews i almost didnt play the game and i am happy i did......my point is use game reviews as guidlines and not the final say because people's opinions are different and that is a good thing, but just try for yourself and see if it for you....Have a great day everyone! (or night depending on where you are)			"

												I don't understand how this game can have such a low metascore rating. That just goes to show you that you shouldn't always follow the majority.This is the most fun i've had in a shooter in years. That's the keyword here... fun.Yes, the game's buggy. There have been some awful immersion-ruining moments that I have personally experienced, a large number of times. However, the game has been behaving itself for the most part, and the issues i've run into have had some pretty easy to figure out workarounds.Yes, the game is not beautiful. It looks like a slightly blockier version of Planetside 2 with some really downright weird looking character models at times.Yes, the PvP is weird (that's the only word I can use to describe it)Yes, the voice acting is corny. At the same time, it's really charming once you get used to it. The characters and their corny dialog/voice acting just sort of starts to grow on you.But none of that mattered to me. The game was easy to follow. The mechanics were easy to learn. The classes, though not distinguishable at first glance, has a nice big icon over each player that shows you what they are. All of the game's flaws were overshadowed by the fact that I just had so much fun playing this game.I don't like the thought that the Video game industry rates gems like this so poorly while continuing to give high marks to the usual shooter excrement that comes out every year and never changes the formula. Firefall is the ideal example of a game where users should ignore reviews and try it for themselves.			"

												This is the first MMO I've played. There is a sorta low level cap of 40, but there are many different classes to level out and it's really replayable. With time I think this game will be considered very good. For now, I'm just having a lot of fun. Looking forward to new fun stuff to do. The game has been out a month and there is already a lot more stuff to do than on release day.			"

												One of the most beautifully stylized free-to-play games i have played in my life. The smooth blend of first and third-person gameplay allows for you to play in your comfort zone at all times and the game has beautiful visuals. The voice acting is great and the character-customization is also good. What is lacking however is the combat system's fluidity as the mobs i encounter seem rather clunky at times. Also there is a very blatant element of Pay-to-play boosting throughout almost all elements of the game, which may throw many people from downloading Firefall, but it hasn't had any effect on my gameplay thus far.         As for learning the game at first glance, there is barely a tutorial to show you to assign hot-keys and to use your core abilities that come with every class, although the narrator that ""accompanies"" you throughout the game does lend a helping hand from time to time with tips and tidbits here and there. The depth of the computer's aid could go a long way into making the game easier to learn from the get-go and generally more enjoyable in doing so.Overall there is no reason for you to hold back on playing this game because it's free-to-play and enjoyable on the whole, so far.

Posted: October 1, 2014
												I recommend this game with several caveats, more on that later. It is a futuristic guns and gear game with powered battle ""Frames"" to which you add big guns and cool gear. Each of the 16 Frames has special abilities and playstyles. You start out with the five basic Frames and purchase/win/aquire the other advanced Frames. You are tasked with saving what is left of humanity on Earth after a terrible calamity has devestated our once fair blue ball in space. Now mutated wildlife, alien creatures, and an alien race called the Chosen are here to eat your babies....so kill them already!!!This game can be a blast and if you like fps and rpg then this is a fpsrpg in an mmo setting that will have you saying ""Pass the ammo"". The gameplay is wild and frenetic, with guns blazing and bombs a'sploding, fun objective based mini events that pop up all over the map, and occaisional Chosen attacks and even speacial full out assaults on the last vestige of humanity,... yep you and your bros.It is a lot of fun when you first start playing, but before an hour is up you will begin to discern one of the biggest problems with this game. Poor coding, that allows a memory leak to slowly chew your graphics memory up. This brings on at first minor stuttering and intermitant frame rate drops, then progresses to chokingingly bad frame rates that make the game nearly unplayable. The first few times this happened, I put it off to a lot going on visually in the game, but I am running 2 gtx660ti's in tandem sli config, not the latest and greatest but more than able to run this game as is evident by how very smoothly the game runs for the first 30-40 mins. So I just kept rolling along wishing the game ran better, till nearly 3 or so hours (yea yea i need a life) wham, the screen went black. The game kept running as the audio filled me in on the action and my eventual death. I tried everything to get out of the game, but the video system having been overloaded could now show NOTHING, not even the os, soooo Hard Reset of my computer later, I restarted the game... and lo there was the beautiful game with great graphics and SMOOTH gameplay...for a while : (After this happened a couple times it belatedly dawned on me that this was a poor coding issue and the game was chewing graphics ram up but never swallowing, causing it to CHOKE TO DEATH...literally.I have since taken to restarting the game hourly, which brought to light that not all of the lost graphics resources are returned, it will greatly improve the gameplay for a time, but after a number of restarts you will need to reboot your machine : (There are a number of other issues that are frustratingly annoying. Loot, including the lootable currency of the game despawns...rather quickly. If you are in a long firefight (most of them are long as the main challenge seems to be throwing and inordinantly large numbers of foes for you to mow down or blow up) half the loot of the fight will be gone. If the mob has a ""mini boss"" (extra tough opponent) at the end of the line of foes then by the time you get it down little loot will be left, which is something that boggles me, I can't for the life of me come up with a reasonable explaination for why the devs are basically screwing their players out of rewards they earned. As time goes by and the HUGE costs of crafting become apparent, it starts to annoy you (or me at least). The non std items, greenies and blues etc seem to stay around much longer, but again most of the crafting raw material and the currency/crafting material Cristite...POOF gone.It is also too dark too much of the time. I understand the whole night ambiance and I understand that night offers some great settings for gameplay, but in this game it is a detractor for so much of the time to be so dark. Its a game of GUNS, you need to be able to see. There is a Moon in the sky at night, but it shines NO LIGHT so the night is VERY DARK, then there are dawn and dusk, both these periods are actually about how dark the night should realy be, to enhance the gameply. So add together dusk, night, and dawn and you get a lot of darkness. Realy I wouldnt mind if the terrain wasnt so varied and rugged, you cannot get around without the constant use of jumpjets to get you over obstacles, the foes you face are invariably very dark in color scheme so they blend in well with the darkness. Often you dont see them till they are on top of you. That would/is fine for some classes but there are classes whose talents, such as sniping are made useless, if you cant even identify a target until your on top of it, what good is being able to shoot at very long ranges? Now not all of the foes are darkly colored many of the creatures are brightly colored but the number that are, as well as the difficulty of navigating the rough terrain warrant a revision in my opinion.Ok so quests. Can you say repetitious? Well good, cause now you will get to intimately know it. It's not just that they are the same old go here kill this, go there fetch that, thats to be expected...its that they use the SAME 1 to 5 spots for all the quest in an area!!! You are repeatedly sent the same locations to do different quests. One quest it might be called a storage area, the next quest it might be a hideout for a badguy, and you're like ""I was just here"", well you do for the first few repaets then you just shrug and get on with it. But I mean really, it's not like there isn't enough terrain or locations, it's that they are re-using the code or scripts from one quest to the other and saving the coding time, just changing the details in the middle, while frugal it lacks immagination and in a game that requires a massive amount of player repetition already it is VERY CHEESY in my opinion.About that repetition....there are currently 16 Battle Frames and each one must be leveled independently, which both makes sense and is a major bore. First by having to learn the Frame's best uses over time with low level appropriate foes it is a great way to make sure you actually can use the frame to its best. That said, since the affore mention repetition of quests now really starts to take it's toll on nerves. While you can level the Frame by simply running around doing the mini events that pop up all overthe place and killing critters and bad guys, I have found that method slower than questing, as I have found that while I am doing a quest it is very easy and often needed to also do a lot of extra killing and mini events that are close by, making it a difficult decision on what path to take for each frame. Before long tho, you will begin to wish that you could just level your character and not the Frames...And lastly, Crafting - I love in game crafting, This seemed like a very very promising method of gear aquisition...until you start crafting stuff, which requires a two part expense: First you have to spend Research points you aquire by salvaging loot and materials classed as salvage items, and Cristite (affore mentioned both currency and a crafting material - the discovery of this material is the basis for all the high tech gear and weapons in the game's lore). Once researched you will then have to provide the materials needed for crafting. These are mostly aquired by Refining raw materials gained from killing critters and mining ores with the use of devices called thumpers. In addition there are multiple levels to each level of items to be crafted. If you want a green quality item you will need to first reseach the regular and then the green version and so on. There are new versions of all craftables every three of four levels and you MUST craft at least the regular version of the previous level to be able to research the next level...OK I'll cut to the chase. It takes a lot of effort!To sum it up this game is a lot of fun, I do recommend it but be aware it has ISSUES. I wouldn't spend a ton on it till they fix the memory issue tho. Enjoy!			"

												Free-to-Play sci-fi MMO Shooter, not much competition on the PC platform for that genre (Destiny is coming), for free that is. Not tempted to throw money at it yet, the metascore of 60/100 is accurate. Still a good game to play with friends and it has a lot of potential for growth. The Digital Deluxe Edition is too expensive and the Digital Starter Pack looks pale in comparison. Sure I can criticize this game on so many levels but it's free and I enjoyed playing it despite its flaws.			"

												Solo player or a group player, this game has it. Solo play by playing missions alone or doing random missions as they pop up. Or making a squad and taking the quests off of job board and random missions with ""group: recommended"" thing to easy it up. Or playing solo but helping other random people out in the open missions which everyone gets a piece of the fun. I like the class bio-tech as I can either do solo missions as well as help out other random players with the open missions like ""ARES Mission"" or ""Crashed Thumper"" or random Chosen drop pods and people need help of reviving. :) Depending on your play style, Firefall has it. Each class working from lvl 1 up, lets say you got a main lvl 26 and your friend just started this and you want to help him out, just switch to another battle frame class in lvl 1 and you both start at lvl 1 and go up from there.

												So i started yesterday (offically) and played 8 hours without stoping. This game is fun and has almost everyone. My only real thing is that there are 0 swords dagers or anything in the melee catogory other than that it's good and doesnot force you to pay for stuff to play also I wish that they keep their other packs for people to buy			"

												The Short:Pros:+  Truly Free-to-Play. All content is available through in-game play.  Premium Currency purchasable content includes cosmetics, Frames (Premium Frames also unlockable via completion of basic frames), and mounts (purchasable via the player driven market).  You don't need to spend ANY money to enjoy everything this game has to offer.+  Player driven market for premium currency.Just like in Star Trek Online, you can purchase ""Red Beans"" on the market sold by other players.  Those things that you can't buy, or aren't available on the player driven item market, can be purchased with ""premium"" currency which you bought with in game currency.  Really, the only thing I can think of needing Red Beans for is extra inventory slots (if you even need that).+  Negligible grind.It doesn't get harder, longer, grindier in upper levels.  The pace is relatively steady.  As you become more familiar with the game, lower levels can be made at an accelerated rate.+  Clever writing.I enjoy the witty dialogue.+  Bouncy Jump Jetty Explosiony Shooty-uppy combat.  With Friends!Nuf Said.+  Decent community.Pretty much all of my interactions have been pretty positive.+  Mailbox, Marketplace, Army management... all available all times through hot keys, anywhere in the field.You don't need to run to town to access a node in town.  They're there but not manditory.  Crafting table, Frame Station and Garage still need a node to access, but those are also accessible in the field with the construction of consumable mobile stations OR purchasable on the market for reusable, non-consumable versions.  Oh... and you can change your appearance at anytime.  All of it.Cons:+  You can experience brief lag spikes.I've got a pretty nice gaming rig with a connection of 30mbps up, 5 mbps down, and I'll experience the occasional hiccup.  Mission updates can lag a bit too.  It doesn't get on my nerves, and it doesn't disrupt my enjoyment of the game.  Some may feel otherwise.+  Can be a bit buggy at times.Missions can confound you when they don't update quickly enough, or your NPC spawns in a rock, but it doesn't happen often, or often enough for me to care/noticeThe LONG...So, I just got back into Firefall after a year hiatus.I'd been involved since beta, prior to Steam release, and so have a few hundred hours that don't show up here. It has come a really long way in some core management mechanics and, in my opinion, for the better.As a free to play, all gameplay is available. There is no level cap for freeloaders, and the only thing you pay for are cosmetic items and variants of the 5 different core classes provided free. Those base classes THEMSELVES provide an unlock for any premium class when you reach max level (40).It's quite a bit to horse around with without having to make any monetary investment.Furthermore, they do something I absolutely adore, which is allow premium/purchasable items to be sold by the community via their market. This essentially makes all those items you'd have to purchase with real monies available for in game currency through the playerbase.There is a currency market where premium currency (Red Beans) can be exchanged for in-game currency (coins? crystal coins?), which is awesome because it teaches our children (it's really always about the children, isn't it?) about market exchange fluctuations and how they too can game a system and bring Global Financial Systems crashing down to their knees... when they get older.It rocks.You don't really need to spend a dime.That is, if your time doesn't actually equal money.But, the grind is not terribly noticeable, and you don't REALLY need to get an MBA (or life experience equivalent) to enjoy all that Firefall has to offer.The voice acting is ""Meh"", I'd call it passable. BUT... the writing is clever, and witty, and tinged with a bit of absurd hilarity; all without drawing one out of the universe. A happy medium drawn when your game takes place in a version of future Earth, obliterated by catastrophe, a handful of humanity surviving, struggle against starvation, poverty, and brainwashed zombie invaders from another dimensions.A dark narrative balanced with charm, levity, and some sunny beaches in Brazil.The game is a FPS/3rdPoV Co-Op shooter with a PVP endgame. Classic elements of dungeon crawling loot drop-iness persist, not too unlike Borderlands (but distinctly different). Traveling between locations is key, which can grow wearisome at times, but random events spawn between way-points, and the provision of mounts, jumpjets, varied and interesting terrain, as well as gliders (oh gawd... I love me some gliders) help spice up your journey.I recommend it, and look forward to this product as it progresses.			"

												Played Firefall since early Beta, great openworld game that allows you to do what you want when you want. Visually stunning when on high settings. Its easy to learn the classes but hard to master them.The game will not tell you what missions to do outside the story based one's that you can do as you level up your frames (classes), Its very open world with a number of varying radom events that will occure and you can choose to join in or not.If you ever need help with a mission or want to know somthing your not sure on most people will be happy to explain it to you.Its easy to jump in with friends and have fun, you can create armies (clans) and work together to explore the world and kill your enimies. Also the melding want to be your friend.........			"

												Sort of a neat little grinder. Kinda glitchy, but in an annoying-fun way at times. Has a lot of room to grow, which I hope it does. Paying is more to show you like the game, not to win, and not forced.

												Solo player or a group player, this game has it. Solo play by playing missions alone or doing random missions as they pop up. Or making a squad and taking the quests off of job board and random missions with ""group: recommended"" thing to easy it up. Or playing solo but helping other random people out in the open missions which everyone gets a piece of the fun. I like the class bio-tech as I can either do solo missions as well as help out other random players with the open missions like ""ARES Mission"" or ""Crashed Thumper"" or random Chosen drop pods and people need help of reviving. :) Depending on your play style, Firefall has it. Each class working from lvl 1 up, lets say you got a main lvl 26 and your friend just started this and you want to help him out, just switch to another battle frame class in lvl 1 and you both start at lvl 1 and go up from there.

												Updated the 9th of August 2014: I just wanted to update this a bit to say that the devs have remained constantly talkative in game, interacting with the community and answering questions and the like. I've gotten a chance to play with quite a few of the crew from Red5 and they are all pretty passionate people. The forums for this game are turning into a pretty toxic mess, but in game I've seen nothing but positive changes as Red5 continues to try to iterate and get the game more polished. The first few weeks were pretty rough but I've got to meet a lot of cool new players who seem to honestly enjoy the game. Red5 seems to have a direction they want to go and seem to be following it much better then the kind of random experiments they were doing before. After yesterdays Firefall Live I have more faith in their ability to take feedback and data and move the game forward.Just, you know, avoid the forums. It's pretty much the bottom half of the internet. If youtube and news articles have taught me anything its that you never read the bottom half of the internet.I've been playing Firefall since near the beginning. I want to make something clear for anyone who reads the negative reviews: They are horribly nostalgic. The 'constraints' system boiled down to 90% of the population using the same build (Max cooldown and jump jets) so they could fly around in circles and spam abilities without a modicum of skill. Regen was high and it was easy to make yourself literally invincible. The game was incredibly easy and no one wants to admit this because that'd ruin their rosey naval gazing.On to the game we have now: It's bigger. The world is really well made and has a lot of interesting locations. The different frames all feel different enough to be noticeable. You can hit level cap in a week or less if you just pay a bit of attention to how you gain exp. Crafting currently is too overtuned in that the prices are sky high, but that'll probably get toned down. (Dev's have said they wanted to start high and go down because almost no one whines about having to spend less to build things.)All in all its a really solid shooter with heavy RPG elements. There are really fun raids at endgame and the instanced dungeons that tell that main story are generally really fun. You can solo all of them (Well not the raid. At least not that I know of.) but they definitely shine with a group.Also the assault class plays like a Tribes spinfusor soldier. Huzzah to that.			"

												I find this game worth writing a review.  It's a solid MMO FPS.  It is quite honestly what you expect when you hear those terms combined.  It's not only playable, it's replayable and enjoyable.  It's absolutely not pay-to-win, and everything in the game can be acquired simply by investing time and energy - not cash.  It really doesn't even take too much time to get what you want with in-game credits, either.  Play the game, never spend a dime, and invest in unlocking all the cool stuff you want for your character.The neat part is that all ""classes"" are played from your one character - you swap your ""Battleframe"", or powered armor suit, and you're a new class.  No logging our and changing characters, no stashing stuff in a storage and mailing things between people.  Everything in one place, just your character the way you want it any day any time.  (Yes, you can change your appearance and even sex at any time, too)The in-game community is great.  It's not filled with trolls constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing at everyone else and calling everyone names for no reason.  The players help each other out when questions are asked, and much like Guild Wars 2 mechanics it's core gameplay is set up so that even if someone attacks or kills your target they're only helping you.Play the game for what it it, not what it was in Alpha and Beta.  It's streamlined and easier to understand what stats mean (World of Warcraft stats crunch, anyone?).			"

												I recommend this game with several caveats, more on that later. It is a futuristic guns and gear game with powered battle ""Frames"" to which you add big guns and cool gear. Each of the 16 Frames has special abilities and playstyles. You start out with the five basic Frames and purchase/win/aquire the other advanced Frames. You are tasked with saving what is left of humanity on Earth after a terrible calamity has devestated our once fair blue ball in space. Now mutated wildlife, alien creatures, and an alien race called the Chosen are here to eat your babies....so kill them already!!!This game can be a blast and if you like fps and rpg then this is a fpsrpg in an mmo setting that will have you saying ""Pass the ammo"". The gameplay is wild and frenetic, with guns blazing and bombs a'sploding, fun objective based mini events that pop up all over the map, and occaisional Chosen attacks and even speacial full out assaults on the last vestige of humanity,... yep you and your bros.It is a lot of fun when you first start playing, but before an hour is up you will begin to discern one of the biggest problems with this game. Poor coding, that allows a memory leak to slowly chew your graphics memory up. This brings on at first minor stuttering and intermitant frame rate drops, then progresses to chokingingly bad frame rates that make the game nearly unplayable. The first few times this happened, I put it off to a lot going on visually in the game, but I am running 2 gtx660ti's in tandem sli config, not the latest and greatest but more than able to run this game as is evident by how very smoothly the game runs for the first 30-40 mins. So I just kept rolling along wishing the game ran better, till nearly 3 or so hours (yea yea i need a life) wham, the screen went black. The game kept running as the audio filled me in on the action and my eventual death. I tried everything to get out of the game, but the video system having been overloaded could now show NOTHING, not even the os, soooo Hard Reset of my computer later, I restarted the game... and lo there was the beautiful game with great graphics and SMOOTH gameplay...for a while : (After this happened a couple times it belatedly dawned on me that this was a poor coding issue and the game was chewing graphics ram up but never swallowing, causing it to CHOKE TO DEATH...literally.I have since taken to restarting the game hourly, which brought to light that not all of the lost graphics resources are returned, it will greatly improve the gameplay for a time, but after a number of restarts you will need to reboot your machine : (There are a number of other issues that are frustratingly annoying. Loot, including the lootable currency of the game despawns...rather quickly. If you are in a long firefight (most of them are long as the main challenge seems to be throwing and inordinantly large numbers of foes for you to mow down or blow up) half the loot of the fight will be gone. If the mob has a ""mini boss"" (extra tough opponent) at the end of the line of foes then by the time you get it down little loot will be left, which is something that boggles me, I can't for the life of me come up with a reasonable explaination for why the devs are basically screwing their players out of rewards they earned. As time goes by and the HUGE costs of crafting become apparent, it starts to annoy you (or me at least). The non std items, greenies and blues etc seem to stay around much longer, but again most of the crafting raw material and the currency/crafting material Cristite...POOF gone.It is also too dark too much of the time. I understand the whole night ambiance and I understand that night offers some great settings for gameplay, but in this game it is a detractor for so much of the time to be so dark. Its a game of GUNS, you need to be able to see. There is a Moon in the sky at night, but it shines NO LIGHT so the night is VERY DARK, then there are dawn and dusk, both these periods are actually about how dark the night should realy be, to enhance the gameply. So add together dusk, night, and dawn and you get a lot of darkness. Realy I wouldnt mind if the terrain wasnt so varied and rugged, you cannot get around without the constant use of jumpjets to get you over obstacles, the foes you face are invariably very dark in color scheme so they blend in well with the darkness. Often you dont see them till they are on top of you. That would/is fine for some classes but there are classes whose talents, such as sniping are made useless, if you cant even identify a target until your on top of it, what good is being able to shoot at very long ranges? Now not all of the foes are darkly colored many of the creatures are brightly colored but the number that are, as well as the difficulty of navigating the rough terrain warrant a revision in my opinion.Ok so quests. Can you say repetitious? Well good, cause now you will get to intimately know it. It's not just that they are the same old go here kill this, go there fetch that, thats to be expected...its that they use the SAME 1 to 5 spots for all the quest in an area!!! You are repeatedly sent the same locations to do different quests. One quest it might be called a storage area, the next quest it might be a hideout for a badguy, and you're like ""I was just here"", well you do for the first few repaets then you just shrug and get on with it. But I mean really, it's not like there isn't enough terrain or locations, it's that they are re-using the code or scripts from one quest to the other and saving the coding time, just changing the details in the middle, while frugal it lacks immagination and in a game that requires a massive amount of player repetition already it is VERY CHEESY in my opinion.About that repetition....there are currently 16 Battle Frames and each one must be leveled independently, which both makes sense and is a major bore. First by having to learn the Frame's best uses over time with low level appropriate foes it is a great way to make sure you actually can use the frame to its best. That said, since the affore mention repetition of quests now really starts to take it's toll on nerves. While you can level the Frame by simply running around doing the mini events that pop up all overthe place and killing critters and bad guys, I have found that method slower than questing, as I have found that while I am doing a quest it is very easy and often needed to also do a lot of extra killing and mini events that are close by, making it a difficult decision on what path to take for each frame. Before long tho, you will begin to wish that you could just level your character and not the Frames...And lastly, Crafting - I love in game crafting, This seemed like a very very promising method of gear aquisition...until you start crafting stuff, which requires a two part expense: First you have to spend Research points you aquire by salvaging loot and materials classed as salvage items, and Cristite (affore mentioned both currency and a crafting material - the discovery of this material is the basis for all the high tech gear and weapons in the game's lore). Once researched you will then have to provide the materials needed for crafting. These are mostly aquired by Refining raw materials gained from killing critters and mining ores with the use of devices called thumpers. In addition there are multiple levels to each level of items to be crafted. If you want a green quality item you will need to first reseach the regular and then the green version and so on. There are new versions of all craftables every three of four levels and you MUST craft at least the regular version of the previous level to be able to research the next level...OK I'll cut to the chase. It takes a lot of effort!To sum it up this game is a lot of fun, I do recommend it but be aware it has ISSUES. I wouldn't spend a ton on it till they fix the memory issue tho. Enjoy!			"

												Never seen game with such potential beeing so ♥♥♥♥ed. I'll be honest, last time I had so much fun with game was when I started playing Lineage 2 on c3. Game had everything  in beta. It was great. Still it was casual but I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun with friends playing it. Now it's pure disaster. Just look on online, you cant even play biger events cuz there is not enought players. I was never so disapointed about game as I'm for Firefall. I hope that man that killed this project wont get he's hands on any other. You good sir are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Have a nice dayConsumer			"

The game has a lot of depth to the customizability of the weapon and ability upgrades. Very Sandbox, but very good storylines that span from the beginning to the upper levels of the game. There's so many ways to enjoy this game from PVP to Exploration to Riding around like a Cyber Biker Gang and taking out bandits and bugs alike...this game offers many different ways to enjoy yourself alone or with a group of friend and/or strangers.

												Generic RPG game.See my time on it? That's all I'm wasting. Game is just so repetitive, run over there to meet that person, come over here and kill x amount of y, then go back to that person to turn in the quest. Now yes, the game advertises itself as an open world shooter. But really, the ""open world"" is just a bunch of level varied zones with the same rpg questing system, with some occasional randomly generated quests, and shooting game? What a joke. The guns dont even have ANY RECOIL. Oh and did I mention? Your secondary weapon, no matter what you are holding, be it assault rifle or greande launcher, it ALWAYS look the same. It just works differently. tl;dr: Grindfest rpg but w/ no-recoil guns.			"

												When i saw this on PC Gamer journal, it was written about alpha version of which details seemed very promising. What evolved from that is piece of crap in which you have to pay ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of money to customize things other people don't even get to see, classes don't seem to have that much difference, headshot damage is almost not effective since you give up shooting speed over precision and gain just a bit more damage, sniper rifles are completely automatic, shooting system seems too simple and too smooth for a Sci-Fi MMO. Overall, this game became just another boring Sci-Fi MMO that is kept alive by some unique elements of game, such as gliding and engineer class (shoutout to TF2).

												I'll try to keep this short...So I downloaded this game honestly not expecting much, especially as I had read some very mixed reviews. However, that being said, I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. There's a lot of elements and mechanics that they've encorporated that really reinforce natural group play. Players get rewards for simply wandering into an event and participating ( similar to GW2 if you are familiar )The battles escalate quickly, and offer a significant challenge at even lower levels for group events. The core gameplay mechanics and classes are fun, and appear to be well fleshed out as far as feeling responsive and ""tight"".Last but not least, there's a lot more I could talk about, but I have to mention the F2P model, as it's always a major concern for these games. So far, it appears most everything is cosmetic. You can pay for a few advantages, like a small XP boost, and you can unlock a few classes earlier than your normally would through earning them. So far though, it doesn't appear to adversely effect gameplay, which is great.In closing, I downloaded this game with no expectations, and have been enjoying it immensely with a few friends. It's worth a try. It looks great, runs great, doesn't feel like it's milking dollars from you, and most importantly it's a lot of fun, especially if you are running with a group of friends.Update:After playing for good amount of time, and breaking into the next higher level zone. Unfortunately, my excitement and enjoyment began to wane, for one basic reason. It became apparent, that what I could look forward to, was more of the same. While the core mechanics and gameplay is enjoyable, the game doesn't really appear to offer much else at this point. Hopefully, they will continue to develop the game and add more gameplay features. As of right now, you'll likely burn out and stop playing before level 30. ( Also, your item mall prices are crazy over-the-top! )			"

As many i hope i planted this game and i enjoyed from beginning, now i see, it's broken badly...

												If you're bored and looking for a Tribes like MMO, this may be worth the 8gb download.  Just keep these few things in mind:1.  As a new character, you'll get some of the basics and be left to a really crappy guide for everything else.  Opening said guide just brings you to the forums.2.  It does get grindy fast, and all the cool stuff is firmly behind a paywall.  3.  Leveling up gear and frames without paying is slow and can be painful.  4.  The still haven't figured out how to patch and not bust more then they fixed.5.  Support is only Monday thru Friday, extended bankers hours.  So if you have a issue during the weekend, don't expect any help.6.  Most or all of the original Devs are gone; and the game, as it is, currently is nothing like what was presented during their funding drive.7.  Combat can be fun, but grows stale over time.On a up note, the world is huge and it looks pretty dang nice.  Exploration can be fun.I've had some fun it, and it's something to log into and keel pixels for while.			"

												so i just tried playing this game again for the first time in a good long while. i made a new character, and played through the first mission. this was my experienceLog inFind that i have to wait for an old character to be migrated (world of warcraft did something like that when it changed the talent system. but they just refunded to you all of your talent points and implemented the new system so you could start right away)make new charactermake recon.first change spottedyou started as a basic assault frame years ago, and you could change your frame at a class station. i do not know if that is still in the game.complete tutorial (basic movement, jumping, how to shoot things)go on a ship to copa cabana2nd change the old game had a cool intro sequence where you and other players charged through copa cabana and defeated enemy soldiers, ending with a climactic fight against a giant enemy.get ready to go somewhere3rd change spottedThe game alternates between mini cutscene and tutorial popups, i actually had a 10 second loop of cutscene telling me what to do, i try to move, popup pops up and stops me, then tells me what to do, close pop up, another cutscene telling me where to go next, repeat.Issue spottedLag like you wouldn't believe. also, many bugs. and im not talking about those crawly things you shoot at. well, technically i am. i shot at one, just before it's hp hit zero, it sprung up into the air and through the ceiling. it may still be flying for all we know. this happened with about 5 other bugs. as for the lag, it's that really bad stuttery lag that happenes after every movement you make, as if the game has to re-position you after each movement so it knows where you are. makes first person mode a nightmare.then i get to the first set of doors. now, in the old game you could just run into a cave and explore it. not anymore, each room is like it's own instance, complete with cutscene at each door to take you to the next room. you go to the door, click the ""move to next area"" pylon, a cutscene plays that us just a swooping camera moving into the next room without you, your camera reappears behind you in 3rd person mode, the door is closed again, then you magically appear on the other side of it.4th change spotted. rather than being open world the game now seems to be going for an open world/instanced hybrid.now you may be thinking, Oh, so you just don't like instanced games, do you zombycow? that is incorrect, in fact, one game i really like is instanced. DDO. except with ddo each instanced area is huge, thus making the transition from 1 instance to then next worth your time.I finally get to the end of the first mission. i go up the first elevator, then the second.....and the quest does not update.now i have to search for the instance entrance AGAIN and go through door, cutscene, door, cutscene, again. this time i get to the elevator, WAIT 10 SECONDS, then the game updates the mission, then i go through the next elevator, WAIT AGAIN, and the mission updates again, telling me to take the final elevator out. I do so. and the mission....Does not update...in-fact, the markers dissapear completely. at that point i decided to make like Bokurano and UNINSTALL, UNINSTALL, ALL THE COUNTLESS SECONDS I SPENT PLAYING THIS GAME, ARE BASICALLY GONE, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PRETEND THAT I AM A MAN WHO NEVER PLAYED THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME.

												1. walking simulator game, boring. you waste most of time for walking. mission very very repetitive, and only take around 2 minutes. and walking 5 minutes or more.2. stupid map, doesnt explain anything3. the graphic and the building have too many colour, make me confused and headache.4. few people, i really mean it. make it hard for hitter class since have low defense and maybe hp?my experience:1. create id, login, and tutorial that you cannot skip, ok this is minor, you can just ignore it. just a little bit annoying2. chat only appear at chat bar, doesnt appear on top of character, make you confused who talking. especially with no name on top their head. feel like you playing alone.3. very few people at hunting area, i really mean it. just image you alone shooting at infinite monster that spawn and spawn. i rarelly encounter any player. especially with a very very repetitive mission that only last 1-2 minutes. kill 10 mobs, how hard is that?4. the money hard to get, like you life at poorest country or something, while the price of the item is so high. even though i dont need them at all. i never buy anything. lol5. stupid map, doesnt describe the building or street or anything, just some symbol for npc and you. maybe because you just can fly they doesnt really make it in detail. well most npc doesnt have any function. but hard to memorizee glider point.6. open map, have a large map for few people, walking take most of time instead of playing. too much monster for you alone, and if the populace raising, to few monster. this is contracdiction.and my suggest if you still want too try this game, play engineer. since this game have contradiction like point 6, is better if u just build tower and shoot random thing.and lastly, sorry for my bad english, hope that no nazi grammar mad at me and shouting like ""bad english ♥♥♥♥er so dont insult this game"" or something.i just wrote what i feel about this game. the choice is up to yours.

												I may not have played Firefall that long, but I have played it long enough to say it's in my top 10 games of all time. The one thing I dislike about this game is walking, because the map is so big. If you enjoy this game, you should seriously consider buying a vechile of some sort.			"

												every played tribes? tribes2? enjoy the freedom of flight, being able to explore a large open world?  before i get all into about FireFall, will say this, not many games do i play for long periods of time, or even like the Devs behind most games.. ----------------------the simple: (like gundamn? voltron, silver hawks?) if you enjoy a open world, MMO, where you can earn everything in game just by playing and farming some, didnt say farming for yrs to get one item that you will out lvl soon, but everything in game you can earn... if you enjoy guns, being able to fly, run around, jump off cliffs, drop posion nades that turn into clouds of green/blue smoke, devs who have events where they take control of the enemies and fight vs you? Customer service that dont make you feel stupid or like cattle? As in, Red 5 responds to us in the forums, they play with us in game, they give us rewards, everything can be earned, i cant say enough about certain aspects of this game, aspects that really make a game worth sticking around to play and seeing what new content comes out, yep, new content comes out, new perks, weps, abilitys, warpaints for your battleframes, everything,, this is how a gaming company should be, despite if they are BIG or small, just the interaction from red 5 with us in game and how they actually seem to care about its core players, this is how certain games should have been released (defiance) to name just one.. who dont want to fly around the world with a glider up high over mountains, oh you got tired of the glide? release from it and free fall, use your jetts and fly around, there is alot to do in FireFall, if you like to earn, farm, grind, group up, pve, oh and one of the biggest things for me about this game, since i was a GUI/video game skinner, i love to customize my character, this game is one of the best ever for that,,, everyone starts with a male or female model, you can switch from male to female on the fly, but you can customize everything, from whats on your head, face, eyes, ears, mouth and my favorite thing, Warpaints,, all you can buy with CREDS from the market, i have allmost everything nice and had them for awhile, working a full time job and just playing this game when i can.. nothing is out of reach, often you can find deals where ppl just want to move a item fast and boom, next thing you know, your BattleFrame is totally unique to you, never seen another one of me (Bimmie) in the game, one of the best things in this game by far.. sorry, tried to make it short.. ----------------------So, lets put it all out there about this game, FireFall MMO.. first, i have over 1300+hrs in games like defiance, played games like D2 & tribes/T2 for over 6+yrs straight, at first i thought this game was a rip off of defiance, but no, this game was in beta way before defiance was even thought of.. this is not a P2W game in anymeans, unlike a lot of F2p MMO's, you can fully earn and farm for every item in game or that you see in the red 5 store, which is extremely rare, i work full time, so i still find the time to earn my creds in this game.. creds can be used in the market or turned into red beans which then can buy stuff from Red 5's store, yea no trion worlds or defiance here, everything can be obtained.. game play: at first game was so, so for me, then i kept playing it for a few hours, once i got a few lvls and felt the speed of my battle frame pick up, i fully enjoyed the game, only thing i wish for is skiing like we had in the tribes series, but the speed of some of the frames, the freedom of open world and flight, you can craft your vehicles needed to travel around the world with.. game play of this game matches my more intense personality, especially once you unlock some of the perks and certain battleframe cores, like run speed core.. you have AOE, you have single target dmg, healing, pretty much everything you need to make a complete balanced team play event.. End game: there is plenty, but in my case, i dont care to JUST do end game content, i enjoy lvl'n a frame to 40, then you get 10 pilot tokens to unlock a new advanced frame with, or you can just buy the 99$ pack and get them all now, but once you get the hang of the game and how to lvl, it dont take that long to reach 40...there is plenty of bosses to fight, you can use thumpers to mine with and gain your resources to craft with or sale your crafts on the market and yes things sale.. its not a stale game, plenty of ppl on daily...Devs:  never have i played a game where the Devs take control of the enemies and fight us, they have special events which have been pretty much each weekend where they do this and they give out special rewards and unlocks for taking part of these events.. there is nothing shady about this company at this time, some ppl may complain, like they do in every game (league of legends) about balance, well, red 5 releases patches, they listen to us on the forums and for the most part they make changes according to what will benefit ppl, not just what they, the devs want,, Hear that Trick dempsy & trion worlds? take note other game companies, even though red 5 may not be that big, they are doing alot of things right and they are not being greedy about it.. its that simple to me, i am happy to see a gaming company like this, get tired of other ones who treat us like we are nothing.. good job with this FREE, yes, F2p, NOT P2W MMO by Red 5... 20/10 will continue to support these guys..

												If you played FireFall back closer to its initial closed beta or even open beta you really need to give FireFall another go. The game has changed so much from then till now and with the Founder/CEO Mark Kern removed from Red 5 and James Macauley taken the seat as acting CEO, i believe that Red 5 is in good hands and the team is shaping FireFall into not only the Best FPSMMO game I've ever played but continuing to make FireFall the best game ever. For those that have not played FireFall and are waiting until 7/29/14 to join in and see what it's all about i will say its worth it. The only thing i feel that new players may have trouble understanding or figureing out is the questing and how the whole system works. Once you figure it all out between the Story Line, Town Jobs and the many dynamic missions and events in-between you'll be having a blast. During those moments of Gliding to your next target that's over 2,000m away, you'll be able to relax after that intense fire-fight and take in the beautiful visuals of New Eden at 300m+ up.			"

												Considering all previous reviewers, i would say: THE GAME IS WORTH IT. I've been through beta, i've seen how it was - for me it was just too complicated. Yes, it gives you more freedom to customize your warframe, but at the same time you need to play more. So they changed it to standard MMO leveling up system. Its not so hard to get into this game now. So, although I was in beta, I like the new system, and I would recommend this game.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed my time with FireFall. Don't let the time on my record fool you, I played this for a while before it released on Steam, so I have closer to 50 hours playing this game. Anyway, let's get into the pros and cons. PROS: - Combat is a lot of fun- The jetpack makes this game differ from other games, with you using it more than any games I can name off the top of my head- Playing co-op with friends and blasting through the Chosen is fun no matter what level you do it at- Great customer service- Their battleframe system is unique- Even the so called ""medics"" are very powerful- This game is truely free to play, with every item in the game being craftable for free, and without paying money- The developers are very active in creating new events to change things up-  Even though there are micropurchases,you are not getting them shoved in your face every five minutes. CONS: - NPCs aren't memorable- There is no quest log that you can use to abandon a quest- Lack of a clear direction can be confusing to new players- You have to grind a lot- Crafting times and matierals are ridiculousWhile it may look as if the game is bad, trust me it isn't. On paper it may not sound that good, but once you play the game, it works. I definitely recommend getting this game, especially with it being free to play.			"

												Firefall is a sort of Tribes meets World of Warcraft... and ends up having a very rocky relationship. This game has had its ups and downs throughout the years I've played it but it's starting to stablize and reach a good place. 2015, I think, will be the year that Firefall makes some great strides and becomes a game that will be truly amazing.

The game also feels a bit more open world then defiance.

												this game is good but it is repetetive and so are other mmo's some just hide it better than others next there is no commitment to a battleframe so you can switch frames at any major city or accord controlled outpost. The game also rewards you with resources, consumables and currency the longer you play with going over an hour gives you the best gift for the day add in if you log in consecutively every day and you can activate a boost then that's a plus. Exploration is unrestricted but it gives you a warning when going out of bounds or in a high level area you can go in for resources but don't expect to survive long  The story is mediocre though so if you expect a story that is new and original it has its moments but still standard humanity is on the ropes and you must help humanity push back the enemy and rise up back to prominence. Custimozation is low you can only choose head shape, hair style, skin color, and voice when you make your character doesn't matter what you choose you can change that almost immeadiately after you land in Copa Cobana and customization after that is horribly limited since most of the awesome colors cant be accessed unless you spend real money on them same with head gear so bad move on the developers part on that one; Also better find friends to play this with as with all mmo's good with just you playing better with friends so yeah this game gets a 5/10 for exploring wherever you want and taking the resources there and switching frames instead of staying in one frame and loses points for standard story, repetetiveness, lack of custimozation unless you spent real world money for it also if you have an old computer with some of the hardware requirements but not all play this game on a good internet connection high 3G, 4G, or a very good WI-FI source if you have a more recent computer ignore my warning also going to have to spend some time grinding since the developers got rid of beginer side missions after you complete a few story missions side missions come back			"

												Whoaw this game finally got on steam! To bad my previous hours aren't added on here ;) After playing this game on and off for roughly 2 years+ I've noticed one thing, this is in my opinion the best mmo shooter out there.It contains great missions that are good fun with friends.I know from experience that large scale projects usually get dropped by the devs once they've earned some money, but Red 5 Studios have done an amazing job past few years and keeps up the good stuff.Another good thing that I want to point out is that they got red beans (an ingame currency which can be bought for some moneyz), these red beans can be used to buy certain items on firefall, however not everyone can afford to buy those. So players can purchase red beans ingame to get their hands on the goods without having to pay for it. Most games allow players to sell the items purchased with the currency but this game allows both, good thing.10/10 would play on and off again for several years.EDIT: The game is still nice, however they removed the good ol' firefall feel/atmosphere. There are (almost) no big world events like chosen incursion, sunken harbor at war, watch towers getting dominated.. Maybe the war is over? I just hope they will bring back the agressive side of the chosen and make them cause wars, take over watch towers..Now it is level to be strong, no need to think about armour or how to develop, just shoot'n'level-up. As a player from about 2 years ago I miss the previous level up system. The one where you had to unlock tech levels. It was complex, but once you had the hang of it you really could feel one with your character and appreciate the unlocked items. At max tech with it's upgrades you couldn't wear the best of everything because it was to heavy, so you had to choose between DPS, agility and HP if you wanted to max one out. Now it's just level up and everything happens itself, just do a random high level job, get a good weapon that almost all high levels have and done. Maxed. Nothing challenging anymore..This is my feedback throughout the years that I've played firefall, I still do enjoy the game a bit, it just had been better that's why I hate it how it became like this. Pretty sure I'm not the only betá tester that feels like this. But damn we've made a long journey with red 5 studios for the official launch, can't complain about the celebration parties ;pAlright so back do the recommendation; I recommend this game for newer players or those that hated the tech tree/xp4armour.If you are from betá or maybe even earlier, if you had access that is, I don't recommend this to you, because a lot of the good old stuff is gone, it is simplefied to an extent which you'd probably never imagine about firefall. They are good to the community though so maybe our prayers will be heard.Edit 2: Touched firefall again after like a year and a lot has changed, for the better. Even for veteran players that played since early betá the game looks like what it was back then. Just some patches so now and then but I think I will be active on this again.Also I have to say that this is the only studio that actually care about veteran players. I receive so now and then some goods from them which kinda motivates me to play it again aswell.The community is pretty sweet. The players were kind enough to help me out getting used to the controls, got invited in several squads etc. Overall a nice community! Something you won't find everywhere.			"

Posted: September 25, 2014
												I JUST started playing this game, and I don't even freaking WRITE reviews often. But you know what? This game deserves it. This game needs, more, PLAYERS. If you are looking at this game all thinking ""Is this going to be another one of those promising yet disappointing games that shove ads in your face trying to get you to pay for things? Is this a pay to win piece of crap? I'll stop you right there. NO.Yes, there are options to pay for VIP but anything you can buy with real money you can get in the real game. There is no advantage really. I have BARELY started playing this game so I can understand how my view probably doesn't matter but screw it. I'll give it anyway.So I'll give my pros and cons as of right now.Pros:-Music. The music I find quite beautiful and honestly I might need to get the damn soundtrack I like it that much.-Graphics. They are pretty decent, I like them. Are they Crysis graphics? Oh no. No no no. But they are decent. No complaints.-Gameplay. The actual gameplay is fast paced and quite fun, I found myself jetting around (You have jetpacks with fast regenerating fuel to shoot around with in fact they encourage it). I actually found myself cackling with pure joy as I blasted dudes in the face as a ""medic."" And at one point, I am POSITIVE my character called someone a noob when I one shot killed him (an ai of course. Haven't tried pvp yet).-""Flight paths."" They are like futuristic hang gliders that you control to get where you want and they are FAST, AND FUN. In the beginning it'll put you through this little tutorial flying through loops, I loved it.-Player Community. I actually was afraid to speak in chat because usually the player community is♥♥♥♥♥♥ But I actually found myself befriending two different people rather fast, and generally everyone was nice to each other. This is RARE in most games and was quite refreshing.-It's a freaking FPS MMO! With numbers that pop up like wow when you shoot someone in the freaking face! I mean come on!-You can switch between first person and third person! So fun both ways.-Not long into the game you actually get to fight this boss guy with VERY simple mechanics. Like seriously he spawns a wall of dirt out of nowhere and anybody with a brain would know you need to use that for cover because without it he's going to hurt. So I don't know if this is a pro or a con but all I do know was, as simple as he was and almost insultingly so, I still had a BLAST kicking his bald♥♥♥♥♥ I think he was there simply to show you there were going to be bosses that you have to think before you fight. I dunno.Now for my cons:-Playerbase seems a bit low. For a massive online multiplayer, I don't know if it's dwindling, or maybe just not known enough but I guess the amount of players isn't that immense. It's not a ghost town, I've seen plenty around me but still, I've heard people say it's awfully hard to get groups together sometimes.-Server lag maybe? I thought it was buggy, but at one point when I was on my happy giggle-infested face-blasting spree of joyfulness, there was one point where I shot a dude in the face, three times in a row, one of them POINT BLANK and he was like ""Yeah, sup. Maybe I uh should move over here so you can, get a better THEREEE you go."" I was like dafuq? This is messing with my face blasting mojo!-They do throw in your face once I think that you can get VIP and I'm only putting this in the cons because I automatically find that annoying. The GOOD thing about this however, is ANYTHING you can get with vip you can get as a free player as well, and it's not hard to. Besides exp boosts but I'm not worried about fast leveling right now.All in all, I had a lot of fun and I hope I get to find someone to have fun with me.Supposedly, it's going to have some dynamic elements to it. I look forward to seeing what that means.			"

												This is my first review. So please forgive me if it sucks. I enjoy this game, and recomed it. The things I like about it are how random things can be and the feel of open world I get when I just want to explore. I dont, how ever, like how few people there are on the servers. I cant seem to make any friends...maybe I am a looser? Lol. I feel that leveling is slow and can become a grind, but mabe I am doing it wron? I dont know. I like this game tho, I can run around for a few hours and kill things just for fun.			"

												Considering all previous reviewers, i would say: THE GAME IS WORTH IT. I've been through beta, i've seen how it was - for me it was just too complicated. Yes, it gives you more freedom to customize your warframe, but at the same time you need to play more. So they changed it to standard MMO leveling up system. Its not so hard to get into this game now. So, although I was in beta, I like the new system, and I would recommend this game.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed my time with FireFall. Don't let the time on my record fool you, I played this for a while before it released on Steam, so I have closer to 50 hours playing this game. Anyway, let's get into the pros and cons. PROS: - Combat is a lot of fun- The jetpack makes this game differ from other games, with you using it more than any games I can name off the top of my head- Playing co-op with friends and blasting through the Chosen is fun no matter what level you do it at- Great customer service- Their battleframe system is unique- Even the so called ""medics"" are very powerful- This game is truely free to play, with every item in the game being craftable for free, and without paying money- The developers are very active in creating new events to change things up-  Even though there are micropurchases,you are not getting them shoved in your face every five minutes. CONS: - NPCs aren't memorable- There is no quest log that you can use to abandon a quest- Lack of a clear direction can be confusing to new players- You have to grind a lot- Crafting times and matierals are ridiculousWhile it may look as if the game is bad, trust me it isn't. On paper it may not sound that good, but once you play the game, it works. I definitely recommend getting this game, especially with it being free to play.			"

												A truly astonishing game that has potential. This game provides many genres combined together that brings a new feel to gaming such as FPS, RPG, MMO, and many more. This game gives you the freedom to roam this vast world and attempt random events or follow a job board that gives you a view at all the side characters.			"

												Generic RPG game.See my time on it? That's all I'm wasting. Game is just so repetitive, run over there to meet that person, come over here and kill x amount of y, then go back to that person to turn in the quest. Now yes, the game advertises itself as an open world shooter. But really, the ""open world"" is just a bunch of level varied zones with the same rpg questing system, with some occasional randomly generated quests, and shooting game? What a joke. The guns dont even have ANY RECOIL. Oh and did I mention? Your secondary weapon, no matter what you are holding, be it assault rifle or greande launcher, it ALWAYS look the same. It just works differently. tl;dr: Grindfest rpg but w/ no-recoil guns.			"

												every played tribes? tribes2? enjoy the freedom of flight, being able to explore a large open world?  before i get all into about FireFall, will say this, not many games do i play for long periods of time, or even like the Devs behind most games.. ----------------------the simple: (like gundamn? voltron, silver hawks?) if you enjoy a open world, MMO, where you can earn everything in game just by playing and farming some, didnt say farming for yrs to get one item that you will out lvl soon, but everything in game you can earn... if you enjoy guns, being able to fly, run around, jump off cliffs, drop posion nades that turn into clouds of green/blue smoke, devs who have events where they take control of the enemies and fight vs you? Customer service that dont make you feel stupid or like cattle? As in, Red 5 responds to us in the forums, they play with us in game, they give us rewards, everything can be earned, i cant say enough about certain aspects of this game, aspects that really make a game worth sticking around to play and seeing what new content comes out, yep, new content comes out, new perks, weps, abilitys, warpaints for your battleframes, everything,, this is how a gaming company should be, despite if they are BIG or small, just the interaction from red 5 with us in game and how they actually seem to care about its core players, this is how certain games should have been released (defiance) to name just one.. who dont want to fly around the world with a glider up high over mountains, oh you got tired of the glide? release from it and free fall, use your jetts and fly around, there is alot to do in FireFall, if you like to earn, farm, grind, group up, pve, oh and one of the biggest things for me about this game, since i was a GUI/video game skinner, i love to customize my character, this game is one of the best ever for that,,, everyone starts with a male or female model, you can switch from male to female on the fly, but you can customize everything, from whats on your head, face, eyes, ears, mouth and my favorite thing, Warpaints,, all you can buy with CREDS from the market, i have allmost everything nice and had them for awhile, working a full time job and just playing this game when i can.. nothing is out of reach, often you can find deals where ppl just want to move a item fast and boom, next thing you know, your BattleFrame is totally unique to you, never seen another one of me (Bimmie) in the game, one of the best things in this game by far.. sorry, tried to make it short.. ----------------------So, lets put it all out there about this game, FireFall MMO.. first, i have over 1300+hrs in games like defiance, played games like D2 & tribes/T2 for over 6+yrs straight, at first i thought this game was a rip off of defiance, but no, this game was in beta way before defiance was even thought of.. this is not a P2W game in anymeans, unlike a lot of F2p MMO's, you can fully earn and farm for every item in game or that you see in the red 5 store, which is extremely rare, i work full time, so i still find the time to earn my creds in this game.. creds can be used in the market or turned into red beans which then can buy stuff from Red 5's store, yea no trion worlds or defiance here, everything can be obtained.. game play: at first game was so, so for me, then i kept playing it for a few hours, once i got a few lvls and felt the speed of my battle frame pick up, i fully enjoyed the game, only thing i wish for is skiing like we had in the tribes series, but the speed of some of the frames, the freedom of open world and flight, you can craft your vehicles needed to travel around the world with.. game play of this game matches my more intense personality, especially once you unlock some of the perks and certain battleframe cores, like run speed core.. you have AOE, you have single target dmg, healing, pretty much everything you need to make a complete balanced team play event.. End game: there is plenty, but in my case, i dont care to JUST do end game content, i enjoy lvl'n a frame to 40, then you get 10 pilot tokens to unlock a new advanced frame with, or you can just buy the 99$ pack and get them all now, but once you get the hang of the game and how to lvl, it dont take that long to reach 40...there is plenty of bosses to fight, you can use thumpers to mine with and gain your resources to craft with or sale your crafts on the market and yes things sale.. its not a stale game, plenty of ppl on daily...Devs:  never have i played a game where the Devs take control of the enemies and fight us, they have special events which have been pretty much each weekend where they do this and they give out special rewards and unlocks for taking part of these events.. there is nothing shady about this company at this time, some ppl may complain, like they do in every game (league of legends) about balance, well, red 5 releases patches, they listen to us on the forums and for the most part they make changes according to what will benefit ppl, not just what they, the devs want,, Hear that Trick dempsy & trion worlds? take note other game companies, even though red 5 may not be that big, they are doing alot of things right and they are not being greedy about it.. its that simple to me, i am happy to see a gaming company like this, get tired of other ones who treat us like we are nothing.. good job with this FREE, yes, F2p, NOT P2W MMO by Red 5... 20/10 will continue to support these guys..

												If you played FireFall back closer to its initial closed beta or even open beta you really need to give FireFall another go. The game has changed so much from then till now and with the Founder/CEO Mark Kern removed from Red 5 and James Macauley taken the seat as acting CEO, i believe that Red 5 is in good hands and the team is shaping FireFall into not only the Best FPSMMO game I've ever played but continuing to make FireFall the best game ever. For those that have not played FireFall and are waiting until 7/29/14 to join in and see what it's all about i will say its worth it. The only thing i feel that new players may have trouble understanding or figureing out is the questing and how the whole system works. Once you figure it all out between the Story Line, Town Jobs and the many dynamic missions and events in-between you'll be having a blast. During those moments of Gliding to your next target that's over 2,000m away, you'll be able to relax after that intense fire-fight and take in the beautiful visuals of New Eden at 300m+ up.			"

												Keep in mind, that this game is a F2P, so don't try to compare it to the MMO heavies, like WoW. Pro's:- Legitimate F2P. Anything can be obtained through sufficient playtime.- Combat is interesting. Generally solid, fun to engage.- Community is great. Players are generally good people.- Many playstyles available. Con's:- Still a lot of bugs.- Mission diversity is very low. A lot of the same objectives with different voice actors.- Enemy diversity is pretty low. End up fighting the same mechanics frequently.- Gear is very limited. - A lot of game mechanics are poorly explained, if at all. I think the game was a lot of fun, getting my first frame to cap. The world events and mission lines were a lot of fun on my first playthrough. However, even with the XP boost, I just can't seem to muster the interest to go through it all again. The quest base isn't diverse enough to do anything but grind through the same dozen or so quests per area, and since random mobs are all but non-existent (and ridiculously low XP), you're all but forced to do them. Yes, there are random encounters, so to speak, but again, they are the same few events all the time. There are only a few instances, which were pretty well done. Finding groups isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, given the relatively small player base. Running solo could usually be done as well, if you're decent. Crafting was... unimpressive. I liked that it was fairly straightforward, and that I could craft most things in the game. The problem is the cost/benefit. Crafting is very, very expensive and time consuming on the front end, for relatively mediocre outputs. Given how easy most useful items are to obtain, versus how long it takes to get anything useful from crafting, it's basically not worth doing. I think the game is worth playing through at least once. It did offer some things that most F2P don't, which I enjoyed. While it's not perfect, it's still a pretty good offering.			"

												The Short:Pros:+  Truly Free-to-Play. All content is available through in-game play.  Premium Currency purchasable content includes cosmetics, Frames (Premium Frames also unlockable via completion of basic frames), and mounts (purchasable via the player driven market).  You don't need to spend ANY money to enjoy everything this game has to offer.+  Player driven market for premium currency.Just like in Star Trek Online, you can purchase ""Red Beans"" on the market sold by other players.  Those things that you can't buy, or aren't available on the player driven item market, can be purchased with ""premium"" currency which you bought with in game currency.  Really, the only thing I can think of needing Red Beans for is extra inventory slots (if you even need that).+  Negligible grind.It doesn't get harder, longer, grindier in upper levels.  The pace is relatively steady.  As you become more familiar with the game, lower levels can be made at an accelerated rate.+  Clever writing.I enjoy the witty dialogue.+  Bouncy Jump Jetty Explosiony Shooty-uppy combat.  With Friends!Nuf Said.+  Decent community.Pretty much all of my interactions have been pretty positive.+  Mailbox, Marketplace, Army management... all available all times through hot keys, anywhere in the field.You don't need to run to town to access a node in town.  They're there but not manditory.  Crafting table, Frame Station and Garage still need a node to access, but those are also accessible in the field with the construction of consumable mobile stations OR purchasable on the market for reusable, non-consumable versions.  Oh... and you can change your appearance at anytime.  All of it.Cons:+  You can experience brief lag spikes.I've got a pretty nice gaming rig with a connection of 30mbps up, 5 mbps down, and I'll experience the occasional hiccup.  Mission updates can lag a bit too.  It doesn't get on my nerves, and it doesn't disrupt my enjoyment of the game.  Some may feel otherwise.+  Can be a bit buggy at times.Missions can confound you when they don't update quickly enough, or your NPC spawns in a rock, but it doesn't happen often, or often enough for me to care/noticeThe LONG...So, I just got back into Firefall after a year hiatus.I'd been involved since beta, prior to Steam release, and so have a few hundred hours that don't show up here. It has come a really long way in some core management mechanics and, in my opinion, for the better.As a free to play, all gameplay is available. There is no level cap for freeloaders, and the only thing you pay for are cosmetic items and variants of the 5 different core classes provided free. Those base classes THEMSELVES provide an unlock for any premium class when you reach max level (40).It's quite a bit to horse around with without having to make any monetary investment.Furthermore, they do something I absolutely adore, which is allow premium/purchasable items to be sold by the community via their market. This essentially makes all those items you'd have to purchase with real monies available for in game currency through the playerbase.There is a currency market where premium currency (Red Beans) can be exchanged for in-game currency (coins? crystal coins?), which is awesome because it teaches our children (it's really always about the children, isn't it?) about market exchange fluctuations and how they too can game a system and bring Global Financial Systems crashing down to their knees... when they get older.It rocks.You don't really need to spend a dime.That is, if your time doesn't actually equal money.But, the grind is not terribly noticeable, and you don't REALLY need to get an MBA (or life experience equivalent) to enjoy all that Firefall has to offer.The voice acting is ""Meh"", I'd call it passable. BUT... the writing is clever, and witty, and tinged with a bit of absurd hilarity; all without drawing one out of the universe. A happy medium drawn when your game takes place in a version of future Earth, obliterated by catastrophe, a handful of humanity surviving, struggle against starvation, poverty, and brainwashed zombie invaders from another dimensions.A dark narrative balanced with charm, levity, and some sunny beaches in Brazil.The game is a FPS/3rdPoV Co-Op shooter with a PVP endgame. Classic elements of dungeon crawling loot drop-iness persist, not too unlike Borderlands (but distinctly different). Traveling between locations is key, which can grow wearisome at times, but random events spawn between way-points, and the provision of mounts, jumpjets, varied and interesting terrain, as well as gliders (oh gawd... I love me some gliders) help spice up your journey.I recommend it, and look forward to this product as it progresses.			"

												I have no idea why so many people do not reccomend this game?I started playing this game about 2 years a go in the beta, and have just come back to it about a week before it was officially launched on steam. I think people are simply disliking it because they are not playing it enough and not giving it a chance. Firefall is a game where you can do what you want. Majority of the game is spent ""Thumping"", this is really fun. It is grinding monsters and gaining levels, and materials which you can then use for crafting great things. You don't have to go thumping on your own, you can join your friends and join a squad together.The PvP side of the game is also extremely good, it is now open world pvp. So the game can even have a huge role play side to the game. You can hold a base, whilst other people attack you and try and take other the base, the ideas are endless!However, the game IS confusing when you first start to play, i would reccommend joining an army as soon as possible so they can help you out.DO NOT just play the game for like 5 hours then say ""there is nothing to do"" because you are COMPLETELY WRONG.10/10 would reccomend, one of the best games i've ever played!

												Firefall is a pretty complete and fun game. There are some bugs, yes, but the world is huge, the options available are so many that I will be discovering thigns easily after 100 hours of gameplay. And for being so large and complete, that ocasional bugs will exist. Crafting system, gathering resources, battleling while gathering resources, not just passively mining or something, things are packed with action, good size action.As far as graphics, gorgeous at Ultra High, the field of view - rendering is amazingly far, due to its vertical aspect (you can fly - use jetpacks), using height is a whole new level of fun and strategy.

												The BEST F2P MMO I have ever encountered. The currency system seems convoluted at first but ultamately it works really well. Have not spent a dime RL cash and managed to buy plenty of in game stuffs. Someone on a server said this "" Red5 did F2P the right way!"".  If I had to spend real money for their premium content I totally would. I dont, but I would.			"

												One of the most beautifully stylized free-to-play games i have played in my life. The smooth blend of first and third-person gameplay allows for you to play in your comfort zone at all times and the game has beautiful visuals. The voice acting is great and the character-customization is also good. What is lacking however is the combat system's fluidity as the mobs i encounter seem rather clunky at times. Also there is a very blatant element of Pay-to-play boosting throughout almost all elements of the game, which may throw many people from downloading Firefall, but it hasn't had any effect on my gameplay thus far.         As for learning the game at first glance, there is barely a tutorial to show you to assign hot-keys and to use your core abilities that come with every class, although the narrator that ""accompanies"" you throughout the game does lend a helping hand from time to time with tips and tidbits here and there. The depth of the computer's aid could go a long way into making the game easier to learn from the get-go and generally more enjoyable in doing so.Overall there is no reason for you to hold back on playing this game because it's free-to-play and enjoyable on the whole, so far.

												I have more of a question than a review. Is his game already dead? I honestly really enjoy it, it's unique, there are some fun missions and events to participate in, and some great classes to play about I hear so many negative things about it. I want to buy an advanced frame, but if the damn game dies out, will I even be able to play it? Or will it just kinda fizzle put and disappear, taking my cash with it? I mean, if people stop supporting it, they very well may stop paying to keep it going. And then I'm just kinda out of the money I threw at it. Honestly a wonderful game. Definitely recommend downloading it to at least try it out.			"

												One of the few Free-to-Play games that has no hidden agendas or pay-to-win garbage.  I would say this has appeal for both the hardcore FPS and well as the casual gamers.  The game looks great and plays very smooth.  With all the new content prime for release there is alot to do and vast areas to explorer but with the combination of battleframe jump jets, deployable gliders, and vechs it does not seem like your walking for days like some other games.  With a well balanced team and many different frames to choose from the battles can get very intense.  I love the diff sub classes with-in each class to provide a more personal game experence.  The starter packs do get you a kick start into the game but you don't need them to build anything you want if you want to put the time into the game.  With the Free-to-Play model this game is well worth checking out and see how you like it.			"

												TL;DR: This game isn't ready for consumption, give it another year.  -----  Post-Release Firefall is not the Firefall you might have heard of before. The advancement is level based, the areas are gated, and exploration is swiftly punished by a deadly encounter with aimbot-powered bandits left over from some other fella's quest spawn. Outside of quests and dynamic events, which are all a variation of kill and fetch quests, there is barely any surface spawn. The starter zone, called Coral Forest, feels dead right up to the moment you reach your quest waypoint and all 15 bandits you are supposed to kill spawn on top of you. Yes, all 15. And after a few seconds, another 15 will spawn just to make sure you have enough to finish your quest so you can spend another 10 minutes traveling to the next waypoint.  When you reach level 25 on your first base class, you may embark on a long quest to attain a vehicle. Until then, however, better invest in running shoes because the constant back and forth means a lot of running. You can level through dynamic events but with the hard level gating it is easy to find oneself surrounded by skull-level creatures even just a couple steps north of the first town.  Despite the alien adversaries, the Chosen, being toted as a constant threat, they have no presence in the lvl 1-25 zone at all. Bandits and pirates are all you will see and they are just as unbalanced as they have been in beta. Their insane accuracy, damage, and numbers tear low level players to shreds. Their hitboxes are tiny and detailed. The game’s latency is completely unsuited for bullet calculations and hit recognition. It is insane luck if every third bullet deals damage. NPC grenadiers, however, always hit. They must have been combat mathematicians in a previous life.   Now, let’s talk about getting hit. This game does not give you shields. Other Sci-Fi shooters give you a regenerating buffer between random damage and your health. Here, you have to run into enemy fire and pick up drops in order to regain some health.   The vertical, level-based progression is as shallow as the new company owner’s, The9, Facebook games. As you level, you may use a stronger weapon, a stronger reactor (stat stick), and stronger abilities. Everything remains the same, only the numbers get bigger. The cooldowns on abilities are so long that every class plays itself the same - hold space while you jet away desperately emptying magazine after magazine at an unhittable bulletsponge.   Gear is everything and grouping is heavily discouraged by heavy-handed server sharding. There is no UI to join a friend that is on another shard, it has to be done via text commands. People will hate you for helping on dynamic events because it takes away from their rewards. Assisting a mining operation out of group yields no rewards at all, and altogether it is more profitable to watch a fellow player’s drill get destroyed and place your own. But that is okay because crafting is completely pointless and the best gear comes from instance bosses anyway.  The leveling is slow and desperation to get out of Crystal Forest is high, so you will be tempted to buy from the cash shop. You probably won’t be able to use the auction house, where other people who bought stuff with their real money resell it for in-game currency, because currency is hard to come by at low levels, very hard. For sale are not just cosmetics and conveniences but also classes, vehicles, inventory slots, and boosts, boosts, boosts. XP boosts. Currency boosts. Resource boosts. If you don’t pay, you will progress slower and be poorer.   But that is okay, because there is no endgame content yet anyway. Maybe next year.			"

												Played the alpha, and the beta releases, and honestly the game was better than it is now. A lot was broken when the devs wrapped their hands around the thumping system, there wasn't a problem with it, but it all first started when you can't place a thumper in a area where another is already set. So gathering of materials, was made difficult because of this, and on top of that, they have reduced the amount of materials you gathered per thumping run... This was to deter the op class at the time which was the Bastion, and honestly... It shouldn't mattered, as the game was mostly PvE to begin with. But was that it? No... It got worse, far worse. After being away for about... A year, the game has went to total crap, crafting system is destroyed, thumping doesn't work, fast travel system is gone, the global map is poorly optimized, and things like the Amazon, and the PvP world is gone. The PvP aspect I didn't care for at all as it was mostly centered around material gathering, if they didn't reward PvPing so hard like every other game, and treated both PvE and PvP players equally, maybe it wouldn't have gone so wrong... Red5 screwed up, and they know this, as they are 'trying' to recover a dead game, and honestly It is going to require a massive band aid to fix this bleed-out... I hope the best for Firefall, and Red5.			"

												I absolutely love this game. The graphics are good. Realistic enough that you can get into the characters and storyline, but not so realistic that it's depressing. Good voice acting, even on no name npc's. Mission dialogue plays over coms so that you can do other stuff while you're being briefed, rather than being stuck in place staring at a person talking. Wildlife is unique but still believable. Enemies vary tactics so they don't all attack exactly the same way every single time. Giant map with multiple ways to travel. I love the mining system, keeps it from being nothing but combat. Good fps elements, great rpg elements. Definitely NOT pay-to-win. The only thing you'll ever HAVE to pay for is the ""you're special"" VIP mode, which is nifty but completely unnecessary. All other items can be obtained through in-game means... with a bit of work (As far as I've seen thus far, anyway).Now, it is true that sometimes your objective is a LONG way from where you are. HOWEVER! This is NOT a bad thing. When you put this much effort into a game, it's not too much to ask that for the first few levels you actually look at the world they created. The bikes and stuff come soon enough and there are glider pads everywhere to leap-frog between wherever you need to go. ENJOY the game. It's worth enjoying.One of the best games I've ever played and easily the best free game I've ever played.Come join us, Pilot! The Accord can use all the help it can get! ^_^			"

I started playing yesterday and i to my surprise im already 12hrs+ into the game and FOR ME that isnt normal.........Play it and feel more than welcome to add me to your friends list Bwiggzz.Just a side note....i noticed that there are some negative reviews about the game, which is fine, however, because of the reviews i almost didnt play the game and i am happy i did......my point is use game reviews as guidlines and not the final say because people's opinions are different and that is a good thing, but just try for yourself and see if it for you....Have a great day everyone!

												Really enjoy this, seems a bit repetitive at the beginning but really develops into a wide and encompassing event. The open play environment lets you cooperate with others in challenging encounters with out having to be grouped yet grouping is possible and rewarding. The game play brings to mind Serious Sam/Doom with jet packs. I have played many games and would rank this definitely in the top 10 of all I have played in my 20 years of PC and console gaming.			"

												First of all, if you are looking for a casual MMO to waste time on, GET OUT!With that out of the way let's get started.  The game is a pleasent blend of Planetside, Borderlands, WoW, and a flight sim.Graphics- The game's asthetics are pleasing to look at.  While nowhere near groundbreaking, the terrain looks nice and the people feel allive (as long as you can ignore the awkward animations). The many different places are all beautiful to look at and glide through.Mechanics- The game machanics are what really sets this game apart from other MMOs.  The simple change to 1st person makes the combat so much faster and difficult.  While most games force you to learn what each move does in order to be good, this game makes you rely on your own skill to survive.Story- What can I say? It's an MMO, so the story is a little convaluted.  A giant space thing hit the earth and made everyone sad. Then aliens came to Earth and made everyone dead.  You're their only hope...blah blah blah... A few interesting questlines, but nothing to brag aboutCommunity- The community-from what I've seen-is very welcoming and friendly.  Sure there are one or two morons and jerks here and there, but overall it's a good community.  The economy is very, what's the word?... oh yes: unpredictable.  Realistic sure but frustrating too.Overview- The game is very good.  I give it a 9/10.			"

												There is nothing groundbreaking here.  Firefall is a well rounded sci-fi fps action title.  It's fx and gameplay are similar in scope to borderlands titles.  Where this game shines is its replay value and simplicity.  Harvesting raw materials is actually entertaining, which rewards the dev team high marks.

												Free-to-Play sci-fi MMO Shooter, not much competition on the PC platform for that genre (Destiny is coming), for free that is. Not tempted to throw money at it yet, the metascore of 60/100 is accurate. Still a good game to play with friends and it has a lot of potential for growth. The Digital Deluxe Edition is too expensive and the Digital Starter Pack looks pale in comparison. Sure I can criticize this game on so many levels but it's free and I enjoyed playing it despite its flaws.			"

												I'm writing this review having put in 225 hours so far, doing general quests, exploring and trying to get in the events as much as possible. I would definately recommend this game, the art style is very interesting, there is NO PAY TO WIN, sure you can get some boosts for xp and the like and a faster bike to travel on but a lot of this can be attained through playing and earning credits in game.There is a token system for buying items and upgrades from the quest hubs which can be earned by doing quests from those hubs, then you have credits and red beans, the red beans can be bought for real money, but again you can earn these in game. These tokens buy much of the visual upgrades, armor paints, camo patterns and hats etc (this has hats galore for all the collectors out there)From just doing quests I have got tokens and won (in the bases token machines) two of the most expensive bikes to date and the legendary glider, so I cant say the drop rates for these are too bad either!I have max leveled three of the battleframes so far and am working on others too, the open world and job board quests are a nice refreshing mix when you are roaming the map, the end game is fairly limited currently but that will come as many MMO type games work on the beginnings first. The landscapes are interesting to traverse and there are many hidden bases and underground caverns to explore and clear out!I felt I should write this review as there seems to be a few people writing bad reviews that have either not made it out of the tutorial area thinking the game is that limited in actions or people who havent even reached the second area (the first area/zone is nice to run around in and I thought well made, and it gets better/tougher & more interesting the further you go).

												I really tried to give this game a try once more, but I was pretty disappointed. I created a new character (Since my old one reset.) Tried to do the tutorial but the game kept lagging (not performance lag) and made it pretty much unplayable. It felt like the tutorial missions have no end, all there was to do is follow checkpoints (it was really hard to reach them with the lag). That was like, two days ago; I just tried to give it another shot, thinking maybe the servers were just laggy for a day or so. Today I could not login at all, so instead of playing the game, I am sitting here giving a negative review about it.

												Lots of bugs. When you cannot get through the first door at the start of the game because the NPC doesn't spwn properly, or, when you are doing a mission and the NPC spawns on the roof of the building instead of in the actual spawn location, the game becomes unplayable. Even other users will suggest to new players where the NPCs are and it becomes an easter egg hunt to find them all.Graphics are good, the actual game play is good when it works, but due to the bugs and stuff, it just makes for an all around clunky experience which is a shame.I cannot recommend this game, unless you are willing to put up with the bugs, frequent bugs.

												Highly recommend the game to anyone who wants an open world MMOFPS, especially anyone who also loves sci-fi. I believe they will also add in guild vs guild areas if it's not in already as well as a map where guilds can compete to control territory to gain resources (think planetside except much smaller scale).The game is free to play with a cosmetic cash shop and a ""premium"" sub option which increases the exp and resources you get. They've had founder packs, open beta packs, and now I guess some sort of ""launch"" packs. All of that along with the inclusion of a cash shop AND a premium sub really rubs me the wrong way. It feels far too greedy. I won't get into the history of the game and the developers, I'm sure plenty of other people will go into that and you can find it all over the internet (essentially they kept redesigning crap due to community feedback, which is fantastic but you have to stick to what you add at some point because you're just wasting money by spending time constantly redesigning systems. I think we're at the point where they are sticking to it).The game plays very well, it's not too easy of a game, a lot of people found it quite challenging. If you do find it easy there are always plenty of things in the game that you can do to challenge yourself with things like higher level personal thumpers or soloing group thumpers. Thumpers are basically something you call down from the sky to ""mine"" resources. You have to defend the thumper from waves of enemies for a certain period of time. Better thumpers take longer to fill up (and obviously extract more resources total) but because of that they also attract harder enemies and larger waves of enemies because of the ""noise"" they create.You can switch from fps to tps. They are constantly adding new content and there are mods available to change up the UI or just help with various in-game things like keeping track of where resources are alerting you of dynamic events that are happening.Battleframes are all fairly unique, there are 4-5 base ""classes"" and they each currently branch out into 2 specialized frames for a total of 20(?) or so battleframes. The specalized battleframes will also branch out into more specialized ones later on unless they've scrapped that idea recently.Either way, watch some videos, give the game a shot if you find it interesting. Just be aware that A LOT of things have changed from the beta so DON'T watch old videos of the game and judge it by that. Watch new videos or wait until someone you like makes a video about it. I think I've spent well over 100 hours in Firefall, I've only just recently gotten it on Steam. I also bought the commander founders pack. Just thought I should throw those two things out there.			"

												Highly recommend the game to anyone who wants an open world MMOFPS, especially anyone who also loves sci-fi. I believe they will also add in guild vs guild areas if it's not in already as well as a map where guilds can compete to control territory to gain resources (think planetside except much smaller scale).The game is free to play with a cosmetic cash shop and a ""premium"" sub option which increases the exp and resources you get. They've had founder packs, open beta packs, and now I guess some sort of ""launch"" packs. All of that along with the inclusion of a cash shop AND a premium sub really rubs me the wrong way. It feels far too greedy. I won't get into the history of the game and the developers, I'm sure plenty of other people will go into that and you can find it all over the internet (essentially they kept redesigning crap due to community feedback, which is fantastic but you have to stick to what you add at some point because you're just wasting money by spending time constantly redesigning systems. I think we're at the point where they are sticking to it).The game plays very well, it's not too easy of a game, a lot of people found it quite challenging. If you do find it easy there are always plenty of things in the game that you can do to challenge yourself with things like higher level personal thumpers or soloing group thumpers. Thumpers are basically something you call down from the sky to ""mine"" resources. You have to defend the thumper from waves of enemies for a certain period of time. Better thumpers take longer to fill up (and obviously extract more resources total) but because of that they also attract harder enemies and larger waves of enemies because of the ""noise"" they create.You can switch from fps to tps. They are constantly adding new content and there are mods available to change up the UI or just help with various in-game things like keeping track of where resources are alerting you of dynamic events that are happening.Battleframes are all fairly unique, there are 4-5 base ""classes"" and they each currently branch out into 2 specialized frames for a total of 20(?) or so battleframes. The specalized battleframes will also branch out into more specialized ones later on unless they've scrapped that idea recently.Either way, watch some videos, give the game a shot if you find it interesting. Just be aware that A LOT of things have changed from the beta so DON'T watch old videos of the game and judge it by that. Watch new videos or wait until someone you like makes a video about it. I think I've spent well over 100 hours in Firefall, I've only just recently gotten it on Steam. I also bought the commander founders pack. Just thought I should throw those two things out there.			"

												I played this on and off since the beginning of beta. It was certainly ambitious, trying different things such as open-world events, giving players tons and tons of freedom. Its character progression was also quite atypical, using resources and stuff to enhance your battleframe. Firefall had great concepts and great ideas, but it fell short on its execution. Firefall ended up lacking a sense of ""direction,"" an overall stale and lifeless feel. Makeovers and revamps of game mechanics and systems tried to fix this, but not to much avail.Not until now.Yet another rework of the game, but this time they're going back to the tried-and-true systems and models of traditional RPGs. For example, battleframes now have levels and gain EXP via quests and combat. Improvements to quests and storyline have given players a sense of direction. New zones, more space to play in, and 20-person raids, and so much more! With this makeover, Firefall loses some of its ""unique-ness,"" but becomes a million times better.If you were disappointed by Firefall in the past, I strongly suggest you try it again now. If you're a new player, the game officially launches on June 29 2014! Play Firefall now!			"

												TL;DR: I like to jump and shoot stuf  and this game let's me jump(jet) and shoot stuff!I don't recommend this game becaus it woudl be good now but for the otential it coudl have been. Plenty good points are still there like the gameplay itself. I so wish some other company would get this kind mmo made too , well guess it is to wait em8erwhile you still can :( --------------------------------------------------------------F2p shooter mmo with jumpjets and such guaranteeing a great mobility no matter which frame you play,  Those are some main things that makes me love this game. It is rather unique game and not so easy to explain, certainly no wow clone. I have been playing this game bit over year now and even in its beta it had little available content  it kept me pulling back to it steadily. There just isn't similar games out there. With the coming update content and playable area will be expanded a lot and there are many changes made to streamline the experience. Can't say i agree with all changes but for most people will like it more that way (like removing perma breaking gear and constraints. I liked the ideas of them, but many didn't )Instead the classes this game has frames, currently there are 5 archtypes and everyone starts with accord version of each which is kinda balanced frame. Then with playing game or buying you can get 11 more frames that are different approaches of those archtypes. Best part is that you don't need to have alt character to play frames but you can switch the frame in any town or watchtower. or even on field if you have made yourself battleframe stations. gameplay itself well it is shooting things as shooter should be, there are ares missions here and there on world and randomly happening dynamic events like bandit ambushs, melding tornados and chosen deathsquads coming to hunt you! Then new thing coming are ares jobs which seem to be your usual quests. Then there is personal campagin with instanced missions Then there is resource gathering with thumpers that are pretty much horde mode mini missions where you decide to drop down your thumper , search good resources with scanning area and then choose place and get the thumper down and kill stuff that tries take it down. 1.6 updateYep, still love the game even if it isn't perfect  and new update was mixed bag. some content was lost for now but again what is left feels lot better most of part (outside bugs). I really love how places in sertao can suddenly turn out total war with bandits and chosens and bugs fighting each other.  Currently end game ow area is rather small, who wants to do low level stuff and get lower level items , hopefully expanding updates come soon enough to fix that1.7The new area is quite dissapointment with Event not working and too many level 44&45 ares jobs are wait and gather. Then again Sertao area is now so much better with stuff working as far i i checked out and is actually better place to level than devils tusk anyway. So i am kinda happy :)New baneclaw is pretty fun to farm needs some coordination and gives reason for support frames to exist (even biotechs no matter how people say it is all about electrons) The new raid weapons are mixed bag. I like how they are different from normal weapons and both frames of that archtype can use them. Though them being pretty much far more powerful than any other weapons kinda turns them too obvious choices for everyone. New mission Homecoming is pretty nice and boss having some mechanics that make it pretty difficult even when you have superb gear keeps him interesting  for multiple runs. Though i guess he is quite lot easier with group than alone. But i like the added challenge.			"

												The recent changes that the developers have made in the recent months have made my experience in the game very frustrating. Used to be a great action shooter but now everything is extremely complex, from the new leveling system to the new mission system. And the worst part is, just as I maxed out my Firecat frame- They made all my gear unusable and I was forces to salvage all my gear into money, so now I'm stuck with maxed out frames with stock gear and no idea of what to do with my in-game money.TL;DR- Newcomers will have fun, veterans will have a hard time converting into the new game systems.

There's a wide world to explore and a lot of new story content to take part in along with epic instanced missions with friends and even more epic raids. The combat of the game is kind of like Tribes crossed with borderlands, The story is surpisingly interesting and deep, There's tons of things to do and lot's more on the way. Bet of all, unlike most free to play MMO's, there are no pay to win schemes in this game. Give it a shot afterall it's free!			"

												Firefall is a game that is ok, for the first few hours. After you reach about level ten, the game becomes a grindfest and every time you do level up, you get nothing. In the game you have a battleframe(class) 2 wepon slots and 4 powers. the battleframe dictates what your primary wepon is and what the powers are. Some powers are almost the same( assults crater and dreadoghts repulsor are aoe attacks that do alot of damage) and some are outmached by wepons, the enginers manual turent is the same as the dreadoghts primary but last for 20 seconds. the world is level based and if you explore too much, you die quick. The AI is the worst i've ever seen and can be beaten by sitting in a legde and unloading on them. One of the biggest problems of this game is if you want better stuff you have to fork over real money to get it, each battleframes max level is 40(witch is hard to get to because its a grindfest) and ranking it gets you the more advanced version of the class, if you want the advanced version without puting weeks into this game you have to pump money into the game. the jobs are stupid and the charaters are strange. also the story is about a superior alien race named the chosen attacking earth but the game hints that humans started this war and scerewed themselves by biulding a battleship and sending it to ""recover"" some recorces from the chosen planet. Even though the game says the chosen are everywhere, I couldn't see the chosen until i was an hour in the game!these are the things that where copied from other games.battleframe= dericet copy from warframes warframe.aranahas= defiances hellbug.thumper= half lifes thumper.chosen= look just like slenderman, but with a faceassalts crater= another warframe refrance, but relating to the mod heavy impact.enginer= has a turrent and and repair machines with a wepon, that doesn't sound familar at all!(TF2 for those who don't get it)I give this game a 4/10, has potential but the devs where so lazy that it is half a game.

												I have had a fondness for this game all throughout its development. There have been some mistakes and wrong turns along the way, but I think they are back on-track making this game back into what it could have been. The patch that is expected in Jan 2016 should bring back Jetball (a pvp basketball type game), as well as smooth out some of the other design flaws in prior builds. Give this game a shot and try out the 1.6 patch, or this game may get the funding support completely yanked out from under it and disappear.			"

												Every thing is free. You can get currency that you can buy free as well. Crystite is your answer. As long as you have a lot of Crystite you can get ""Red Beans"" By changing your Crystite into Credits and buying Red Beans with those. Its a long process to get enough Crystite but if you work at it you can get a lot of it at one time. Thumping and missions help a lot with this. Thumping because it draws in enemies that drop Crystite and Missions because they normally give Crystite from both enemies and when you complete the mission. Now as for the gameplay its straight forward. You have your jumpjets which allow you better mobility than in most games. You have your abilities which allow you up to four over time. Level 8 is when you have all four. Then you have your two guns. You can also add modules to both abilities and your guns. Now if your playing a class like Arsenal your abilities give you a couple extra guns with a small amount of ammo each. One clip.Now some people will argue that the game is to hard. This can be true if your not accustom to massive enemies even if they are weak but great in size. Thumping can be an example here. some times enemies can be great in size so you have to kill more. Or they can be less in size but stronger. It all depends on where you thump. For example thumping in new eden can result in great numbers but weaker enemies while thumping in other places could result in less enemies but stronger ones. Of course you have a chance in new eden to cause magor enemies to spawn in massive amounts as well. Yes I am talking about the Chosen. In one spot I have noticed if you drop a Squad Thumper you spawn in four to five drop pods. This causes a ton of Chosen to appear and the Chosen are a pain to kill pending on where you fight them. So it can be hard if your not accustom to fighting loads of enemies and using abilities at the same time. Also if your not accustom to fighting in groups.I say give it a try at least. You never know if you're going to like it unless you actually try it.			"

												This is a game that really needs to be avoided. It's unfinished. It feels like the development team behind it have no idea where to go with the game. It has been several years now and the game is just as miserable as in beta, not much has changed with the core of the game during all this time. The switch to turn it into a generic mmo was a very bad move, ie quests and levels(like any other mmo). I would say that it was better during the beta than it is now. The sad part is that many glitches and bugs with the terrible interface has not yet been fixed after all thes years. Maybe at some point it'll turn out into an okay game but I seriously doubt it. Has nothing happened after all these years then it'll never happen.It says that I've only played it for 1.5 hours which isn't true. I played it ~10 months ago and leveled a frame to 40 and some other to 25. I did however play in the beta as well... whenever that was.			"

												Firefall is one of the most addicting, fun, and awesome games i have ever played. It's a rpgmmo, so of course it has grinding, but that's not the right word. They've made gather xp and weapons REALLY fun. Theres a mission board wherever you go, so you will never be bored. If you don't like doing the missions, then there are random events like the brontodon king to fill up your time. You can mine for resources, make your own weapons, use gliders, call in cars, and do all kinds of stuff. To top it all of, you are given a jet pack so you dont have to skyrim your way over mountains! And, at the begining of the game, you can choose what class you want to play as. You can run it and shoot somebody in the face with a shotgun and run out before they can do anything about it with the Bioscience class, let machines do the work for you with the Engineer class, mow enemies down with a giant minigun as the Dreadnought, or snipe a creach from a mile away with the Recon. 9238715914365197865/10 IGN			"

												Everyone has always beaten around the subject of an MMO shooter, and believe it or not, this comes closer than any other game iv'e played so far. Think borderlands, but MMO. Fantastic game with fantastic gameplay and combat system. Yes, the game is a little rough around the edges, and needs bug fixing in a few places, but honestly between a level 1-40 playthrough, i only encountered a couple of issues here and there. Endgame content, while present and active, is not the huge thing that it should have been, and rather players are encouraged to play many different classes to a higher level in order to gain special perks that are account-wide. As far as i can tell, this game is a 7/10 for me, little rough and not graphically titanic, but an awesome game, and totally hooked.			"

												Firefall is one of the most addicting, fun, and awesome games i have ever played. It's a rpgmmo, so of course it has grinding, but that's not the right word. They've made gather xp and weapons REALLY fun. Theres a mission board wherever you go, so you will never be bored. If you don't like doing the missions, then there are random events like the brontodon king to fill up your time. You can mine for resources, make your own weapons, use gliders, call in cars, and do all kinds of stuff. To top it all of, you are given a jet pack so you dont have to skyrim your way over mountains! And, at the begining of the game, you can choose what class you want to play as. You can run it and shoot somebody in the face with a shotgun and run out before they can do anything about it with the Bioscience class, let machines do the work for you with the Engineer class, mow enemies down with a giant minigun as the Dreadnought, or snipe a creach from a mile away with the Recon. 9238715914365197865/10 IGN			"

												Firefall.. where to start? Let's begin in the negative reviews. Firefall has been bombarded with negative reviews ever since it begun. Why? Red 5 (probably a specific developer that I believe was fired) kept changing what the game was based around, at one stage it would be all about pve and then swap to pvp, etc. The hyped up fans quickly lost interest and plummetted. The IGN review scored a 5.7/10 from some reviewer who outlined false reasons or reasons that have been dealt with as to why it was a mediocre game. If you'd look at the community ratings it's up in the 8s or something. Personally it's a 10. Firefall has so much to do whether it be pvp, pve, crafting, travelling, emotes, etc etc. I think many people should give it another shot as it has vastly improved since release and is constantly getting better. In addition to this, the long-despised crafting system will have many major improvements in the next patch (in a week or so). So I recommend trying Firefall out again, I'll see you in game!~Capteign			"

												I was for the longest time looking for a game to play with my friends and with my wife.  and recently lost my job so looking for something free to play.    and most of my friends always played MMOs and we all use to love counter strike.   so I thought we should get 2 birds stoned at once and play firefall.      So far I am really enjoying the game getting both my MMO fix and my Shooter fix at the same time.   Things to note if you want to give the game a try.~ The tutorial is lack luster and the game takes awhile to learn whats going on~ I have so far never had anyone be rude to me in the game while asking newb questions~ The game, Like most MMOs is fun with friends, i found myself a little bored when my friends logged out.~ You might feel like the game is harder than it needs to be between level 8 and 15 if you didn't pick assault and are playing solo,   Keep in mind the Game is Free to play and if you pay for VIP (about the same Cost of pay-to-play for any MMO around  These problems are easily avoided.~ You get a Mount IF  you log back in after your first hour session within 24-48 hours. but this bike isnt listed in your inventory unless you look at a small tab at the top right of your inventory.   So it took awhile to realize I had the item and playing without a mount in this game would drive you mad. Overall I am really happy with it so far, I joined a clan and plan to continue playing it up to the end game content and see where that takes me.    If your going to play firefall I suggest~Bring a friend~Be willing to learn^Sometimes Via google.~Ask for help if you dont understand or cant find something. People are helpful in this game.			"

												Steam might say i only got 4.6 hrs on record but trust me, i've been playing this game since CLOSE BETA, i've been watching this game growsAt first the first time i see the old gameplay i fell like this is gonna be a great game like borderlands 2 but with an MMO twist on it! then i got into the close beta then i felt something is wrong, well it was just a close beta it's doesn't reflect the final game and it sould be fun later on right? NO! the game got worse since then! i still remember the feeling when i was playing in close beta, i can feel the ""sense of achievment"" the ""sense of progression"" then lots of patch after they RED5 like took it all away from us, Us players were confused with what the hell are we supossed to do with the game, all of the missions felt like cheap sidequest, too much bug, the crafting feel hella slow.The guy on the other review was right, it's a sunking ship, i'm feeling the same thing as he is feeling right now, this game HAD a huge potential on it's own and HAD A LOT OF CHANCES to fix it before the game got released into the public. Unfortunately, It's too late, it's already labeled as a BAD DISSAPOINTING GAME which just throw away our big hopes on this ""Borderlands mmo"" game... shame for those who throws their money on this failed game before it even came out			"

												Despite a troubled past, the game is just plain fun and getting better every day. You really have nothing to lose by installing it and checking it out. You get to run/hover/fly around shooting mobs in their stupid mob faces. You can group with other players or go solo. All of the quests have voice over so you don't have to sit and read everything. If you want PvP there is an in-game sport called Jetball that is frantic and fun. I'm having a great time.			"

												Even though I said no, I'd give it a maybe if there was a button for it. But I can't whole heartedly endorce it. Used to love playing this game. Now it all changed once it was launched from beta. Took away a lot of what I liked about the game..now seems like a different game all together. Occassionally I log in, but I dunno, just get kind of lost and bored with it. I always was a bit lost with the open sandbox, and once I got used to the game it, I kind of liked it. But now, I dunno. Not liking that they took the fun out of it. I enjoyed the crafting and the thumping, and now that is all missing and changed. Battleframes have been revamped too, maybe for the better? 3 of each seemed too much, not much difference from the base and the next one up.			"

												Firefall is a FPSMMO in a world full of MMORPG in that regards its a great change. Alot of the negative reviews you will find are made by people who played prior to the launch of the game and alot of the positive are people who played after it launched. The battleframes are all varied enough to feel different when you play them.  If all you do is run missions from the job board it gets repetitive fast. if you do world events while you do those not only do you tend to level faster but its feels alot less grindyThe only real flaw i see in the game is its crafting system which is to time consuming to even bother with pre 40 (which is the max level) and is duanting even then with its high resource reqs and RNG mechanics.With that said the game has plenty of room for growth and Red5 has been pretty quick about adding content and adjusting things in game. The devs actually play the game as pilots like you and me and as chosen for some events			"

												This game was -for me- the best mmotps out there when it was in the beta. So many things to do. You could just run around do world events with players that you've never met for hours. Make friends, parties etc. They removed the best events, level system just sucks and after pvp rebalances only few classes barely at that was viable to solo. Some classes became straight unviable for both purpuse. Game became worse and lost its orginality with every patch and I think its just worthless pay to win of an mmo. Good job devs. You did it. Don't know how did you manage to turn this masterpiece to a worthless game but you did. "

												Another great F2P game, if you want to get away from the boredom of other games you play everyday.There are some things to say about this game, which got me thrilled into this game.Basically, you can choose whatever class you want to play as with 5 total: Biotech, Assault, Dreadnaught, Engineer, and Recon.If you are playing this for the first time. I'd suggest playing as Assault because this class has decent weapons to start off with. If you are very experienced, and yet you are bored, try out the other 4 classes.Just a bit of problem: when you play and launch the game for the first time, you have to watch this boring, but long cutscene about some soldiers being attacked by giant insect monters, or whatever they are, I don't know...Lastly, I can't say that this game is like Borderlands, but a little like it.Anyways, this game is worth a try for you, just don't have a crap computer running this.7/10			"

FIND'EM, LOVE'EM, GET USED TO'EM! The main reason why you will quit this game;- The game mounts are only rentable, without any option to buy them;- Slow, boring, snail-paced game; if you're expecting a fast-paced FPS game, like Quake, move on;- PVP is dead, takes 4 eons to find a match, and if you do, someone will crash or disconnect anyway;- Half of the original content got shelved, because reasons;- Etc.PROS::- It had potential in beta;CONCLUSION::- RIP			"

												Combat and gameplay were decent, and the visual style was pretty cool.  The thing that made me leave though is the fact that to use a sniper rifle you have to level another frame that can't use them to level 40.  I didn't like how I was forced to play with a gun type I didn't care about just to get to one I did. Locking all the ""Advanced Frames"" makes a barrier that some people won't want to go through to get to the weapon type they want to use.			"

For in Firefall there are two gameplay scenarios1- The sound of your gun glitches, eliminating all the sound of the environment, characters and even the basic game sound effects, leaving you to the torturing symphony of your gun firing nonstop, this happens when you use the weapons the way you're suppossed to use them2-you run into a (prop?) that the game has not loaded yet, you may be able to border it, UNLESS OF COURSE this invisible item is an objective that you supposedly have to interact with, so, yeah, you're kinda ♥♥♥♥edan ""engaging gameplay experience like no other"" indeed.

												What was once a totally playable and sometimes even fun experience is now nothing but a frustrating husk of its former self, plagued by awful hit detection, lag, poor mission design that makes you wonder if anything was even playtested, and an increasinly small player base. With the most recent update and server switch, there are somehow even more bugs than there have ever been at any point in this game's life. They completely threw several classes out the window, and totally ♥♥♥♥ED several key mechanics of the game. It was an entirely poorly done patch and server migration that not only ruined the already repetitive and boring gameplay, but also entirely ♥♥♥♥ed paying customers over by making certain account items bugged and unusable (bye bye certain customization items, I can no longer wear my Sky Warden or any of the other stuff I unlocked). They've entirely removed features like weapon crafting with a simplified grindfest mechanic known as ""tinkering"". ""♥♥♥♥ YOU FOR LEVELING UP YOUR CRAFTING ABILITIES IN ORDER TO CRAFT THE BEST WEAPONS!"" - Red 5, pretty much. They also removed a few of the classes as well as a bunch of other great features. All things considered, any of the potentially redeeming features this game has to offer are so outnumbered by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and frustrating features that I'm forced to suggest that you stay away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It was once my favorite free to play MMO on Steam, but because the devs keep ♥♥♥♥ing everything around, most often for the worse, I can't recommend it. In the state that it's in as of writing this, it deserves to die off.			"

												So I have to admit. I have just about put aside every other game since I started playing this.  While yes, it is free to play, I would think of it more as an extended demo. Play it, and if you like it, you will eventually support the devs and put money into it. The elite battle frames are a bit cooler than the vanilla frames, but don't get me wrong even the vanilla frrames are awesome. The open world exploration is pretty darn cool too. It does a great job at easing you in to the deep. It is also boat loads of fun when you are with a squad. Cons: Zomg that annoying assistant that constantly keeps talking or rather nagging. So annoying. I'd pay to get a different voice asistant. But game is a blast.Update: Game is still a blast specially since recent updates and added features such as elemental weapons.  I did get the Premium package that contained all the battle frames and do not regret it for one second.  If you like the vanilla frames you will deffinitely enjoy the unlockable ones.			"

Please understand that this is an MMO, even with all of its uniqueness, so any reviews you read are very time-sensitive; as of this review, it just hit version 1.1.  The official launch changed many things, making it much more approachable and way more fun for newer players (and some grizzled grognards like me.)  While I miss the old complexity in resources/crafting and hope that we'll get some of it back later, I have to say that this version is more fun to play than ever before.  There's always things to do, at your own pace and in your own style. (Providing said style is running, flying, shooting, and using abilities.) The classes are different enough to keep play fresh, and the whole 'one character, but classes at different levels that you can switch to nearly at will' mechanism is my favorite MMO innovation yet.  I'm an alt-holic, and I own that.  Resource gathering (once the primary activity) is now largely seen as useless, but the short story missions are rewarding (mechanically and narratively) and short enough to stay engaging.  The fact that everyone gets rewards if they contributed to a mission/event success, without taking away from others' loot, really encourages assisting your fellow players in most areas, and the amount of tweaking (while far from what it used to be) that you can do to your weapons and abilities is really enjoyable.  It doesn't feel 'grindy' to me at all, and combat and exploration remains incredibly fun whether it's desperately trying to survive an ill-advised, overconfident assault on mobs far too tough for you or strolling through a lower-leveled zone and obliterating critters like a vengeful deity.  It's free, and does microtransactions and currency conversion better than any 'free' game I've played to date; all unlocks are aesthetic or convenience, and I haven't regretted purchasing any of them.  Is it a game for everybody?  No.  PC only, doesn't play well with most emulation these days.  If you don't like your games twitchy, or want raids with complex strategy and teamwork required, or really need constant PvP options, this current version will likely disappoint you.  I had many friends bemoan the loss of Star Wars Galaxies' incredible, in-depth crafting, (pre Jump to Lightspeed, natch) and telling me how nobody does anything like that anymore; I loved being able to point to Firefall and blow their minds.  But Red 5's doing an incredible job of keeping the content coming, and has events most weekends to encourage you to try new frames or in-game events.  I really do recommend that everybody try it out, with each of the Accord battleframes at least to level five or so; if you liked old-school Starsiege: Tribes (No skiing, sadly) or team-based shooters, this is a wonderful way to play cooperatively with friends.  Hell, just installing it and exploring all of Coral Forest via glider and jumpjets and taking in the amazing work they did on scenery is worth your time.   Worst case scenario, you uninstall it and go about your life.  But you may have found an incredible, plucky little mash-up of some beloved genres here, with a wonderful community and innovative gameplay.  If that's the case, please tell your friends and play together; like most MMOs, it's even better with a team.			"

												Hop on an play with your friends for a couple hours at a time. Combat is very fun--can be playing in third person or first person.  There is only a grind if your only goal is to max out your level.  There is great class diversity and a good variety of abilities specific to each class.  The FTP model is VERY FAIR. Cash shop Items are not rediculously expensive and all ingame currency can be converted to cash shop currency for a reasonable exchange rate. If you like flying around on jump jets, heavy machine guns, explosives, heavy armor suits, and a variety of good and cartoon like voice acting, this is the game for you!			"

												I was talked into this by a friend, I read the reviews, wasn't confident based on those, seemed very negative. But it was free to play so I took it and went in.It is very pretty, very simple to play, Once in-game you can change your class, no need to create multiple characters. So for example if you start as a Biotech (medic) and get her to level 6 then decide to start a Dreadnaught, the Dread begins at Lvl 1 and the Biotech holds at Lvl 6, If you go back to Bio you will be Lvl 6. The storage inventory is common so If your Biotech finds a dropped weapon for another class, no worries, just swap class, level up and equip the weapon.My only bug is the chat, having to type /s to change to squad chat or /z for zone chat whilst paused is kind of irritating, it's clumsy.Quests, Sort of repetitive but interesting until you start to repeat them or go elsewhere but as the map areas are level based, going elsewhere could get you killed.Don't like PvP? This game doesn't need it. One of the devices you can summon is a Thumper. A sort of autonomous mining device that extracts iron from the ground but has a serious side effect. It also irritates the locals and they do SWARM the Thumper. For about four minutes you just get waves of these bugs trying to eat you, the Thumper, your shoes and anything else. It's insane as a few players try to keep the Thumper safe from the hordes of bugs and speaking of the bugs, they are absolutely believable as sentient beings, well constructed, well drawn, aggressive and abundant. Think ""Starship Troopers"" and you get the sort of idea.Ignore the negative reviews, they do not reflect the game that I saw. It is free anyway so what are you losing by trying it. You have jetboots and gliders from the get go. And don't worry about character creation, it's sort of a bit back to front, they show you the classes to select, four are men, one is a woman. Then they want your character name and then you can select sex and face/hair. I was worried for a time that the classes were all gender based but was relieved when they were not.			"

												Firefall is a good free to play, if only he had more courage in merging MMO and FPS elements that constitute the core, would have really been able to make ends meet. I refer to the social components developed only partially and AOLA lack of an open PvP adequately contextualized: the lack of factions (the Chosen playable would really manna) and dedicated servers to clan warfare on a global scale is aging considerably a title, especially as it is a true F2P that sells for real money only aesthetic elements and boost the experience, still deserves to be recommended to all for the breadth of what it has to offer and the incisiveness of some goodies like the live event and the economic system. Ultimately lacks that degree of innovation that could elevate to something truly unique.			"

												I just level a character to 40 and i got to say that the the enviroment was so beautiful, the consept of the game is Shooter/Mmo just like borderlands! ithe conspet of grinding and leveling, at first i though that firefall was pay to win, but i decied to give it a try any way. and i got to say wasnt any pay to win, you can buy with credits (ingame money) thinks are not that expensive, so you will gear easly. so no-pay-to-win! stuff at level 40 wont sell or buy so yeah good game :)instances/raids(ihave to try those in a future)explore/pve/pvp all i wanted in a game. i'm used to play alot of shooters but im not really that competitive, and i love mmorpgs. and this game combined both. all my thoughts are messed up but thats what i got for this game 10/10 for a free to play game :) hope more in the future, this game is awesome!

												Well, this game was apperently good before update, but as it stands right now i reallyy dont know. I mean , i havent seen such dumb AI's in sooo long, i at one point finished eating my pizza while the mobs shot a wall.... My first encounter with Nian a boss that spawn in a , mind you beautifull looking world, was glitched to all hell, clipping into stuff, litterly and i mean literly not taking any damage what so ever, missions wouldnt load for me even if i abondoned and retried it, games insanely buggy, i mean soounds dont work sometimes, you fall threw the map ect, xD dont get me wrong this game is really nice looking, concept behind it is nice, but it's just too broken to even keep me wanting to play honestly, unless this game gets fixed, im not gonna bother >.<			"

												I played in the beta for this game and enjoyed it. It was different. The levels style was cool. There were so many materials and rescipes. Now in the full game is just straight up EXP leveling and there is no where near as much materials and recipes. Its a bit disapointing but its still a reasonable game.			"

												As a Beta player who quit after a week or so because I couldnt 'get' into the game; I was pleasantly suprised by this launch build. PROS:+ Huge world with varied terrain and beautiful lighting (if you can max it out); Beaches, Grassland, Tundra, Desert, Snow; Firefall has it all+ Engaging gameplay; all classes (Battleframes) play very differently and its fun to figure out how to use each one. The jumpjets add a certain verticality to the combat and makes an interesting dodge and avoid mechanic.+ Good Difficulty Curve - It starts of easy until level 10 or so when things become more challenging; level 15 onwards, at least one squad member is highly recommended.+ Earning money is actually Fun! - Unlike other MMOs; in firefall, ""Thumping""; which is the best way to earn money is actually a horde mode; needless to say thats much more fun than crafting 1000 necklaces.+ Good Story / Side-quests - The main story and all the side-quests are voice acted and remain engaging throughout; the absence of walls of text is most welcome.+ Good F2P Model - Firefall does not penalize you for being a Free player; the cash shop items are cosmetic only, besides the normal XP boost stuff and convenience stuff; even F2P players get vehicles and gliders and the ingame currency can be exchanged for the cash shop currency. All of the 16 battleframes are available to everyone.CONS- Backtracking - You can only take one quest at a time, which is not a big problem since 1 level = 2-3 quests; but they occassionally take you running to one corner of the map and back; thankfully there are random events  and constant predators to distract along the way.- Weapon Feel - Despite being fun (and some quite unique); the weapons lack a bit of 'punch'; enemies regularly have little or no reacton on taking a shotgun blast in the face; even though half their health bar dissapears. Overall Firefall is a worthy addition to the MMOs available to PC gamers; despite falling significantly short of its orignal promise; it holds up well against its peers and is in more than one way, Unique.Anyone interested in Shooters/RPGs/MMOs should try this out; it costs you nothing, and trust me; the first 1 hr of the game is the worst :)			"

												I was an Alpha Player from way back, great to see how far they've come from the early stages. the Map is HUGE now. Lots of content I have yet to see still, I think there is plenty to keep you occupied besides job boards and Story. My favorite feature has to be resource gathering using the ""Thumper"". It is not your average Resource Gathering in other MMO's  this things blasts from the sky and makes quite the entrance to gather resourses just for you. While it doe's all the work you have to protect it from creatures and bad guys alike trying to take down your thumper. I think the fact that this game found a way to implement Defensive Combat into Resource Gathering is game changing! take it up a notch and use a ""Squad Thumper"" with 4-5 of your friends...now thats Firefall!

												::CLOSED BETA REVIEW::Great game fun with friends and in my opinion not really pay to win i mean you cant buy overpowered weapons with real money all you can do with ""redbeans"" is buy Pets(which just FOLLOW you) and some paints, cosmetic items,you can also speed up the progress of things your craft with redbeans but you only need 1 for those other than that you can buy 1 hour XP boosts but what F2P game is without those and well besides all that stuff the game is outstanding in Graphics and combat but the story ehhhhhhh needs a bit of polishing. but you should just check it out for your self it's free on the 29th Gameplay: nice and solid not clunky feels just right  PvP: pretty fun Community: One of the best i've seen  Content: Enough to keep you playing for a while Voice Acting: Really funny XD Devs: Nice and Active Rating: 8.5/10::OPEN BETA REVIEW::    Left the game sortly after the Open Beta, came back and it has a bunch of new content (like 4 more new events; OCT,SkyDock,BK,Melding Nadoes) but i mean it has a really stong grindiy feel to it now.(i know every MMO has a grindy feel to it welcome to PC gaming) but this is a diffrent griding feel dont get me wrong the game has somewhat improved but i mean theres 16 frames in total and u have to max out one(Lv40) to get the next (future update wil make it so u can only get to Lv20  if you want to then u can pick a new frame) and i mean you'll have to grind on your main frame then when u get a new one u have to grind on the same missions over and over and over again, but people will tell you just do events dont repeat missions but then what are you doing with the events just repeating and repeating to grind a new frame to your main frame's current statis and with PvP gone (their adding it soon) i mean the game gets really boring really fast. the only thing keping me going is the Unlockables im just probably going to get them then im done, unless PvP dose good and dosnt die again........but even tho i only listed a negative thing(s) i still think its worth a shot if u havent played it cause the Devs are quite active,but for me its getting Dull But for you it could be the game you've always wished for.Gameplay: Still nice and Solid not really clunky PvP: GONE Community: Still one of the best i've seen (has somewhat gone down in pop) Content: Enough to keep you playing for a while Voice Acting: Still Really funny XD Devs:Still Nice and Active Rating: 8/10			"

												[EDIT SECTION: I lost a lot of interest in this game due to bad changes since I left my previous review... This game has been turned upside down so much mainly due to new ownership. They actually switched ownership more than once too. They also screwed over all the older players during the 2nd major weapon/armor/inventory overhaul making me lose my maxed out gear for multiple frames and being left with inferior set-up for them especially since 1/3rd my gear was from KanaBana Raids even owning some HardMode quality (+2 stat)]Random Note: First off I've been playing since PVP Closed Beta NDA times. Lots has changed but now the game has finally settled to what it is now and I have seen many many many changes good 'n bad throughout the builds and feel they finally did what looks to be a good/realistic outcome.First off the game is more enjoyable grouping up/with friends! You can do stuff solo to which I do alot but it definitely pays off to be in a squad working together more often than soloing. Some of the missions at the ares job boards truly add to the lore of FireFall so even if your one of the few with all maxed frames it's worth checking them out! Particular the storyline involving the chosen that I've only done a part of so far. Their still working on things to make it easier for new players such as improving the tutorials etc... But as it stands now it does a pretty good job + the community/mentors (have green apple icon) can help answer remaining questions. Due note though the perk system needs better explanation still especially when it comes to respec and other things like that. People may complain about the crafting system in game but the truth is the best gear is found in hard mode doing campaign missions mainly in blackwater at the moment (BWA for short) and modules fit into the weapons to improve them up to 3 total and yes it's recommended to be a max frame for hardmode BWA preferably with a group.Back to actual gameplay, you start out in copacobana (copa for short) and aero gives you tutorial/missions off the start to get you familiar with the game explaining how to get around, garage, ares job boards etc... This is also a game that mixes between your level/gear and your own personal skill at FPS games so it is possible to do missions above your level to some degree (dont try to be a lvl 10 in a lvl 30 area and expect good experience/grinding and so forth) Each frame has a few unique abilities aligned to it that they start off with and you can have 3 total regular abilities + an HKM (ultimate skill that charges over time by being in combat) All advanced frames can use their accord varients abilities as well which helps in customization later in game (Accord assault skills work on FireCat & TigerClaw as they are all assault classes) but the same is not true for the accord frame. Anyways at this point it's just better to dl the game and hop to enjoy the world of FireFall for yourself :)P.S. their are still bugs/balancing issues here and there just like any other game so if you discover something submit a bug ticket in game & definitely give feedback on forums if you feel something is missing/needed but try to search to see if anyone has already started that topic first before making a new one.

												Wow...I really really want to like this game...I don't know? I guess I could go back to Defiance :) first of all hasn't this game been coming out for like the last 9 years. I was excited when I first caught coverage of it like 3-4 years ago but... and secondly the game just looks awful. graphically it looks like they are trying to marry the look of Borderlands and Team Fortress 2 and it just falls flat. admittedly I have only started playing and as I play more I will update this review, but the controls are weird?? You use the left trigger on your XBox controller to run, left bumber jumps, WTF!? Some of the intro AI supports looked kind of interesting, but if you're buying this as a kindof PC FPS/MMO to rival the Playstation 4 game Destiny, I think you're going to be pretty disapointed :( as I've said I'm early on and I will update this review. I bought one of the starter packs for the game, so I'm playing now, but if you want to check it out, it comes out and is freetoplay on the 29th.In the mean time I have an Beat access code for Destiny on my PS4 so I'm going to go and play that :)Oh yeah and pleeease when you do a patch, update the graphics - they're...well I've said that already			"

												This game was extremely exciting, the menu music was loud and offered to rid me of my ears which I don't need anyway. The account creation itself was masterfully done, making me try to make an account 5 times ingame which never worked; ""Alright!"" I thought; ""Challenge Accepted!""Onward I went onto the Firefall site and tried making an account there. I enter my information and go forward, only to be greeted by the site that has now changed to German Language along with a pleasing text of ""Account Creation Failed"".Being the positive man I am, I went forward and tried other browsers...and THERE IT FINALLY WA-Nopeh. Still offering me a german version of the site instead, along with the ""Account Creation Failed"" -Greeting.All in all this game offered me enjoyment I never before had in any game and I would like to thank the Devs of this game for the experience. May many raisins and potatoes light your path Devs, I would say that in german to please you but my German is inadequate so I'll just say this in the hopes that it is enough for you; Lederhosen.			"

												I have played alot of MMO before (Pay to play ,one time purchase , free ), Not Firefall is the best MMO out there but also is one of the best games i have ever played , it has its own problems but no game is perfect . Before i start Firefall i've read many reviews and then i decided to download the game and give it a try and i didn't expect to see a beautiful game like this , always i spent most of my time playing PVP because PVE was boring after playing a while or after end story and i didn't like it much but in Firefall universe things went differently , i didn't know PVE can engage you like this , forget any PVE you have seen before Firefall is different and you will never get tired PVE , not even a single time i think about playing PVP in firefall ( I never been in pvp in firefall but im sure its also engaging ) . Firefall maps are really well made and its universe is memorable and all of them for free. It has huge freedom which you can find in few game ,you can fly anywhere do anything with amazing jet packs . Firefall defind me many standards and because of this i can't play many games  This game is 100% FREE and im playing it and enjoying it with my friend . I definitely 100% recommend this game ,you can't miss this one .			"

												So after a while since I made my first review, and even longer since I started playing, I think its time to redo my review.Pros:+ Shoot and loot gameplay that is similar to borderlands+ Good class variety helps incompass playstyles+ The NPC's actually pose a threat now a days, something they never used to.+ Slowly returning to the level of success that was the beta (very slowly)+ Many of the old interface issues  have been improved (some through gameplay, others through the interface itself)+ Weapons feel like they pack an actual punch+ Every character seams to have at least basic voice acting+ Gameplay flows better than it used to+ Tutorial is better than it used to be+ Better mission variety compared to about a year ago+ Resource and reputation mechanics have improved with timeCons:- Tutorial is still garbage (better, but still garbage)- Quality of voice acting varies extremely heavily from suprisingly good too dirt crap- Still loaded with bugs and glitches (falling through map, enemies not taking damage, dozens of audio bugs, incorrect map guidence, disipearing glider pads, etc...)- Still really difficult to work with friends when playing (still need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that one)- Annoyingly difficult to get an vehical that isnt the default- Cutscenes are really badly done (minus the opening cutscene)- Character models and portraits differ annoyingly- Map size feels small at times, something that really annoys me (bigger map and faster vehicals would be great)- Seamingly tone deaf developers that dont pay attention to community as much as they shouldOverview:I really like this game now these days. The string of improvments from say a year ago have deffinetly helped. That said, this game is still nothing like its beta. The beta was notorious for its strong gameplay, and it felt more rewarding because of it. Although that level of quality has not yet returned, I do still have hope for this games future. The apperently deaf developers, combined with updates that introduce massive lag and bug problems is sorry to see.Over all, this game deserves an 8/10			"

I've played destiny and some other games similar in regards to being an mmo styled shooters but this is my top. I would easily put it above destiny for gameplay NOT OVER ALL PRODUCTION of the game but as far as going around killing things and getting better gear this game to me is better than destiny and its f2p. With that in mind i have not had an encounter with the market or even looked through it. If you are looking to kill some time on a game you haven't played yet. Give it a try i'm sure the uninstall button will work fine if its not for you.			"

Basically the game is being ran by a chinese company now and we all know how much they love their grind and pay to win stuff.  If you are wanting to come back to the game, DON'T you lost your stuff and now you gotta spend waaaay more time getting geared back up and then down the road that work will mean nothing when they raise the level cap to 45 and then again to 50.

												Game without mass pvp only with Duel? C'mon...P.S Okay, I decided to give this game another try. PvE content in this game is quite unique comparing to other products. But lack of proper pvp here is the main thing that pushes me away. There is duel and Broken Peninsula map, reserved for end-game characters. Right. End-game. With this kind of mechanics this game is BEGGING for amazing PVP content. Where are guild (in this game its called Army) wars? Where is arena based pvp? Like CTF or Team Deathmatch, you click, you join the queue and wait for a match. You just grind your way to max lvl to just have a hope you may be able to kill something at BP. Check other reviews about pvp and you will know why I dont recommend this game, at least now. Im still waiting for any pvp improvement here.			"

												Great solid MMO. You'll see awesome visuals for a F2P. Custimization is limited and selective. Mad Guns and an easy to understand progressive crafting tree. Everything is based on the role type of character you select. Storyline is interesting and the enemies you fight are... not so unique. but hey monsters and bandits is always fun. 8/10 Would Hang Glide Again.			"

												A great game. I played since beta with alternating quit times. Now the questline is direct without getting the damned job oards. the game guide you first time you create character to a very well scripted questline. Leveling has benn done A LOT less grindy. every mission is almost one level making the game a really enjoyable MMO halo style. Classes have been reworked since patch 1.3 and, in my opinion, redesigned VERY well. Is fre, NOT A GRINDFEST like before, enjoyable and very light! (i run it in my old paper pc without fps problems!)totally worth it. Good work Red5!			"

												Firefall has the worst new player experience of any MMO I have ever played. The game seems to be focused around doing a single randomly generated mission at a time, before running back to the job board in town to get a new one. Trying to accept a second quest just overwrites the first one, and as punishment for your arrogance of attempting to do two quests at once now you have to listen to the mediocre ""quest intro"" VO work again. Then you often get to wait, because the server is trying to dynamically place the NPCs/objectives and seems to have a tendency to take 20-30 seconds longer than there's dialogue going to do so. That's okay, you can sit and stare at your objective tracker while it spins and says ""loading next objective"". Maybe you can use this time to find a friend! Good luck, because although the game doesn't appear to be sharded (in that it doesn't tell you what shard you are in or give you an option to change) it totally is! Eventually we searched online and found the /joinleader command, which is thus far the only way I've seen to change your shard and it requires being in a squad already.The shooting experience is pretty lackluster, with the AI happy to stand still while you shoot them in the head. This would be better if you got absolutely overwhelmed, but each mission just seems to spawn about a dozen or so guys and/or spiders for you to shoot before sending you off on a nice couple minute jog to the next objective (it's killing 20 more spiders, were you able to guess?) which you'll do 1-3 more times before returning to the originating NPC, and then back to the job board to repeat. The humanoid enemies aren't very good at hitting a moving target and the spiders can't catch you if you jump, cause combat to quickly slide into ""jump from side to side shooting in the direction of enemies."" There might be a dungeon at level 24, and it looks like 2 or 3 ""raid bosses"" at max level, but this game is so aggressively boring I can't imagine playing the time required to get there. Go ahead and try! I don't know anyone who wasn't forcing themselves to keep playing past level 4 or 5 in the hopes that the game will pick up and evolve.I feel for Red 5, dealing with the aftermath of Mark Kern's whimsical desires, but without the structured PVP to fall back on I'm just left wondering who thought this game would be successful in the year of our lord two thousand and fourteen. WoW, FFXIV, Wildstar, hell even Elder Scrolls Online provides a more engaging world and leveling experience. Planetside 2 is a far more capable MMO shooter, even Defiance is probably better than this. If they would have spent another year generating content this might have done okay, but from what they've got here I'm a bit concerned this is the final release from Red 5.If I had to guess why this game came out now, I'd say it's probably somewhere between the Mark Kern-earned venture capital running out and the realization that Destiny will likely bury it entirely.

												So pretty much this game is not what it was before the update.I remember playing it more than 2 years ago and I must say, grindingly it was, but still enjoyable.Now I do not know what am I even suppoused to say... So maybe I will just pin point the pluses and minuses:+ A good f2p game (I love how this game servs this type of gaming - the only premium things are skins)+ You can buy currency from real life money wih in-game money (red beans can be bought wih credits)+ Fast paced FPS or TPS+ Good co-op game (raids with even 12ppl doing same instance which takes sometimes 2 hours)+ Interesting instances and challenging enemies + Still enjoyable grinding (which i found weird)+ Interesing story of our responsibility as humanity in discovering unknown things+ Easy to understand interface (it was even easier before the update)+ Countless events with Devs Team and just normal ones (melding tornado, OTC, Bronto King, etc.)+ Game is still supported even though it has like 5 years now+ Good people to find in gameAnd now the minuses, get ready:- Repeatable quests (bring this, kill this, talk to this guy, etc.)- Grinding (for some it may be a bit of disadvantage)- Razor's Edge - This patch basically broke the entire game, making it nearly dead, I am gonna give some examples:- Lots of Bugs and glitches (kicking from the game, crashes, etc.)- Useless interface options (like, 3 windows for stupid log-in rewards? why?)- Not helpfull guide (and for returning high level veterans it's really annoying)- Trinking (and i thought our equipement was already overpowered)- Additional pieces of equipement (it took long enough time to level up a battleframe, and now it's gonna take even longer to lvl up your secondary class and gear it up)- Deleting many good ol' battleframes (Assalut on example) [I know there is a way for this, but y u do this? ;-;]- REAAAALLYY long loading (when you log in your screen goes black and it takes some time for it to load your character if you come back and not start fresh)- Not skippable guide (I hated this guide, I share hatred towards it, and I am gonna swear on it good)- Many closed sites after the patchSo hopefully the Red Team will fix this patch finally. because of that I give it thumbs up, albeit I'd rather recomend you thinking about playing this game at least for some time, because it's really hard to play right now. We need to wait for the Devs move.			"

												I played a lot back in beta.. 100s of hours easy yet this is just not the same game I used to love... Now the open world feeling has been changed to standard questing and leveling. Gathering and crafting is an extreme grind for little benefit and does nothing for the actual game, in fact it broke the economy completely. And just the social feeling it used to have, of working together and joining in with events at all times is gone for a single minded approach towards progression.They basically redisgned the game into a standard themepark system from it's previous mode which resulted in many systems feeling confused, out of place and not polished enough. Because of the large and constant changes it also lacks content. Much sad			"

												The game has potential,but it's so extremely buggy and unpolished I just can't recommend it until it's fixed.Just some of the problems that annoyed me:-You have to restart every few missions because NPCs who you must kill/talk to forget to appear.-You or your enemies occasionally fall through/get stuck in the ground.I lost one of the first missions because the boss got stuck in a tree and I couldn't damage it.Also died a bunch of times when I fell through texture.-The route planner hates roads and thinks you are a ghost.It will often try to send you through solid walls or the ground and instead of showing the road it will show you a way through cliffs and other obstacles to the nearest city.Which is pretty hard to navigate with a vehicle.-The spawn rate of enemies in world dungeons is so high that most missions can't be done on the recommended level without a group if you have a character that can't ""run and gun"" effectively.If you have to stop for a few seconds then enemies you killed 30 secs ago will just spawn behind you and you will be attacked from two sides.There are many good ideas in the game and it is fun though,so it's worth a try if you are very patient.

(normally was like 10 different kinds of ores/rarities)- U only get 10 points for buying a new battleframe after u level your lowbie batleframe to 40.That's 12,964,000 XP, u can get about 2k xp from a normal mission and about total 33.5k from a tornado (if it spawns in the right lvl area), u do the math...Read the review of Icedrake, i aggree 100% with this guy.

												Generic and somewhat dull. A lot of quests feel pointless as you stand around blasting blocks of 10-20 enemies that stand still blinking in the sunlight for a few seconds before trying to move. Oh, and along with twenty to thirty other people that reduce the encounters from a challenge to basically trying to get a shot or two made in your favour before they're all dead.Honestly, it also feels like a bad Borderlands clone in visuals. That lovely 'giant bulky armour' gimmick gets old about as fast as you realise they're also plying the same class system you've had in a gazillion games so far. Engineer, Assault, Recon... et cetera. Infinite ammo on your secondary weapon and enemies that generally do jack to you for damage (which may be partly down to the fact that there are usually twice as many players as NPCs in a typical fight) means you may as well just get the lighter recon class and enjoy an infinite SMG. Ah yes, and a sniper rifle with a 30 round clip, machine gun fire rate and about 400 stored ammo. Yeah that feels about right.TLDR? Nothing inspiring here.			"

												After my friend badgering me to get this game, I finally did- and after playing four hours I can say I am extremely dissapointed. First of all, the game is the most repetitive thing I've ever played. Hours and hours of shooting the same monster over and over again. Some may argue that is an open world- which it is, but open worlds are not fun when there is only one thing to do- shoot stuff. This game is a repetitive, buggy, mess. 3/10			"

												I have been a Beta player about a year ago.I just started this game up yesterday and found out this game had lost his soul.- Area's are now lvl based. No more asking friends (low leveld) to come lvl with you, they just get killed really fast.- I haven't seen 1 world event in the last 6 hours i played.(just 1 Tornado wich was in a to high lvl area, see first point.)- Only recource i have thumbed now was Iron and dirt. (normally was like 10 different kinds of ores/rarities)- U only get 10 points for buying a new battleframe after u level your lowbie batleframe to 40.That's 12,964,000 XP, u can get about 2k xp from a normal mission and about total 33.5k from a tornado (if it spawns in the right lvl area), u do the math...Read the review of Icedrake, i aggree 100% with this guy.

												I've only been playing this game for about 3 days now and I have to say I'm enjoying my time playing it, it just has one devastating con, downside, fault, failure, quite possibly game ruining thing, in order to my just about any cosmedic item, that gives you no buff of any kind it is completely just eye candy, you'll have to either grind for months, literally or spend between $10 and $50 if not more, no kidding, for the price of a big release game you get a little eye candy . . . . What was the game dev's thinking, nothing and I mean nothing in the ingame store should cost a player more then $20 and that better be some rare item, because that's still the price of a full game, I don't get it, was this game intended for the filthy rich?Until they reduce the price of Red Beans greatly, by half, if not more, I cannot recommend this game to a friend that isn't filthy rich, like someone that spends 5k daily with out putting a scratch on their income.I'll keep playing but by the time I have enough red beans to get either of the items I'd like I'll of probably beaten the game and gotten bored of it.

You WILL feel the grind.Grind for crystiteGrind for special tokens you need to use the market place (NO commerce for newbies)Grind to unlock other, potentially more interesting battleframesOr you can pay real money to 'skip' those requirements and get access to all of the above.Don't even think about the PVP.

												This game used to be so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Pick a frame, go fly around to a nice quiet area, drop a thumper to collect resources, blast the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a bunch of aliens while defending said thumper, process the mats into awesome gear, repeat. Sounds a bit of a grind but there was so much to it, and it was incredibly entertaining. Or you could spice things up and go muck about with world events: defending towers from aliens or bandit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, do a raid with some friends in the tougher zones, or just go explore the huge world full of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥The progression was excellent; you could choose to upgrade your guns, armor, abilities, etc. to fit your play style. Find yourself getting stuffed by some baddies? Use those resources to even the odds. Still can't beat em'? Or find yourself bored of the same playstyle? Go grab a different frame and blast em' to hell in a completely different fashion.Now it's just a grind, and a worse grind than most other grindy games. Not really worth your time, unless you're into masochism. I've never been saddened by the decline of a game moreso than this game. It was one of my favorite games ever made while it was in beta, and now it might be one of the most awful games I've ever played.Bring back the beta! Otherwise, 0/10 would not play again. Fakkin frowny face :(			"

												Very glitchy when downloaded on steam at the moment. Steam needs an update for the game, mostly at the main menu and start of game when everything is glitching out. When you start the game the yellow waypoint starts multiplying and moving a weird way while the background is frozen in place.I'm sure theres many more glitches and bugs in the game that you may find, but this is what ive experienced.

Posted: August 20, 2014
												So I played it for a while, and here is how I would rate it 7 for graphics, content and mechanics, 1 for combat and frustration.Pros:  Beautiful graphics.  Cool concept.  Research is another interesting system.  Scan Hammer/Thumper resource gathering is interesting.  On map mini-adventures were nice.Cons:  P2W (pay to win) or at least pay to not waste a bunch of time.  All of the free frames are complete rubbush and will get you killed a lot, they have single target capabilities only.  Only advanced frames have AE capabilities, the ones you pay for.  Research is too expensive...rp point costs need to be at least halved.  Not enough gear drops.  Not enough health drops during fights.  Never failed...power ups dropped off of the last npc I killed never off the 1st or 2nd...  Fights are often total CFs...you against 5, 10 or 15 NPCs...sometimes more.  Missions do not compensate well for the ammount of time you spend doing them, mostly in travel.  You get run all over the map wasting your time.  There is an idiotic crystite to credit system so you can buy stuff on the auction house.So I tried this one out even though there were some not so good reviews but a lot of good ones.  Pretty much the poor reviews were spot on.  I played to lvl 25 with the free engineer frame.  I decieded to stop because I got tired of the gang♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanic that is constantly used in the encounters.  Litterally stuff spawns 5 feet behind you and starts shooting you in the back...constantly.  Also, the NPCs generally detect you around 100 meters and start trying to kill you, and if you run away they will follow for quite some distance or until they shoot you to death (I actually always had to kill them as the followed me until I was dead, and sometimes even after death.)  I will say that if you have a regular group to run with combat would probably be less annoying, I play at odd times and often late night so did not group much.I would have considered buying and advanced frame...they are only $12.50 if you buy $50.00 in redbeans but I wanted to know if the game was worth wasting any money on before I spent the cash...it is not.  I heard that if you get a standard frame to lvl 40 you get a token to unlock an advanced frame...if you are a glutton for punishment and have the time to waste.The game also has player ""mounts"" basically a motorcycle.  You get free 1 use ones occasionally, you can buy a perminant one for $17.50 if you buy $50.00 in redbeans.  I found the free ones to be difficult to use and annoying.  You are in a battle frame...you have jump jets, but no skates for fast ground movement or jet skating at ground level for faster movement or any way for faster ground movement other than a motorcycle...I will probably let this game sit for a few months and see what they do with it...but right now it is a fail and I think their prices are just too high, but then it is P2W.

												Very good by MMO standards, but still not that good.You run (or fly) around, killing various overgrown insects, and the occassianal alien raiding party, loosely strung togther by a series of generic 'Go here, do this, theres your reward' kind of quests.Still a fair few bugs, some of which for me have been temporarily progress blocking.Firefall contains a healthy balance of all of the staples of any MMO diet; Level locked content, vertical gear and stat progression, unfair PvP.The best parts of the game are the movement. Seriously, getting to your desination is often a lot more fun than what you actually do at that destination. You can jet-boost up onto and scale any object, use glider pads to glide your way long distances, spawn a motorbike thing to ride around. It feels satisfying.The combat is quite engaging.5/10 - Average. Dunno what else to say, it just feels like any other MMO.			"

Well everything went smooth up to this point, the quest is not giving me any waypoint where to go next and I'm stuck now with normal Accord entry lvl battleframe while everyone else is running arround with their fancy Advanced battleframes...

												I enjoy this game, A great Sci-fi PvE FPS.   I don't like to PvP, I am too old,  I am just cannon fodder but this gives me what I am looking for in an open world setting.  Warframe is more like a dungeon crawl but this has that open feeling.			"

												Starts off fun but gets boring very fast. Incredibly grindy and they can't even decide on core parts of the game to keep the same. Crafting system has changed like 3 times since I started playing and each time it's more of a hassle to do and more of a time sink. For how long the game has been out they shouldn't be making such massive changes to it still. Don't think they shouldv'e added the current leveling system at all, was way better beforehand, less grindy and timeconsuming.			"

												It's a nice game to paly, especially considering the Open World feel. You can just go out and shoot some things if you're not in the mood for completing quests. And also there's a chance for you to actually get better battleframes without needing to  buy any DLC. Just convert enough crystyte into credits, press T for the store and look up Licenses.			"

												""Quakestyle"" fps mixed with mmo. You will Love it or hate it. True F2P (only cosmetic shop) and the premium currency that you can obtain by playing the game. Fast peaced shooter in open world (that's getting bigger from patch to patch) with levels, perks, equipments and nice graphic. You just have to try and play it for more than 15h. When you'll start to get some fun from it - play more, becuase it will get better with every lvl, zone and frame. If you won't - it's not game for you.			"

												This is gunna be short sharp and sweet.For the 'Free' mmo. this game rocks. solid gameplay, very stable and smooth servers, one of the best shooter mmo gunplay systems in any free or even paid fps mmo I have seen in a while. Random events are fun and like any mmo its even more fun in a group when you are social. Tho is very fun solo and you see loads of people in the open world that help you. And following the great success of Guild Wars 2 this game doesnt require specific class rolls in a group for success.Honestly, though i havent played as many hours as others, i fully appriecate what this game offers and brings to the table and I was more than willing to support it with spending around $20usd in the in game store. To me thats a donation and big thank you to the developers and every F2P user who likes the game should do the same imo.If you like FPS mmo games and like a colourful big open world, this game is for you.

												I played this game in very early beta, in the days before it had even imagined being on steam. I found a link on some backsite forum and managed to sweet talk my way into very early closed beta. I've seen this game go through atleast 7 massive overhauls in game play from 3-4 overhauls in crafting. Thumping minerals, to crystals for gear, to then having new item slots, then no items to craft, then back to crafting, then back to no thumping, ive seen it all.About a year ago this game was great, a true sci-fi setting with a unique catch, it was all about 'thumping' for ores, they came in different rarity and the rarity of the ore you used for crafting effected the outcome of the item.So everyone was out looking for the sweet loot in the ground. You couldnt run 5 feet without coming across a decked out squad battling the bugs as they defended their thumper, it was alive, it was action. It reminded me alot of star ship troopers, i loved it. I check back on this game every few months to see how its coming along.I cannot believe how bad its gotten, nothing that made this game great is there anymore. They have removed the ores COMPLETELY, you can now mine 1 ore which is not used for crafting. Its added a leveling system? Its just ruined. Honestly there is nothing new or good about this game any longer, the devs have killed everything that made it stand out. I have invested alot of hopes into this game, it really genuinely upsets me to see whats happened to it. It hurts me deeply to say this, but its now a steaming pile of standard♥♥♥♥♥♥ :( "

												Played since the beta, off and on. probably put a good 100 hours in the game, outside of steam. I played it again back in october and was having fun. I come back post 1.6 update, and the game feels like it was dumbed down and downgraded in a lot of aspects: crafting is gone; I lost lvl 2 sentry upgrade on heavy turret [as bastion, no less]; alt fire is gone, replaced with a subpar fp aiming down ironsights. I can go on, but I'd rather not. If you want to try it, go ahead, but just remember it had a lot of potential in the past, and now it just feels like a watered down beverage. "

												This was a fantastic game; it really surprised me how great it looked. The gameplay is very good. The movement is a lot better than most games, it is very interactive. The classes are distinct. The vehicles and weapons are great and were fun to mess around with.  It was a load of fun with friends; I started to put in a lot of time just to play this awesome game. But what really inspired me to keep playing was the life changing day/night cycle. When I started and noticed this, I had to just stop and stare for a while. About half of my time is just enjoying the day/night cycle. I have watched videos of the day/night cycle. Spending hours both in-game and out of game, the day/night cycle calms me, it’s like a therapist to me. It only makes me feel good and right in the world. My parents have asked me why I spend hours watching a day/night cycle, but they don’t understand me when I talk about how magical it feels. I try to recommend this game to friends but start talking about the day/night. But if this review didn’t help express this game, just go look up some videos of the day/night cycle, you will instantly want to download the game. "

												What can i say about Firefall? Well how about this? Firefall is MMO FPS game. It's really nice that it's open world and FREE. The game is extremely fun to play with friend's. The world isn't huge but it's still big. But then there is the bad side. The game has alot of missions, But all the sidemission are just stupid! The main missions are the only ones littlebit diffirent. Because EVERY side mission feels the same, And that really is boring. Because to me sidemission are important part of a game. But Firefall has really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sidemission (Sorry For Bad Language). But yeah i'm not the one you should listen. I think that nobody can tell you that will you like this game unleass you try it yourself. Because for some people this game is good, and for some this is a complete pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ But for me it's both. Bugs make this game hilarious, But also♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some missios don't work because the enemies don't spawn. I mean WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ is that!?! IT TOOK 6 MONTS for them to get the mission working 6 ♥♥♥♥ING MONTS. So when i came back to this game i finally got to do that mission wohoo... I't almost seem's that the people that made this game don't even care about it's players but who am i to judge. Yeah so some mission break because bugs and some don't. And don't forget the classic falling throught the land. But yeah if you read this whole thing i thank you that you took the time. I could give this game thump's up or down. I hope that my decision does't make you angry. I'll give thumps up only because i've been playing with friend's so the pain wasn't so bad.			"

												Firefall starts out fun, it does, the first time you play it it's really neat and cool, jumpjets, guns, glide pads, and superpowers, plus being able to change your class at any time? Awesome, right? Until you realize you have to level each class seperately while there's only one path to do it in, the quests are all boring and very much the same, the actual campaign story is only 8 episodes long, there's next to no customization - and what you CAN customize you need to buy or pray to your various gods or goddesses that the slot machine will give it to you. There's no gun customization, you just pick up whatever's strongest, and can't change the colors or looks at all, and the Advanced classes, hoo boy, thyose are awful fun to get. Empahsis on awful. Either you level to lvl 40 to get ONE free frame, which you then have to level ALL OVER AGAIN in the exact same way, or you buy one. You can do this by either grinding and grinding and grinding and grinding to get enough Crystite to change it into Credits and try to buy them o nthe auction house - and before we get too far into that, let's remember, 25 Crystite per Credit - where the prices vary from 8,000 credits - That's Two hundred THOUSAND crystite - to 12,000 credits - THREE hundred thousand Crystite. Beyond that, you can also buy them with Red Beans, the 'real money' currency of the game. But don't despair, you CAN trade Credits for Red Beans... At a price of, at the lowest currently, 103 Credits per bean, and considering the advanced frames are all 100 Beans, that's, let's see... Two hundred fifty thousand Crystite. Now, imagine a setting where every quest you do gets you around 100-200 Crystite... HOW FUN!  But let's not forget that Crystite IS a currency, you use it for building items and for repairing your battleframe as well, so that's a heck of a moneysink too. Red5 - the developers - also seem to be going for the TF2 buisiness model, pay money to get hats. WOO. Trust me, if you enjoy having a good time, give this game a miss. Seriously.In short, if you like games that are tedious, grindy, and incredibly boring, give it a shot. If not... Well, try something else.EDIT: A friend has told me that Firefall is a lot better now, if it's really as improved as they say then I'll gladly ammend my review to reflect that.			"

												Far too involved of a game, crafting is complex and wouldn't be pleasing to the average gamer, Wait times are established to crafting in order to encourage the user to buy packs and coins. Visuals arent very impressive even on max settings. Weapons are far too similar to eachother and are very underpowered. The recon classes primary and secondary are basically both SMG's, all shotguns in game feel like pea shooters, you have to get incredibly close in order to do any damage at all.			"

												It's not that this game isn't good, It's because it could have been so much more.I remember watching the trailer in 2012 and smiling at how great everything looked and how smooth and good the gameplay was.Remember the invasion feature? It's disgusting now, It's just a point and click at enemies and you basically cannot lose because 500 people circlejerk around them and just shoot.Funny? Yes, Up to expectations? No.Could have been soooo much better I'll still play it for fun sometimes though.			"

												The game's really fun, even with some problems that need to be fixed (but the game isn't done being made).You have the 5 generic classes Recon (Sniper), Assualt (Average Soldier), Dreadnaught (Heavy), Biotech (Medic) and Engineer.These classes can advance into better classes (kind of like sub-classes)Though the quests can sometimes be far away, there are usually forms of quick/safe transportation.There can be some really wierd lag, but if you have your settings right, you can reduce it.

												Remember Tribes? No, not the Ascend one, or that single player one.. the original Tribes and Tribes II before it sucked. Yeah, that Tribes. This is basically Tribes the MMO, but much better. It's not without its flaws, but overall I like it.The Good:PvE is a hell of a lot of fun. Constant events and randomised encounters. It's dynamic events done right, not pre-scripted stuff that's in the same spot every time. Even when you redo town quests, they're always in different locations. Levelling is fun, and it's the kind of grind that doesn't feel like a grind. It's the kind of game that makes you want to put some money into, but at the same time doesn't require it at all.The Bad:PvP is practically non-existant. There's a big open world PvP continent, but with no levelling balance, so it's basically for level 40's only. Plus, if you followed this game through its development, it came out VERY different in terms of progression mechanics and such than it originally set out to be, so that will likely colour your perception. Does it make the end result a bad game? Not at all, but those pining for what Firefall WAS, aren't likely to appreciate what Firefall IS.Ultimately, it's a lotta fun. If you're ingame and want to ask questions, hit me up: DeusMaximus			"

												Firefall is an open world with lots of things to do. It has the basic classes and many more that come along with your character progression. You can customize yourself with red beans that can be bought with real money and so can your battleframe. New weapons and items can be bought at the shop with credits and transportation can be done in many ways,  dropship, foot, glider or LGV. This game is very exiting but they could add more things to do along the way. I haven't played through the whole campaign but from what i've played it is extermely creative and sometimes challenging if you don't have a group with you. But overall I would reccomend Firefall to anyone that likes and open world.			"

												I would recommend this game for MMO players, while it stays free. If I had to pay for this game then it would proberbly receive a lower score,but since this game is Free2Play, you can always give it a try.I'm not a MMO player at all, this game has some nice features but alsosome flaws which annoyed me a lot.I would say for a full review, make sure to check out our video:

												Imagine if Borderlands was an MMO and you didn't have to go to the Job Boards continuelly to gain any decent EXP. Randoml events appear all around the world so you can move from one to another in a fluid way that breaks to common RPG trend and gives you the constant FPS action you expect from other games. Depending on your playstyle there can be grindy moments but playing with friends is great fun and the massive end game raids are hectic. 8/10			"

												Firefall is one of the greatest most ambitious MMO conceptualizations, really.  There’s a ton of ideas being thrown around here, placed in mostly logical, fun and coherent controls. At the moment there aren’t quite enough characters options or powers available to create too many variations, but nonetheless,  characters do feel yours, beyond a pretty decent ingame visual customisation. All the elements are here: a good roster of characters, equipment, weapons, and skills, solid leveling progression. The fights are good, appealing, and the battleframe ultimates are all wonderfully devastating.The ambition is clearly there, but, the budget, and clear administration was not.  I’d say it’s definitely worth playing. Red5 have enough moments of triumph here, to outweigh moments of...			"

												this game is a great game. to put it in a sort sentence. i play with my friends on this game and it has a nice feel when you play it. the shooting isn;t as bad as i thought it would be. there is crafting weapons. there are lots of missions. the only thing im not fan of is that i have to pay for veichles or craft them at a level. that is pretty high. but other than that its good i give it 8/10.

												Fun game that gets fun content and features stripped from it with each update. Loved seeing loot literally fall off bosses but the loot system was nerfed into oblivion and green modules occupy space on the loot table for bloody Hardcore Mode missions making it near impossible for me to get the necro weapon I desire. Red5 go home you're drunk. Events were amazing but the server is usually dead now unless OMG Brontodon King is up. Don't bother going afk to grab a drink if you're in DT, a chosen executioner will mow you down. Maybe even three at once so just park yourself in FOB Harpoon. Most people are farming tokens and prototype weapons but I am not most people. At least bring back the old loot system or make necro weapons tradable. I am not asking much here. One more thing; this game suffers from loads of bugs and rubberbanding. Guys I play WoW and Crysis 3 multiplayer at max settings and I am still using a Geforce 770 and get no lag. Not the case here. I'd rather this be a decent p2p mmo then it be a f2p mmo that keeps getting cool stuff taken away.			"

												In 2012 I backed this game on Kickstarter to the tune of $100. I played the Alpha and Beta, was not very impressed at first, put the game down and forgot about it. Fastforward to the release on STEAM and I've come back with friends to play the game and  I'm having fun. +1Game is like taking Star Ship troopers and plopping it into the world of Borderlands. You can easily see the animations, sounds and atmosphere as being a straight rip off of Borderlands... but that is actually a GOOD thing. The game is quite pretty for such a low rez affair and the animations are quite good. Love the jetpack, love the classes, and love the bugs that go splat. +3Another good reason this game is a blast are the resource thumpers themselves as when they drop all sorts of mayhem is unleashed. Now there are a few tiers of personal and squad thumpers and each present a challange all unto themselves. Things are easy at first but when the Chosen decide to drop pod in on your thumper things escalate quickly, and often badly, to make a hard situation almost impossible to handle. +1World bosses look amazing, seen some video footage of them, they look like lots of fun. There needs to be more of this element in the game to keep high level players coming back for more. +1PVP - this is already fun in duels but I have yet to get involved in the PVP arena. Looking forward to it and it is something Borderlands has been lacking since its first game but is readily available in Firefall. +1THE BAD: The game, although released on STEAM, is remarkably STILL in beta. It has its bugs for sure, quests can bug out, textures can bug out, friends list disappears and reappears for no reason. Yeah... game still needs a lot of work. One of the worst pats of the game? The tutorial, just leaves a lot of people scratching their heads as to what to do next. That said I give this game somewhere in the region of 7/10 for not being finished but when they do finish it the potential is there to be an 8/10. I am having fun with this game, my friends who are sticklers for spending cash on Free To Play games 2 of them have spent money on getting extra items like a reusable motorbike and another friend of mine liked it so much he bought the $99 premium package after playing it. So there is proof that this game offers bang for the buck EVEN IF the game is free to play. You can't go wrong downloading Firefall and blasting some bugs away.  "

												Ever since the loss of Tabula Rasa, I've been looking for something that fills the hole it left.Firefall is very similar to TR in many ways. It's a sci-fi first or third-person shooter MMO that focuses on PVE, with PVP being kind of a side-note. (I admit I haven't tried PVP yet)The story is pretty much identical. [Event] causes humanity to experience a dramatic boost in technological capability, and then aliens invade. Except instead of taking place on another planet after Earth is lost, Firefall takes place primarily in South America, and humanity is facing two threats: a humanoid-alien, technologically superior race called the Chosen, and a phenomenon called ""The Melding"", which is basically a purple death cloud covering most of earth.The class system is similar, as well. You have your basic sci-fi classes: The medic, the sniper, the engineer, the soldier, and the big guy with the minigun. You start out with one starter class of each type, and eventually you will unlock access to 'advanced classes' which can use all of the skills and equipment the starter class had access too, plus its own unique stuff.And then you have a progression system, but here's the kicker: Instead of branching into different subclasses as you level as in TR and having that be a permanent choice, in Firefall you can switch to any class you have unlocked at any time on the same character. Each class you have unlocked has its own set of gear, its own talent tree, and its own experience bar.You can unlock classes in a few ways: Getting a class to max level (40) earns you 'pilot points' which you can spend to unlock any advanced class you want. Or, you can buy access to a class, either by purchasing it from the cash shop or from another player on the ingame marketplace.Right now, the game is in considerable flux; the game just launched, so there are bugs and glitches galore, but usually restarting the client will fix any issue that pops up. There are also major balance changes being thrown around.			"

												When I started playing this game, I had no technical issues. Later on I had a server connection issue, in which the game maxes out my processor speed and will reboot the game in game. I was thinking it was form this program.The symptom. The game lags for about 30 seconds to 2 miunutes of game time. This is described as a complete failure of the game, ingame restart from some error, that I couldn't solve or explore with the forum and google searches. Theere were similiar issues but none of their suggestions solved hte problem. THe problem actaully got exponetionally worse. Meaning I had no problems the first week of playing, it escalated to a worseing state, until I would play the game, and every 10 minutes it would lag, in such a way. making it unplayable. It rememinded me a little of Unreal 2003. Just a little slower.Do I recommend this game. Not sure. Mixed. It was fun, easy, interesting, funny videos. Co-op play was interesting in teh PVE environment. I mostly had fun withthe reasearching and missions and engineering items. Free-to-play.Engine handling - 4.4 - based on how the game handles data an dnetwork usage, compliling nad decompiling nature , Its efficiency or deficeieny. How the engine performs. Is it just to large. Engines are usualy revamped, some the market pool can be larger, by changing and making the engine handle data more efficenintly in the game rendering out.Graphics - 6.5Gameplay - 7.7Feel - 7.0 FPS,MMO ,RPG, improvement form An old game I played call Neocron, but not that much. Had an okay feel to it.6.7 ish out of 10.I would still play it. It was a filler for time, but I should really be playing my piano.			"

												Pros: Very good engine. Lots of settings (especially GUI), gives stable 60 FPS with high quality graphics. Very good art and world design. GUI and input feels right and responsive. Interesting crafting concept with a resource gathering system. Various random events on the map. World feels alive.Cons: Haven't seen much of the weapons in the game, but they look rather boring. It's a weapon type (say a minigun) and then few perks on them like diffent types of damage. And that's it. Very small variety. Obviously you compare that game with Borderlands at some point. Nothing like borderlands when it comes to weapons. It's focused on PvE, however mobs are the problem. AI is super stupid, the mobs that are supposed to shoot you, sometimes just stand still even when you're out of sight. Melee mobs feel laggy and annoying. Haven't seen the end game, but in the beginner area, melee mobs can't really hurt you much at all. So.. stupid AI, laggy feel, balance issues. Yuck. Quests. OMG, those quests. Almost all quests require you to travel 300m+ of the map back and forth multiple times and then you're asked to hit 'E' button on an item or kill a bunch of mobs. Despite the fact that all quests have voice acting on them, they feel super boring and I don't even listen/read them. The stupid mob problem plays a big role here as well.So, if you enjoy beautiful worlds, then it's worth taking a look, but the game is essentially about grinding stupid mobs 24/7. Many people describe MMO games as a game of ""changing numbers in a database"". That game has this feel too, you shoot the mob, you look at its HP going down and it dies. No fun, very boring.Sadly with that tech it has a potential. It could have been a good game, but it's not.			"

I don't feel however an investment in this game is worth it unless you will be actively playing with friends. unfortunate though, is that by the time you complete a class you really won't want to do it again on another just for a buff that you have to get to clear any tough instance mission/dungeon. also imho the pvp sucks, well the snowball fights were awesome though. it's free, try it out for yourself.

Other than that, the game seems good, then again i havnt played this game for the longest of time. i would recommend this game ONLY for people who have nothing else to play and want to play a scifi shooter.

												This game is an absolutely wonderful mix of FPS, RPG, MMO, and SP elements. It has come a LONG way in the past couple years of development, and its current status is incredible. They've gone great lengths to make sure that everything in the game is interesting. From mining resources to doing quests, you won't be bored. It's all an intense battle. Being able to switch ""battleframes"" or classes on the fly allows for almost endless play, as each of the different battleframes have their own advantages and disadvantages that might suit your style or situation.It's free, so there's not much to lose. It's absolutely worth a try. Also try with friends.			"

												Can't change settings because the ""Apply"" option is bugged out and unresponsive.First mission requires you to literally wait for 2 minutes (some kind of public event maybe?). After the 2 minutes, the timer disappears and nothing happens.Graphics are horrible even on max settings.			"

												In 2012 I backed this game on Kickstarter to the tune of $100. I played the Alpha and Beta, was not very impressed at first, put the game down and forgot about it. Fastforward to the release on STEAM and I've come back with friends to play the game and  I'm having fun. +1Game is like taking Star Ship troopers and plopping it into the world of Borderlands. You can easily see the animations, sounds and atmosphere as being a straight rip off of Borderlands... but that is actually a GOOD thing. The game is quite pretty for such a low rez affair and the animations are quite good. Love the jetpack, love the classes, and love the bugs that go splat. +3Another good reason this game is a blast are the resource thumpers themselves as when they drop all sorts of mayhem is unleashed. Now there are a few tiers of personal and squad thumpers and each present a challange all unto themselves. Things are easy at first but when the Chosen decide to drop pod in on your thumper things escalate quickly, and often badly, to make a hard situation almost impossible to handle. +1World bosses look amazing, seen some video footage of them, they look like lots of fun. There needs to be more of this element in the game to keep high level players coming back for more. +1PVP - this is already fun in duels but I have yet to get involved in the PVP arena. Looking forward to it and it is something Borderlands has been lacking since its first game but is readily available in Firefall. +1THE BAD: The game, although released on STEAM, is remarkably STILL in beta. It has its bugs for sure, quests can bug out, textures can bug out, friends list disappears and reappears for no reason. Yeah... game still needs a lot of work. One of the worst pats of the game? The tutorial, just leaves a lot of people scratching their heads as to what to do next. That said I give this game somewhere in the region of 7/10 for not being finished but when they do finish it the potential is there to be an 8/10. I am having fun with this game, my friends who are sticklers for spending cash on Free To Play games 2 of them have spent money on getting extra items like a reusable motorbike and another friend of mine liked it so much he bought the $99 premium package after playing it. So there is proof that this game offers bang for the buck EVEN IF the game is free to play. You can't go wrong downloading Firefall and blasting some bugs away.  "

												Ever since the loss of Tabula Rasa, I've been looking for something that fills the hole it left.Firefall is very similar to TR in many ways. It's a sci-fi first or third-person shooter MMO that focuses on PVE, with PVP being kind of a side-note. (I admit I haven't tried PVP yet)The story is pretty much identical. [Event] causes humanity to experience a dramatic boost in technological capability, and then aliens invade. Except instead of taking place on another planet after Earth is lost, Firefall takes place primarily in South America, and humanity is facing two threats: a humanoid-alien, technologically superior race called the Chosen, and a phenomenon called ""The Melding"", which is basically a purple death cloud covering most of earth.The class system is similar, as well. You have your basic sci-fi classes: The medic, the sniper, the engineer, the soldier, and the big guy with the minigun. You start out with one starter class of each type, and eventually you will unlock access to 'advanced classes' which can use all of the skills and equipment the starter class had access too, plus its own unique stuff.And then you have a progression system, but here's the kicker: Instead of branching into different subclasses as you level as in TR and having that be a permanent choice, in Firefall you can switch to any class you have unlocked at any time on the same character. Each class you have unlocked has its own set of gear, its own talent tree, and its own experience bar.You can unlock classes in a few ways: Getting a class to max level (40) earns you 'pilot points' which you can spend to unlock any advanced class you want. Or, you can buy access to a class, either by purchasing it from the cash shop or from another player on the ingame marketplace.Right now, the game is in considerable flux; the game just launched, so there are bugs and glitches galore, but usually restarting the client will fix any issue that pops up. There are also major balance changes being thrown around.			"

												Yeah i like this game's graphics,combat,sniping,dying animation,nature,vehicles and specially armors and classes but it started to get all messed up when the new patch update came in the game. Ithough the next patch would be fantastic and i was eager for it to come but then when the patch came half my stuff is gone.. and the crafting is gone too.. And i though the new equipment armor are all BS too.. so i uninstalled the game because of this new update.. But it deserves a thumbs up for having a great gameplay.			"

												I honestly don't see any issue with this game, as a returning player I've forgotten almost everything and decided to make a new character, so far I've enjoyed the new inclusions, cutscenes that wern't there before, and leveling seems faster, which might be a turn off to some but I assume the majority of players are high level so the point that I can catch up with them is great, I apologize for this not being a review but I wanted to state my opinion of this. The game is as fun as I remember.			"

												From the moment I started the game, the story was confusing, and I had no idea why the mysterious people wanted a crystal so bad. I ventured forward to find that the graphics of the game remind me of my Nintendo 64, and not in the good way. I tried changing the settings but nothing seemed to work. Hell, I even changed them to the lowest. Avast, nothing seemed to do anything except for the motion blur. And keep in mind, I am not playing on the weakest of machines, so that's not the problem. I got over the graphics problem (barely), and went on. I went throught the 'tutorial' to find myself waiting in a small area with about eight other players. What were we waiting for? Nothing. Nobody knew what was happening so we just kept waiting. I waited for about seven minutes and decided I wanted a drink. When I was getting my drink, I stubled down the stairs, fell through a hole to hell, speaked to satan, came back, got my drink, and nothing happened when I was gone. Literally NOTHING! That was the moment I decided I had enough of the game, and decided to write this review. So, would I reccomend it? If you like waiting for eternity, shooting guns at nothing, and looking at graphics that came from the year 1679, then you'd have a blast 'playing' this game. Don't download this piece of trash if you have a brain.			"

												i have been hardcore playing this game since over one week ago. i started with accord biotech after deleting and remaking a beta charecter. id highly recommend you do not play accord biotech first it is an awful battleframe. id recommend any of the other battleframes basic and advanced. i personally lvled biotech to 40 to get the advanced frame recluse which is amazing. for new players to the game id highly recommend an aoe heavy frames like assault becuase most of the time your going to be against hordes of enemies and if they are chosen they can and will beat you down quickly with there heavy firepower. speaking of chosen look out for ones called siegebreakers, elite juggernauts, and snipers. if you see any of the three stop what your doing and kill them asap snipers always take priority for they are most accurate unless you dont know how to move and shoot which then siegebreakers will always be the priority. you can unlock all the frames without paying a dime by just lvling frames to 40 and using the tokens. you are not bound to use the tokens for a frame in the same general class.

												i recommend this game, but the fact is that im still a newbee to this sort of games (MMO FPS games) actually this is my first so i dont know if my judjment will be helpful thus i didnt experience other MMO FPS games to compare with Firefall.bottom line:- Really fun game play althought you will always repeat the same thing... the game is a bit routinic- wide variety of characters, each character have its own skills and weapons so if your got bored you can always change the type of your character, but the bad part is that the weapons does not have any other attributes than fire rate and power. so the choice of weapons will be based only on the power and lvl of the weapon- advanced battle frame systems is pretty cool, it allows you to upgrade your soldier further more- the best thing in this game is that eventhough the game is free to play, its pretty far for being a pay to win game. it has a great trading system that allows you to trade the credits you get while playing the game with the ones that you must buy. you can also buy the equipments that requires the buyable currency with the inn game currency, the brice will be a bit higher thought.- i didnt find the community very helpful, some missions in this game requires to be in a group, most of the time i asked for hel and didnt receive it, athoutght in other reviews you will find a positive opinion regarding the community of the game.- good reward system-wide map areahope this review is helpful  "
