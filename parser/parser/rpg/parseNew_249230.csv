												This is a long review, so just read the bottom paragraph for a simple summary of my thoughts.It surprises me that the general consensus for this game is worse than Risen 2: Dark Waters. To be fair, if you hated Risen 2, there likely are not enough redeeming factors about the end of the trilogy to be worth your while. But nevertheless, some substantial improvements to the overall experience have made this a promising step in the right direction for Piranha Bytes as a developer.Risen 2: Dark Waters was ultimately a failure as an open world, engrossing RPG. It was extremely shallow, overall having one of their smallest and most lackluster world designs to date, with most of the islands consisting of winding pathways with few interesting landmarks leading between major locations. These locations were greatly devoid of life, as the characters were as dull and two-dimensional as wooden boards. The combat wasn't the worst I've ever seen in a game, but it took forever to get the necessary skills to stay on top of combat, and by then you just got used to button mashing between prayers. Beyond combat, half the skills in the game were worthless or used in only scripted situations that were easy enough to do without.At first glance, or maybe even for the first couple hours, Risen 3 hardly seems any different. But if you put some effort into it, you'll find much more in store here. The combat system is widely criticized for the wrong reasons. To be fair, the easiest way to fail at Risen 3 was the only way to WIN in Risen 2: button mashing is heavily discouraged in Risen 3, as timing your combos poorly results in substantially slower attacks. Instead, the game encourages you to time your attacks with precision, and focus your efforts between multiple foes instead of trying to spam them to death one at a time. It also has a dodge maneuver, which Risen 2 lacked on release (and when they patched it in, it was hardly any more useful). In fact, the dodge led to quite the opposite criticism: that combat was too easy, since dodging made you invulnerable during the animation. (A patched-in ""Ultra"" difficulty removes these invincibility frames, if you dare - as well as forcing a cooldown between potion uses.) Beyond that, skills you can learn from instructors give you a parry ability, faster combos, additional combo attacks, and further stat increases to make you unstoppable by the end of the game. It's still not a flawless combat system overall, but this is a world where Skyrim's dreadful DPS-focused combat dodges any ounce of criticism while a game like this is torn to pieces over a moderately tactical system.The magic system is a bit unique, and certainly much more appealing than the lame voodoo system of Risen 2. Combat magic is available to all three factions, but much more varied to the Guardian faction. Some spells are equipped as a primary weapon and used in place of a sword - these spells can be used as a moderately-ranged attack in melee, or aimed as a projectile. Support magic can be placed in your quickbar for a single rapid cast, after which it requires a cooldown. Each faction has their unique spells which can only be acquired through the faction, but single-use versions (scrolls, voodoo dolls, runestones) can be found and used by any class as a disposable magical support with no cooldown.The only thing that truly disappointed me about the magic was that there was hardly any difference between the different types of offensive magic. Fire and Ice did the same amount of damage, for example, and had no unique effects, such as freezing enemies or igniting them. You only switched between them if you found an enemy who was immune to one and not the other.The world design is notably improved. The game does re-use two islands from Risen 2, and scales them down considerably, but the new locations are significantly larger, have more to explore, and have areas of the map that open up as you complete more of the story. The maps themselves are a bit more open, but still tend toward a frustratingly path-focused design that makes most of the locations seem more linear than they really are. Thankfully, they've expanded the game in a vertical direction, allowing you a BIT more freedom in climbing. It's still obvious where you can and cannot climb, for the most part, but ambitious explorers may find rewards hidden in unexpected places if you can find a way. A large assortment of books can be found throughout, attempting to expand the game's lore or close some of the plotholes left between the previous titles.I can't say the characters have improved significantly - there are plenty of fodder characters who just seem cut and paste from the previous game, and are often indistinguishable from others, but they've greatly increased in number, and the dialog has vastly increased as well. Many of the characters are still cringe-worthy or dull as dishwater, but a few still made a note with me as I played, such as the woeful Mortimer on Fog Island, the quiet yet stoic demon hunter Kane, and the misforunate Burke, many of whom have interesting quests or even just stories to tell.You know what to expect with the questing - most RPG's these days have the same number of fetch or exterminate quests, but even in this regard, I'd say Risen 3 at least makes some of them more interesting. If you're feeling adventurous, make sure you disable quest markers - otherwise, if you're getting bored, use them to wrap up sidequests quickly. At least Risen 3's questgivers will tell you what to do and where to go, so you don't HAVE to depend on floating arrows to guide you if you don't want them.The number of items in the game has increased, with more variety to melee weapons, magic, and firearms. Some of the weapons are mechanically indistinguisable from each other (crossbows vs. pistols, for example) yet require different skills to use. The ""legendary items"" quests from Risen 2 make a return, and number slightly higher, providing potent stat increases. Unique weapons can be found in two pieces, to be reforged at a smithy - but with no clues on how to find these weapons, it's quite possible you'll have better ones by the time you find both pieces.Unfortunately, the game again shipped with day-one DLC, with two story DLC's and one item-only one. Needless to say, developing gameplay content prior to release and charging separately for it is not a practice that consumers should ever endorse, but at least each DLC is slightly larger than Risen 2's, with a smaller price tag.Final consensus: this game does not do enough to change the most vitriolic opinions about Risen 2. Nevertheless, Piranha Bytes appears to have taken some of the largest points of contention into consideration with Risen 3. Not everything got done that fans wanted, but in the shorter development time, dealing with internal restructuring and losing major designers, I think Piranha Bytes was able to focus on their most egregious sins and provide a substantial package that I don't regret paying for.

												I recommend this game for those who enjoy a challenge.  NOT for players seeking the details.  READ the CONS, if these truly matter to you, DO NOT BUY. If you can live without those for a challenge, then this is a game for you.I do NOT feel this game is worth the $50.00, so if you feel this is for you, be sure to follow it and wait for a sale.The only problems I've had, none game breaking thus far, are1. Purchase points: a. I chose this game after reading the reviews of those who had 50+ game hours, ensuring that I was getting information and recommendations from payers who not only take time to truly evaluate a game, but also enjoy the same challenge that I do and really try to learn.   b.  I also choose it after viewing the acheivments and seeing the acheivements 'Perfectionist: complete 300 quests"", and kill ### so and so monster or animal. Many of the other acheivments are to complete specific quests, or that is how it appeared to me, So this part made my decision a touch more difficult.The Purchase point that disappointed me most was B.  I have yet to join a faction, I only have mages up to the joining ceremony and yet it shows I have completed 146 quests.  I've completed almost half of the game before I even join a faction??? By the time I do join a faction I will have completed over half of the entire game.  ( Unless I am understanding the acheivment incorrectly, and 'Perfectionist"" does NOT mean that you complete all quests in the game. )  Mind you, There are EXTREMELY important ..... abilities / items not obtainable until you do join a faction.And the reason I have completed so many quests is where they placed Quests.  What I mean by this is what actions or goals are considered quests.  An example is when you begin the game, you start on a ship, your woken up and told to come top side to join your 'mate' ( I will do my best to give away the absolute least regarding story or spoilers. ) and literally you only need exit the room to complete your first quest,  "" Find so and so island""  When did I 'FIND' it?  In truth someone else found it.  I only woke up and moved my♥♥♥♥♥♥    2.  The combat:  a. CON:  Combat is difficult, so far every monster I have met is able to attack without so much as a wind up or a way to tell they are about to strike, thus not giving you a chance to dodge or block, my attacks are however all wind ups, meaning all monster seem to break my attacks over and over. If I am attacked by 2 or 3 monsters I have had to run because one will complete attacking and as I wind up my attack the next one interupts me, and another attacks after that. Basically meaning I can't get a single hit in on them as they pummel me.  Also they get 2 to 3 consecutive attacks without my being able to interupt with my own attacks, I am only able to dodge like mad or pray they dont break my block. While every one of my attack is interuptable. b. PRO:  OMG the challenge to perfect this is amazing.  I've never played a game that has started with such a combat system that forces you to learn mechanics so quickly.3.  Dialog: a. CON:  Dialog is a bit lame, when reporting a quest complete, if the quest has more then one objective you have to select each objective as completed, then after you go through the ""I finished this part, I finished this part, I finished this part, I finished this part, you have to then click ""I did everything you asked me to.""  As if clicking 4 times for 4 objectives isn't enough to prove you completed all tasks.    CON:  Some dialog choices are out of order, Your only available selection will be ""I'll take you there.""  and their responce will be ""Ohh thank you.""  "" I did this, and the monsters are everywhere.""  ""How will I get home?""  Giving me the 'Will you help me' statement AFTER the 'yea, I'll help ya.""  CON:  Voice overs,Just before you leave the first island an important event occurs, and a party member joins you When you speak to this member they have a specific tone, and way of speaking. After speaking with them regarding several different things as you travel, their voice will change, suddenly as if they fired the voice over actor and were to lazy to fix the previous voice over recordings. And what I mean by change isn't simply the tone, it is also the manner in which words are spoken.  b. PRO:  The amount of information provided is very nice, your given much information regarding missions, characters, locations and story content.4. Map:  a. CON:  You are given very little detail on your mini-map and full screen map, making travel difficult, and understanding which way you need to go to enter certain 'interior zones. b. PRO:  This is actually more realistic for the era the game is played in as map makers were not as meticulous as they are now adays, and adds to the challenge of the game.5. Mission Log: a. CON:  Finding specific missions that you are on, in order to mark key points on your map, can be can be very difficult as it is a bit difficult to understand how they catagorized things. b. PRO:  as you move through the missions and add more quests to your log the rhyme and reason become apparent, easier to navagate, but also makes sense.So, although there are many cons, I personally am enjoying the game, because the cons really don't break the game play, and the pro's seem to show me that the developer was looking to increase the overall challenge instead of spending to much time on the little things that can be easily ignored.  I understand that when a company releases a game as completed that it means they have fixed the bugs and CONS I have mentioned above.  This is why I only recommend the game to those who are specifically seeking a challenge, and NOT for players who are simply looking for story and graphics.Well that's my two cents, (Looking back) ok that's more like a buck 50,  I hope this information helps you decide if this is a game for you, and thank you for giving my first review time to read. :)I hope you all enjoy!!

Pros- Incredible visuals. Probably the best fire I've seen in a game.- Goofy as usual. Piranha Bytes hasn't changed a bit, and I like it.- Great open world gameplay. There's a lot to explore and find.- Magic is back, and it's satisfying.Cons- Awkward sword combat--things just don't feel quite right, but with time, you get used to it.- Companions aren't as helpful as they are capable.- Story is decent, but unmemorable.- Astral vision ability could have been a lot cooler if there were puzzles or areas where it was required. I found I never really used it.VerdictIf you're looking for a decent, challenging RPG with a sense of humor, definitely get this game. The whole series is fun. Don't expect a Witcher game, but don't let the Metacritic score scare you off either.(Take the Witcher comment with a grain of salt. If you don't like that series, then <insert favorite RPG here>)			"

												I normally played turn-based RPG, but decided to try Risen 3 for a change.I totally enjoyed this game. It has a great storyline and is extremely immersive.I spend many hours carefully picking up everything, collecting all Legendary Items, and Reforging the best Weapons in the game.I also spend many hours trying to get all the Steam Achievements and was able to do so in a single playthough as a Demon Hunter. It seems that this is the only faction that you can get all achievements in a single playthrough. The other 2 factions, Guardian and Natives all have missing achievements.The combat sequence was extremely fun too. The only hard part for me was the Sea Battles and the Final Boss Fight, because they both require fast interactive responses which was difficult for me. The mini-game were really fun, although the archery one is quite difficult too. However, getting Legendary Items from instances of certain mini-game were a great idea and an incentive as well.Anyway this is really a fun game and it is wonderful to spend many hours in it.I highly recommend this game.

												Originally known for creating sloppy, difficult RPGs that gave the player full freedom in an open world, then deprived him of anything resembling a functional control scheme to interact with it, Piranha Bytes continues moving away from both the pros and cons of its heritage with Risen 3: Titan Lords. Although it is restrictive, small in size, and has a game world that doesn't change, Risen 3 is also easier, more refined, and more approachable than its predecessors. Risen 3 takes place shortly after Risen 2 without providing any background information on the setting. The male, unnamed protagonist is Patty's brother whose existence wasn't acknowledged in the prior games. Changing the protagonist between games wasn't handled well. Returning characters can't chat with him about past events because he wasn't around, and without establishing the setting, the game expects the player to already know the events of Risen and Risen 2 to fully appreciate characters and factions that were fleshed out in those games but not in Risen 3.While searching an ancient ruin for treasure, the hero stumbles into a massive skull cave spewing a small contingent of shadow warriors. When he gets too close to a crystal gate, a shadow lord pops out and sucks the soul out of his mouth, killing him. A pirate's life is full of tragedy, and after three or four seconds of crying Patty leaves his corpse in the sand and goes back to treasure hunting. For reasons that aren't elaborated upon, a part-time shaman returns him to life and sets him on a quest to reunite with his spirit stuck in the Underworld. The game's subtitle implies there will be titan lords too, but don't hold your breath.The story as a whole is uninspired. Crystal gates to the Underworld start appearing everywhere, unleashing shadow minions upon the Southern Seas. The hero cooperates with human settlements in the area to close the gates, kill the shadow armies, and get his spirit back along the way. There are three joinable factions on separate islands, and membership in one serves as a bottleneck for plot progression rather than a well-planned addition to the story. Regardless of which faction is chosen, they coexist peacefully and the hero ultimately needs to assist and recruit all three of them. This is in stark contrast to past Piranha Bytes games where siding with a faction was serious, world-changing business. Here, it affects the hero's chest armor and which spells are permanently learned, but nothing meaningful related to the story. Although the world is open and the small islands and their ""run to every corner of the island and do something"" quests can be completed in any sequence, the player only picks the order of events that will all occur by the end.Unfortunately, the characters and dialogue are no better. The writing is dull and repetitive, and when everyone is chatty it makes listening to the voice actors slowly enunciate each line feel like it's taking up too much of the game's total playtime. Inconsistencies in the setting and writing impact all aspects of both. A starving village complaining about the lack of food might have piles of fish lying around. Four NPCs in a row might make a nearly identical gallows humor joke, then no one else in the game does. It's distracting when large chunks of the script read like they were written in the same sitting by the same person due to the repetition therein. Word repetition frequently occurs within an NPC's conversation when dialogue relies on parroting the same exact phrases in statements and interrogatives, back and forth. Dialogue also has issues where the flow is off, with NPCs and the hero having unnatural segues and answering questions with incorrect expressions and sentence structures. The writing has some successful moments and executions, but on the whole it stretches out and hurts an already uninteresting setting.The battle system has its problems too. In the beginning, the hero fights as a pirate using a sword for a melee weapon and pistols or throwing knives for ranged attacks. Melee range in Risen 3 is a long distance. When initiating an attack, friends and enemies leap-teleport across the distance to strike, not unlike Batman in his modern series. Attacks can form a three-hit combo. The first attack is lightning-fast while the final hit takes so long that most enemies in the game recover from being stunned and can land a hit before it comes out. Between defending, teleport-attacking, and charged strikes, combat has a tactical feel to it that's somewhat lost in the speed and chaos. Some enemies are so fast they can instantly launch stun-locking combos at will. Others are so defensive it can take a long time just to land a strike. Companions are bad at drawing aggro and most enemies come in packs of two to four, meaning the player is stuck rolling all over the place, trying to avoid stun-locks from fast foes while getting a few hits in when possible. There's no way to lock onto a single enemy, making it tough to target one and take it out before hitting the others. Combat can be annoying and test one's patience, but due to a large health pool and instant, animation-free healing, death is hardly a serious threat.Combat completely changes later in the game, though. Whether it was to encourage players to try guns and magic when they become available, or pure sadism, the ability to counterattack after a parry is a special talent which must be purchased from a trainer after experience points are spent upgrading the hero's melee attribute. This skill, which should have been available from the start, goes a long way toward fixing melee combat. When guns are equipped in the melee slot, combat becomes even easier. Gunshots can't be blocked and are more powerful than swords. Although they must be manually aimed with a radial sight on the screen, hit detection is generous. Finally, after joining a faction the hero can use magic as a primary attack. Like guns, magic can't be blocked. Like melee, magic auto-aims. Using magic or guns negates everything that was tactical about combat, making it so much faster and easier that only role-players and the masochistic would still be using swords by the endgame. It would have been nice if there were more balance between these mechanics or if swordplay were less frustrating, but it's fun to blast through foes quickly in the last half of the game. The progression system provides more than enough experience points and stat-boosting methods to be a journeyman of everything and a master of whatever playstyles are preferred.Risen 3 fares well overall when it comes to the presentation. The art style is lifelike, but more clean and color-saturated than the real world. Outdoor areas are nice and vivid without looking cartoony. Character models have an unnatural shape that's unfortunate during all the bobbing-head dialogue, and indoor locations can be untextured and bland, but considering this isn't a high budget game nothing is appalling. The music is serviceable, but the sound is pulled down by the rough voice-acting. The hero's voice-acting is great with natural gravel to it. NPCs, though, are awful and made worse by how long-winded every character is. Sometimes words are mispronounced and sentences are emphasized incorrectly, like the actor had one take and didn't know the context of the line.Risen 3 is a decent game. It looks, runs, and plays fine with the main downsides being the story and script and anything related to them. The problem is that everything Risen 3 does decently has already been done better. It's a small in scope, small in size, very generic hodgepodge of the foundations of many action games and RPGs without any of the specializations that made them memorable and superior. Ten years ago Risen 3 would have been ground-breaking, but today it is a fine, unremarkable game I expect to forget about in a few weeks.			"

												The Risen 'series' isn't really much of a series at all.  Risen 1 was very obviously a rebranded Gothic 4 that followed the events of the 'neutral' path of Gothic 3: Xardas and the Nameless Hero banish the gods.  Given its moderate success, however, Deep Silver dangled a bag of money in front of Piranha Bytes and out pooped Risen 2 -- an abomination of a game that somehow missed all the hallmarks of what made prior PB games great.  Apparently Risen 2 sold well enough to justify a Risen 3.  Unsurprisingly there will be no Risen 4.What did PB do right this time around?  Factions are back after their mysterious absence in Risen 2.  And while they don't quite approach the Gothic 1 and 2 levels of distinction they arguably surpass those in Risen 1 (with a very disappointing shallow difference between Warrior of the Order and Mage).  Moreover, each faction has its unique school of magic where spells have distinctive themes and are fueled by different 'currencies.'The game is less linear with the ability to choose which island you tackle first; or, you can go back and forth and explore as you wish with little in the way of artificial barriers impeding your progress.  Unfortunately this pro feeds into one of the game's biggest cons: about a third or so of the way through no enemy presents a challenge.  Even on the harder difficulties you aren't at risk of dying save for the occasional one shot from certain creatures if your magic resistance is low.  And while there's plenty of content it eventually becomes a tedious slog through the same old monsters.  In one section on Kila in the final third or so of the game I swear I must have hacked my way through at least a hundred spiders.The character system is much the same as it was in Risen 2 but its greatest flaw is that once you decide on the type of combat you want to focus on (melee, firearms, or magic); you can get close to maximizing it fairly early on.  Throw some points in Toughness to take some hits and that's all you need.  Dexterity is needed for lockpicking if you don't go mage (who have spells to handle locks) but the other skills are borderline worthless.  Silver Tongue is useful maybe a half dozen times and there's always an alternative to it.  Pickpocketing merely nets you a few extra items but you'll be swimming in gold soon enough.  Intimidate is equally as useless as Silver Tongue.  After 30+ hours of playing I haven't even touched alchemy or distilling.  Crafting isn't needed unless you're a completionist.  And then there's this 'second sight' ability to let you scout for gold, weapons, monsters, whatever... and I never used it a single time.  If you have a pulse and a few brain cells you will have no problems spotting the loot and the very few levers you need to pull to progress through the game.Melee combat is as unsatisfying as it was in Risen 2.  Most monsters will go into stun-lock charges a la Gothic 3 so your best defense isn't parrying but rolling.  Risen 1 did it better and while shields were overpowered the simple introduction of a stamina mechanic to prevent you from turtling up would have been the more elegant solution.  Fortunately the magic is better so you can nuke your way through the throngs of spiders, skeletons, and hell hounds you'll get sick of by hour fifteen or so.The story is uninteresting and largely unexplained.  Instead of the character from the first and second games you now play as the brother of Patty.  Why?  No reason, really.  Outside of the tutorial section Patty becomes largely irrelevant unless you opt to use her as one of a half dozen or so companions in combat.  You could be random Pirate Joe for all it matters.  I didn't even see a mention of the Titans or the events of the last few games until around halfway through.  All you know is: you died, you need to get your spirit back, evil demon things are attacking, and... you have to assemble a fleet to fight the ghost of a dude who died in the second game.An unfortunate companion to the 'story' is the non-stop 'dream' sequences you have whenver you sleep.  You wake up in the spirit world and wander around until you have a brief conversation with characters from the previous games or some big monster spawns, goes BOO, and you wake up.  Similarly jarring are the awful arcade combat vignettes against sea monsters.  Three or four times as you progress the story you're forced into a ship battle where you tool around and fire at it with ONE canon.  Fun times.Risen 3 is a game that screams 'fulfilling our contractual obligation for X number of sequels.'  And while PB puts in some effort to improve upon the turkey of Risen 2; there are still far too many flaws to justify the series continuance beyond the first game.			"

												Risen 3 – Titan Lords~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As I have not played the previous two (2) games, I really had no idea what this game would be like.7 hours down the track, I am absolutely amazed by it. The amount of quests I am getting in one location is just unbelievable; I am literally losing count. This RPG is set in a world of Pirates with absolutely stunning visuals. If you enjoy taking screenshots do not look further, this game will give you plenty of opportunities to snatch great screenshots from sunset to beautiful sceneries.Great open world and apart from quests you have a fair few of other things to do like picking up clams where you can get pearls or gathering food, vegetation for potions/magic, and a must for a good pirate, rum and other distilled substances. They are great sources of health in the game. Argh...hip Argh...hip...burp...Argh!One thing I like so far is you do not have to worry about how many objects your character is carrying, just collect them. Anyway, you will be able to trade your goods with multiple people in each destination. And, you will be able to learn many essential skills like using a monkey! Yes you will!Along the way you meet characters and you can invite them to your party. I already have two at this stage (different skills) and they are very useful especially during combat. However, you have to choose who you want at your side when you arrive at each location. For the combat side of the equation, it could have been smoother but it is fine. I am just being a little bit picky here. A little bit of advice, try to upgrade your character attributes as soon as possible because some foes are quiet challenging and even with a companion at your side you just might die quickly. The audio is good and the story is sound. A good RPG all round.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Great graphics-	Good story-	Massive number of quests-	In depth character options-	Challenging adversaries-	Good humour-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Combat system could have been betterA very solid RPG in my opinion.

												Risen 3 is Finally out and is now being hit by reviews that are up and down. Let me talk about my experience and what this game's strong point and weak points. Read first before you point that dangerous thumb at me.  As a new protaganist to the series, you are the son of steelbeard and brother of Patty who both are on the way to crab island to discover treasure from a map only to run into the army of the underworld and have your soul taken. The only thing you can do is to try to redeem it by battling against the forces of darknessRisen 3 is a good improvement over 2 in many ways, Fans of PB's  original risen will love it, those who hated/loved 2 will also be welcomed back to the pirate theme with new improvements, and those that are new to the series will be a hit or miss. The game isn't like your typical rpg or Skyrim. It is a third person rpg with different style, rules and combat. Don't be mislead though this game isn't about sailing the open oceans or exploring a massive world but instead lets you explore certain lands of reasonable size that is filled with plenty of quests, dangers, and treasures.The combat system itself feels more smooth this time around as as it reverts itself away from risen 2 and taps back to its root like Risen with some added tweaks and with a much more fun magic gameplay. Yes you do start this game off weak, in fact you'll have to depend on your companions which you can choose to bring one at a time during the game to help you. You'll have to count on them because enemies will swipe you, attack you from sides, dodge your attacks and even blind side you when you aren't looking and in groups. In fact hard mode can be quite a challenge during the start  game. As you progress the game leveling the way you want you'll start realizing that your efforts will start paying off. You'll start investing in new skills to aid you in becoming stronger  even experiencing better combat which should feel a bit more fluid and much like original risen. You'll also  be able to switch weapons and spells via the bottom hotbars, while combining the use of  items and scrolls becoming more powerful in fact too powerful to the point where you're completely ridiculously almost overpowered, killing enemies in a few hits..The game offers you a choice to join between 3 factions. Voodoo, Demon hunters, or Guardians and you can only commit to one so choose carefully. Each offering its own unique skills and spells to help you fight. Some though are similar to other faction.The game leveling systems revolves around glory and gold. You earn glory from mostly killing and questing.The quest system in this game is well done in a way so that if you've already encountered the quest you'll be able to turn it in to the npc when it is requested eliminating that need to go back and forth. There are Plenty of quests and things to do in the game to acquire glory and gold. The return of magic this time around is more  fun to play with depending on your faction you've picked.You'll be able to utilize spells from that faction otherwise you'll have to buy runes and scrolls.Spells are also a completely seperate tree  and requires certain gems to purchase. When you attain spells you'll only be limited to casting by a cooldown timers. For every faction is a spell you can use as a melee spell over and over again.,You can even improve the timer and combo off more or cast faster. Yes I became a mage and I kick ♥♥♥ with a epee in my hand raining fireballs upon my enemies and stealing stuff by just reaching out my hands and did fire bending somagic this time around is  more fun.Aside from the gameplay the sound and music is perfectly fine for this game, the graphics though a bit outdated is much better than its previous series for sure and the game feels more optimized (save for the 8 cores + situation). If you are a fan of the series you will see that it is NOT THAT BAD though could be improved much more. The voice acting is decent for  in the game  though  some are  a bit cheesy (such as bone) or bad but can be looked over because the dialogues actually get a bit better later in the game.. Sometimes you can see the devs joking around with the dialogue by adding really funny questions and phrases and isn't meant to be taken too seriously. The quests themselves in this game contain many lore behind the world of risen 3 and will keep you wanting to do the quest. You'll have retrieval quests, kill quests, subquests, and mainquests. Not all quests are grindy at all or without purpose.There are choice dialogues in this game and the choices affects the outcome of what happens. The choice is really up to you on how you want to play the game, maybe you'll steal, maybe you'll use your tongue and intimidate or pick another choice to accomplish your mission. maybe you rather be the bad guy and lose a bit of your humanity or gain humanity. Whatever you  choose to do in the game will either acquire your soul back or help you lose it much quicker.anyways check the game out. This game might not be the cup of tea for everyone.Make your own damn decision on the game. Don't be mislead  by naysayers and research it well.  I beaten the game around 25 hours and thats not doing EVERY quest there is in the game, once I became OP i went straight for the last mission. Reason is because I can save my other quests on the other islands for other playthroughs as different faction. I enjoyed the game quite a bit and hope that in the future they can improve on some of the cons I've written about the game. + Game starts off really slow  and difficult but gets better as you progress+ Tons of quests, plenty of glory and gold to be found+ Ship battle with sea monsters are challenging+ The combat is much better than risen 2 but can feel a bit clunky at first until you progress a bit.+ Quests systems completes if you done it already in the world so you don't have to actually grab it to do it you can turn it in as long as you've done it.+ Magic is fun, try guardians and firebend.+ You can be any class you want to be varying from 3 factions.+ Plenty of gear to play around with and stats you can mix and match to your advantage. Legendary weapons included and upgraded weapons.+- Reused map and game materials from 2 +- Subpar dialogue and lots of comedy and jokes, sometimes funny, sometimes cheesy, sometimes very bad+- Some people will probabaly not like the way the combat is done, you get a certain amount of combo hit and you must dodge or attack your enemy.- Armor feels more asthetic than useful sometimes, I found myself wearing adventurer armor during the entire game and barely changing to the other armors.- weapons animation are all the same, along with fist spells, wish elements played a role against enemies more.- combat can be repetitive after you become OP and autotarget can cause issues if you face an npcs you could accidentally hit them sometimes. - difficulty scaling could have some improvement.t- Voice is decent, main character sounds like Christian Bale's Batman.- Graphics needs updated engine, decent at max- camera can be clunky during dialogue sometimes- The item interface can be reworked much better, hate having to hotbar everything to use it such as self cast spells, also need rework on keybindings.-  The game could interact button instead of the attack button as interact, sometimes you accidently just talk to your companion in the fray of things or clicking to find loot because it is all one button.- Need patch to fix 8 core limitation that is causing a blackscreen- spells are a lackluster- World empty after you kill everything, it doesn't respawn so no more mobs respawn.finished on twitch.tv/kenuty on 8/13/2014Video review -

												Risen 3: Titan Lords is an RPG game developed by Piranha Bytes and published by Deep Silver. It’s the third game in the Risen series. The game was released in August 2014 on PC, Xbox360 and PS3, but the PS4 got a remastered version of the game is August 2015. The game plays almost the same as the first two games in the series. An easy to use combat system which makes you counter and parry enemy sword swings whilst you weave in your own attacks. I found the combat system to be very clunky and not very responsive to your input.  Whilst in combat you are able to use your range weapon too; I found this to be a rather pointless addition as it misses the majority of the time even on much bigger targets.  You are able to freely explore the world and take on plenty of side quests. Each of the quests has different ways to solve them, which is a nice element, depending on how you resolve the quest; you may even get a different outcome.  I liked the fact you can play the game in almost any order you choose, meaning you can mould your character exactly how you want it to be. Graphically, I wasn’t too impressed, for me it looks worse than the previous games. I was playing on 4k and it looked really poor. Texture quality was mediocre at best. The lush scenery when exploring islands does redeem itself a bit, but what’s inside that lushness is some really bad looking modelling. The animation and sound effects are so bad, they are sometimes laughable. I believe all modern games should have voice acting in, and sadly Risen 3 has some absolutely awful voice actors. Every single word that is spoken just feels out of place and does not match up with the game play at all. It almost made the cut scenes unbearable sometimes. During the first fifteen minutes of gameplay, there is almost silence. All you hear is the gun fire, no shouting, sound effects of fights, nothing. It just seems to have very poor production values. The game is pretty easy even when playing on the hard settings. The combat system, when you get a hang of it, is easy to use, meaning you can be taking on larger groups of enemies before too long. A lot of the time throughout the game you will be accompanied by a companion which also makes the combat scenes more easily handled too. I only died a handful of times so there isn’t any major challenge to be found here. Risen 3 does have a very good amount of content to play through. Each chapter of the game has at least 20+ side quests for you to tackle. Whilst the side quests don’t distract you too much from the main plot, they are a good addition to the game, that rewards you with money and much needed experience for completing them. I didn’t find myself wanting to complete a lot of them though; they are all very samey after you complete half a dozen; the side quests in this game are nothing when you compare it to the likes of Witcher. The game took me almost twenty five hours to complete, with a fair few of the side missions completed. For me, since I was struggling to get through the abundance of cut scenes and dialogue, I feel that was almost a bit too much, even now I have plenty of side quests I could complete but I honestly don’t think I can put myself through any more of it. You can probably get about 40 hours of content out of this game, and you may even want to consider a second play through given the amount of choice some of the quests offer. I didn’t have any technical problems whilst playing thankfully. I was able to play at 1440p with all of the graphical settings turned up to max and still have a steady 60 fps. I played the game with keyboard and mouse, as I found that to be best for the previous games in the series, but the game will work perfectly well with a controller since it is in the third person perspective. To sum up, I believe Risen 3 to be the worst of the series so far. The first two games had better animation and voice acting in than this one, and to some extent, they even looked better graphically.  The game is currently retailing for £24, 99, and sadly I don’t think it’s even worth half of that. If you are a fan of RPG games and the Risen series, I would suggest you wait till it drops to the £10 mark, just so you don’t feel too let down by the poor production values on show here. Whilst the game does have a vast open world exploration feel to it, it just didn’t live up to my expectations for the third game in a really good pirate series.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I had fun, at first.  Combat was a bit challenging and the first island I chose to explore was interesting enough. Then I chose a faction to join.  I joined the mages faction, and then suddenly combat was quite easy.  That alone is not enough to condem this title.As I started doing more and more quests, the quest NPCs were just annoying to listen too.  They would take thier sweet time to get to the point of what they actually wanted.  I mean, I can deal with a long winded NPC once in a while, but it seemed with just about everyone, I wanted to scream, GET TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING POINT.Then as I explored even more, I realised everything was the same.  The same monsters, the same scenery, the same ♥♥♥♥ing loot (the difficulty of a chest to unlock has no bearing on the quality of the stuff you find inside), and for the most part, the same quests.I played the original Risen and liked it.  I just can not get into this one.  I found myself trying to speed through quests, but then when I got to the point where I needed to do all the faction quests dealing with whatever was important to them, my will to play this game just dissolved.  It was not fun, it was a chore.  It was a repetitive chore.  Only the hope for something new had kept me playing, but I do know there isn't anything new under the sun with this game.Unless you want to play a repetitive open world game where each area is pretty much the same as any other area, then skip this game.

												I’ve seen several people defending this game by saying ‘this is not a triple ‘A’ title so don’t expect that level of polish’, however if you’re going to charge $50 then you will be judged like any other $50 game.  The price needs to match the quality of the game, and I blame myself for pre-ordering this game without looking deeper into it.When the price of this game drops to $30 or less then it will be worth it.Good:So far the game has not crashed on meBad:Combat (serviceable but lacks polish) after about 7 hours of play it gets a bit better, but still not greatVoice Acting not great but at least it is fully voicedGraphics are subparThe price to refinement ratio is off			"

												Overall this game is pretty fun although it has quite a few issues.Pros:-Good Graphics-Great Setting and Theme-Plently of side quests and optional content-Decent sized map, quite a few islands to explore (though don't expect anything as large as black flag)-Alright story, not the best but you don't really play a game like this for an amazing storyCons:-Bad voice acting, the voices sound muffled and it sounds like the characters are sitting in an enclosed room-Awful combat, really basic and really clunky-A few bugs hear and there although the game seems more polished than the previous gamesOverall i think this is a pretty good game for the price as it is very cheap and you can get quite a few hours out of it. Don't expect it to stand up to games like the witcher or AC but its still pretty fun to play, dispite the issues it has.Would recomend when on sale.			"

												As a fan of the first two games (more so the first) I am very disappointed in this game after waiting a long time for it. I was so happy to hear that the game would be going back to the medieval roots and abandoning the pirate theme but apparently that was scrapped and they stuck with pirates despite keeping the medieval theme on the game cover and the title ""Titan Lords"". I lked the combat improvement between the first two games where you unlocked abilities that made fighting easier as opposed to being a master at dodging. The combat in this game is the most simple yet the most frustrating to the point I would even prefer to have to dodge every swing to survive. Right off the bat the game gets too spread out trying to send you to 5 different areas and every other person you meet sends you out of your way to help them. I appreciate the openesss of the story and having options but it feels they tried to drown you in quests just for the purpose of prolonging the time to finish everything. To top it off, the voice acting is terrible compared to any other game I've played and the graphics just don't feel right at all. This is the first game that I felt obligated to give a negative review and hopefully it will be the last.			"

												I finished the game right now and well...I have mixed feelings about it. I give a thumbs up because I loved previous Risen games, and want to support the developer which is a semi indy european company, but I'm not sure if I can recommend this.Ok, the things which Piranha does great in general, does great also in this game: the atmosphere, the exploration, the humor and the side quests. AND Risen 3 does a better job in those things which are generally bad in Piranha games, like it is more polished than previous Risen games, and finally has an approachable fighting system as well, but the story is horrible as usual (even if Risen 2 had a decent story anyway).So what's the problem? The problem is that the game is not new. RIsen 1 was an interesting game, and then Risen 2 came out and was able to bring some freshness, so they were different and innovative experiences on their own. But Risen 3 is not more than Risen 1+2 with an updated Risen 2 graphics. It is disappointing even if the game is very enjoyable.Then for whatewer reason the devs cut the story and the lore of the previous games and introduced a new storyline and arch enemy. It was quiet a WTF?? What made the story more messy is that they made constant references to the happenings of the previous games even if the story line doesn't have any connection with Risen 1+2. Because the story was uninteresting I felt the game a little longer than I wanted. It is a 40+ hour game, bear in mind.So should I recommend this game? Well, if you love Piranha Bytes games and want to get all of them, you will buy it. If you enjoyed the previous games but you are not a hardcore fan don't buy it, becuase previous Risen games are better. If you hated them, you will hate also this one.But for starters maybe this is the most accessable game. It is the most polished out of the 3 ones with the best fighting system, and becuase it has a different story you don't need to play the older games to get into it.I personally enjoyed it, but I feel it completely skippable. Piranha Bytes next time you need to try harder coz ppl won't buy your games!!!			"

												(Updated my review below)Now let me start off my review by saying that this isn't a game for casual players. If you want to mash some buttons and get through stuff alright you're gonna get frustrated and angry.People who have played Gothic and previous Risen games will feel right at home here though.The game is in many ways an improvement over Risen 2, I'll sum up all the points I think have been improved over compared to the previous game in the franchise.+ Much bigger world+ Tons of quests and things to do+ Combat at sea against sea monsters (ripped from Assassins Creed Black Flag but still nice)+ 3 different factions to join (exactly like in gothic 2, you can pick one and stuff will change according to your choice)+ Magic is back, there are tons of spells and skills for you to learn (Voodoo is back and awesome!)+ Treasure searching from Risen 2 is back in force and theres a lot of stuff for you to find+ Companions have more to say and aren't just there like in Risen 2, the game feels more alive. (They give you advice and sometimes really save your life during fights)+ Less bugs and glitches than in Risen 2 (although there are still a few minor issues)+ Gorgeous evironments! (Seriously, look at some screenshots!)+ Music and sound is perfect!+ Replayablility because of the 3 different factions (You can only join one of them so you can play the game again and experience it in a different way with different skills and everything!)+ Hilarious dialog sometimes+ Feels a lot like gothic! (no, seriously it does. The 3 different factions you can join and the overall feel of the game when you're playing is very similar. You even get good references to gothic sometimes throughout the game. Scavengers are in the game and there's a guy called Moe asking for money in front of the tavern :D and those are just a few of them.)+ Did a quest for a parrot, got 2200 gold and new armor! (10/10)Unfortunately there are a few things that just aren't that good...I love the game but in order to make this an honest game review I gotta put the negatives here too.- Voice acting is a mixed bag (For me it was fine but other players will think it's horrible)- Armor is really scarce throughout the game, you'll get your faction armor when you join one of them but that's about it. (It was pretty much the same in the gothic games though)- The game has frame rate issues- Enemy AI is horrible sometimes- ocasional pop in throughout the entire game- Some graphical glitches here and there- Clothes of npc's don't look that great sometimes (clipping)- Combat is challenging in the gothic kind of way, in the beginning you'll have to run away from enemies sometimes. If you wander off and go to deep in some parts of the islands you'll encounter monsters that are way to strong for you. Levelling is slow at first but once you're strong the game is a lot of fun. Gothic was the same and if someone says it isn't they're lying. I've finished Gothic 1 and 2 for like 3 times so I know how the games are. I don't have a problem with this but others will, thats why I said at the beginning that this isn't for casual players.Overall the game was and still is a lot of fun for me, I'll probably keep playing it for a while like I did with Risen 2. But players that aren't used to this kind of gameplay wont enjoy it as much as I did. I'm sure of that, so my advice to those people would be to play Gothic 2 or try out Risen 2. If you get annoyed as hell and hate the levelling and the overall gameplay of those 2 this isn't the game for you. It doesn't do anything new or inovative, it's made for the fans of those 2 franchises (Gothic & Risen)I give this game an 8/10Update: Just started a new game to see if things are different when you join another faction and they are. I joined the Guardians and I have a different ship and some unique faction quests as well!. I highly recommend players to try the game out a 2nd or even 3rd time to see the changes for themselves. I know I gave this game an 8/10 but there's just so many good things that i'm seeing that I'm very tempted to raise it to 9 :D			"

												I don't really review many games, but I came into this experience not really sure what to expect. I am honestly not certain why I never fell into the Gothic / Risen fanbase, it's clearly right up my ally, but Risen 3 is my first despite knowing about the following it had, for a long time.It was just great, that's all I can really say. I did whatever I wanted to do, whenever I wanted to do it, and built whatever character I wanted. There are some obvious criticisms, as any game has, but they aren't really significant enough to have distracted from how much fun I was having. The dialogue can be cheesy, but I was mostly interested in what people had to say (that's rare.) The missions had purpose, the maps and caves we're interesting. I'm not going to do a neat list of pro's and con's like other prolific reviewers. Just a damn good RPG, tons to do, tons of items, interesting magic, and a really refreshing melee combat system. Honestly. every video I see online of hard encounters we're people using rifles and the like. That seems so boring. I 1-hand melee'd my way through to the credits. You think it has quirks until you learn what's really going on and how to time your charge attacks, or parry. That aspect reminded me of the Dark Souls series. Once you git gud, it doesn't matter how much damage your weapon does or how much defense you have. Just learn it.10/10 this was a welcome surprise.			"

												Once again a traditional Piranha Bytes title with all its flaws, rough around the edges, feels unfinished sometimes, very very bad beginning and end, almost only tedious fetch/kill quests, ancient facial animations and many more. I hate almost all new mechanics like the sea fights and especially the whole underworld/ghost parts. Just finished the game in about 40h and already forgot most of the weak story.The different factions you can join almost make no difference as you will travel around a game world that is 90% accessible right after the prologue and you will do almost all quests of all the factions anyway. Balancing is abysmal, I would say even worse than the early Gothic 3. The game starts extremely hard, you will probably die most of your deaths in the forst 5 hours. At some point when you master the combat mechanics, got some decent equipment and learned nice skills, the gameplay is actually pretty good. Sadly, it wears off after only a few hours. Most combats are the same, you will probably take the same companion with you 95% of the time and the only interesting situations will arise from glitches. The second half of the game will be one long grind towards completing most quests, looting and killing everything there is, because skilling and learning the important stuff from trainers gets extremely expensive.You will not see a single new creature/enemy in the second half of the game. But you will have to suffer through the worst boss fights in the history of all PB games, which is ridiculous, because they somehow built up a reputation for having the worst end fights with Risen 1 & 2 already. I could go on ranting about many other things, some of which were certainly designed by the Devs on purpose because they are sadists and we the fans are certainly a bit masochistic in return. Nevertheless, once again it is somehow a good game in many aspects as well. For me mostly because the world that has been created is amongst the most atmospheric and credible game worlds I ever experienced. The factions are interesting, the islands are astonishing, the level design with the incredible attention to detail is still one of a kind. The music is beautiful and the voice actors are solid, with a few brilliant exceptions. While many of the main characters are boring and bland, a few save the day, for me these are the gnomes and bones. I'm happy that I decided to give the game a few second chances when I felt like quitting and after all finished the game.My only regret is that I wasted a lot of time collectiong stuff I never needed. TLDR:If you liked any other Piranha Bytes Game, get Risen 3, it is better than Risen 2 and the most impressive in regards to the game world. If you are new and curious about this rough little gem, get it in a sale and read some beginners guides.  "

												I've had played Gothic 1, 2 and 3 (multiple times) + Risen 1 & 2, so I am pretty familiar with Piranha Byte gamesTL;DR; PB ♥♥♥♥ed up again. This game isn't worth 50€25€ would have been appropriate.I lost hope in PB, won't buy anything from PB for now.This game is even worse than Risen 2. I would even call it Risen 2.5.The game pretty much feels like Risen 2 with factions. The fighting system is again pretty flawed and boring.I wish the developers would just take the one from Gothic 2 ... It was challenging and got never boring at all.This fighting system is a left click spamming fest to be honest.The story feels like it was made one week before release.The quests are boring and dull.The voice acting (German) is pretty bad and unimaginative. The jokes are also lame and cringe-making.The graphics are the same from Risen 2 and aren't even decent. Many textures are blurry and everything looks unfinished.PB used to make great games with a great stories, a believable world and interesting and challenging quests.This game however feels like it was made quickly just to make money without any love.PB, please just make games like Gothic 1 and 2 again. I know you can do it.			"

Risen 3 - Titan LordsRisen 3 - Titan Lords is a fantastic RPG focused on story, and nothing else. If you are really into it, its brought to the perfetion, almost every detail, dozens of characters, hundreds of quests and thousands of conversation lines. You can get really deep into almost every NPC story, find out what happened to them, what they think, need or want. I really appreciate this system and especially that these lines are not repetitive. Very often you have got more options how to solve a task or proceed through conversation tree. Mixing pirates, mages, natives, demon hunters and underworld was really nicely done in this game, making it much more interesting than previous title.On the other side fighting and talent systems are really bad and boring, with time you just walk and kill using only the same few clicks, after a few hours skills are developed enough that you needn't to improve them,  but if you pass over this fact the game is really exciting.  7/10 "

												If I had to describe this game in one sentence it would be this:This game is like that really bad B movie on the syfy channel at 2'o clock in the morning that you just cant help but watch even though you have to get up at 6am to get to that meeting you didn't prepare for because you like to procrastinate. The voice acting is wonderfully bad, the camera is like a mini game all in itself, and the combat will have you're character constantly somersaulting all over the place like an old circus performer trying to show the new boss he's still got it, usually rolling into more enemies you couldn't see while battling the camera, but it embraces the pirate theme with unashamed glee, using every opportunity to drop the f-bomb and preach the many miraculous powers of booze.And god help me if I don't love this game. If you want a good pirate rpg this is it. The only thing really holding it back from being great, in my opinion, is the lack of ship management/travel and far too few ship combat segments. My advice: plug in a controller, flip it on easy, somersault like no one's watching, and let the terrible B movie magic take you away.*no you don't need to play 1 or 2 to enjoy this. In fact, you'll probably like it more if you didn't play the first 2.			"

												Many reviewers judged Risen 3 to be generic which I don't feel is quite fair. The fantasy Caribbean setting and use of early firearms are rarely seen in rpgs as are open world games that are free of level scaling. Risen 3 is a game where you can find a difficulty 90 lock early on and a diff 10 in the ""late game"". Of course early and late game are almost completely dependent on where you choose to go and when.Exploration is a strong point of the game and you're always bound to find something useful or something funny at least, whether it's a new weapon, treasure chest, schematic or just two skeletons with apples on their heads and a bunch of throwing daggers stuck in their rib cages. Unlike in many rpgs gold is useful in Risen 3 and you always need more of it. Even if you accumulate large amounts by the end there's some powerful weapons that you can buy in the end game that will deplete your reserve. Conversations with NPC can sometimes feel long winded and slow but the writing also has a unique kind of derpy charm and the humor can be pretty good if a little awkward. Though the ending did feel very anti-climatic I must say, not that it matters much.English voice acting's pretty good but the main protagonist sounded very cheesy to me. Overall both the protagonist and Patty looked/sounded a lot better in Risen 2 I think. The main character in R3 is simply generic and bland both in terms of his voice and appearance while Patty was made sluttier for no good reason. Patty was already good looking in Risen 2 but she also had more character and sass appearance wise imo. Guns and magic make combat quite easy, healing items are overplentiful imo and some of the skills (like distilling for example) are almost useless but ultimately I found the combat and overall gameplay quite fun and that's what matters in the end. It's a shame that some Risen 2 combat elements were removed. Things like salt/sand, the parrot pet, the kick skill but magic and ""power gloves"" were added so it's not a net loss.Like all the Risen games Risen 3 is a bit rough around the edges but there's plenty of fun to be had and the 3 factions even give it a decent amount of replayability.

												I'm not new to Gothic/Risen series. It's reception was fairly mixed with a small dedicated fanbase. Most criticism came from  lack of polish, overal clunkines and no clear gameplay guidelines. Risen 3 is no different. Although it's far from original Gothic's awkwardness, the core of the game mechanics is the same. Much of the blame was put on difficulty scaling. You're free to go anywhere you like, be it danger seeping cave that's to be tackled by powerful character or trivial fights with monsters as challanging as shooting shotgun at chickens with nunchucks. Risen 3 hints what needs to be done but it doesn't hold your hand throghuout the game.Risen's 3 contuinues it's precedessor carribean setting which is quite unusual, yet eye-catching. Piratey theme is dominant in this RPG. Being so colorful as Risen 3 is, some RPG gamers may be a bit of put off. What needs to be said, is that plot and characters are less than exciting and unique but not subpar - just the usual fantasy RPG mambo-jumbo plus ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ish protagonist.What shines in third Risen installment are numerous quests, items and skills. The latter, though not balanced perfectly, provide variety in gameplay. Many assignments are clones of each other but somehow it manages to be satysfing. At least for a bit more than half of the playthrough it's challenging and gaining experience either by killing monsters or completing quests is satisfying. By the end I was far too powerful to have any kind of challange but getting there was a pleasure and that's the strong point of this title.In conclusion, Risen 3 is surprisingly a somewhat solid RPG. Lurking in shadows of AAA titles, it's mostly overlooked. That's a shame because even with it's shortcomings I honestly enjoyed Risen 3. If it's on a sale, just try it. Just don't expect much in story compartment.Final score : 7/10The good :- Attractive graphics- Lots of quests, items and skills- Freedom to choose your own path and game styleThe bad :- Pirate setting may be not appealing for many RPG fans- Some of the Gothic's clunkiness is still there- Story and characters are ok. Just ok.			"

												Coming from an Rpg fan,  this game is very good. The combat does take some getting used to however. The visuals are awesome! The story not so much. But the exploration!! I would recommend this to anyone. Not a contender for game of the year, but still entertaining nonetheless. Definitely worth the $30. Has some good replay value.			"

												I've really enjoyed all of the Risen games so far. Lots of freedom, very little hand-holding, lots of toys, interesting characters and locations. On the down side this is the easiest in the series so far. The strong challenge and lack of world-levelling - where the enemies get more powerful as you progress - was my favorite thing about the earlier games. It makes things VERY satisfying when you get that new spell or item and finally crack a previously almost invincible enemy. I blame those negative reviewers who haven't really understood the earlier Risen games for the dramatic drop in difficulty here..It's very much a marmite game - you will love it or hate it.			"

												Nothing compared to the second and overall, not worth the price. Get it on sale if you can, but stray away if you absolutely hate repetition due to the ease and speed at which everything drops off and turns from fun to boring.Pros :- Good Graphics- Actually quite challenging (Reminiscent of the Witcher's combat)- Ability to explore and find secrets- Large World- Enjoyable character builds, and lots of choices to pick depending on your play style- Most ""Boss"" fights are coolCons :- Gets extremely repetative after about a quarter through the game- Cookie Cutter Monsters- Environments Get Old- Only 20~ Hours of (Story) Gameplay- Bland Story ^ Due to the fact that the story is really all that contributes to the gameplay, thats a magnified factor.- No Replayability- Poor Attempt at Character Background & Buildup- Lore Cut in Half From 2nd Game			"

												First I'd like to say I went through many of the reviews here, many of the thumbs down played less than 2 hours, came here and passed judgement... an open world RPG with hundreds of quests and destinations, too many NPC's to name and a host of new features, yet 1.7 hours and it sucks. Really.Okay, that said, here's my quick opinion, if you played Gothic 2 there is much to enjoy here, the game is similar in many ways, but perhaps too easy to start. If you are looking for Witcher 3 graphics, nope, want Halo shooter action, nope, this game is exactly what it tries to be, a game for those who enjoyed the Gothic & Risen game world and wants more.If you are looking try this game keep in mind, those who play 1.5 hours after spenting 50 bucks, then come here to condemn it, you might want to consider the ability of anyone to jugde this type of game after such a short time, I suspect they were not aware of the history that comes with this game.

												Risen 3 is a third person open world action roleplaying game made by Piranha Bytes, the team that gave us the Gothic games and of course the first two Risen games. It's hard to talk about Risen 3 without referring to the previous games, which I'll call 'PB games' for short.To summarize: Risen 3 is definitely a step up from Risen 2 but all in all, it is probably still a game that only fans of PB games will love and a game that only fans of the genre may learn to like.To talk about this game more in-depth, I'll take the list I used for my reviews of 'Risen' and 'Risen 2'.Melee combatThe melee combat in Risen 2 was bad, very bad. The melee combat in Risen 3 is a lot better. It would certainly not win any prizes for the most exciting combat in a RPG ever, but after the fiasco of Risen 2 it feels like a huge improvement. The melee combat in Risen 3 is a lot like it was in the first Witcher game. Your character can perform a combo of moves and all you need to do is click the mouse at the right time to make sure the combo is performed correctly. If you click at the wrong time, the combo will be interrupted by the opponent or you will at least notice a decrease in your effectiveness (lower attack speed and damage dealt).The secondary weapons are back: you can use a pistol, a crossbow or throwing daggers. But since melee combat relies on performing a series of successive attacks (combo), you will hardly ever use a secondary weapon because that interrupts the combo flow. Ranged combatThe ranged combat in Risen 3 is about the same as it was in Risen 2. Muskets and shotguns are back, they work about the same as in Risen 2 and they are about as powerful as they were in Risen 2. But because of the improved melee combat and the return of magic, ranged combat isn't the only viable build anymore like it was in Risen 2.MagicMagic is back after being pretty much absent in Risen 2. Each of the three factions have their own type of magic (rune magic, crystal magic or voodoo magic). I can't really comment further on how a mage build would function in Risen 3 as I went with melee/ranged. Learning curve for your characterLike in all PB games, there isn't just a learning curve for the player but for the character, too. He needs to learn to fight better. As the game progresses and you improve your character's skills, you actually feel your character getting better. This curve is not very steep in Risen 3, making it by far the easiest PB game so far. For the sake of Steam Achievements, I only improved my stats and skills a bit and then started saving 'glory points' (what XP is called in this game) to be able to max out each stat one by one (there is an achievement for getting each stat to 100). This means that I went through the better part of the game with only minimal stats and skills, and the game still felt too easy. You can up the difficulty in the game settings, but that only makes the monsters hit harder, which isn't really an issue when the problem is that most monsters don't hit you at all. You could artificially increase the difficulty in two ways, though: go solo, so don't take an npc companion with you: I should have done this earlier but the first few hours you need a companion so you get used to it. Also, there are companions that are part of the factions that live on the main islands and they have a personal quest there, so you miss out on some stuff if you go solo. But it was only after I started to go questing without a companion that I felt challenged in this game. don't use dodge: dodging is overpowered. It has no cooldown and opponents can't interrupt your dodging, so you're actually invincible while dodging. Combined with a companion who will take aggro while you're dodging, this can make the game way too easy.FactionsFactions are back, after being more or less absent in Risen 2. They aren't as different or game defining as they were in the Gothic games, but at least they feel like real factions and they come with their own armor sets, like in the good old days ;-)TrainersThe character development system is very close to the one Risen 2 had, with some minor but welcome changes. You still increase stats with 'glory' (XP) and you still learn or increase skills by finding and paying a trainer who can teach you. It would go too far to describe all the skills and all the stats and their impact on the skills in this review, but I must say that I found the overall character development system in Risen 3 a bit better than in Risen 2.Great atmosphereThe settings, the NPCs, the towns, the music, the humour, ... everything adds to a distinct atmosphere that only PB can create. Although the 'slightly dumbing down' of Risen 2 & 3 compared to earlier PB games is still noticeable, there is a slight improvement compared to Risen 2. NPCs will react to your actions (e.g. stealing in plain sight) a bit more often and a bit more logically than they did in Risen 2, but it's still far from the first four PB games.Something that reminds me of Gothic 2, is that a part of the world of Risen 3 is 'recycled content' from the previous game. Some people find this incredibly lazy. While I see their point, I personally like the vaguely familiar settings. Those islands look different enough from the previous game to be a largely new experience, but you have a feeling of “Hey, here used to be...” and a curiosity of “I wonder if ... is still there”.There are a ton of references to the Gothic games in Risen 3. For starters, some creatures from the Gothic series are back: scavengers, swamp golems, snappers and dragon snappers. There are also a few encounters and easter eggs referring to earlier PB games. For example, you'll come across an annoying fellow called Mud who follows you around and won't shut up (same as in Gothic 1), you'll meet the nameless hero you played in the first two Risen games and you'll see a lot of dead people again like Steelbeard and inquisitor Mendoza. ElexI'm extatic to read that PB is making a new game and that they know they need to improve on a lot of things in Risen 2 & 3. If you're curious, I suggest you read the Q&A thread on the official Elex forum. The replies from PB there are extremely promising. There is also a Steam placeholder product page to be found here: Some notes about the Steam AchievementsThe achievements aren't bugged like they were for Risen 2. If you want to get all the achievements, you will either need three playthroughs or plan a bit. That means: join each faction (save, join, reload) before joining one for good. if you aren't going to join the Demonhunters faction for good: when you join them briefly to get the achievement for that, also do the quest 'A new rank' for Drake before reloading. This quest is Demonhunters only and as a part of that quest, you need to complete another quest called 'Zak's temptation' on Antigua, which has an achievement of its own. gather enough glory points to max your lowest stat and then max each stat one by one (save, max a stat, reload, max next stat, reload, etc.) before allocating your glory points where you want them for your build. start playing the game as a good guy to get the achievement for getting your soul rating over 90 (I'd save at 80 or so, then give all soul dust to Edward to get soul rating above 90, then reload), then start playing as a complete prick to get soul below 10 for another achievement.

			Cosmic reviews Risen 3 Titan Lords for PC developed by Piranha bites and published by Deep Silver. Enjoy this Risen 3 review? leave a comment!		

Hello once again I'm Cosmic and welcome to the latest addition to the Risen franchise, Risen 3 Titan Lords. Risen 3 was developed by German developer Piranha bites who are well known for their previous titles including the Gothic franchise as well as the previous two Risen titles. Published by Deep Silver, Risen 3 was touted to be a throwback to the first Risen title by once again boasting more open world and exploration based game play.Risen 3 takes a break from the unnamed hero of the first two games. Instead you start the game as the son of the famous pirate Captain Steelbeard thus being brother to Patty a familiar face from the last two games who also features once again in this instalment. Searching for treasure on the mysterious crab coast you soon come across a skull cave that has 'Risen' from the ground, get it? Within the cave itself a skull lord appears and steals the soul of the pirate who seemingly dies. Upon regaining is life thanks too a strange shaman doctor known as Bones, another typical cheesy risen joke. The pirate begins a quest around the southern isles to reclaim his soul and ultimately stop this new threat.Moving away from the more linear and heavily pirate themed second instalment. Risen 3 has gone back to the multi-factional open world style of the first. In Risen 3 you are able to travel throughout the southern isles to visit and explore islands such as Antigua, Taranis,Calador and other familiar places from the previous games. One thing I do really like so far is that exploration really does reap rewards as you can find loot, quests and secret areas in a variety of ways. One new gameplay feature in particular is the ability to swim, while it sounds a little silly it actually becomes a great exploration tool as you can swim offshore to discover secret islands full of loot.One of the positive traits about Risen 3 in terms of travel is in its free-form design. You can just head off in a direction and explore, with the only thing stopping you in your tracks being enemies that you are not ready for. Once you finish the starting section you can go to any island that is available to you at that time. You don't have to do the islands in a specific sequence which adds replay ability particularly when you take the factions into account. While on an Island you can travel on foot or fast travel to the various portals once activated. One useful mode of transport is a magic spell that transforms you into a flying parrot, while you cant stay in this mode for long its great if you've just travelled up a mountain and want a quick route down. It's especially useful for those of us with kleptomania as the parrot flight allows you to fly into locations otherwise inaccessible by foot.The games combat has always been notoriously difficult throughout the series. One click attacking combined with clunky movement can become very tedious and outright frustrating. The start of the game is particularly tedious as your character has next to know abilities other than basic attacks and basic melee blocking. It can end up meaning that those who like to play on the harder difficulty settings will spend hours upon frustrated hours dying against relatively minor enemies especially in group situations. As you progress in the game, improving your stats and acquiring new abilities from trainers, combat becomes a hell of a lot easier. The combat system overall is massively improved from Risen 2 however it still suffers from fundamental flaws that have plagued the series since conception. Clunky movement, issues with focusing on enemies and of course pistol shots missing from point blank range are all back once again.The major redeeming feature about combat this time round is the return of crystal magic. The developers took out magic in Risen 2 something which was largely complained about upon its release. Thankfully magic is back in force this time and I would argue it is the best way to deal with the majority of enemies as not only does it pack a hell of a punch but its the less frustrating option for group encounters. Luckily which ever faction you decide to join, all offer various forms of magical abilities so no matter how you build your character you will have some form of magic to fall back on.Those familiar with the previous titles won't find much different when it comes to character progression. To improve your characters array of stats you must accumulate glory points. Glory is earned for the completion of quests as well as killing enemies. On top of this to improve particular stats and gain new abilities you must find trainers which are dotted throughout the world. However to learn from trainers costs gold and depending on what you are trying to learn you must be prepared to part with a substantial amount. There are also special items hidden throughout the world which you can recover which add a permanent boost to stats these can be gain via exploration or through reading books to acquire the specific quests.While character progression is solid, I've never liked the way the developers have insisted on putting trainers in the game. The main reason behind this is because you really need the abilities they offer and having to pay gold for them, especially early on when large amounts of gold is not easy to come by is a massive frustration. One thing annoys me even further is particularly when it comes to the sword fighting if your a melee focused character. The ability to riposte is essential against some tougher enemies and a life saver in group encounters. Yet even though your playing as a pirate captain you don't have this ability from the start. You must go to find a trainer and then pay gold to get it which is ridiculous.  As I've mentioned there are factions in the game to which you can join one. The three factions include the mages, demon hunters and a voodoo tribe. Each faction offers an array of faction specific abilities and quests. Once you join a faction your able to then gain better ranks within that faction which unlocks better gear, quests and abilities. However once you join a faction you cannot join another so choose carefully. Thanks to the freedom that the game allows you can travel and complete the majority of quests on each factions island before making your decision of which to join. I ended up join the mages faction known as the guardians, one for the magical abilities and two for the cool eye piece.Graphically the game is good but not great. On the PC specifically I would have liked to see a lot higher texture resolutions as much of it looks very last generation console. The world however does look good and immersive. There are some glitches and bugs to be found throughout but these tend to be minor. Sadly once again Risen 3 follows suit in the terrible lip syncing animations as well as poor facial animations as a whole. Similar to the previous games the voice acting and scripting is full of off colour humour and outright cheese. Some of the voice acting isn't terrible but some is just cringe worthily bad.Overall those familiar with the Risen and Gothic series will be right at home with Risen 3. Any avid RPG player will be able to sink their teeth into Risen 3 and find a good amount of enjoyment from it. However I wonder if many people will not be able to get past the difficulty of the combat at the start, it does require a certain amount of perseverance that I think will send more casual players running for the hills. Risen 3 is certainly a large improvement on the second and there’s a good degree of enjoyable content in the game. At the end of the day, if you enjoy a decent RPG then Risen 3 will be for you however those looking for a more streamlined RPG experience may wish to look to more mainstream titles.			"

												This is a hard review to make. I simply love the world, it's very well crafted, full of things to discover and interesting npc's. Graphics are great, and there's many great wallpapers to be screenshotted from this game. Dialoque is funny, lots of sidequests. Sounds like a dream game, right?Unfortunately, the one big thing that breaks this game, is the frustratingly bad combat. I've tried to time my clicks, but it won't help when most enemies in the game use the same tactic which is: Attack, jump back far away, close in, attack, jump back far away. If you can't corner your enemy, expect long fights even with the weakest of opponents. The combat has always been bad on risen/gothic games, and it makes me wonder, why? What have the devs thought with this system? :D Didn't they play it themselfs at all? Didn't they hear the criticism about the combat from the first parts?It's a shame, since other parts of the game are cool, interesting and there's a lot of eyecandy. But in a game like this, combat is a big part, and it's not fun, not at all. Makes you mad, frustrated and takes a lot of time just watching enemies jumping backwards. It ruined the game for me, i'm tired spending almost o minute fighting a lone scavenger that gives me 50 exp (leveling needs about 4000).			"

												To start with, I finished ""Risen 3"" 5 days ago. So with its completion, I have done with the series, at least for now. I think I can say without hesitation that Piranha Bytes did a marvelous job there with Risen series. In regards to Risen 3, I have read a lot of reviews and comments that says the game is just more of the same of its predecessors and I kinda agree on that. However, I think it is a good thing that R3 got the best of these two worlds.As an RPG gamer, what impressed me in R1, is the faction system which utterly failed in R2 because your faction was shaping your play style and it was limiting the player to a certain role. Now these factions in R2 plays a role in R3 but for instance, if you want to be an inquisitor, now you can't but there is a whole bunch of quest for them, too and even if you are submitted to another faction which also can heavily consists of magic usage, you can develop you character in both magic skills and/or other gun/musket skills.  Also faction system makes replayability of the game skyrocket, just like it did in R1 and R2; you can revisit the game and play a different storyline with a different faction.Story-wise, it is on par with 2 previous games; although, for me, first one is still the best. It goes without saying, it was also heart-warming to see the characters from previous games; heck, you can even meet with the antagonist of the second game(playerchar) and clink some booze with him; even though it plays a small role it is very nice addition and I really appreciate the developers for giving us, players, tangible lines to merge previous games to the newest and latest title.As for the map, it shares the same location with 2nd game's. I am not sure but maybe, 1 or 2 island were added. So if you played the 2nd game, it's not a big surprise to say  yourself ""I think I know this place but from where?"". One can say it is a disadvantage or a proof that developers didn't work as hard as they worked for the 2nd game but I found it really satisfying. Because instead of spending time on recreating a new world, they spend the time on enriching the story and quests, giving us a better game in terms of story content from the other previous titles. The story length is quite satisfying in comparison to today's standard; just to give an example, my play-through took around 45 hours.So what I don't like about R3 is, still the same since the beginning of these series. Item-wise, you are still searching for the strongest weapon in regards to your level, not really thinking of any other option because there is no real option there. Second, Lockpicking and Persuasion skills are all needed but for one tenth of whole cases, really. In nine tenth of cases treasure loots or things we steal are totally garbage. So there is not much negativity for me in this game; even they integrate a teleporter system. In the previous titles, it was becoming tiresome to walk over all the island just for 1 quest item. So I think I can safely recommend Risen 3 to rpg lovers and also, with its friendly UI, even to the newcomers from other genres.			"

												This ""review"" may be very stream of consciousness.See, I don't think I'd call the Risen series a good game series, save maybe the first game. Well, that's probably a bit unfair. They are good in a variety of ways, just not the traditional ways most games are. The combat just kinda stinks in these games. There's no real way around it. Again, Risen had this issue too but was far lighter on combat than either of the sequels, at least for the majority of the game. It's incredibly basic and spammy, and there's far too much of it.So why am I so compelled by this series? I think one of the things Piranha Bytes does well, is exploration. There's always nooks and crannies to explore and side quests to find. These random adventures with the sidequests are among Risen 3's strengths, are often very funny. Risen 3 lets you have almost unfettered access to the game's world once you complete the tutorial area. There's about 20 percent of the game walled off for story purposes, but other than that, you can really just do what you want. You'll have a few major goals, but they are so out of reach that often just following your wandering heart is the best course of action. You'll probably find your way into the main story eventually by sheer accident. There's a spell that turns you into a parrot that you can useThat brings me to the story. In order to account for that free form exploration, it's pretty basic. You are the son of a legendary pirate (and brother to series mainstay Patty) who gets his soul stolen by someone in the underworld, but you've managed to retain your human body. So you'll need to set out and find your soul, and in the course of doing so basically solve everyone's problems along the way. Now, the series has never had a strong story. For some reason you're a new character, despite that this new guy kinda looks like the old guy, and he's sort of a similar character (the previous hero is probably a bit more polite). So it's kinda weird that you're a new guy that's not very different from the old guy. Like you can actually read reviews for the game and people are actually confused about it, thinking it's the same character. Well, anyway, it's even weirder because like, the game is pretty heavily invested in Risen 2's story. You recruit 3 of the party members from the 2nd game. So, anyway, just a bit weird that they made this new character that's barely different and have him interact with everyone anyway. I'd get it if they were like ""we don't want to reset the hero again,"" but they kinda do it to you anyway at the start. Just sort of a strange decision.Speaking of things back from Risen 2, the game heavily reuses some of the areas. Most of them are vastly expanded or changed, but still felt a bit like a retread at times. There are a variety of quality of life improvements, like a fast travel system similar to something in an Ubisoft game. The game has the most ridiculously in depth quest tracking system, so if you're lost you just need to use your log and put ""show map marker"" so if you're not in the mood to explore, you have that option. Crafting's a bit easier now too. There's more trainers, and most trainers train multiple skills so you likely won't have to worry too much about not having access to someone to train you. Trainers and merchants are all marked on the map after you find them once.The levelling system is largely the same but has been reorganized, and not really for the better. For instance, melee skill increases your skill in all three weapon types, so there's not much specializing. Similarly there's like a Silver Tongue (charm) and Intimidate dialogue option often, and these skills are on the same stat too. Most games would force you to pick, be a charmer or be a brute, perhaps tying them to related stats. So it's a little boring that way.Anyways, game starts off hard, like the others. You'll need to choose a magic faction for story purposes (and also, c'mon, free magic). This magic makes the game substantially easier, at least for the faction I chose, which favors direct damage. To be honest, and I find myself saying this with complete surprise, but I'd advise people to take a melee path. The combat does ever get good but there's some fun to be had once you get the parry ability. The basic magic attacks act sort of like weapon attacks, so you can't really use them with swords. So eventually when I got bored of how easy the magic was making the game I invested in melee and only use the cooldown abilities. Combining sword, a magic attack, and then a pistol shot while dancing around enemies could actually be fun at times. Random gripe but, hey, PB, you're a PC developer. Don't give me 30 moves and make them all need to be on the 10 hotkeys. Give me a scrolling hotkey bar or something. That's something to be said about this game over Risen 2 is that you have a lot more stuff to use, and it gives you it often. Even the magic of the other factions can be used via consumable items, so it really adds to the value of exploring. In R2 it seemed pretty rare to find anything too useful outside of a sword upgrade here and there.The game does a good job of feeling ""alive."" It has a small cast of characters but this allows them to do NPC scheduling. I liked that as you clear objectives like taking back a mine overrun by undead, the miners that were displaced by the undead will go back to work. That sort of stuff. Small touches a lot of games would ignore.Voice acting is weird. The PC sounds like someone's trying to do a Bale Batman voice via Aaron Paul, and I really hated him at the start. I got used to him though, mainly because his deadpan delivery really works well given the odd stories he gets himself involved in. Most of the party members are good, and I rather love Bones' voice actor. Very strange performance in both games. Graphically it's not going to stun much but most enviroments are well done, and it seems to be far more technically sounds than Risen 2. Fairly certain I had better performance in Risen 3 than R2 on the same hardware.Anyways, I preordered it so, a quick review of the DLC, in case you ever get the game. The Gnomes isle one is kind of bland. About 2 hours. Not much to do there, honestly, and it feels rather disconnected. One of the big appeals of the game to me was sailing into a port, finding treasure maps and quests that take me to a different island, and just bouncing around. The DLC, by nature, can't be involved in this, so it loses that. The second major DLC is the Fog Island one. This one I like better. It's more involved in the main story, and has some decent atmosphere. Also had some good treasure to be found, while the other one didn't. Still suffers from being disconnected. Both are about 2 hours each, which isn't too bad for 5 bucks, but I'd probably wait for at least a small discount.Writing this all out sounds negative, and it kinda is, but as much as I have issues with some of it, I enjoyed my overall time. I think PB are really good at creating areas to explore. The aren't too big, not too small, and there's always something around the corner, and they give you. I just hope, now that they have the rights to Gothic back again, that we see them address the combat in the future. I don't need much when it comes to action RPGs, but something's gotta give. Even something as simple as making combat rarer.Alright, ramble done. I don't think I can recommend it outright. Have a tolerance for Eurojank, and like pirates, humor, and good exploration? Probably worth getting. Liked Risen 2? Get it for sure. Hated Risen 2? Ehh, it's an improvement but not leaps and bounds. Wait for a sale.Final clocked in time is 45 hours, for those that care about game time. Minus the DLC and a few deaths / idle moments I'd say most people will get 35-40 hours out of it.			"

												The first few hours of Risen 3 feels similar to its predecessor, with slightly dated graphics and a shortage of polish. However, patience is a virtue, and as you progress, a fun and addicting longing for adventure prevails. Piranha Bytes is known for its imagination in the genre of RPGs, and Risen 3 is yet another fine example. This game is full of charms, and will keep you entertained for many hours. The voice acting is good, quests feel authentic and give you a sense of importance, and the overall objectives are virtually always clear. There is room for improvement in graphics and final polishing, but I'd give Risen 3 a solid 8 out of 10. It doesn't quite rival the brilliance of Skyrim, but for RPG fans, it's still a no brainer.

												Always a little worried what kind of game you might be getting from Pirahna Bytes after the Gothic 3 debacle.  While Risen 3 was marketed as a return to a more medieval traditions of the Gothic series and Risen 1, it still is very close with the pirate theme seen in Risen 2, something that put some players off but was a plus to me, as a person who gets tired of seeing the same setting in every fantasy RPG to be released.  What does return though, is a more open world, literally tons of quests with branching options and the return of joinable factions.  The combat is more refined than Risen 2, it flows a lot better.  The main story is typical save the world that is seen in most RPGs but the path to get there through the faction stories is more unique.  I really enjoyed Risen 3 and hope it is not the final installment of the series.  Pirahna Bytes really hit the nail on the head with this one.			"

												I think that the decision whether or not to recommend this game was quite a close one for me because while the game does have allot going against it on paper it was still fun to play I just think that it got held back because unfortunately no one area of the game stood out as having been particularly well executed throughout.On the one hand the levels are quite well done and there is allot to do in the game, plus you have a wide variety of choices when deciding on how to build your character so you don’t have to decide what play style you want to employ up front. There are also a wide variety of side quests to pursue which provide quite a few hours of entertainment. The crew of your ship which you will build up over time are interesting as they will make comments as you travel with them, some of which are fairly amusing. Another thing that I liked was the skill system, to many games have long complex skill trees that don’t feel like they contribute to much more than the player stats. In risen 3 you can learn any skill you want and allot of the spells are interesting to play with, from being able to blink around the field to turning yourself into a parrot to more aggressive combat spells there is allot to play and experiment with. While I know that some people have had stability issues I’ve yet to crash once and fps drops are small and few so I personally think that the game is fairly stable. On the other hand this game does disappoint particularly as you progress, this is due to your character becoming overpowered and there being no real counter balance making combat a chore as the enemies don’t become notably stronger or varied also meaning that there is little incentive to mix things up. Another damming issue is that you don’t have to get too far into the game to have seen every enemy except the bosses. Graphics were another issue, while the environment may be appealing the rest is fairly sub-standard and broken graphics and clipping are a common issue. It’s also fairly easy to glitch a quest with issues ranging from broken markers through to the quest being impossible to finish effectively breaking the game forcing you to either load an earlier save or start a new game. while the game does have some replay value from joining different factions and completing different quests it could do with some incentive to start a new game such as unlocking (significantly) harder difficulties or additional content. I think that the straw that broke the horses back though was the highly anti-climactic endgame. The last few quests and the final cut scene were extremely disappointing because allot of what you had done to that point seemed to fizzle out leaving you asking the question “what, is that it! What the (inset preferred term to express outrage)!”pros:.interesting environment.the story was great up until the last chapter.fully voiced (though it’s kind of expected in this sort of game these days).interesting characters not the best ever but still ok.stablecons:.not challenging after a point + various balancing issues.anti-climactic ending and no closer.can bug out on you either quest markers or in a breaking way.poor graphicsIn conclusion I felt that while the game was fun to play it doesn’t feel finished and while I can accept that not all games are going to be polished to a mirror shine they need to pick up the slack in some regard whether that be through the story or the gameplay mechanics and risen 3 ultimately just didn’t do that.

												Firstly, although my game time says 4 hours, my save file says 6. 6 hours of gameplay might not be enough to properly review this game, it seems to be improving, but is all the time I am willing spend here for now. I bought this game based on the various reviews here swearing that the game will get better, but honestly, who wants to go through 5 or 6 hours of gameplay before having fun?The combat is clunky. The attacks are not responsive, the characters go through pirouettes, leaps and lunges to deliver a single blow. At the beginning of the game the delay between the strikes in your 3-hit combo are long enough to allow the enemy to interrupt you every single time. You will be reduced to using the same hit and roll tactic for next 3 hours, whittling away at the enemy's health while your companion does most of the heavy lifting... Unless the companion AI suddenly decides to stop attacking or has gotten stuck somewhere, in that case whittle away. On the other hand, as you progress you acquire new types of weapons and skills that really add up to the combat. It can still be frustrating, but after 5 hours or so (your mileage might vary depending on the places you visit first and how you develop your character) you start to see where the combat is trying to go. I do not if it eventually gets there, I will update this review when I revisit the game.This might be surprising, but the combat isn't what finally pushed me away from the game. It is the conversation that did it for me, and that is quite sad because they went through the effort of voicing pretty much everything. The problem is that the conversations meander so much, there are so many exchanges in one conversation branch that hold no value, they don't develop the characters, they don't introduce lore, nor do they mimic normal conversation. It is really, baffling how much extra effort went where it needed to. I understand that a complaint for the previous game was the lack of voiced acting or how little voice acting there was, I am not too sure about this, but regardless, there is just too much useless and pointless dialogue in this game, but I might have been able to take if it wasn't for the horrible voice acting.  That's right, there is awkward writing being voiced very badly. This is the first time that this has affected my gameplay so much that I have stopped playing. All that said, the game has the potential to improve plenty, perhaps by the 15th hour everything else would be sufficiently enjoyable that you can look past the scrip and voice acting, but if that is the case, it would be better to wait for this game to go on sale, currently it isn't worth the asking price.

												I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. Hell, it was a new Piranha Bytes release, and I LOVE these devs. However, I'm not sure what's going on with them after seeing this. Sadly, I would have taken more consideration into pre-ordering it had I known what Risen 2 ended up being, as PB in my opinion has had a relatively solid track record with their games, with titles that were at least good enough for me to pitch in and support them, and that's saying something in most cases.I've been a Piranha Bytes fan to the core when it comes to their RPGs since I had the manual dexterity to use a keyboard, and Gothic was actually my first RPG experience. Even to this day, I have a hard time finding games in the RPG sector that manage to captivate me as much as G1 and G2 did.However, this isn't a Gothic 1 or Gothic 2 review. This is a Risen 3 review, so let's get on with it.What really ruined it for me:The Combat-   -   -   -   -   -This was the first thing I noticed when I began playing the game, and I have to say PB fell flat on their face with this one. First and foremost, the main character has about as much ability in using a sword as a dead cat, and he's about as stalwart as one, too. His attacks have an atrocious wind up that make even the simplest combat situations into an ordeal of timing and hoping the enemies don't hit you first, which brings me to my next subject: Enemies have NO WIND UP to balance this out. Just about everything you encounter and fight in the game will attack you relentlessly and without any kind of delay, meaning that if you go in and swing at the enemy, they can just attack and interrupt you, doing damage and bringing you back to square one. Oh, and that's another thing. EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING stuns your character. Tiny♥♥♥♥♥beach insect thing? (I still have yet to understand those creatures.) Yeah, their tiny attack will stagger your character the same way you'd expect him to if he got clocked upside the head by Chuck Liddell.     As a whole, this results in an absolutely infuriating combat experience that was one of the main reasons I had to put the game down for good. It's completely unbearable, and frankly I've come to expect far more from these developers.Now, I know, I've seen it everywhere. People could say that Gothic's combat was just as awful, if not worse, but there's a key difference there: Gothic's combat is anything but horrible, for one. If anything, it's about all you should expect from an RPG from around the year 2000; on the other hand, this game from 2015 manages to have combat that, unlike Gothic, doesn't just take a bit of time to get a hang of, but instead is completely impossible to work with and that, in my opinion, makes the experience null and void. I even used cheats to increase my combat skill in hopes of making my character's attacks worthwhile, and even THIS did absolutely nothing whatsoever.In terms of major flaws, this really is the only one, and it manages to be so outstandingly, so GLORIOUSLY bad that the game is completely ruined by it.Now, the game has some things that I like about it, namely the fact that it really does feel like a Piranha Bytes game still. The dialogue, characters, world, and music all still make me feel like I'm playing a good old PB game, but once I get into a fight I simply can't force myself to get through the whole thing.Now, for an open recommendation for the developers and a closing statement:You clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s have given me gaming experiences throughout my entire life, and I absolutely adore you all for it. I've often burst out in laughter from the Hero's dialogue options and an NPC's response, as well as the numerous easter eggs and goodies you leave lying around. This, just as often as I've have slammed my fist down on my desk in frustration from the challenging and punishing, yet rewarding combat experience, but this game hardly managed to do any of that for me, as the whole thing was sadly cut short by its one fatal flaw.When I say this next bit, I want you guys to know (and this goes to other readers as well) that I'm not just putting on the nostalgia blinders; I just know a working formula when I see it.      Hypothetically, if you lot made another RPG, regardless of if it's Risen or something new entirely, and you used the same formula for G1 and G2 (here's where you could call me out on nostalgia blindness, if it weren't for the fact that an overwhelming number of your fans will show agreement) and adapted it for a modern market, using a newer engine with better graphics and the like, it would probably end up being another great installment; and, when I say 'formula' I'm talking about everything that made the first two Gothic games what they were, from the controls to the stats. Hell, you could make it on the old G2 engine and it'd probably still be great, but if there's one thing I'll admit, it's that the controls, while not inherently bad and not in need of outright change, could definitely use a tune up to make it feel a bit more fluid and responsive.At this point, I doubt anything in the paragraph above will happen, but I do sincerely believe it'd do the team a lot better than what they're going with as of now. Some things don't need to change, and it really does seem like the games started going downhill once the controls went through the big overhaul they did starting with Gothic 3, which changed the other two games' main control drawback of being somewhat stiff at times and generally feeling rather old-school to making the whole thing just feel outright clumsy. Risen 3 seems to have marked the apex of this clumsiness, and it's so atrocious that I couldn't even recommend this to my worst enemy.Hopefully this review shed some light for players on the fence about getting it and why I sincerely believe they should just go to GOG and buy one of the Gothic games instead. (It's probably obvious which two I recommend.) If you can be a proper human and adapt to the controls that are most definitely different from what most are accustomend to, you'll find what is an experience that is worlds better than what this title provides, and possibly one that you may find unforgettable.

												I bought this game over a year ago, but due to the negative reviews I never bothered installing it. I played the original Risen as well as Gothic 3 (about 60 hrs) and enjoyed both of those titles. I had a hankering to play a pirate game yesterday, so as I was going through my games I remembered this one. I installed it as well as the enhanced mod, and let me tell you I really like it. It feels a little outdated and more in line with some other titles I played back in the xbox 360 days (Graphics aren't quite up to today's standards, and gameplay feels slightly generic...) but overall it plays well, has some good lines of dialogue and I don't find the combat as clunky as some other reviewers claimed it to be (I use a 360 controller and it plays quite well.)I think this game was overlooked by the majority and maybe it aquired a bit of an undeserved bad rap.7.8/10

												beautiful. just finished what i'm hoping is not the last pirahna bytes game. and even though i don't really write reviews and am new to steam i figured the newest edition to my favorite series deserves a shout out. i discovered risen 1 a couple years ago in a bargain bin and didnt expect much... just a no name company with what looked like a simplistic, guided rpg.... i was surprised at the little details put into it that i had never seen before and a friend told me about gothic.  my next was gothic 3 which to this day is my favorite game right up there with skyrim, fallout 3, kotor. their games seem to get a lot of flack, and i think that is mostly for the combat system... which i always thought was fine. no this isn't a world where you start off hacking through hoards of enemies seamlessly, if you want an action game... get an action game.if you want a role-playing experience where you are put into the shoes of a character and asked to build them and guide them through a process than all of their games are great(though don't get the steam version of gothic 2 one of the steam patches broke it and it stopped booting in the fifth chapter for me..... all my disc versions have been fine though)first off, all their games are 'deceptively' open world. meaning, you look at a mini map( in the later ones) and see roads and mountains and assume you are supposed to take those roads. one of the things i find so wonderful about their games is: yes, they offer a road.... but if you don't follow it they reward you.risen 3 doesn't have the greatest feeling of accomplishment and i think that may be do to making teleporting easier. teleportation stones used to be a big prize and this feels more similar to arcania.... too many stones means you aren't excited about it any more. though that could just be compared to gothic 3 which had the biggest moment of ""score!"" of any game i had ever played with finding all 6 druid stones when people online would all swear their were only 5 and the mentioning of the 6th was a bug. finding something that the internet hadn't found for years... that makes a game stick with you.this one didn't have as many of those moments, unlocking unlimited flying and the 'reach far away objects' hand were my biggest. but it still sticks true to its roots and gives a gaming experience that rewards exploration. and player control of the leveling process.this is easier than it's predecessors, but their games are all designed to be hard at the beginning and easy later on and i think that is brilliant. there is nothing more annoying than leveling up only to have enemies take longer to kill.... ok i don't play games for the repetitious hack and slash. i play for the character development and story... i'm one of those weirdos that reads all the game books and listens to what the characters say. i like games that let you ease in, explore cautiously, and then once you have been everywhere don't make you repeat things.i think the biggest annoyance in the game was the knife mini game, sometimes my knives would be sticking out of the board and i get no points -_- that and the one character that i got, started a quest with... then he leaves.other than those things, risen 3 like its predecessors is a game that gives what it gets. if you run through the trails, don't care about dialogue, and are only there to kill things than you will get a shallow action experience. take that extra time to climb that highest peak, to fly in between shadow minions, to read the items in your inventory. and you find a game that people put effort into. which is more than can be said for most of what comes out today.

												Risen 3 promises to bring back the best features from the previous titles in the series as well as features from the Gothic series. In the next installment of the Risen franchise, you are a new hero who must fight the oncoming Titan attack. The world is crumbling, island by island and you must build up a resistance to fight against the horde of Titans. Your soul has also been stolen and you must figure out how to regain it back, claiming it as yours as it once was.Risen 3 is quite an improvement from its predecessor: Risen 2 in all the right places. The animations, skills, exploration, and graphics have all been upgraded. One of the reasons the Risen series is not enjoyable for gamers is due to its frustrating combat. I can attest to being very frustrated with the combat in Risen 2. The combat in Risen 3 has not been improved very dramatically. The combat system is mostly the same except for a few tweaks. You will still get frustrated at one point or another, but continuing through the story definitely has its benefits.The animations during fighting battles have vastly improved, easily having the best animation work out of the Risen series to date. Skills also pour into the combat system more than ever. Yes, you still have to use money to purchase skills. Yes, you still have to use glory to purchase skills. But, the skills you learn in Risen 3 are more beneficial than any other skills in the Risen series. The skills provide players a somewhat easier time in each fight because they are learning extra skills that will help in combat, providing for quicker and more efficient kills.Where Risen 3 really shines is its exploration and its storyline. You are a new hero in the Risen universe who has his soul ripped out from a Titan Lord and must get it back. Simple premise, but its a little more complicated. When you wake up, a war between the Titans and humans is going on and your hero is caught in the middle of it. He is then sent to destroy Titan portals, to keep Titans from entering the world as well as forming an alliance between the remaining island factions to ensure humans are victorious. The storyline provides hundreds of quests that people can give you to do in exchange for money, items, or even glory. The quests can range anywhere from ""Kill x Amount of Bloodhounds"" to recovering stolen items. Factions and exploration are a few main features of Risen 3. You can join three factions: Demon Hunters, Voodoo Pirates, or the Guardians. Joining one over the other reaps different benefits than another. You may also only be able to learn skills if you are a specific faction, which may be of use to you later in the game. Going back to the islands from Risen 2 was refreshing but also disturbing when you see all the destruction that has been caused to the cities. Exploring the large amounts of caves also gave me a Skyrim feel, which I haven't felt for a while. It seems like every place matters to where its at and every place is different and distinct from another place. There is not a huge difference in graphics, but Piranha Bytes obviously took a lot of feedback from Risen 2 and improved some major bugs within the graphical system. The storyline provides anywhere from 10-50 hours of gameplay; depending on how many hours you spend on exploring and how many hours you spend on doing the wide variety of quests.Something came back to the Risen franchise. Magic. There is still Voodoo magic, but I'm talking about REAL magic. Such as magic from Risen 1. I loved magic in Risen 1 and I was really happy to see them bring it back for Risen 3. In Risen 3 it is done very well and one of my playthroughs I eventually just used magic because of how powerful it was. If you would like to become a wizard, join the Guardians faction, they are the faction that handles magic.Although, the game is better than previous titles in the series, it has its flaws. One, the combat system. It hasn't been revamped and you will still get frustrated from your ""lack-of-skill"". Although, unlike Risen 2, if you keep leveling up and buying more skills, you will begin to have the upperhand in combat; which was awesome to see and kept me going. Although there is a TON of exploration, you are visiting the same places as in Risen 2. I really would have liked to see another world, instead of the one from the previous title.(This is a shortened review for Steam. The full review will be up on my blog ready for anyone and a link will be provided. Happy gaming!)6.5/10			"

												I love Risen 3 in its current form. Through the 30 or more hours it’ll take you to complete the game, you’ll encounter so many locations, characters and situations that it takes far too much time to talk about in detail. Little things, like the two loonies with Anatidaephobia, or bouncer at the tavern on Calador who has the same name as the bouncer in Gothic 2. Risen 3 won’t do anything to win you over if you hated the previous instalments of the series. But then again, that really just means this series isn’t for you. Risen 3 is no huge leap forward, but instead focuses on small but considerable improvements and additions to the formula. It’s not perfect, and you might not feel there’s enough new for your liking, but for me it was just enough. I was never bored throughout my adventure, there was always something new to do, someplace new to discover. The seemingly small environments were teeming with enough life that it felt a lot bigger than it might look on a map. It might not be the proper sequel to Gothic 2 we’ve all been waiting for, but it does its job well enough for me to accept it into the collection.4/5Full review:http://www.pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/risen-3-titan-lords/ "

												I've played and finished Risen and Risen 2, and as a fan, I think that this game is even better then my spectations. In Risen 3 they brought back the elements most missed from the first game, in addition to the things that already had in the second game. If you played Risen 1 and Risen 2 you must think already that the change of the charaters appearance is kinda common from game to game. But I don't want to discuss about that.Well, risen 3 showed a big advance on the mechanics of the plot for two reasons: In the previous games there were only 2 factions to choose (Risen: Monastery and Bandit Camp| Risen 2: Inquisition and the Natives) and in Risen 3 you'll have 3 factions (guardians, demon hunters and voodoo warriors) and also you can choose the side that you will be (of the humans or of the demons) that is decided according to what you do to people. And the second is that the faction and the side that you choose will interfere on the main story of the game.The game brought back also the crystal and rune magic from the first game, without letting away the voodoo magic. It also has new kinds of weapons based on the first game.With so many things that are based on the first and second game, we can say that Risen 3 is the sum of the others, with some things more.The bad thing about this game that dissapointed me a lot was that the game is TOO EASY. when I got near to 50% I whas almost invencible for any creature in any amount, I even had to put in the max dificulty to keep enjoying the game, but it didn't changed much, not even on the final boss.

												Alright I do not usually do reviews as you can see, but I thought this game deserved one. First and foremost I am coming to love this game and I hated, absolutely hated the first and second game. I actually just gave both of them to my friend on the day I bought them. I am honestly unsure why I dis-liked the first game, something about it just pushed me away so severely I could not stand it.. That for me at least was fixed in this one.It is fun, I enjoy all the stories and quests and silly little things you can find, despite some bad voice acting at times I do actually like the voice acting and I love the things the main character says. All in all I love this game, but I have one gripe. Honestly the combat is really lacking, even if it is an improvement. No matter how good you seem to get with the combat, you are nearly guaranteed to get hit a couple times fighting a group of two (or three if you have a companion) and if you are fighting a group of three or up you will not avoid damage. That is just how it is. Combat does not allow you to get good enough to really protect yourelf while you deal damage. I found dodging to be more effective than blocking after a bit but still, it was just impossible to really avoid damage... Which really sucks to me because I liked to play games ""perfectly"" if you will. No mistakes and such. That doesn't matter in this game.But anyway, like I said I love this game, it is great, just don't expect to be to awesome in combat. You will be able to deal pretty heavy damage eventually though. 8/10 for me, only combat holds this game back in my eyes.			"

												Yeah it's clunky you heard about it and there are a lot of pirates (again) and well ending and story aren't really good.Still it's worth playing if you like games  like this notably Gothic or Risen -type exploration games.There is a good amount of playtime with fun leveling and hidden loot, different factions and so on.I had a great time scavenging the landscape for items, running from monsters only to come back stronger later and slay them.I sneak and steal stuff and beat people up. What's not to like here.			"

												I liked Risen 2 - and I liked some parts of Risen 3 even better.  Graphics were good, game was smooth with no glitches.  I played through as Voodoo Pirate like in 2, but with the other options I expect I will do another playthrough.  Only negative was boring companions - hopefully they will release some better ones in an upcoming DLC.			"

												I don't know why so many bad reviews.. Open world with a lot of exploring.. same as any Risen seriescombat is nearly same as Risen 1 and 2 (weird but simple)Graphics, voice acting and story mostly as any risen game (mid-core at best)So you get what you expect.. 15$ seams reasonble, but with sales its for 5$  (Super cheep comparing the content)If you looking for best experience go for witcher.. if you just want typical Risen experience then i recommend this game "

												Risen 3 - Titan Lords is a fantastic game. The story is very exciting and it is incredibly exciting to follow the story. (This is my first Risen part I played, so unfortunately I can not compare this game with the predecessors.) The first impressions were very good, the graphics looks beautiful, the characters have humor, and as already mentioned, fits the story perfectly. If a fourth part should appear, I'll buy it to me in any case.			"

												First impressions....objectively balanced!I've only parted five hours of my life, to Risen: Titan Lords. With these three hours, I must confess. I'm sold! However, I will admit faults where they are due. I'll outline the good, the bad and the ugly.The Good1) Shiny enviroments to look at! Crystal clear water, and reflective water bring life to the world. Much improved over number 2 in the series.2) Combat mechanics, the skill system is similiar to Dark Waters. They've improved on the ""wheel"" so to speak. 3) UI layout, it's simplistic and opitmized. You wont feel, it's a waste of space. Since it barely takes away from the visual sights.4) The music, it's well done.5) Swaggity swag, more swag than you could possibly swag out to. The Bad1) Sounds and atmospheric immersion. Combat sounds are sub-par. The enviroment sounds, just seem off. I know, pervious incarnations have had these issues. Hopefully, patches/mods will fix it.2) LOS on enemies, so far mobs just seem to see you at a ridiculous range. Sneaking, definitely helps trim that. Movement can be awkward and disorienting at first. Just need to adjust.3) Lack of interface options for fullscreen mode. Game started out windowed, I had to ini file, fix it. Not a major deal, but easily fixable via placed in-game options. 4) Character identity confusion? Okay, minor spoiler...you're not the nameless hero from the other games. Yet, you're with Patty and the character is Steelbeards son. However, you're still nameless. I call him ""Ted Dos Lagos"" we get it Piranha Bytes, you don't name the ""heroes"". I'm sure, ya'll over there have some inside joke about it. It's from the Gothic days, and eventually the heroes name get's revealed. The Ugly1) Claw monkeys! 2) Facial expressions and animations. They just don't really have a quality feel, it's irky. The combat animations, aren't amazing. Yet, it could've been better. I know, the guys at Piranha Bytes, have it in them. 3) Lesser polished look on model textures and meshes for bodies They took a step backwards, this go around. Dark Waters, had really nice textures and meshes. I will admit, the armor looks pretty dope, which helps overlook the body. 4) Dead Veggies, you'll spot dead vegetation on living healthy plants here and there...it's weird to see. I know it adds immersion, it just looks off. Minor gripe of mine.5) The dialogue, lots of sarcastic remarks. Lots of profanity for profanity sake. Sailors, like doing that. The voice acting is ugly, but it's not terrible. 7.5/10Overall, based on my first impressions. It's solid follow-up to Dark Waters. It needs some patching, needs some shiny boot polish, needs a bath. However, it's Risen the only successor to Gothic. You get, what you pay for. If you're a true zealot of the old Gothic series, whom are rare. Give the Risen franchise some more thought and maybe even you can help improve it. I will say, we'll never have another Gothic II. I'm okay with that too. I genuinely feel, the guys/gals at Piranha Bytes, have the best intentions at heart for their products.Edit: I'm just going to add, if you do still enjoy Gothic II, in all of it's fantastic glory. There are a few mods out there. The community is dim and with little life, I know World of Gothic closed their doors. Folks, are out there though. Just need to try and find them.			"

												I played mostly Risen, and also played Risen 2. This is an improve over them, if you are not sure you can try a demo of them to see if this is you RPG style. The main thing is that is more focus on exploration and missions than combat, there is a lot to explore and secrets, collectives, etc. and missions have different ways to be resolved. But combat can be a pain for some people and there is a need of tweaking for some aspect but for me is good, is the Risen combat and I like to have different combat system on games. I recommend the game BUT IMPORTANT I don't recommend the price, look somewhere to buy it cheaper, wait a sale, wait a complete edition or something.			"

												Good game, but still same problems.PB will never learn apparently..either they are incredibly stupid or stubborn.  They make a good game, with a very detailed believable game world, a workable leveling system, an all around solid open world RPG BUT the combat is horrible, the fighting is just always the weakest link with PB.If you have ever played a PB RPG before you know exactly what to expect.  I am bewildered as to whats up with PB and the fighting in thier games.In this iteration, the guy does overly elaborate second...two second long animations twirling around flipping the sword behind his back before just friggin attacking...Its awkward, badly paced and not very good.  You just spam the dodge key doing acrobatics to get out of harm, then do some long stupid overly fancy attack move when all you want to do is friggin swing your sword at the monster standing infront of you...no need to twirl all over the place...And what ever happened to shields sheesh...

												Disclaimer: I like all the Piranha Bytes games. They have their own atmosphere, hand-crafted environment and rough dialogues. Exploration is written in capital letters.This is the third in the Risen series but it's its own fun world. You can explore various very distinct islands, from northern Calador to the tropical island Kila. I don't know any other games that are so much fun just exploring. You run/climb/swim to your next treasure. The NPCs alll have their stories to tell in a lot of quests. The main story is nothing to write home about but I found myself enjoying everything else the game has (like parrot flights and monkey training).A little balancing would have gone a long way: The game is too easy after one third of it.But don't let the Angry Joe Army and metacritic score scare you. If you like exploring and RPGs, this game has it.			"

												I do not understand why people complain so much about bad voice acting and combat system. All PB games have that problem. I believe it would be appropriate to say that PB games offer specific experience which one will love or hate, if you didn’t like previous ones you will most definitely hate this one. My problem with this game is different, it is ridiculously short and after 25h I have done nearly everything I could. Game feels shorter and smaller then Risen 2. I was expecting that using the same engine etc will allow them to make bigger world, and more quests. I enjoyed time spent with it but I cannot recommend spending GBP40 for game which simply doesn’t deserve it, Adding 30h (I assume that this is how much you need to do everything) to existing game is worth GBP20 at best.

												+ I like the story, freedom of movement  and the ability to choose which order you do everything.- Mob difficulty, it seems to be flat across the board meaning stuff is hard at the beginning but later in the game you are practically immortal unless you step off a high ledge.- Itemization, you mostly run around in the same gear and use 2 maybe 3 weapons throughout the game. Merchants sell the same stuff all over and there isnt much difference, I like to continually build up a character but felt like 90% was the same old crap or same stats.Still think it's worth playing through but could be better.

												It is what Risen 2 should have been in some ways while still making partly the same mistakes and also introducing new stuff that mostly isn't needed.The world is much more interesting than the world in Risen 2 and the factions are nice but QTE, cutscenes and stuff like moral system and astral vision don't need to be in this game.The game tries to hard to pander to everyone: Gothicfans, Risenfans, Risen2fans.And so it only does a half-decent job.It's still a good game and definitely an upgrade to Risen 2 but for the next game Piranha Bytes definitely need to listen to their own community even more.

												More of the same as previous 2 Risen games. It is kinda combination of the gameplays of those two. Depending on which faction you choose to represent, your magic usage changes a lot which is  a nice touch. Playing as different guy was weird for me, because there is almost no difference between the two heroes and even though previous hero has nice cameo, I would prefer all 3 games with one main hero. Risen 3 is like traditional food in your regular restaurant, you had it so many times and you realize it is not the best or super special, but you return there anyway and eat it. This time it is still acceptable.			"

												PROS:-very nice enviroments, like 95% of the game is beautiful-some areas and dungeons(mines!) are reminiscent of the old Gothic games-good, humorous voice-acting(appplies for the English version)-takes very long to finish if you go through every last corner of the game-the magic returns! so do the factions!-less resource hungry than Risen 2 plus you can sit on chairs again-no actual bugs!In the middle???-a lesser number of different types of weather(it actually rained only the first time I got to Antigua)-not as many particle effects as in previous instalments-combat seemed to be okay until I progressed and had OP means to deal with, well, anything-only 4 chapters -_- bring back 6-chapter games! The game could easily be longer...CONS:-easy even on Ultra difficulty, super easy the second half of the game-Tacarigua is rather dissapointing, the island looks cool, but there is so little to do compared to every other island(even the one with so called   gnoo	)- gets too damn easy if you are a completionst like me!-Toughness attribute is broken, you are practically invincible once it's over 90-Final dungeon... there isn't oneRisen 3 is actually comparable to Risen 1 in terms of how much fun I've had playing it. That should give you an insight.			"

												Great game. I Loved Risen and Risen 2 before this. the aliasing was a bit disappointing when first started up, but using Nvidia's 4K DSR makes the graphics very good indeed - and I'm a stickler for good visuals. Risen is a feel good RPG with great (although remade at times from Risen 2) locations, quests and characters along the way, each having a distict personality. Repeating a location isn't all that bad, it adds familiarity and adds continuity from the previous storylines. The Combat, for me, is great, not clunky at all, very simple but the amount of weapons and options you have for defeating foes is plentiful. Do you really want to have a long, drawn out fight with one of the hundred Scavengers in the game, or just get it out of the way quickly and move around and explore, loot chests and complete quests? For me RPG's like Risen 3 (and the first two) are built for exploring, not getting into 5 minute fights at every turn.The DLCs are worth getting too, adds hours of extra gameplay and great bonus items, more great quest storylines too! Sad to have completed it! Though maybe I'll find the time to get some replay value by playing as another faction... For me, an easy 8/10 all things considered.  Personally, a 9/10 - playing games is about enjoyment, right?			"

												It's not a bad game. It's like a mix of Risen and Gothic 3 and Two Worlds II. You get to play as Captain Steelbeard's son who is your typical hotheaded pirate that loves adventure and treasure hunting. And man his sister is hot. xDThe detail in the world is amazing. You have to take the time to just look at everything. Explore and find hidden paths and secrets and LOOT LOOT LOOT. You will be looting your a$$ off in this game.The controls need work though, I found the controls when fighting to be a little clunky but damn if that Dark Souls type dodge roll button didn't save my a$$ several times when I got caught up in an ambush. I was spamming that button like mad. And there was a nice bit of satisfaction when in a sword fight and finishing off the threat by blasting it with my pistol.Oh and speaking of finishing off. I like that sometimes you will see a finishing animation after a fight. It's not shown often like in other games where you get tired of seeing the same finishing animations over and over, but you will see them here and there and it mixes up pretty well by offering different types of finishing animations and camera views like when ramming your sword in a guys stomach or catching him from behind in a struggle to cut his neck open with your sword for example. Badass! :DI was pretty impressed with the detail and animation of the beasts. Wait until you run into that damn alligator. It scared the heck out of me the first time, chasing my a$$ all over the place, the damn thing was relentless. But the detail and its animation was nice.The NPCs that join up with you actually help you out. I had left an NPC behind and I wandered off, and next thing I know I was caught up in an ambush. I thought I was dead for sure, Dark Souls dodge rolling all over the place for my life. Next thing I see the NPC running to save my a$$ and he casts a heal spell on me almost immediately and starts kicking the sh!# out the threat. I was like O.OOne more thing I have to mention. Even though the voice acting is... terrible, you will laugh at the dialogue. There is some serious humor and cursing in this game. LOL. Try wandering off in the beginning and your sister will ask you. ""Hey, where you going? Do you even know what your doing? Are you Fu#%ing lost?"" And you can choose to hide behind your pride and answer back, ""No I'm not Fu#%ing lost! I know exactly what I'm doing!"" Knowing damn well you don't. xDAnyway, I can say I am happy with this game. It is fun and very satisfying. :)I will keep you guys posted with whatever awesome stuff I find throughout the game. ^ ^			"

												(The game took me 35-40 hours to complete, Steam failed to record some of them, so the displayed amount is missing at least 8 hours) If you know Piranha Bytes and their history, you know what you're getting yourself into: A unique and memorable adventure with quirks both major and minor. Virtually everyone would like to see another proper Gothic game, but PB is keeping in mind what the market lacks at any given time and what the publisher may be willing to shell out money for. Back in 2012, it made sense for them to try out a different setting for Risen 2. After all, it had to compete with the likes of Skyrim, and a small studio such as PB has to pick its battles. Risen 2 was a sequel developed from scratch (content-wise) – no easy task, I imagine. They probably could not afford to ditch it all again for Risen 3 and instead opted for a more iterative approach, applying a thin layer of Gothic in the meantime to please the impatient fans. Thus, it feels more like a very large content update to Risen 2 than a true sequel, and PB have not quite delivered on their promise to go back to their roots. I'm not going to talk about story and graphics, as those elements are just solid, do the job and do not stand out to me. What does stand out, is the world.The world: The islands can be visited in any order this time around. They have been lovingly crafted, with many small highlights and cheekily placed treasures waiting to be uncovered. Carefully placed objects tell stories without using words, such as skeletons surrounded by bottles of rum in a secluded spot or a monkey messing around among bananas, voodoo dolls and corpses. There were countless occasions of these enriching little things that never failed to make me smile or ask myself ""WTF happened here?"". The world is teeming with quests (300+ of them) that mostly revolve around fetching and killing stuff. Their presentation through funny and witty dialogue (which does have its cheesy moments) makes them rewarding to complete beyond the glory and loot you get. Swearing is indeed overused, which is a trademark and a welcome recurring theme in the German version, but probably superfluous in the eyes of the English audience. The world and the characters that populate it can suck you in for countless hours at a time. What bothers me is the use of recycled locations from Risen 2 (such as Antigua and Tacarigua), which, apart from the shadow realm's dark taint, retain their Carribean atmosphere.A thin layer of Gothic, weapons & armor: PB promised to go back to their roots and create a darker atmosphere. There were indeed (very short) moments where I felt like I was playing a Gothic game again, largely due to the new locations, factions and their armor sets. Roaming through the swamplands in a demon hunter's armor that looks like a beautiful cross between a dragon hunter's armor (G2) and an Old Camp one (G1) felt great. However, once I returned to my ship and met a parrot named Polly that told me to shave, nostalgia was quickly smothered. There are a few reincarnated minor NPCs from the old games, such as Mud (G1), an annoying, needy motormouth following you around for a bit, and Moe (G2), a violent bully demanding a toll from everyone trying to enter a tavern. Such small instances of fan service kindle hope for a more substantial return to Gothic in the future.Aside from the faction-specific armor sets, there is still a huge emphasis on pirate's clothing. This results in an muddled mixture of epochs and settings in places. Moreover, it's a shame that some stronger versions of armor pieces are just recolorings of the previous ones (e.g. a third-rank demon hunter helmet is a shade lighter than a second-rank one). Re-using assets from within this game and the previous one and applying a different coat of paint to some may be a necessity because of the development team's small size and budget. However, it seriously hurts immersion and they need to apply more polish and care to their equipment in future games.The types of weapons you'll find are again ripped from different eras and settings. There are Gothicesque axes and maces, there is your typical pirate gear and then there are a few questionable design choices. For example, the strongest musket in the game looks like an overdesigned modern-day (scoped...) air rifle that is made of bright, varnished wood. The fact that it says ""way ahead of its time"" in the description doesn't help much. By mixing medieval-looking arms, pirate sabers and fancy guns, PB created a rather incoherent set of tools.Combat: Serviceable, but still rather quirky. You'll find that monsters essentially teleport to your location from 10 meters away and repeatedly knock you back in a straight line. This gives a very rigid and stiff feel to the whole affair when it comes to sword fighting. Thankfully, you can dodge and pick up more moves along the way, but most of the time surviving melee combat felt more like exploitation of design flaws than standing up to a challenge to me. Many have said that it gets better later on as you get stronger and master your timing, but I really wasn't enticed to put up with sword fighting for that long. The fact that they re-introduced offensive magic abilities (painfully absent in Risen 2) adds some much needed flow and diversity. Muskets still provide an easy way to avoid finicky sword fighting and just shoot s#it in the face Indiana Jones style. I would not call them overpowered per say, as they behave and do damage as you'd expect, but still quite out of place in a Piranha Bytes RPG.Conclusion:Piranha Bytes took Risen 2 as a foundation, made it less linear, a little bit better and added a few excellent islands and factions. The result is a fun and engaging, though incoherent pirate game with a hint of Gothic/Risen 1 and plenty of the old PB quirks. That's a little less than I was hoping for, but about what I was expecting. Overall, I'm satisfied with Risen 3 and I can't wait for what future games might have in store.			"

												I loved Gothic 2, but never really ventured out to play any other games by PB. I picked this up on a whim, and I'm completely blown away - in a good way.Yes, the dialogue is cheesy. The script can be bad and jump around. The bugs can be awful, and laughable. You may rage the first time you accidentally back up a palm tree during combat only to fall out and die. You'll get headaches from the twitching textures, and the jittery lighting during cutscenes. You'll think the voice actors are sometimes intentionally trying to be do a bad job. The quality of the character design varies greatly from on to another. But, I still love this game, and for a good many reasons. Combat is excellent. It won't be everyones cup of tea, but its a better twist on difficult than some other games. I hate combat and levelling in Skyrim. I love combat and levelling in this game. It just feels better, and I feel like I'm accomplishing something. Enemy placement is also excellent. The world is dangerous. For example, after returning to the tutorial area after finishing the tutorial. I had killed all the monsters, and was grabbing a shroom from near a pool of water and waterfall. I almost jumped out of my seat when a massive crocodile charged at me. Almost died, but surviving a far stronger enemy after being surprised felt great. I really love the level design. Risen 3 takes relatively small maps, and makes the most of them. I love exploring and trying to find every nook and cranny, because you actually benefit from doing it. Think that ledge over there looks like you can land on it? There's probably some dead dude in a weird position, with some coins and a bottle of rum. Maybe some flowers for some extra stat points. Looks like there is an out of the way beach around a jutting out rock? I bet you'll find some useful loot, and some lore. Found a way onto that roof that makes it seem like you were glitching the game? Nope, devs figured players would do that and planted a few potions/spells. The devs understand me as a player. They know I like to mess with things, and they took it in stride and made their game great. This game won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it's up there. I give it an 8/10. Well worth the cost, especially on sale.  "

I have been stuck to this game for 5 days at the time of writing this and am near the end of my second playthrough, its got to the point where Im dreaming that Im in game...send help.Anyway everyone else has the pros and cons so let me write up a tiny list of hints from my time of playing to help anyone who cares enough to read them.1, watch a youtube video about the combat (not angry joe he's a noob) to get the jist of it and to see if you want to get the game or not...2, dont use ranged combat (rifles or shotguns), stick to melee or magic, some spells are very badass, spells cost no mana and theres even a bunch of spells that improve your melee combat (demon hunter guild best magical swordsman imo)3, pick up as many quests as you can, it may overwhelm you but they are not endless and you'll nail them off fast4, if you like the game pick up the dlc's (dont need adventurers garb though) they extend the game a fair bit and dont impeed on it.5, look out for stat increasing plants and recipes for turning them into stat potions, a huge amount of free character improvement lies in these things.6, choose the right difficulty level, lots of people think this game is too hard and it will be if you put it on hard, put your ego aside for this one and just put it on easy at the start you'll have a lot more fun while still needing to pay attention, as you get better turn it up if you feel the need.7, watch out for margoloth, I wont go into details but it can be a hard boss battle. The best way to combat her imo is wait until shes at 50% health and use about 5 necromancy spell scrolls (get them before the fight). When the time comes...you'll thank me.Thats it for my main tips, I wish I knew that list on my first playthrough, still I managed ok because I put it on easy and had a blast. Controlling the difficulty is essential to not rage quiting like a moronIts a good game, get it			"

												If you liked Risen 2 you will like Risen 3.  It is essentially more of the same.  The combat is still stiff and iffy but what makes Risen series appleaing to me is the immersion it gives.  An enjoyable underrated RPG series.			"

												Risen 3 offers great entertainment value. It was designed to be fun and enjoyable to play for a more casual gamer, or a gamer that enjoys some pleasant and relaxed gameplay once in a while.What sets this game apart from other action-rpgs is the beautiful handcrafted world that is a joy to explore, no other developer can compete with Piranha Bytes in this respect.The game offers a light-hearted story that is well told, and a lot of side quests.You eventually get a good ship and start building your crew of companions, each with their own stories, personalities and side quests. The assortment of skills and spells is very nice and varies somewhat depending on what faction you chose to join.The character progression is fairly fast compared to previous games.The one thing that is most important about the combat is to NOT tap the attack button repeatedly. Tap once, wait for the move to reach its peak then tap again, with a bit of practice you will get the timing which is very forgiving. You can also tap by listening to the sound. The dodge move has 100% invincibility window, making it very efficient when you want to get away from a tough spot.If you are looking for pleasant gameplay and good entertainment this is the best game you can get.

												If you play RPG's for immersion and exploration (ala Skyrim, Fallout 3), you should probably ignore the negative reviews and give Risen 3 a shot. The world is large and incredibly detailed with many sizeable islands each with their own unique look, feel and questlines. The combat is not frustrating like in previous Risen games, its a bit on the easy side but quite enjoyable once you learn some skills and spells. The game looks good and the economy is well balanced so you always have reason to just head off into the wilderness in search of loot to sell or hidden quests. While previous Risen games had slow, difficult starts that confined you to a small area, once you get past the opening sequence which lasts about an hour Risen 3 opens up entirely. The main storyline is not good at all, but there are lots of interesting side quests and colourul characters to talk to. If you have been curious about trying a Pirhana Bytes game but are worried about a slow start or a long learning curve, Risen 3 is a great entry point into one of the most underrated series of the last five or so years.

YouTube™ Video: Risen 3 Titan Lords Review 

			Views: 14,847		

			A Risen 3 review looking at the gameplay and its features on PC. Risen 3 Titan Lords is also available on Xbox 360 and PS3 platforms from August 15th 2014.		

Risen 3 provides an interesting romp  through its fictitious locales with an overflowing amount of things to do , comprehensive character progression, and the chance to do things differently depending on the choices made. Despite a few negatives here and there with things like getting stuck in the scenery, not enough variety with the combat and the view being obscured by foliage when in battle, the game runs smoothly and plays well. Considering its price point, gamers will get their monies worth in terms of hours, and there’s enough intrigue to keep battling on to see what happens next despite some dodgy dialogue and shallow performances.  If you’re a fan of action role playing games, then there’s a lot to like about Risen 3 which offers some pleasant and open ended adventuring.			"

												Much bad has been said about R3. Is it really that bad?No. Not at all. Except you hated R2 or R1, then you won't find anything good here too.Don't like that pirate-setting? It's just the tutorialmap, afterwards there is not very much of that left.Personally i liked it, even though it often feels less mature than Gothic1,2,3. But hey, it's not that you're drowning in major quality RPGs to be picky, is it? :)It does many things better than R2 (combat, feats, size of world) and it does many things equally good/bad (quite shallow story, ocasionally repetitive fights, etc.) but in the end it's still funny to explore, find the secrets, discover things, visit new islands, fight sea monsters, have sea battles, take different companions with you, etc.Biggest plus is that the companions (of which there are some to choose) now respond more to the world you are and to the things you do. Sadly their commentary in battles start getting repetitive and annoying pretty soon.Although the Gnomes are not nearly as funny as Borderland's Claptrap, they're quite cute and often good for a smile.One plus to mention is the balancing. I'm the explorer type and discovered nearly everything so the final island (which is not really small) i could master in well earned god-mode :)So if you're just rushing through it, it could be a bit more challenging.tl;dr: Recommended if you liked Gothic1,2,3 or Risen1&2. If you didn't like them, keep miles away! "

												If you liked the other Risen games then this does follow in the franchise foot steps. I think it is an under rated game. It runs flawlessly with no crashes and the graphics/sound are good. The story is a bit weak but there are lots of great characters and many side quests to follow. I got a good 56 hours of playtime doing all of the dlc and most of the side quests. Many of the sidequests are fetch this and that but there is enough variety to keep you interested. Combat again is more or less hack and slash if you play as melee as I do.My biggest complaint is the ending which is rather anticlimatic. Otherwise this is a decent game.			"

												Risen 3 is merely a shadow of former Gothic glory. There is no debt in it, no noticeable choices or visible character development. Risen 3 is reduced to following ""X"" on a map and killing loads of mobs on the way there. I played as a mage, because it had been my favorite playstyle in Gothic nad Risen 1. But magic is dissapointing here. It is simplified to just spaming the left button. There is litterary no choice of spells. You have basic attack spell, heal and AoE. Also there is no mana. Attack spell have instant cast and other spells have cooldowns. Enemies are other thing I found frustrating. They have a ridiculous aggro - when they see you from a distance, they are instantly rushing like crazy. Story of the game is short and forgettable.All in all, I can't recommend this game. It may be interesting for fans of the series, but if you are not Gothic/Risen veteran, go buy Witcher 2/3 instead...			"

												When I first started playing this game, I had just clocked Witcher 3 , and I thought it rather tame. However, the more I played , the more I got engrossed in it , and then I could'nt stop playing it. I'm doing this review as I've finally completed Risen 3 and found it to be both challenging and joyful. The main story line is like no other and held my interest right to the last battle.(Which was a battle royal ) There are heaps of side quests and lots of unusual skills to aquire and learn. I would recommend this game to everyone.			"

												Practically the same game that Risen 2 was; same levels, same characters, same quest types and so on. Horrible voice acting and plain ugliness don't help much either. And still... it has some hilarious dialog and a remarkable atmosphere that makes you feel like a true pirate -- even though the ship is still just a fast travel device. It certainly doesn't worth the full 50 euro price, but for 20 or some it might be a nice catch for the fans of the previous games.			"

												I didn't want to even buy it in the first place.... Being an old Gothic 3 fan, I was not overwhelmed with Risen 1. After Risen 2 I swore 'never again'. Then I red the the first reviews which have been fairly good for risen 3. And it seemed to excel in the points I was interested in. It piqued my interest....Now I'm in the game for 8 hours and I must say, that it is difficult to get away from the game. It is not political correct, which is such a relief. It is not the top notch technologie, but it doesn't matter. It uses vivid candy grafics, which soothes (I found myself just walking the beach to collect clam :) for 10 min.)All in all it is more Gothic 3 than it is Risen. I really enjoy this game and was long waiting for something like this. If you are a Gothic-Series fan, you can buy Risen 3. Well, it is not as difficult as G3, it is not so political incorrect as G3, but for the time being it is just at least s.th. good. Really missed. :) A must buy!			"

												For some reason, Piranha Bytes games tend to be underrated. I love the art in this game, the tropical scenery is fantastic to look at. Lots and lots of quests, hidden objects, places to explore. Very good combat, definitely more challenging that what you find in Bethesda games. Three factions to choose from, with different play styles (mages = pure magic, demon hunters = melee with magic buffs, voodoo = melee with curses). Strange design choice for what concerns progression: the game starts pretty brutal, but while enemies always remain the same, you become more and more powerful, until you basically enter god mode.Anyway, having a blast with this game, and will probably play it again on hard after completion, picking a different faction. Comes highly recommended, especially considering the budget price it can be bought for now.			"

												If you like good RPGs with an open world and basically no limitations as to what you can do (in the sense of it being anything but linear, once you got through the ""tutorial"" missions), I can highly recommend this game.The graphics might not be the best, but the world still looks beautiful and, as it is common for Piranha Byte games, it has a lot love for the details.This leads to the game actually creating an intense atmosphere, that you can cut with a sword.If you liked Gothic or the other Risen games, you should definitively give Risen 3 a try. It is doing (almost) everything right, that Gothic and Risen did and it eliminated a lot of flaws of its predecessors.			"

												I would not suggest purchasing this game yet (8/12/14). It has yet unresolved bugs with no fix to-date. It needs work supporting multiple resolutions and processors with more than 4 cores. There is a work around which I used to play it somewhat. From what I've seen so far, this should be a $30 game, not a $50 game. I think of it as a poor-mans AC4. There are some very frustrating traits like followers that are stuck to you so close you can't cllick on anything in the environment without the game thinking you're talking to the follower. The fighting mechanics are clunky, and the story-line is very confusing with no idea of what you need to do. In summary, a $30 game, not a $50 game...			"

Aside from that and a few scenery glitches, the game was well rounded and the fighting system was smooth.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game.The graphics are good, particularly the environment.  There's quite a bit of fun dialog with NPCs and your companions which had me laughing at times, it was entertaining.  There are a lot of side quests which I didn't get to finish all of because I got so focused on completing the main story line.  That's actually a compliment though because I was so focused on the main story because I'd really gotten caught up in it.  Towards the end of the story line I was REALLY wanting to kick the butt of the main bad guy.  In my first play through I focused mainly on melee weapons (swords) and enjoyed the combat.  It wasn't too complicated but at the same time had a nice level of challenge to it that gave you a sense your own skill matttered.  The kill moves were also pretty good (with the possible exception of one where you slit the throat of a skeleton which just seemed silly, but I can live with that when the rest was pretty cool).  There are also a LOT of cut scenes, the developers devoted a lot of time to this and they're generally pretty good.  It gives the game a more cinematic feel which was fun.Okay so that's the good, now for the bad.Not everything is explained very well, so I found myself sometimes just saving, trying things and reloading until I had a sense of what I should do or what was the best decision because the game didn't give me enough info about various skills and so forth to make anything other than a random guess.  Couple of examples.  Spending glory on skills and attributes, I was never entirely sure how important different ones, what the effect of raising one attribute vs another really was or how useful some skills were.  Another example, whether to keep or sell some things I'd gathered.  I gathered a LOT of iron ore, gold ore, etc. but by the end of the game all the gold ore was still sitting in my inventory.  Should I have sold it, was there some crafting I could have done with it but missed, or was it just another form of ""wealth"", I don't know and the game never explained this.  This was my first Risen game experience so perhaps previous games had explained this but, again I don't know.  But for someone coming to the game franchise for the first time some parts of the game were a bit too puzzling.  Overall though these problems didn't stop me from enjoying the game.  Also the game doesn't prevent you from saving at any time you like and you can have as many saves as you wish so you can always just save, experiment with choices and then reload as necessary.There's a lot of weapon choices but your armor / clothing choices were limited so being able customize your character's appearance was likewise limited more than that I would have liked.  (I guess Skyrim has me really spoiled with all the options I got used to there.)   If you have the Adventurer's Garb, which I did, I wore it for much of the game.One other criticism I would have is that once you finish the main story line the game ends, there's no option to continue in a sandbox mode as you can with other games such as Skyrim.  There is a lot to explore and with such an engaging main story line its easy to miss stuff.  But I don't necessarily want to start a new game or go back to one of my many older save points just to finish exploring a richly detailed game world.  So the lack of a sandbox mode after finishing the main story line would have been a plus in my book.Lastly, if the game developers happen to read this I have a small criticism about the game ending.  I don't want to give away any spoilers here so I'm going to be a bit vague.  But, the end cut scene was abrupt and short.  Your hero emerges you briefly see your friends and then it cuts to you sailing away and rolls credits.  As it cuts from seeing your friends to sailing away, that was very abrupt and for a game that had so many well done cut scenes the ending felt a bit anti-climatic and short.  So just wanted to point that out, it could have done with more of a celebration and renunion with your friends and crew at the end after such a big final battle.Overall though I'd very much recommend the game.  All the important aspects of the game worked, nothing felt broken to me or unfinished.  I had a lot of fun exploring the world the game presents, getting to know the NPCs, forming alliances and making enemies.  Some of the sarcastic dialog was just FUN, it was nice to play a game where you really could tell an NPC, ""Hey, you know you're a moron, right?""  LOL "

												So, here it is. The finale for Risen series. At least I hope it is, although the game explains nothing and again the plot feels like a huge anime show filler the main character slashes unimportant♥♥♥♥♥♥and sub-plot has no real impact on the core story.Incipiam.The Risen 3 once again throws us onto the infamous southern seas full of small islands and boring, uninspired pirates of the caribbean theme. I can rightfuly feel cheated (again) by the developer, who promised to dump the failure Risen 2 was and go back to Risen 1 alike tone and released only selected set of screenshots and information during the development time.You start the game on the Crap Coast, fighting poor♥♥♥♥♥attempt of hitting towards their braindead fanboy scene with scavengers who also loved Risen 2 (because of the stamp PIRANHA BYTES GAME printed on a box - or they genuinely enjoyed it, but this review is not about scat fetish, it's about Risen 3). I mean - oh God, do they really think they managed to create a good pirate theme in Risen 2 and decided to base the whole game around it once more? I'm convinced that the developers live in some kind of green-house, protected from any word of critique, letting themselves to hear only braindead applause Risen 2 received from PB-logo's mental slaves.So, we're now a different person, a brother to Patty. A wierd decision if you ask me, because he doesn't feel different at all from the previous ""nameless"" hero (whom we actually meet in the game, with levitating rum bottle floating above his hand). All right - I guess, because I could play a rock named Tom and I wouldn't feel any difference and the plot wouldn't suffer at all: the main character just grunts, speaks some kind of broken germenglish and the voice actor seems to be jagged (you can actually hear it!), and he mostly says ""everything will be all right"", ""I will do it"", ""give me more money"". Ok, back to the game. The Crap Coast is a training level, where we die and our soul is stolen. Patty cries, buries us and then Bones from the previous game appears out from nowhere and revives us. After leaving the Coast the game gives us few main goals: you need to reclaim your soul, you need to form an alliance to defeat the deus ex machina which is the ghost of Crow. Why is he back and haunts the seas? Duh - TO HUNT YOU! Why? Ummm, I don't know and it's never explained beyond that. It actually is a contradiction, because later it's explained that everything we do helps Necroloth and was planned by him. Why did he send Crow to hunt us? Ummmm... Talk about Star Wars I-III plot nonsense that tries to look good. The whole plot feels like wrote by an 8 years old fan of PB's games. The Crow subplot would actually make sense if he appeared after the plot twist, but he's actually the second most important cause of our actions to form a fleet. The third one is to join the faction which will help you to reclaim your soul and gives a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of quests. I've to admit that doing quests in the early stage of the game was fun, as most of them were reminiscent to Gothic's stage of choosing your faction. Also because the new game areas, like Calador and Taranis are actually well designed and are open for exploration. You can actually jump on some roofs to discover some powerful stuff early in the game. You're not too limited by the game and you can actually choose what do you want to do now. To level up in the faction, make and alliance, destroy the shadow portals, or just do minor nonsense. It's a huge step forward from Risen 2, but it's not a big achievement (I don't really believe it is possible to make a worse game than Risen 2 was). Unfortunately they reused some islands and they are as bad as they were previously. Antigua is laughable and Tacarigua is a boring set of corridors with some bonus chests you can't miss.Then you perform an unsuccessful ritual in order to reclaim your soul, you defeat Crow and arrive to the SKULL ISLAND. You kill some minor trash mobs, free three main mages and the game ends with one of the most disappointing, rushed, not thought through, cheesy endings I've ever seen, including the shoot-2-bullets-to-win Mara fight. I mean - what the ♥♥♥♥ happened there? The series plot is excactly where it was at the ending of Risen 1! Another titan/titan lord (apparently Necroloth is a Titan Lord AND a Titan at once, which doesn't make sense and contradicts the previous games) is defeated, everyone cheers up and they set sail to the open sea... Watch credits and go ♥♥♥♥ yourself, you just finished a boring filler which is apparently a clue of the whole series. Disappointing, because I really hoped for jumping out from the♥♥♥♥♥♥hole Risen 2 dug plot-wise.Gameplay-wise it's a Risen 2 as it should be in the first place. The combat works, character development doesn't feel like a shoveled down gimmick that does nothing at all but brakes the whole game. The skills are thought through and work, but they're still the same broken fundamentals of Risen 2 gameplay concept which is just not fun and boring. Firstly, the game is incredibely easy. Like - super easy no matter which path you take. Muskets were overpowered in Risen 2 and instead of reworking the whole system, they decided to overpower everything. Melee combat is predictable and it's easy to kite enemies, you can actually defeat EVERY type of monster in the VERY BEGINNING (after the tutorial). Imagine my astonishment when I actually defeated some golems with a basic swords, and then mauled down a shadow guardian (which is a reskinned dead guardian from Risen 2) right in Calador. You will meet only two stronger enemies, some kind of flying lizard and an undead beast, but the feeling of character progress is absolutely non-existant. You will see everything the game has to offer in the first 2 hours of the gameplay time. After you master melee fighting/demon hunters' spells/whatever you will just be able to do more mistakes (letting enemies hit you) and you will kill enemies with one or two swings less. Every single enemy has exactly the same set of moves - if they have actually different ones, I didn't see it, because fighting with a big rat feels exactly the same as fighting a shadow beast, only requires few swings more/less. You can beat the whole game not using any potions or spells, actually. I never used demon hunters' overpowered spells and summons besides the Morgoloth fight (the ONLY enjoyable fight that required spells and curses and actual tricky kiting of endless enemy spawn). I crafted the best sword in the game mid-game and 1-2 hit everything. I never used buff potions but a rum for healing. I never learned any other crafting schools as the blue-prints I found weren't simply worth it.I can actually see the character system working and worthwile, but not in the game that shows you everything it has in the first hours lets you beat it all with finger up your ♥♥♥♥♥♥.What else? Game boasts with HUNDREDS of quests, but let's make things straight. There's 100 quests at max and I wouldn't be surprised if there were less. If you take a quest ""follow person X to point Y"" and split it to 7 (SEVEN) separate quests it doesn't mean you deliver 7 more quests. It's still 1 quest that takes 1 minute to ""accomplish"" - it's only cut into smaller pieces. I think the developer really wanted to ""shine"" but the ""hundreds quests"" talk is a fraud. I mentioned laughable hitting towards their braindead fanbase. There's more than scavangers. They actually copy-pasted Moe the bouncer that wants all your money before you enter a tavern and Kyle, the guy from Gothic 1 which had a hut that everyone walked through. It's miserable and shows that developers are aware that they can never make nothing new and good at the same time: they're slaves of ""those guys who made Gothic"" and will never achieve more. CUT OFF MORE COUPONS, LET'S THROW SOME ""NOSTALGIA"" CRAP! Don't make more games, please.			"

												I love the graphics, the storyline, the sheer amount of content in this game, as well as the fighting style. It reminds me a lot of Skyrim, but with pirates! Also, having played Risen the original, this one is so much better in terms of being able to obtain equipment and being able to keep up with the strength levels of all mobs. Great game overall and refreshingly different type of storyline and creatures for a fantasy RPG. Also, the dialogue options are so entertaining!			"

												The Combat is sadly still like Risen 2's and not as good as the first Risen's, wich had the best combat of PB's games, Gothic series included.Though it seems that PB doesn't even WANT you to use melee combat since every class gets the option to use powerful magic that is superior to melee in every conceivable way.Like Risen 2, I ended up not hating this game simply through picking the most fun class/playstyle there was (back then it was the gunslinger, this time its the mage.) Though as I said, every class can do everything, which sadly means your decision of who to join in the first half of the game is just fluff, especially when you take into consideration that even the few spells that only a certain faction teaches are still abundantly available as scrolls. This also means that the game doesn't lend itself well to multiple playthroughs.Now, all that sounds pretty negative, but everything else here is at least solid. I liked most of the quests and NPCs, the dialogue and interactions are fun, the magic is satisfying to use (though that is partially by virtue of being overpowered) and the presentation, while not amazing, still works in creating distinct and cool looking environments.All in all, while I still cant wholeheartedly recommend this game to people that are - understandably- still sour about Risen 2, its a step in the right direction and I want to see where PB takes the series.

												I just finished Risen 3 - Titan Lords for the second time, so I feel comfortable writing a review.Risen 3 is a vast improvement over Risen 2, although I did like Risen 2 myself as well, but what can I say, I've loved PB's games ever since Gothic 2. While I do admit Risen series has been a lot worse than the original Gothic trilogy, they are still great games in their own sense. At first Risen 3 feels more like an expansion of Risen 2. Lots of assets have been recycled and even a few areas have been brought over from Risen 2. Luckily, however, that feeling vanishes pretty fast when you notice that the recycled areas aren't really that important and all the main areas are brand new, and then you notice how much better Risen 3 does everything. So it ends up feeling like Risen 2 but only less♥♥♥♥♥♥ Risen 3 is a lot bigger than Risen 2, and more refined in almost every aspect. The combat is great, the exploration is awesome and the world is actually open this time around.It isn't without its problems however. My biggest problem with the game is that it is WAY -WAY- ---WWWAAAAYY--- too easy! It's alright in the beginning if you play without a companion, but it becomes faceroll in the end. Even on hard. On my second playthrough as a voodoo pirate, I managed to max out all my stats. All 8 stats! Maxed! Why is this even possible?So the balance is ♥♥♥♥ed. It doesn't ruin the game, but it takes away all the tension from the last quarter of the game. Possibly even earlier if you use companions, or something else than melee. In order to get a satisfying challenge out of the game, you pretty much have to shoot yourself in the foot, by not using alchemy or companions. Alchemy is probably the biggest criminal here. It is so ridiculously overpowered it's insane.Economy balance however, is amazingly well made. There's never enough money if you really want to get the most out of skills. If you're fine with a few skills here and there, you might end up with some extra pocket change, but that wasn't the case for me. The moment I got 10k money, I used them right away, and there were so much more I wanted.Graphically there's a lot to say as well. The graphics are all over the place. The game looks dated and runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I got it running on reasonable fps only after tweaking a lot of the ConfigDefault.xml file. The level design which PB has always been amazing at, is also bit of a let down. Some places are extremely gorgeous, but some places are hideous. There's also a few narrow canyon paths too many for my taste.The story is.... Well... The story is. It just is. It exists, but isn't important on any level. I have never cared much about PB's storylines, but I've always loved the world, and the history of it. And here it's interesting enough to keep exploring. But the storyline itself is completely irrelevant and forgettable. Combine that with a pointless ending and that's it. But it isn't the meat of the game anyway so who cares?Some of you guys played the DLCs of Risen 2? Remember how♥♥♥♥♥♥they were? Well, the DLC of Risen 3 was a massive positive surprise to me, because both Fog Island and Uprising of the Little Guys are awesome. I enjoyed both of them thoroughly. So those are recommended if you don't have them. Nothing to say about Adventure Garb. It's a pile of gear that I don't use because it's too good for the beginning of the game. As if the game wasn't easy enough.So all in all, it's better than Risen 2, but the difficulty holds it down. I loved it. If you're a PB fan, chances are you'll love it too. If you're not a PB fan however, you probably won't like it. I hate to see people bashing the game when they've never liked PBs games. Why do you expect this one to change your mind? The ""mistakes"" people claim PB makes, are all things that have always been around, and if they were magically fixed, I doubt it would be the same thing anymore. Which would make the old fans disappointed. Even moreso than they already are.So yeah. I love it.Sinathor out.			"

												I want to say to anyone who likes rpg's like skyrim and The Witcher, or Dragon Age/Mass Effect... Do not be fooled, this game is a waste of your time, money, and life force. It will pull you in because you spent the money, only to make you depressed and searching the forums for refund policies. Do yourself a favor and just say no. Wait for the next game that's actually good. Please listen to me. You will not like this game, don't make the same mistakes I did. I want my $49 back, but it's gone, and with it my pride for making such a poor game purchase Decision. TRUST ME I WOULDNT TELL YOU IF IT WERENT TRUE. I've been playing games for 20 yrs, it's okay. Pass this one up.			"

												I have never played an RPG with worse combat. What were they thinking!!Even on sale for $5 I feel ripped off. I am not willing to expend my time learning a broken system. It's not too much to expect workable combat mechanics from the beginning of a game. Apparently the combat gets ridiculously easy as you level up. But that's just the opposite of what you want in a game. You want an easy beginning to introduce you to the game with rewarding difficult combat as you progress. This system is a fail in my book. Also the game world and story so far are not particularly interesting. Not enough at any rate for me to be able to recommend this game.			"

												By far the worst part of the series.The story is basic, the combat system feels akward and based on luck, there are a lot of bugs and the game overfloates you with side quests.But the worst part are the boss fights. I have never seen such bad boss fights. They are quite unfair (depends a little bit on your equipment), but have still nothing to do with skill. The bosses just spawn infinite little enemies, which are more than just annoying. But if you manage to get through those enemies and hit the boss enough times to get him low, he heals himself. Quite common in RPGs right? But not infinite times! That´s why the bosses often take up to 30 minutes and more and if you have no burst you have no chance at all. Also the bosses have the same attacks like normal enemies so they are uncreative as ♥♥♥♥ as well.  "

												first of all I think this game is great, it looks great, in terms of visually it is very polished, i havent seen any flashing textures even far in the distance like you do in skyrim, colors are vibrant, and nothing looks out of place the art style is attractive.i dont know why alot of people are complaining about combat, sure its not the best combat system ever created, but its not boring and hopefully it will get some tweaking, think the witcher 2 when it first came out. the voice acting is great, only very rarely do i think that the script detracts from immersion, I did have some trouble with the game at launch, the game would not save, so i had to restart it like 10 times before i finnally figured out how to fix it, add me as a friend if u have this same trouble and i will tel u how to fix it. but olther than that, the world is vast, offering many choices of where to start your journey once u pass the first chapter, YES this game does take a while before you start to feeel even a little powerful, to get magic and abilities takes a while, but that is all in good fun, lets u explore first and doesnt hand you victory very easily. there is as plethora of people to talk to that can teach you different things, and they are located everywhere, not in just one place like in most rpgs. tho the important combat stuff is mostly close by the faction you choose. This game is not a rushed cheap experience like many think. I think this is the best effort of this franchise and while i havent come close to finishing it, I am having fun and not regretting the money spent.			"

												Just finished the game, I had good time palying it, especially the first 3 chapters, but after that the game felt super easy and got a bit boring, maybe because I did a lot of grinding and tonnes of sidequests, other than that, the game is really good and fun, especially if you are a Gothic fan, it has its downsides though, and sometimes it can be frustrating.Good:True open world (just like Gothic series, the world is completely open, no restrictions and other kind of tricks).Beautifully crafted levels.A lot of sidequests (even though some of them are pointless).Good graphics (some scenes are really beautiful).The world feels alive.Monster models are cool, I really liked it.Player is free to choose its path (can choose to be evil, or good).Voice acting is good (in my opinion).Swords, guns, bows & crossbows, magic... its a mix of everything.NPCs are nice and funny.Gothic feel is there but its still not Gothic :(Neutral:Story isn't the greatest (its completely personal though).A lot of swearing when NPCs talk (it got boring after a while hearing all the f**ks & craps. Gothic had done it right without all the crap talk).Negative:The game gets easy once you master a fighting skill.There aren't a lot of enemy varieties.Loot items are just meh.Stealth isn't as good as in Gothic, guards and NPCs won't beat the hell out of you when you sneak in front of them.Weapon/armor variety is very limited.Optimization isn't the greatest.No SLI support (that's optional though, there aren't a lot of people who runs 2 graphics cards).Overall game felt too easy after chapter 3.I think Risen 3 is a good RPG in its own category, it isn't the greatest game but it isn't bad either.It was worth my time and money, so I'm giving thumbs up.

												Risen 3 is a wonderful RPG that expands so well on what made the Gothic series so great.Lots to explore, lots to do, multiple factions to side with and magic's back, baby!Piranha Bytes continue to make that special kind of RPG that just wins me over every time. I love that it's not some cookie-cutter generic series; I love that there's so much to do in the world; I love the combat, the magic, the quests and the crafting.I suppose that these games are either ""love it"" or ""hate it"" games--you either ""get"" them or, well, you don't.

												Risen 3 marks off the end of an era in the Risen-series. As far as I'm aware, there won't be another one. However, that doesn't matter since this final game finishes the series close to perfectly. From the first moment of playing Risen to this last moment of Risen 3, the series has made me replay the games several times, that's how good they are. There are a few noticeable differences between Risen 3 and Risen/Risen 2, apart from improved graphics of coure. In Risen 3, the combat is slightly different, as many people before me has noticed aswell. While the combat in itself is very cool and not very hard, your character is pretty weak and your NPC companion has to help you quite a bit. At least in the beginning. In Risen 3, you don't play as the character from the previous games. You play as Patty's brother, who I hadn't heard about before playing Risen 3. But that doesn't matter too much since you get to know him during the game and there's a little surprise somewhere in the game if you've played the other games...I highly recommend playing this game if you've played the former Risen games first, if you haven't. you risk losing out on a lot of the precious story. The combat gets better and better the more you play and it's the kind of game you just want to keep playing, even after finishing it. Even more so since there are different factions that you can join, changing the gameplay for every playthrough (to a certain point).			"

												*NEW REVIEW UP-New Review after 20+ hours in the game-I'm going to write this review from a Gothica/Risen fans PoV. You will have to understand PB games to appreciate this game. it is a niche game for players who like hard combat Action RPG's like Dark Souls.-For returning players from the Gothica/Risen universe, PB made a solid game in Risen 3. The engine is a more efficient less buggy redo of Risen 2, so the graphics and physics are techinaly the same but have now been recoded for less bugs, locked high frame rates, and less stress on your hardware. So if you're looking for a new top of the lin graphics engine on par with a PS4 game don't expect much. The Game was released on 360/ps3/WinPC, so it's made for last gens hardware.   You play a new hero, you are not the nameless figure from Risen 1 and 2, but instead you are one of the sons of Captain Steelbeard, your sister is Patty and you start off the game together.==FOR NEW PLAYERS==Pirahna Bytes, aka PB, is known for making EXTREMELY STORY driven RPG's with DIFFICULT COMBAT mechanics. Not combat thats clunky, but combat that reflects starting off as a new character, as you gain skills in combat training you will notice the improvement and growth of your character. If you're new to this kind of game, then the start of the game (first 4 hours) will be a pain in the butt for you. But you will feel your character grow and get a real sense of accomplishment as you gain more skills and stats. It's one of the staples of PB games and it makes it a very niche genre not unlike Dark Souls is a niche genre. I highly suggest purchasing Risen 1 since it's dirt cheap and has no DLC to get a feel for PB games. if this is your first PB game and you don't like the game style you will feel ripped off, but I don't feel ripped off, I love it.==COMBAT==Combat will be more in line with Risen 1, then in Risen 2. More emphasis on dodging, and reading opponents ques, understanding when they combo attacks and when what they do when you dodge, moving in combat to avoid getting ganged up on, and choosing when to attack is key. Unlike Risen 2 you will not be able to move from Parry to Attack seamlessly, lending a step of difficulty more in line with traditional PB games. Which for PB fans is great, Risen 2 had hard reviews from PB veterans for making the game more cupcake and less hardcore. So Risen 3 is a step in the right direction.==CRAFTING==Unlike Risen 1 and 2, weapon crafting actually has a USE in this game. A new feature is that you take some of the misc items and combine them with weapons to make a better weapon (Thrusting sword + 2 silver plates+6 iron ore) gets you a Disked Epee, with better stats of couse, it is very money effecient. This is also in line with Guns, Muskets, and all melee weapons, even with the unqiue weapons that require difficult to find parts can be upgraded with lots of rare mats to make superior verions or to change it's damage type. Example the Crest Wave SLASHING sword 55-85 Damage +10 Slashing can be changed to the ""Lightning"" 55-85 Piercing +10 Piercing *and it has electric particle skin and can partialy pierces blocks*Potion crafting is back along with the rare + perm stat potions made from the perm stat ingredients, The raw ingredients give +2, the potions give +5More emphasis on temp buff potions is used since there are more skills to allocate your Glory(XP) too. So expect to use buff potions often to surpass early Lockpicks, Persuade, and Pickpocket checks==GAME LENGTH==24.5 Hours into the game at the time of this review, i am still in chapter 2, I have 4 islands explored,  2 islands un explored, and just started my 5th island. Like a good book, PB games tend to have 3 acts, I have not chosen one of the 3 factions available yet, and don't expect too until I'm near the end of chapter 2. I have only encountered 2 of the main factions so far. The games factions are the Guardians/Mages from Risen 1, the Voodoo Pirates from Risen 2, and the new faction are the Demon Hunters. You will spend hours revisting islands to find more quests, NPC's, loot, buried treasures, and open hidden passages. These do not feel like tacked on back tracking to add game time thank goodness, but honest progression, both in character development and story. I expect to drop 40-55 hours on the campaign easily.==OVER ALL IMPRESSION SCORE==Using 10/10 as a base line for Risen 1Gothica 3 beng 9/10and 6/10 as a Baseline for Risen 2and 4/10 as Gothic 4: Arcaniaand 1/10 being Daikatana or Superman 64I give Risen 3 a 8.5/10Graphics 7/10The graphics are last gen but RECENT last gen, so they are smooth FPS on Max graphics and are plenty pretty, PB games aren't known for shiny, they are known for superb story and gameplay.Combat 9/10Not as varied or complex as Risen 1, it is much better then Risen 2, you can still feel your character grow, and get that sense of accomplishment. PB vets/fans should play on HARD. Pb did a great job getting back to it's roots.Story 10/10 Well written and capable of being a book, deep and lengthy but not stale, and a continuation from Risen 1 and 2. It's fantastic, a game with great plot, it is perfect for the Single Player western RPG fans who miss plot.Is this game worthy of the PB saga? Yes it is, it is a redeeming light for PB since the goofs of Gothica 4 and Risen 2. A great sign that they are getting back in touch with what made them our favorites. I would compare Risen 3 with Deus Ex 3 in terms of taking a step in the proper direction to it's roots.Is the game worth the 49.99 USD price tag? YES, most new games cost 59.99 USD, some Early Access games cost as much as 125 USD and are utter crap. 10 dollars cheaper the most AAA games and a positive growth in game style for PB fans makes this a steal!PB vets should buy Risen 3 if you are on the ropes.NEW PB PLAYERS should buy Risen 1 or Gothica 1,2 or 3 to see if this is the game style you;d enjoy. Feel free to read my review for Risen 1 to see what I mean.*DAY 1 OLD REVIEW*Finished my third island. taking I'm taking a break to write a short early impression. I like the game so far, the combat early on was dissapointing but it picked up soon. i restarted a new game and made the entire first level without getting hit onceIt's closer to risen 1 in combat then risen 2. Main difference, you can't go from Parry to attack, and you use dodging a lotOnly found one bug and it's in quest text, there in Antigua, you'll have to find a bag of clothes and it says it's on the FIRST floor, it's actually on the 2nd floor, use a parrot flight to get thereI am dissapointed that damage types aren't damage styles, now all weapons swing like slashing weapons, makes the fencer in me sad i play on hard difficulty, the game is still fairly easy, about on par with risen 2. the soft 50 fps lock is nice. It's superior to risen 2 in story, size and gameplay, i need to play more to compare it to risen 1. if i had to review score it based on the first 4 hours. 8/10 but I'm not into the meat of the story line yetPatty broke my heart, they got rid of her curly long black hair, and I'm her god damn brotherI wanted to continue as the nameless hero and finaly get her in the damn sack!It's a solid game, and worth the 49.99 USD, which need i remind people is not the usual 59.99 of most games. If you played both Risens and liked risen 1 better, you'll like this game. not as much as 1 but more then 2. I think it was worth the purchaseOn to Fog Island next to get the 10% Glory special item			"

												Risen 3: Titan Lords is a solid RPG with awesome (but cheesy) dialogues, pretty nice story and large world that rewards exploration.Every other system in the game is somewhat basic:- Leveling? Yep, just put your XP into your stats.- Combat? Yep, just 3 buttons - evade, attack and block. You can do riposte by blocking at right time and you can do heavy strikes by holding attack, but that about it. Oh, yeah, there are spells that make combat a bit more enjoyable, but you get them only after ~10h into the game.- Crafting? Yep, just gather mats and click ""craft"" to get the item, no random stats or minigames.- Lockpicking? Yep, no fail state though. Just a lot of annoyance with complex locks >_>- Naval battles? Yep, but so arcadey that you can actually tell the ship to go forward...- Other mini-games? Yep, drink game, knife throwing game, arm wrestling game, etc. All come down to either using one button, or just QTE stuff.All of those are VERY basic, but not bad. They can vary gameplay a bit from time to time, but get boring pretty quick.If you are looking for fat loots - you won't find them in this game. Items are pretty limited, but getting a new one almost always feels like a large upgrade. No random stats either. (think Witcher 2 style of itemisation)If you still want to be a pirate and good storyline and quests is what you are searching for - then Risen 3 will deliver in full.All dialogues are nicely voices, there's tons of quests to do and places to explore. Quests often has several ways to complete them and some of them are pretty amusing. Once again - all of that is pretty cheesy. So if you don't like cheese or searching for fat loots - this is not the game. If you want RPG, dialogues and exploration - this is the game, and quite good one.More in depth look on the UI, mechanics and other things in the lengthy video:

Overall just a fun enjoyable experience.Good and Bad compared to the previous titles:Good:-Fighting System improved, anyone who is still too stupid to play this game should get deported (looking at you, ANGRYJOE)Bad:-Voice Acting got ♥♥♥♥♥ier-Ending suckedEverything else is pretty much the same and if you enjoyed any Risen or Gothic title you definitly enjoy this one. I would rate them as such:1. Gothic 22. Gothic 13.4.5.6. Risen 27. Gothic 3 (I would rate it higher if it wasn't basicly unplayable at release)8. Risen 39. Risen10. Gothic 4			"

												Nice Adventure Game, missed this Genre, if you liked Risen 1+2 and Venetica, you will love Risen 3.  But better buying this Game for a lesser Price, for 50€ its a bit too expensive and not realy worth that much. (if you have to buy the DLC`s too - First Edition or Preorder contains them). 50€ with all DLC`s is okay.Pros:Very long GameplayOpen WorldA lot of QuestsLow loading timeBeautiful PlacesLegendary items/TreasureSkills can be choosenA lot of ""Jobs"" (you can be a witch, voodoo master, work with juwels, or make alcohol)A lot of peoples, animals and enemiesSometimes very funny (gnome)No issues with XBox360 Controller (you have to activate the controller under options)You can save the game when ever you like (autosave enabled)You can choose Game Mode, Easy, Normal, HardContra:Sometimes bad animations or no feelings. Grafik not realy better then Risen 2 (if you care)A few Bugs (Barrel moves from alone)When you fight with other peoples together agains monsters you have to be carefull, because you can hurt your ""friends"" and they try to attack you then, if you die you lose 50 glory, if you won, they stop fighting and are senseless for a little time.  For me this Game gets a 8 of 10 Points. I realy enjoy playing that game and already spend over 20 hourse and still have more then 50% to play.			"

												The best Risen game so far. The beginning on crab coast and Antigua is meh... I even thought of uninstalling it, but after that the game reveal it self in it's full glory.Combat was revised and is best to be played on ultra difficulty. Combat still has it's downsides and glitches, but is still better than in Risen 2 and it gets better with every skill you learn. I was a little dissapointed that they cut out my beloved ""kick"" abillity... Although the story is not that surprising and great it's good enough and is better delivered than in previous games. The dialogues are good and I like it's humor, main protaconist's voice acting is something that you will need to get used to though. And I have to admit that I liked the previous protagonist better.I had fun with it and I find myself playing it again for a different faction in the future.Recommending it!			"

												When I look around the internet, all I see about Risen 3 are bad reviews. Now that I finally got to try it myself, I can say that most of the people's complaints about this title are overstretched by what may be a long lasting hate for the Risen series started from Risen 2, just because it ""wasn't like Gothic"". This game is a product of high level, featuring an interesting storyline with moral choices that affect your gameplay (even though some decisions that should alter your soul just don't), can be played in many different ways (swordsman, mage, ranged to make some examples) and lets you choose between three factions that provide you with spells that give you more options in a fight (even if the more skilled may stick with meelee, because of the riposte). The animations for sprinting and jumping look strangely similar to the ones of Assassin's Creed Black Flag (I could be wrong), but I don't care because they look and feel more realistic than the ones of the previous chapters. My sole complaint is about the Demon Hunters: I know, I know it's lore... but does he really have to shave his head?!			"

												Game is an improvement over Risen 2. Without Making this review overly complicated, I enjoyed the gameplay elements so much, but I do have some nitpicks on it. Positive first, the world to me was very expansive and for the most part you could go multiple ways to reach your destination. Also the skill based system for bonus objectives is spot on what I want in a game. The fluidness of combat and movement has improved so much from what it was in Risen 2. Now for the negative: main characters voice acting I feel was not normal and felt just plain wrong to me. Cutscenes and ending felt thrown in and out of place. The implementation of hunting for additional ingredients, while something I like, doesn't seem fit in without a reliable respawn system for monsters. The implementation of how much glory it takes to raise a skill should be balanced so that it doesn't take into account permanent potion bonuses.7/10*very minor min/max character spoiler below*Only reason I mention the last item under negative is because I like to min/max my characters, but you have to raise your skills in a way where you drink the permanent potions at the end so you spend as little glory as possible leveling skills.

												Patty getting herself a ѕlutty costume should have make me understand there is something wrong with this game. See for yourself — she had more style and dignity even in the first instalment of the series, where no female characters got good 3D models. It is tolerable that the game brings nothing new to game mechanics compared to “Risen 2”, though first one’s and of course “Gothic” I or II’s one would be much better preferred. The bigger problem is that prologue and chapter one take 80% of game time to complete, while the rest of the game offers very little new content. So the problem is the game got open world game’s curse: as I could go anywhere any time, I did, there were no enemies strong enough to stop me, and locations that opened after choosing the factions simply were not large enough, and no new quests were added. Taking “Gothic II” or “Risen” as reference models, the picture there was absolutely different, every new chapter urged you to re-explore the locations, find what happened to NPC, what new problems appeared, how maps changed. Here we have nothing like that, and replay value is negligible, too.			"

												I loved Risen and Risen 2.  What I mostly enjoy in games is the plot and characters and the interactions between them.   In the first two, I loved the ""Hero"" and Patty, and the way it danced around them having a romantic relationship but never really went that far.  When I heard that a Risen 3 was in the works, I was so excited about the possibility of the Hero and Patty officially getting together.  Thus, though I thought the game OK, I was thoroughly disappointed that the Hero wasn't even the main character, and that he and Patty seemed to have come across a rough patch.  I am still hopeful for a Risen 4 that brings the Hero back, along with Patty, and finally a deeper relationship.So overall, yeah, the game was OK, I just couldn't get past that I wasn't the ""Hero"" from the previous games, and I did not enjoy it near as well.  I didn't find this hero, who was Patty's brother, as interesting and likeable.  Though I still enjoy playing Risen and Risen 2 over and over again, I have no desire to play Risen 3 again.  I also thought the foul language was excessive and unnecessary, and I did not like that.  It seems each game the language got worse.  Still holding out hope for a Risen 4 with the original Hero and Patty, and the foul language toned down.			"

												A very qualified upvote -- Though it stands in the shadow of still great Gothic 2, Risen 3 has its moments largely because of the vertical enviroments (islands) which are fun to explore.  The combat is notably poor though and virtually all of the ""thumbs down"" reviews cite  the combat.  You WILL have to forgive the ropey combat in this game or you wont like Risen 3 at all.   The story is sadly generic and there are a ton of f-bombs.  Fair warningLike every PB game ever made, about half way the combat gets too easy because you will be overpowered.  Why PB does this is a mystery to me. Buy If you like action RPG's with lots of cool exploration and poor combat.			"

												A very good roleplay game, maybe the best of Risen series. Fine graphics, but some textures and scenaries are dull and empty, and the world seems populated by a few people with similar faces. Has the wonderfull mechanics of the series, well implemented and with changes in combat system. The maps are slightly small and linears, but worthy. The story it is quite normal, but perfectly finished, without glitches of code or texts: a merit in a game with more than 300 dialogued missions. The game difficultly is low, very easy for veterans of the genre.Hope that developers will continue Gothic-Risen lore in future products, with more resources and means. They deserve.			"

												If you enjoyed the Gothic series, you will enjoy this game. Risen 3 represents the latest incarnation of that long long of role-playing games. If you haven't heard of the Gothic series, or Piranha Bytes, or JoWooD Entertainment, chances are that you will not enjoy Risen 3. By the standards of modern RPGs made by U.S. developers, Risen 3 is archaic. Gameplay can be boiled down to fetch quests and go-there-and-kill-that quests. But when you think about it all RPGs boil down to that. Combat is clunky by modern standards. In fact I knew this already and didn't bother playing combat and cheated, giving myself all requisite skills to avoid the frustration of constant stun-locks and whatnot. Plenty of wise sages before me has described the problems at length. The only remotely interesting aspect is the morality system. Good deeds result in soul gains, resulting in good guy rewards. Bad deeds result in soul losses, resulting in bad guy rewards (which are still rewards, so that's more realistic than most RPGs). Don't expect anything like the Witcher 3.Visually, it looks nice for a 2014 release. Some parts still look stunning, like the forest regions. Just don't expect FarCry. The story's serious parts, much like the serious characters, consist of non-descript, entirely forgettable, and highly generic fantasy tropes. You couldn't get more vanilla if you tried. There's a Dark Lord of course. However, the game is made much more spicier (and racier) by its non-serious parts, thanks in no small part to the fact that the main character is basically a pirate. Or privateer to be more accurate. Finally, you should be aware that Risen 3 is pretty sexist and racist by the standards of modern American politically correct non-triggering entertainment values. For example, I ran into two quests where the awards were sex with women, without even trying (incidentally if you're trying to be a good guy -- just remember that obvious harlots cannot be trusted!), and the only female crewmember is my hot sister strutting about in her tights and lovely bust. She is generally useless, except that she's very good at acquiring the locations of treasure by ""being nice"" to ornery old pirates. What is not useless is my gnome companion, Jaffar, who likes to steal gold and loots my defeated enemies. We also have an IQ differential that is comparable to our height differential. Jaffar is a good chap though, speaks with a strange accent and talks about his gnome buddies, named Kasim and Ali. Besides the gnomes, you also meet Voodoo natives who I swear are from Africa, with the spiritualism of Native Americans (as interpreted by modern old-worlders), but I'm surely mistaken. In any case, all of these things put together have caused many butt-hurt game reviewers to complain that the game is racist and sexist. Funny as hell though.By the way I applaud Patty's pants because they're low-rise.			"

												No lie, I bought this game like 3 months ago, but got a refund once I played it for 4mins the first time. This time I told myself to try it, and yes, I played it for 45+ mins plus. The game is very enjoyable and difficult at the same time (I played it on max difficult).  There is a ton of things to be done, and if you’re like me, you try to complete everything that’s on the map. The combat is very good, it’s like The Witcher, in some way. The dialoged could be little clumsy and times, and the graphics look corny at points, but if u can get past all that, it’s a game worth playing. "

												Even though I'm a huge Pyranha Bytes fanboy and I can forgive them a lot....I just can't recommend this game. Gothic 1, Gothic 2, Gothic 3 and Risen 1 are all absolutely amazing games and I recommend wholeheartedly every one of them. I can even recommend Risen 2 even though it's nowhere near as good as the previous games. But Risen 3 is just too a blatant attempt to extract some more money from the Risen 2 engine and assets without too much effort.This game still retains some of PB's trademark systems and there IS some enjoyment to be found if you look hard enough. On the other hand it just exudes an uninterested, glassy, dreary atmosphere. The story is a complete joke, the writing lacks the spark and wit of Risen 2, NPCs are vapid and long winded, quests are boring, character models and entire areas are cynically rehashed and reused and the combat, the greatest strength of PB games, isn't very satisfying either. There's way too much of it and it stops being challenging or interesting very quickly, especially if you go for the mage build. You're just blasting hordes of trash mobs again and again into oblivion. Sometimes it feels like a 3rd person Diablo which is the complete opposite of what PB games traditionaly strived for.Many fans claimed Risen 2 marked the end of true Pyranha Bytes but Risen 2, even though a significant decline, is still worth playing. Risen 3 is not. It's cynical, disinterested, boring and routine rehash of Risen 2, nothing more.			"

												Basically It boils down to this. A good role playing game rewards fastidious exploration. The Risen franchise is no exception.The more you explore the more loot you get, the more loot you get, the more money you get, the more money you get, the more skills/items/equipment you get. To me, this is the attraction of the Risen franchise. Exploration=reward, pure and simple. This is a very important element in any pure single player RPG. This particular element is handled well in the  Risen series of games. However the Risen franchise is still struggling to find a solid identity. The first Risen was very ambiguous, the second chapter, the developers, despite giving the franchise a more polished pirate themed aspect,  were still experimenting with the combat system. This 3rd chapter is wonderful to the hardcore RPG'er, the pirate element still remains but the combat remains slightly clunky and experimental if you will.  However, the exploration vs. reward idea remains solid in all 3 games. Risen 3 is a more finely polished example of where the franchise could go. Exploration and completionism is the key in the Risen franchise. However to be perfect the Risen franchise could do well with a lot more polishing.  Some examples being, keep working on the combat system, the combat system in Risen, being the core of the game still feels slighty clunky. I figured out the obvious pattern in the combat system early on. And there is a definite pattern still. This pattern in the obvious timed moves still hinders the combat system from feeling fluid and natural. If you attack at the wrong time, you get hit, if you attack at the right time you strike. There is no fluid inbetween. The combat feels ""timed"" more so than natural. Another aspect the developers could benefit from working on.  Make the skill earning system more complex. The skill system in this game is OKAY but not perfect. It still feels slightly limited. You spend cash on new skills, and you add power points to existing skills to ""level them up"". However there is no complex skill tree per se. You don't get to master a whole entire set of skills in any one combat style. This all lends to a slightly limited combat system. You can get BETTER at guns...but all you'll notice if you do so is that you do more damage with ranged weapons. To be blunt, the leveling/skill system needs a serious overhaul to feel more rewarding. Also very importan to the hardcore RPG'er is, reward all the hard work put into the game with a beautiful well thought out ending. I notice the Risen titles in this franchise have lackluster endings. I realize the games themselves tell a story. But a moving, rewarding ending for a role playing game like this, where hard work and exploration should lend to the game's ending  is needed to complete the immersion process. I hope they continue this franchise, and fine tune the understandable flaws until they release a game that surpasses all other RPGS.In short, this RPG does exemplary on the exploration verses reward aspect. The more you explore, the more you benefit. However this franchise still continues to fall short on the combat system, skill system and endings for the games. This game will tickle the fancy of any die-hard fan of single player RPGs, but there is still a ways to go if the developers want to perfect this franchise.			"

												I wanted to like this. Risen 3 is clearly a bigger, more ambitious, and more polished product than its predecessors, which always felt like they wanted to be bigger than they were. The combat is slightly less clunky than before, but still recognizably the traditional Piranha Bytes plodding, stunlock-loving style that I would inevitably toggle God Mode to avoid eventually.The fact that I can't actually do that this time without 3rd party programs is a factor in my negative review.Honestly, the killer problem with this game, the one bad enough to make it the first of these games since Gothic for me to abandon outright a few hours in, is that it's just horribly balanced. I don't mean ""unfair"" - Piranha Bytes games are always unfair. But normally they're a consistant level of unfair that simply presents a steep learning curve, like a poor man's Dark Souls.Risen 3, meanwhile, is just plain inconsistent. You can be playing along, managing to more-or-less stay on top and not meeting the traditional fate of being stunlocked to death by a passing ostrich, when you'll wander into an unremarkable-sounding quest and be killed in three shots by some complete nobody that the game in no way warns you is fully capable of handing you your♥♥♥♥♥on a platter. And with no way to cheat my way around it this time around so I can enjoy the parts of the game that aren't awful, I simply don't have the patience to roll the dice every single time I fight a new enemy and hope that they just haven't arbitrarily decided to make this nondescript monster deal five times as much damage as everyone around him.I suppose it's worth noting that this inconsistency is foreshadowed somewhat by the story, which is by far the least concrete of the series. After a kind of rushed-feeling tutorial level, you're thrown into the wide open world with what the previous games would've called late first-act gear and a vague mission to do something about your missing spirit. I didn't like the way Risen 2 bottlenecked you for the first third/half of the game by locking you onto a single story path, but at least it gave me time to understand what the hell I was doing and what the stakes were. Risen 3 by comparison legitimately feels like the entire first act is just missing, and I frequently find myself feeling like I'm showing up to certain areas prematurely as random plot points are discussed as if I should have been told about them beforehand somewhere else.Between that and the random difficulty curve, I'm not sure the game was designed to be as open-ended as it is, and ultimately it just winds up feeling like a mess. I know it's not Piranha Bytes' style, but this is probably one game that could have benefitted from the traditional RPG approach of having character and quest levels to guide the player along. The intent was to make a game that doesn't hold the player's hand, and I can applaud that, but I don't have the patience with a game that not only doesn't tell me what to do, but then kicks me in the gut whenever I fail to read its mind about what it expects me to do. ""Open-ended challenge"" isn't the same thing as ""be psychic or die.""			"

Fighting? well... a one button system is not too fun reminds me of Fable 3 but better. Fable 3 ""Thumbs down"", but Risen 3 seems to make it work ""thanks for the magic back btw PB!!"". Like others have said it is a timing and skill combat type. You died so your weak and have to slowly earn your way up. Still I know PB could have taken this to the next level if they would have spent the extra time. Seems like a copy paste of the older Risen games. The rest of the sound and music to me seem to be in sync. Again joining one faction at a time wasn't cool but I feel they did it more for a replay effect more than anything ""even though the story gives it some weight"". It is a solid game for what they did, and the combat is a bi@!h at first but rewarding as you start to feel the flow. Loot Loot Loot is awesome. Gold is a little rare but I hoard my booty so that could just be me. I give Risen 3 Titan Lords a solid 7/10. It is worth the ride but not worth the relese price of 49.99.  If you liked the old Risen games a must buy, shoot even if your a hardcore RPG fan it's worth the ride. Pick it up on a sale I feel in the end you will like it. GAME ON!!!			"

												If you're a fan of the Risen games, this iteration won't dissappoint.  The character levelling/RPG elements are unique and as entertaining as always.  The writing and voice acting are extremely rough.  If you're a fan of exploration, there are hundreds of secret nooks and crannies if you're willing to spend the time to look around.  Unlike the previous games, the melee combat in this one is actually enjoyable.The game does one particularly interesting thing - it opens up pretty much the entire world to you immediately, and the enemies do not scale with your level.  This has advantages and disadvantages.  The beginning of the game is quite hard, but as your character develops, you really feel yourself becoming powerful.  It's very satisfying.  However, by the end of the game, you feel like an unstoppable god and just plow through the same enemies that you've been fighting for the last 30 hours.			"

												Honestly, it's not what I expected when I first played through the game. I was looking forward to a more challenging Gothic-esque follow up. The game is way too easy for a ""Gothic"" game. No real challenge, all you need is your trusty fireball spam and you are good to go.Overall the story is not that great and engaging as the one Gothic 1 or 2 was. Characters are plain and have not much depth to them. In Gothic even a simple guard was more interesting than a named NPC is in Risen 3. Simply put, there is not enough character development going on in Risen 3. (For example Milten the mage from the old camp becomes a close friend later on in the story of Gothic, turns out to be one of the closest helpers of the Nameless hero and in the end helps restore the blade Uriziel. Something like this was missing from Risen 3.)The game is fun overall after the first playthrough, but after that, it becomes bland and not that interesting at all. Maybe it is, because it is so simple or it's just me who expected it to be even more challenging than the original Gothic 1 and 2.Overall, if you are a new generaion player and want to try a ""Gothic"" game, Risen 2 and 3 are the games for you. If you are up to the challenge, try Gothic 1 and 2 too. (Even though if you ask for my opinion, neither is Gothic 1 and 2 that hard for new generation players to play it, but whatever...)Piranha Bytes should have focused more on PC players who expect difficult RPGs from them and put less console like tutorials and mechanics in Risen 3. I almost felt like they were holding both of my hands while I was playing. Consoles really ruined this game the most as I see it.The DLCs are a sorry excuse of aditional content. They are by far not that satisfying as one would expect. The 2 islands added have only a few quests and even though you meet some old faces from Risen 1 and 2, they didn't hold my interest for long. 1 hour of gameplay per Island is not worth 10€.Even after all this, I still recommend this game, but you should buy it once there will be a discount, as it is by far not worth 50€. Maybe if they upped the difficulty a bit and added more depth to characters, Risen 3 could have been the game we all waited for so long. (And of course less hand holding and console nonsense.)			"

												Risen 3 is a vast open world rpg with hundreds of quests, the combat is challanging and can be unforgiving at times but is fun. this is not a game for anyone that likes easy games that u can just run through and kill everything without tring, it is maid to be hard to the player and make him work to win in most every fight. plus side you can get followers to come with you if you want from your ships crew.

												5/5Gameplay: + Oriented on Gothic 1&2 and Risen 1+ Same humor as ever+ Very much atmosphere, in terms of quests and the game/level/island design. + I can not! confirm, that the quests are generic or anything like that. Also every character has it's own personality and position in this game, there are only very few unnamed characters with no kind of background in this world. But this does not only to npcs, but to all items and locations aswell, truly handcrafted!+ I love the way magic got implemented in this game! No exhausting mana-potion collection or brewing which I always disliked, but just a cooldown-based system. Some critisize that, I love it and think a lot of games should go that direction!+ I do not find the story boring and do not agree with (most) reviewers.+ I love flying or gliding around like a parrot.- Sometimes there's not enough feedback whether a quest is completed, failed or still pending in status, e.g. before being promoted to a guardian you have to talk to your pirate admiral. He then tells you to kill the undead dogs, swirling around the city. Although this is not hard to accomplish, one may still miss out on some dogs and ask him-/herself, why one can't get promoted. Another example would be the ""di fuego"" related quests.- Sometimes npcs can't follow you and get stuck, however if you wait long enough they will eventually be back at your position (Teleporting and/or going back to your ship or another island helps in this case).Graphics:+ I don't know where to start. All people critizing the graphic of risen 3 can't have played it. + I have rarely seen such beautiful sunsets and sunrises as in this game. Just as an example if one stands a bit away from the council hall or tower in antigua and in front of it, and if it's dawn and you look up in the sky, you see the air glimming inside the council hall, with a warm fire enlightening the whole building and if you look up, you have this dark, star filled sky, which at the very edge slowly fades into a warm pink/purpleish kind of color. There were countless moments like that and I can truly say that I have met no game, where the graphic is that atmospheric, some of the steam-screenshots catch very well how beautiful the game looks!- I mean, yes, sometimes!!! there are very low resolution textures, but most of the time they don't catch the eye.Sound:0 Well, there has been written a lot about this part of the game so I will skip the extensive part and sum up that although I also find that the sound is very atmospheric, there are some downsides. + The german synchronization however is very well!To sum it up: If you liked the Gothic series and Risen 1, buy it. The basis for this game may be a pirate setting and of course it plays in the Risen universe, but it catches the Gothic flair from old times quite well and has some (good) adjustments to it.Also I have not played Risen 2 so I can't say which textures got reused etc.One last comment I want to make is, that most of the negative reviews seem to be from people that have played the game only a few hours and could not immerse themselfs in it, whether it is because their personal taste of a game is different or because they were not patient enough. I also think that this is reflected pretty well in the metacritics score which has a lot of negative reviews, but just as much positive reviews and nothing in between, so this game really splits based on your personal taste.

												At first I was really sceptical when I entered the game and it looked just like Risen 2 but after the first few quests I realized the numerous improvements the devs have made to the game. Some major complaints I had with Risen 2 have been resolved.Gameplay & Story:The standard melee combat system is still not at a level that i can truly say I liked it. Muskets felt really underpowered in this title. But magic is straight up powerful and feels (and looks) pretty nice. I really like that they don't use a mana system in this title but rather cooldowns only. It helps to remove those annoying downtimesI really liked the idea of the parrot spell, where you can just fly around the world for a limited time. A stronger version you can learn would have been great thoughLike in the previous title there are some minigames you can play in most major cities, which is a nice idea although not a time dump like in some other games.The very numerous quests played out nice. The map system has a solid design. The fast travel points are well placed enough to be helpful and still in ""believable"" locations.As in all RPG titles the story plays a major role. The story telling is pretty solid in this title. The story is interesting to the end although nothing too new.For fans of the series there are a lot old acquaintances to meet.The voice acting was pretty solid, although some npcs obviously shared voices. Calling spiders insects all the time drove me nuts though (Yes, I know that in olden times people probably didn't know, but still).In total it took me a good 40-45 hours to play through on a high difficulty and complete all quests I could find, which were quite many as stated before.Looks & Performance:The game looks really pretty for a huge world story driven RPG. There are very few bugs and glitches. The world design is well composed and feels for the most part realisticFinally I really want to praise the optimization levels the devs have gone through. With all options on max my old third gen i5 used all it's cores equally and rarely went above 50% total load. Most of the work was done by my GPU (as it should be)			"

												Nice game, pretty faithful to old Gothic style and lots of pirates and what not.On the plus side, it got a nice environment, varied ways to play, lots of hidden things to find and some interesting characters. For the most part the story is enjoyable and fast paced and the leveling up style make you have to plan ahead. The downside, story can be a little 2D in places. The game is fairly challenging at the beginging, but if you complete all the quests you get pretty over powered by the end and things get a bit repetative - the last island really could have done with a whole new set of monsters. Likewise weapons/equipment could have done with a lot more variation. It's not perfect by any means, but if you enjoy an fun RPG where you wander round exploring it's pretty good.  "

												RISEN/GOTHIC fans will LOVE this game.Quite simply it is the ultimate amalgam of this type of TRUE open world RPG.A fun mix of both adult and light hearted storyline/dialogue/voice acting with lots of bad language thrown in the mix as usual, this game doesn't take itself as seriously as other RPGS and is more fun because of it.Good combat with lots of different styles, sword, piercing, muskets, shotguns, pistols, and many different kinds of combat magic. The best crafting in a RISEN game to date, and also, perhaps my favourite part of the game is the incredible exploration, all sorts of secrets and easter eggs await in some very hard to reach and unusual locations!Highly reccommended to all RPG fans, especially if on a good sale.Just remember ""Treasure you take : Suffer the fate!""

												The ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you people?! This game is great! -The combat is awesome, it requires skill, well timed clicks (non of that button mashing bullcrap), patience and concentration. (atleast early game when you are weak)-The story is interesting. (although the protagonist's voice is rather odd until you get used to it) -Replay value is high since there are 3 factions each with their own spells, abilities and quests.-The game is supposed to be hard in the beginning and easy as you reach the end (see the Gothic series).-I haven't encountered any noticeable bugs.It may not be the best of the series, it may not be the worst, but it certainly isn't a bad game as some portray it to be. If you have doubts get it on sale, but it's well worth the current price in my opinion.			"

												I didn't like Risen, and I skipped Risen 2. Risen 3 came out when no other big games are around, so I picked it up to kill some time. And it turned out to be very enjoyable experience. Very few games give you that feeling of being in the game. Like first Fable, all Mass Effects. And Risen 3. If immersive world is what you like in games — definitely check out this game. And actually it becomes better and better as you play. More skills, magic, more weapons and armor. You really feel that you've become stronger, but battles are still challenging and fun. Everything in this game is really simple and nothing new. But it works well.			"

												Risen 3 is the type of game that will appeal to those who enjoy the solo parts of certain MMOs.The nameless hero is ultra cool and seriously♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that he has lost his soul. The language that spews forth from his mouth is foul but it is also smart and full of confidence and no nonsense attitude. In my opinion the voice acting altogether is  very clear and consise for a pirate themed game. It is sometimes exhausting to listen to the amount of voice work in RIsen 3 though and I found myself skipping it to get to the point of meandering conversations or more prominently when the fixed camera gets stuck behind an object.The orchestral score adds to the cinematic quality of the game, more on that later. Classically epic for a swashbuckling adventure to the pit of a man's soul while slaying undead monsters and feral beasts. Music quality seems muffled underneath the sound effects but reappears at the right moments to genuinely solidify the moments of sentimentality and heroics. The sentimentality that exists between the gamer and this adventure, the game supplies the avenue for the heroics.Sound in general is good. Your going to hear the seagulls high pitched squwack on the beach and  they are there to accidentally interrupt those moments of sentimentality that this experience provides. The sound of the waves and ocean could encapsulate the vivid scenery when the 3d sound would like to work. Chatter from npc's is repetitive.The views displayed during gameplay are heavy hitters for sure. If you like the bloom, then keep it on, but by default it is a bit too much. I am not sure if the landscape design and environmental effects are purposely directed to the player's best field of view but you can rotate the camera enough to see the brilliance. Which is nice, the game is not over trying to establish itself as an over-achiever with AAA graphics, but what is there is decidedly cool looking. Player models do their justice and close inspection of monsters shows surprisingly deep design. I feel the land design, including craggy landscapes and beautiful beach vistas are only eclipsed by the feeling of traversing over them and losing your poor AI companions in the process.If you can see it, then you can go to it - most of the time, that is a good thing because with the amount of exploration here - not being able to go somewhere is a clue that there is absolutely nothing to gain by going there. okay, the game is deep on many levels. The islands are charachters in themselves and hold many secrets and surprises. You will explore shallow and deep caves, old ruins, mystical rock formations and many more fantasy cliches. This game is different, firstly it is a pirate adventure so things are just a bit off kilter than the standard fantasy fare, the lore holds it's own steadfast and doesn't apply the pressure to the player to like it. Secondly the level design is in my opinion, the entire game and it surely amounts to being something to experience in it's entirety. Quests are abound and only those who play CRPGs all the time will get sick and tired of the hubs and fast travel openings that games like these emit. There is a large portion of learning the game here, then a middle part that is exhausting but refreshing up until the final chapter which plays out kind of like a thriller. That is how this game is like a cinemaic experience. Seemingly so in the perspective given to the player and his choices during gameplay such as dialogue or it's open worldness. This ancient world made up of islands did feel a bit like it was showing the player the motions to run through it, but there is so much charachter depth to sink your role playing teeth in here. Lots of weapons and skills, crafting. It should be stated that there is not much armor to choose from but there is cosmetic diversity thats fundamental to the storyline. The companions you accumulate over the entirety of the quest definetely makes it feel like family and the comedy shines through more than a handful of times.It could be said that this game is a loot grind or simply quest after quest after quest but that is not necassarily an insult as I have meticulously attempted to be a completionist and loot everything. I have enjoyed the game as a whole and really liked going on treasure hunts and living like a pirate in this fantasy role playing game.  As far as combat is concerened, I felt this - there is alot of it! The amount of enemies to fight is comparitive to an all out action game, minus the bosses, but the combat system here is extremely banal compared to a spectacle fighter. Although the combat engine is adequate and it is up to the player to find their own style of magic, melee and missile, the wish for a quicker resolution to encounters may occur due to the engine's simplicity of hit or be hit and remembering enemy patterns. All in all this method is rightly better than all out button mashing or turn based applicatons. There are the occassional stuttering animations not just in the combat, but this can be overlooked, but add in, at the same time a grossly boggled camera in unleveled jungle floors mired in bush, then you may be reloading a previous save.This is a game that knows it is a long ordeal, and epic it may be when realizing the credibility of the game design and excellent mechanics overshadowing the many minor bugs that fail to sink this ship. Advice: Try the shapeshifting skills and admire the animation.			"

Diversity is all that matters. Give it a chance, if you did like the games like Bound by Flame, or other Risen games.			"

												This game is worth a try, in the very beginning game may be boring because you are strong and  game may seem very easy, after the first island you are so weak without companion ( because i didn't like to play with them ) that you may not like it, but in the middle of the game you will definetly like it you will need to make hard decisions like which faction to join ( i joined Guardians, because magic was returned ). I very liked how my character uses magic and in the start i didn't like those slow motion power hits, but ofcorse i got used to it. You can finally swim in the game. Music in game was very inspiring. I also liked sea battles, they were very interesting but i couldn't skip them or go to them later which wasn't the best thing but in total they where worth it. What i didn't like was ending island i can't say really why, but it was bad in my opinion. Ending scene was horrible it should be remade and longer like i could talk to my teammates in the end after last fight like in risen 2. Very good game. I could give to it 8/10 because i enjoyed it and really didn't encounter any horrible bugs because i completed every single quest which i found in the game!Edit: I also saw peaople saying that game was too short, i wil disagree with that i completed every singe sidequest i found and main quest in 52 hours and it is enough in my view!

												So far so good, started out rather hard, but getting the hang of the combat more and more and finally now that I understood where I was supposed to go for spells and such (as I aimed to be a mage with all of my points were put into a mix of influence, toughness and magic).The story so far seems nice, the openworld feel of it all is marvelous, spent 2 hours just running along the beach by the Citadel stabbin' them Iron Golems, my god was I surprised.I do feel that I should probably up the difficulty a bit, but for now I'm satisfied with how things are.The story might be a bit lacking but the game is incredibly beautiful, running it all on max without any issues at all..The only complaint that I really have is that the camera bugs out sometimes, and that I wish there was a lockon system.. :CEdit: Almost 20 hours into the game now, the quests might be a bit lacking but I am overall enjoying it. Mage seems to be rather OP as I just throw out Rain of Fire and then shoot a few lightning bolts here and there.Will be nice to see how Demon Hunter is after this playthrough is done!			"

												This is pretty much a middle of the line RPG, with a particularly weak combat system, but with an interesting, mediocre storyline that seemed to keep me intrigued. I put approx 32 hours into this game, and I didnt feel forced to finish it. The voiceacting of the NPC characters was quite good IMO, although the main character was a dullard with poor voiceacting. The combat system, as I mentioned, is very clunky, and using melee weapons will be a bore due to the simplicity and frustration of the slow movements.That being said, this game is of no improvement over RISEN 2, and if you enjoyed Risen 2, then I would recommend this game, as it is nearly identical, without anything new.Would recommend if: #1. You liked Risen 2.#2. You can score it for less than 20 dollars.#3. You are looking to put 30 hours into a decent RPG. "

												 Did you like Risen or Risen 2?  Then you might enjoy this game.  If you did not enjoy those you defenitely will not enjoy this one either.  For  better or (in my opinion definitely worse) worse the same engine has been reused from Risen 2.  Same blocky world textures same combat system, inventory system all of it is back.  I had high hopes for this game after having read some reviews by other people,  I was greatly dissapointed.  Combat is a major ""feature"" of the game and it's just terrible.  I do not enjoy combat rolling around the screen endlessly trying to avoid getting beaten up by a small pack of monkies.  Is it hard?  No.  Is it fun? Not even close.I didn't get too far into the game, which says a lot considering I beat the second one and the dlc and enjoyed it.  I just can't forgive the combat again.			"

												This game was a bit slow at the start, but once I got rolling, it has been very enjoyable.  It is a solid entry into the RPG market.  Some of its concepts seem a bit dated, but why does everything need to be new and innovative?  If it isn't broken, don't fix it.  This game does a lot of things right and surprisingly, despite its rough edges, I don't regret my preorder purchase at all.			"

												If you enjoy exploration in your open world RPG's this may be worth a pick up when its on sale. That being said outside of the large open world to explore I've found no other redeemable qualities to this game. I've tried on max setting on my home PC and its a bad looking game. I've tried on low settings on my Surface Pro 3 (that runs Skyrim, Deus Ex, etc) and it chugs along and is almost unplayable all the while looking like a 10 year old game. Terribly optimized. If you're starving for an RPG and find this for $20 I can recommend it, but as it stands $50 for this is a slap in the face.			"

												Great game.  Loved the pirate setting.  Much like Skyrim your character in the beginning plays as though they were crippled but by end game I had improved my skills and was a nimble wrecking machine.  The Thieves Den Island I could have done without.  It was a filler throw in and the game ending battle was annoying not challenging.  Froze up about 5 times in my play through forcing me to close and restart but other than that it ran pretty smooth.  Two weird drawbacks were the fact that you couldn't add map markers which were absolutely necessary.  No map markers in a buried treasure pirate game?  It came across like a bad joke.  Second was the inability to save a game with your own heading.  It would have been nice to have saved my game just prior to choosing a faction so I could go back and replay as the other two classes but it literally doesn't let you name your save which I've never seen before so it eventually just got over-written which will prevent me from ever going back to this game.  A real shame quite frankly.Great price(publisher sale), good graphics, fun skill progression and interesting characters.  They kept it simple as well so you didn't get bogged down with carrying encumbrance and the like.  Just straight forward fun.  Looking forward to a Risen 4.			"

												Really easy tip to make the game a bit easier in the start: count the enemy's attacks, learn when they stagger and when not. The enemies have openings, attack during those. Not all enemies you can lock with continuous attacks. Also, don't spam left click for combos, click directly after the damage has been delt for the fastest chaining of your attacks. Also, unfair review from angry joe. Game is actually quite good compared to Risen 2. I know I dont have Risen 2 on my account. ArrrrEdit: HIGHLY recooment this game if you liked Risen 1. This is a true followup to Risen 1. Melee combat could be better, but that is the con. All other forms of combat are good and you can build yourself around that. Great story and entertaining crew. Even the sea monster battles and boarding battles are fun as hell. --Ps. I was offline during my entire second (thorough) playthough, so hour count is far off			"

												If you enjoyed 1 & 2, you'd enjoy this entry into the series. Though it's nothing overly spectacular it is a good game. The only thing mechanically I had to complain about is the horrid control scheme. Controlling the camera is alot like being a broken bobblehead heavily intoxicated by methamphetamines. Combat can be a bit trying, especially when even oversized chicken monsters can somehow parry sword swings, but all in all it is still a decent game, just don't go in expecting something like the Witcher 3. 6/10.

												Any game that has pirates gets my attention immediately and in that sense I feel like Risen 3 definitely delivers. It also delivers horrible combat mechanics, a fair amount of bugs and some poor dialogue here and there but the experience is still worth it and still enjoyable if you can get past that. The graphics look pretty good and there are some really beautiful areas. The game has a ton of content and side quests that can lead to some pretty rewarding stuff. It's one of those games where it feels as though there is a set amount of gold to be made in the game, so at times you really want to take every opportunity you can if you want to get ahead. The order that you need to do the story is a little confusing and personally I found myself doing most of the side stuff before I even touched the main. I don't recomend this though, as you lose out on some content that you could have had earlier in the game.I really love the attitude of the main character even if his dialogue feels a little bland, he just really doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about mostly anything and tends to mimick the attitude that a lot of players have who just want to get on with things and shut those NPCs up mid blab :p (this does save a lot of conversation skipping lol).There are even a few battles to be played out with your ship, though they don't even come close to the awesomeness that are Assassin's Creed: Black Flag's naval battles they're still a nice addition to the game.All in all, if you're looking for a pirate themed game I highly suggest this. If not, it's still a good game if you can get past some of the obstacles such as combat. It might be worth waiting for it to be on sale either way though.			"

												I have played a lot of Pirahna Bytes games, including every Gothic game and Risen 2.  This game is an excellent addition to their catalogue.First, you'll love this game if you're like me and enjoy the following things:1.  A large amount of side quests, some of which have multiple possible solutions.2.  A fairly large world to explore, and many secrets hidden by camera perspective, geography, and whether or not you can turn into a parrot right now.3.  Being rewarded well for such exploring.4.  The ability to chose a faction that affects the gameplay.5.  A challenging fighting system (at least until you max out toughness and nothing can hurt you any more).Although I very much enjoyed my playthrough, here are some things that could be improved.1.  The moral choices seem to have only small impacts on the game.2.  The factions aren't developed enough, you max out your rank in no time with just a little concentrated effort.3.  There aren't as many puzzles as I remember in Risen 2.  Exploring ruins as a pirate necessitates more puzzles and traps.4.  The majority of the quests are the same regardless of whether or not you joined a faction.Lastly, a piece of advice from an avid off the main path player, join a faction right away.  You get special abilities for doing so that if you wait until you've done everything else, you won't have long to enjoy.  Also, it can save you some back and forth from traveling.			"

												I wasnt sure about getting this game at all but it proved to be more than i thought. It reminds me a lot of skyrim and fable. Granted, the combat isnt the best but it is  very immersive and makes you use your own reflexes instead of relying on the AI. It is a very interactive game and there are things to see and do wherever you go. The game runs smoothly for me and the graphics aren't perfect but they are certainly very pleasing. The first few missions seem  a bit slow but as soon as you get past the opening chapter you will be playing for hours due to amount of people you meet and quests you can do. The minigames are also fun :p			"

												Great old school RPG, love every second of it. I have not enjoed an RPG since Skyrim, so it says a lot. If you are into propper action RPG's, buy this game. The only negative I have to say about it thus far is the ease with which you accidentaly select your comapnion to talk. Basically if you are picking loot up on a regular basis (as you are supposed to do in this type of games), you will often klick you companion, and the same one line comment ""maybe later"", that even puts you in the 1sec aniomation , where you can not move etc is annying. Other then the minor thing, its great, but BEWARE, the fighting, while I personally find great, is one that you might need to get used to a little. But its superior to 90% of the super stilised figting you often find in games, that are making things too easy. Really great game.			"

Very few gates or restrictions.+Classic ""Gothic"" sort of character progression+Stable (only few minor bugs detected over 50hrs of play)+Huge world, *hitload of side quests+Gnomes! (source of best dialogue in game)-Horribly outdated graphics that belong to 2010 or earlier-Very simple combat system makes late-game combat mundane-Due to progression being split across 3 islands, there is a lot of filler content-Many locations are partially reused from Risen 2.-Story is better than in Risen2, but worse than Risen/G3/G2.All in all, it's still a niche title that lacks mainstream appeal (and pretty visuals). The game is decent, was fun to play. It feels like Risen 2 made properly, but the amount of content is so huge that it's worth its price as a standalone game.IMPORTANT: Played with German voiceover + English UI/subtitles and suggest you do the same. English voice acting is horrible and will completely ruin the mood.			"

												7.5/10Fun game, like the previous ones. Great story, let down by some dodgy voice acting and stilted dialogue. Some of the gnome voices are on the Jarjar Binks end of the annoying spectrum. Sometimes they verge on casual racism, sometimes they say funny things. It's like they are trying to do bad asian accents and sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the same time. There are some notable exceptions to that criticism. I thought the characterisation of ""Stax"" was done very well.Some criticize the combat system, and I can see why you'd love it or hate it as it requires a little patience. It's real-time-turn-based, if that's a thing; similar to the Gothic games. It's not a mindless hack-n-slash so you need to time blows, blocks and dodging. It's generally easy with one opponent but gets quickly impossible with 3 or more. You need a party to act as combat decoys more than you need them to assist you in fighting. The lore is a bit of a grab-bag but I enjoyed the pirate/inquisitor/voodoo/druid/mage/aztec ruin/underworld thing they mashed together. I like sandbox sprawlers that let you jump up to seemingly inaccessible places and reward you with hidden loot. There's no character creation, but it also doesn't lock you in to classes so your character will end up evolving towards the skills you like using.Very playable RPG fun....After 70+ hours of game play, I can say it's well worth it given the price on release was around half of what a premium game would be. There's some amusing quirks that are either poor translations or dev in-jokes, for example every single bird yields chicken drumsticks. I suppose everything tastes like chicken. What I said about classes, well you don't need to hold back, you can max out a lot of skills by the end so there's no compromises. There are 3 guilds to join, I played mage because lightening, but going back I'd probably have a go at demon hunter. Voodoo is powerful but to be honest that was my least favourite part of the game. Pirate Patty's boobs are ridiculous. And she's supposed to be your sister, thanks Borat. I recall the character from a previous Risen, but I don't recall her being dressed like a pirate-stripper on halloween. I love boobs but really, it was a bit out of place. Witcher did that way better. They swear a lot too. I spose it's pirates, but if you're gonna swear do it well.			"

												If you enjoyed the Gothic franchise, you're going to love this game.I won't lie to you and say it has the best graphics for its time, because it doesn't. They're mediocre at best.The voice acting is some of the worst I've seen since Daikatana.The combat is a bit clunky, but once you understand the subtle nuances of timed combat, and learn the patterns of the different enemies, it's actually quite enjoyable.The story is alright; with better voice acting it might even be pretty good.Here's the thing, though... This is basically Gothic 3 (without the awful frames / freezing bug), except you're a pirate. There aren't a lot of games like that out there. Additionally, the sea combat is wonderful. If you don't really enjoy the genre, this game isn't going to be for you. However, if you love this sort of game - your elder scrolls, your gothics (before 4), or earlier Risen titles - this game is going to be a blast. It's very open in that it doesn't force you to visit places in a set order. You can go just about anywhere right from the start, and the different gameplay styles and factions give it a fair amount of replayability. Overall, I'd give this game a 3/5. For me personally, though, it's a 5/5. It just comes down to what you're into and what you're willing to put up with.			"

												All the guys saying that this game is crap is not really Gothic series or Risen fans, this game is great and i enjoy it, reminds me of Gothic 3, i like the way how you get stronger and see the difference when you fight. Lots of missions to do with multiple ways to solve it. Again if your a Gothic or Risen fan you will be right at home but if this is the first time playing their games then it takes some getting used to, especially on the combat. The story is nice. Magic looks nice as well. You have 3 factions to choose from but once chosen you cannot join the others (same as Gothic series). I have chosen Guardians (mages) and enjoying it a lot. I recommend this game and for new comers just give it a chance and get used to the combat and you will enjoy it how you evolve and get stronger. It might feel crap in the beginning but thats just it, you must get stronger and stronger and your combat skills will improve and you will notice how your changing and getting stronger in the game, you will then see what you worked for. I loved Piranha Bytes Gothic series and Risen and love this game.			"

												I would like to start off that im a huge fan of the first 3 gothic games and so far ive gotta say the same for the risen series. Although this game does have its flaws so far the voice acting is sub par but the dialoge is good (ive only meet a few main charcters though so far, but the main charcater is really the worst compared to all the other pb games, imo. But then again im a mel blanc fan, so im a kinda snob for good voice acting) the movement is very stiff of your character, and take some feeling out at first. Ive gotten used to the melee... and the magic from all the differnt factions looks crazy sick! (as in awesome, which pb has always been good at mage combat, again imo) ... and once you get used to attacking only when you need too, and same with dodgeing, it turns into a game of patience, kinda dark souls style but not necessarily as difficult, but still fun and rewarding (btw, i really like the dodgeing system, where you double tap the move keys in the direction you want to go compared to the camera angle rather than where your character facing.) ive been playing 3 and a half hours now and ive still only been to one island and im nowhere near explored all the lush forsest full of beast and minions, and the cliffs (conveniently staircase-like so you can climb it up and up and up, lol, I guess it gives me an old school nostalgia;) I really enjoy Risen 3 and after I got past the beginning, it started feeling like a world i wanted to explore. (reminds me most of gothic 1 & 2 quest-wise where you've got your three factions, and gameplay handleing/movement, its very much like its predecessors. To me the movement could be less clunky, (which makes it hard for me to play it with a controller) I cant wait to get my magic going though, itll be a whole new game after that! Two thumbs up from me (was a bit pricey but like i said ive been a fan since gothic 1.) No regrets here...			"

If you liked the Gothic series and Risen, and can stomach the pirate theme of Risen 2, this game is for you.It was, as usual for PB, made for the audience that enjoyed their previous work.PositivesThe game is beatiful in my opinion, shaders and reflections are some of the best I've seen in a long time. Game runs mostly solid 60fps on my system (660ti and a first gen i7), dips rarely went lower than to 50fps, max settings.Combat system really did see improvements, even though many reviewers fail to see them.The new islands are much larger (at least 2 times the space and 3 times the quest density) than the two taken from Risen 2, ( the islands many criticized for being copy pasted, which is only really half-true, they have been noticably reworked and don't play as of a role in the story, I spent as much time on both of them as I did doing one half of one of the three main islands)The UI has never worked this well; instant response times and logical structure make necessary UI navigation easyNegativesThe sea battles are half baked at best, luckily they didn't take up more than 5-10 minutes at a time for me. Shame one of them starts off the game, so you see shoddy scripted animations and QTE's as a first impression, when either are rather rare throughout the entire gameWhile most of the UI is very snappy and responsive, the Inventory system is on a list basis, so scrolling is necessary. I prefered the Risen 1 system of a big open square based inventory, but I did get used to it easily.The overarching story is, as usual, quite cheesy and uninspired. That said: Obligatory ""hero looses his abilities"" we come to expect from PB games twist is probably better executed than in most previous iterations. Nice set pieces, areas and generally diverse side quests though.English voice acting is mediocre to 'meh', with many characters, german v/o is decent for a german v/o, many characters voices dont really fit their characters though. Many german voices are by voice actors that were in RIsen 1 and subsequently in the old Gothic games, so nostalgia bonus.That's really the biggest point, nostalgia bonus. If you liked Risen and loved Gothic, like I did, I would recommend, for anyone else, you may wish to wait for a sale. "

												Game is pretty entertaining, combat can be a little off but it does end up being enjoyable once you get the hang of it.  The game is not as easy as most games out there now, but the story is decent.  Graphics are good but dont quite seem ""solid"" dont know how to explain it other than that.  With reviews I wasn't expecting much but I enjoyed this game MUCH more than dragon age inquisition, and I am a Huge Bioware fan.  DAI just seem 90% fluff and 10% game not to mention boring combat that wasn't as tactical, this game has a much better feel and pace when you get used to it.  I would rate it about a 85%			"

												Great game with some flaws if your a fan of Piranha Bytes past work you will probably enjoy this gamePros+ large world with loads of quest to do+ your free to do anything you want when you want how you want+ the combat is better then it was in Risen 2 but still isnt that great but gets better when you learn new skills+ lots of skills everything from magic to voodoo to guns to melee and many more+ feels like the first Risen and the first 3 gothic games in many ways + soundtrack is very well done but nothing that will get stuck in your head for years to come+ the graphics are great i dont know why some people are saying they suckCons- the game is fairly hard at first thats what i liked but half way into the game i was almost a god and rarely did i die- the story is alright i guess nothing that bad it was just kinda there - voice acting is alright i didnt mind it but a hear a lot of people cant stand it- it takes a while to get to the real meat of the game i didnt mind this at all cause the gothic games were like that but i have a feeling many wont like thisso to sum up i do recommend this game but its not a RPG for everyone but if your a fan of the first Risen and first 3 gothic game you should most definitely get this game			"

												I was excited to play this game but unfortunately it makes me sick when I try.

If you are prone to motion sickness I would stay away, and even if you are not you might find yourself experienceing it.			"

												I usually never write a review for anything unless it is extremely warranted but here we go. This is a more regrettable purchase than WarZ. Boom! You get screwed by the developers here. They know it, you will know it. It is absolutely disgusting that they come out with something like this. *EDIT* I came back to the review and figured I should add that when you play this game, just don't expect anything spectacular. I concluded its made to be bad. I can understand that, but not for $50 can a game be that intentionally bad.Oh, its pretty? So what?! It doesn't even preform well and is a mockery of a game that should come out in this day and age. I feel like I have been pretty ripped off by the quality of this game for the price of $50. I think I have been made fun of for purchasing this game due to the extreme lack of quality and substance. I cannot believe this is even on Steam's market right now to be absolutely honest. For $50 you expect a game to actually be polished and work well and play well. Risen 3 does nothing of the sort. This is the type of game I would have expected to come out in 2003, not 2014 and certainly not for that price tag. It was advertised as an improvement from Risen 2 in every way and offering a new experience in ways of storytelling and combat that will be relished. That is completely false. Actually the biggest load of crap I have fallen for. The combat system is the same with no redeeming qualities. Here is how it goes: you strike twice, maybe 3 times, most of which the enemy blocks if they are a humanoid, then the enemy strikes where you hold down the RMB until you get to throw a strike of your own. You can try and dodge, but guess what? The enemy will probably come at you with his strike nearly teleporting to hit you. This is the entirety of the combat system. Nothing built on and certainly nothing improved. Nothing tactical or even trying with this system. It literally consists of just waiting and waiting and waiting. COMBAT SHOULDN'T BE BORING, THIS MANAGES TO BE SO. They should be ashamed for trying to get this game out on the market. The creation of this combat system actually makes me feel sick. Thinking you can slap something that bad together and be happy with it is ridiculous and is part of why this game was just a cash grab.The voice acting actually feels like they were joking while making this in the studio. With the main character sounding like he just got out of bed the entire time and Bones (your kool companion) trying to sound interesting and mystical, you can tell nothing was seriously done with this trash. At first I thought it was funny, now its just getting on my nerves and feels like a repeated kick in my junk for falling for this horrid game. I will keep trying to play this game again but heavily discourage it to ANYONE else because it is in all sense of the word, a cheat to the gamer. I really do feel screwed by it in every way.			"

												I think there's one character that truly captures the game's problems: your sister. I can imagine that design meeting:""Ok, we need a girl in the game. What do we know about girls? Uh... they have boobs. Good, perfect. Make them huge, because pirates would value the extra buoyancy. Now we have a boob pirate... oh! But let's be different, and instead of eye candy she's your SISTER! Right... so, what do brothers and sisters talk about? Being brother and sister, of course! Make sure that she reminds you with every sentence. That way the player is convinced that she's both a boob pirate AND your sister. It's called immersion. Look it up.""I don't think the game was actually written by a real writer. I've played it for 12 hours. I will probably beat it, and I actually enjoy the game a little despite itself.The overall issue that will prevent me from ever truly recommending the game is how poorly-devised the world is. The writing is stupid -- and I use the word ""stupid"" because it really is the most accurate. It's simply dumb. I actually find myself sympathizing with the writing at times, because the problems remind me so much of the ""books"" I wrote as a young teen (I'm almost 30). Characters say things ALL THE TIME that create a hundred different questions. ""If he uses magic he'll die like all the others."" What others? Who died? Who used magic and had it go poorly? Why does everyone treat magic like it's a part of life, a boon, or a blessing, and then this character acts like it's certain doom OUT OF NOWHERE. Why does no one else reflect this? Why haven't I been presented with lore? Why didn't you use this opportunity to GIVE me lore.""If you don't do this you'll die.""How do you know that? Where could this knowledge have possibly come from? Why does the main character not find any of this strange?Those are just two small examples in what feels like an absolute barrage of inconsistencies. I don't feel like a world has been created here. It feels like a few game designers sat around and threw around cliches at each other until they had a script. The main character suffers three-fold: for some reason they wanted him to look like an unlikable version of Christian Bale. His voice actor (or the director) can't seem to nail the mood of a single line. You're constantly being reminded through his gruff cursing that this is a recording of an actor in a booth somewhere, and not a real person. And third, his writing is terrible -- both in WHAT he says, and in his robustness as a character. Some of the voice actors truly are great. There are good performances that stand out, despite the rest of the game. That point needs to be made. But even these GOOD performances have issues. I feel like no one directing the game's talent had any true vision for what the game was supposed to be or how lines were supposed to be delivered. It feels like a discovery-writer's first draft. OR, the opposite problem, they could have had TOO many creative hands in the development. This is an issue of leadership and vision.Perhaps the absolute worst thing about the game is that when it makes me laugh (and it does, it can be quite funny), I'm not completely certain the game MEANT to make me laugh. I'm fairly certain the ""funny parts"" are supposed to be when people curse. I just don't believe the creators were capable of intentionally making me belly-laugh. I don't know if I'm laughing with or at this game. I go back to my earlier comment: this game is stupid, and I hate using that word to describe things. The game labors tirelessly to convince you that not a single talented designer has ever touched Risen 3. I enjoy it a little, and am rather determined to finish it. But every single person who had a creative hand in this game's writing, design and acting needs to take a long, hard look at other themselves or other professions. I would be embarrassed to ask people for money for this game, and I feel foolish having given them the benefit of the doubt.			"

												Buy this game if you love RPG's, and don't mind if a game is a bit rough around the edges, people who played the previous gothic and risen games know. You will get a good amount playtime for your money, and the game becomes alot of fun as soon you figured out the combat system. As the gothic series and the previous risen games, one of the biggest appeals of the game is the exploration. You will always find some hidden treasure and secrets, if you just look for themThis game gets a bad rap for being not as streamlined and polished as some other AAA rpg's, quite undeserved if you ask me. And i'm not a blinded fanboy of the franchise who desperately wants to defend it. I started playing this game after Witcher 3, and the transition was more than rough, since Witcher 3 was  doing everything right that matters in a good RPG.  Going over to risen was very difficult, since the clunky animations, odd combat system, and campy dialogue made it very appaling after Witcher 3. I even stopped playing entirely until i got back into it much later. But if you're willing to put some effort in the game you can get alot of entertainment out of it. Especially if you love exploring, this game will be for you. While the seperate Islands that you will visit throughout the game are not as huge as for example Skyrim, there are still tons of areas to discover that are completely optional, but will always reward you for exploring them.In conclusion, i'd recommend this game to every rpg fan, although if you only want to play perfectly balanced and polished games, this one might not be for you as it comes with a series of issues coming from the sometimes faulty game design. If you played and like the previous Gothic and Risen games, you can't do anything wrong with this one.			"

												Although i consider myself a big fan of Piranha Bytes(i loved Gothic 2 and Gothic 3) i cannot recommend this game. The battles here are atrocious since even the weakest creature can attack and kill your character due to the stupid battle sequences. The dialogs and voice acting are a joke and the main campaign plot is just silly. The entire Risen series had definitely been inferior to the Gothic series but Risen 3 is an especially poor effort.

												I bought the entire trilogy, and I have to say, I really enjoyed the witty humor some times, and the game flows well.  I started with the first game, and while it looked like a bad high school project, it was still fun to play.  After beating the first one, I played the second right after.  It was an absolute joy to see how much the game improved in terms of overall quality versus the first game and how it continued the story line from the first game.  At times it got a little slow, like a bad movie with lots of sex as a saving grace to keep the movie interesting, but once you get out of the crud, it picks back up for a great finale.    After beating the second one, I moved on to the third game I am currently playing.  WOW!  Absolutely huge improvement in overall quality versus the first two games, but the story was a little... concerning.  You play as Patty's brother, whom there was NO mention of in the previous games.  However, a lot of the characters and towns from the previous games were here as well, and GREAT fun.  It's rare to find quality games like this, and if you are thinking about the game, definitely get it.  I wish there was a 4th game of this series coming out, but I need to start playing Witcher 1 up to 3 now.  LOL!  I don't understand the negative comments, but they are way off.  I do agree that there was a couple bugs, but they weren't game breaking.  I had one bug where I floated across the screen on the first board.  Then after death, I jumped back up and played as an immortal... don't know how, but when I spoke with a townsperson on Fog Island, I just died.  Hahaha!  Those were the bugs I noticed so far and only bugs so far.  I salute you Piranha Bytes.  Well done!			"

I also know I haven't played this game for long to really get you to consider my opinion, but just check out gameplay videos if you're really unsure about getting the game based on the amount of good and bad reviews there are about this game.

												While only slightly better than Risen 2, this one offers a beautiful world rich with terrible voice-overs, floaty and unbearably slow combat.  The game stays true to its pirate-theme from the 2nd game but does very little to draw the character into the story.  It feels as if Piranha has taken a tremendous step-back from its Gothic roots and has instead tried to streamline the game to which it fails miserably.			"

												The game has very nice graphics even though it's a 2014 game and still looks better than some of the games today. The only bad thing about this game is the voice acting and animation. The voice acting is really bad and Bone makes me feel that he has 2 different voice. The animation looks rocky and not natural. Besides all those things, it's still fun to play.			"

												Before I write something I have to mention that I enjoyed gothic 1,2,3 and risen 1,2. This review will be random and useless.What can I say about this game? It looks cheap like hell. Really. That inventory, sounds, animations, models...everything looks damn cheap. Not like I didn't get used to it but they could have done way better for 2014 year.I am a bit mad because I don't understand what the hell is going on in this game. No prologue, no files to read. I was confused a lot till I reached wiki.Combat system is fine at least.But what I really loved here like in all pirahna games- dialogues. They are hilarious. Word ""♥♥♥♥"" and all its forms are in every damn line. I freaking enjoy it because finally characters talk freely, it feels much better. I also like how companions add some funny commentary when you talk to somebody.I would recommend this game for its current price. As people say it is fun to explore anyways. "

												Why? Why Piranha Bytes, why must you hurt me like this?It's like you've taken the good parts of their older games and thrown them all out, while at best not doing anything about the bad parts, and at worst magnifying them, or even shoehorning new ones from other games in.The NPC Hubs, unlike the ones from about every Gothic game they made, seem empty and dead. The liveliest one is the Guardians big hold, but it's a single one, compared to the countless other ones that simply seem...barren. The inter NPC banter which made the towns in Gothic and Risen seem especially lively is almost completely missing, as is the ambiance that came with it. Most of the NPCs become completely meaningless, after you've done a sweep through their area and finished whatever quest they were involved in. Unlike the previous games, there are almost no quests that become available at a later point, making the gameworld seem even more devoid of life. Because apparently nothing happens while you're away.Choosing a faction also has almost no impact. There is only a handfull of faction-dependant perks, most of which carry little weight. Apart from that, faction dictates which set of spells becomes permanently available to you, but during one playthrough I found a sufficient amount of scrolls to make that meaningless as well. After that, the only thing left are AFAIK about 2 quests per faction that wouldn't be available without joining. There are almost no other reactions or consequences to your choice in faction. Though that might be rooted in the choice to have no conflict between the factions, which I think is a rather boring design choice. Along with the factions comes the comparable tiny variety of equipment. There is a miniscule selection of 3 sets of armor per faction and they don't have that much impact on gameplay, as the values of armor seem laughable (150 points of damage mitigation, of which about 115 are from character attributes and perks at the end of my playthrough).  Though there are a bit more weapons available, a good part of those are already useless at the point one can optain them. All special abilities and perks no longer cost any learning points. All that is left is an amount of gold one has to pay for them, which undoubtably enables players to get anything they want without any need for choice. And with the Potion Brewing Perk, which costs 2000 gold pieces, the upper half of the attribute scale becomes meaningless as well. Why invest experience points into enhancing an attribute past a value of 50, if one can instead do it with not that hard to get potions?The Sea-Battle minigame they implemented seems like a sloppy attempt of copying Assassins Creed's sea battles, but with only 3 instances happening, none of which are avoidable, I couldn't familiarize with it's mechanics enough to be particularily good. It thus simply became a chore, each one taking about 20 minutes of gametime, while not being any kind of fun or adding anything to the story. The other three minigames were less of a chore, but also weren't required at any point, which is a good thing I guess. Why the hell they decided to implement the seabattles, and do so the way they did still is beyond me.The other, more ""puzzely"" possiblities of the game were mostly ignored. The ""trained monkey"" sequences were few in number and rarely provided anything of value (only 2 times IIRC). Same goes with the ""transform into Parrot"" sequences. There was only a hand full of them, and most of them only provided mediocre loot. None of them were in any part needed for any quests, neither main nor side. In fact, there weren't even meaningful possiblities to use them during the mainquest. The final battle was (again) only a ""whack the damage sponge"" with the occasional ""follow the damage sponge"" which felt kinda anti-climatic.While you get seven possible followers, it's of little meaning which one of them you take with you. They simply didn't add that much, appart from distracting monsters during combat and only occasional lines of banter. The game simply never made me (as a player) care that much about them. Of the three followers that I never took along, there is one whom I never found out anything but his name and his fondness of Alcohol, one I only found out that he had gotten ret-conned into a cruel, mercyless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and one that only seemed to be fond of stealing things. Nothing else. Nothing upon which I could build any feelings towards these characters but disinterest.So I have to ask: What the hell went wrong at Piranha Bytes? Why did you build something so completely forgettable, so unbelievably mediocre, so underwhelmingly plain? You guys were the heroes of my youth. A small scale studio, making such incredibly awesome games. And now this... please Piranha Bytes, please stop slacking.Edit1: ""PC Gamer: 83%""...guess thats where the money that would've improved chapters 3 and 4 went.			"

												I've played Risen 3 for about 11 hours now and I can break it down for you pretty easy:1. This isn't a big studio fancy production affair. It has bugs and it has a poor voice acting in places2. Despite this I love it, it's a beautiful game with caveats and funny turns. I've liked the Risen series as a whole, this one takes the cake3. It has a combat system that is moderately unforgiving, not Dark Souls but also not Assassin's Creed. I've only played Demon Hunter and the basic but enjoyed both for the moderate challenge they offer and how one must watch the movements of one's enemies to fight well (I have gotten lazy and died also :P)4. It also has tons to do, so many quests! And most of them are quite interesting (some boring sidequests but they don't interrupt the flow as you can club them together)			"

												This game is alright at best..... I'm a hardcore fan of RPG's and enjoy a game that challenges... however sadly after reading other reviews saying that this game just reqires ""tactics"" and ""doging"" are just hogwash this game is extremely mediocre and lack though passion a sense of caring and depth. I say this game will hold your interest for about 30 hours. But those 30 hours are rarely memorable and fun. Most of this game is a grind and the combat is messy and repetitive. HOWEVER the most major gripe I have with this game is the ""boss fights"" they honestly feel like my 5 year old cousin has made them. They are unfun grinds that pit you againts an infinite amount of spawning minions of the boss and the boss itself is heaing constantly, so you fight off 5 of the minions that dont matter because they give you no XP and never go away and then you return to the boss to find it have full health and maximum power after trying to kill if for 30 minutes. It was stupid game design and poor production values resulting in a failed franchise that makes the player angry rather than reward hard work and time. PLEASE PLEASE VOTE WITH YOUR WALLET AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS ENTRY OF RISEN! Go play the First one for a much better game if you have money to spend on something not this. And if you HAVE toplay this game do yourself a service and pay no more than 8$ for it. "

												Having played 14 hours of ther game, I've had to revise my opinion downwards.  Still a recommended deal if you can get it 75% off, but it's not worth full whack. It's a few steps improved over Risen 2, but sadly still suffers from jerky movement and scrolling control -- easy enough for the programmers to fix by upping the screen refresh, but they don't seem to take such suggestions on board, despite just about every review of earlier games going on about it.  As you progress through the learning curve, and get used to the awkward klunky combat control, you wait in constant expectation of the game getting better -- but it doesn't.  It's island hopping and running chores for NPCs who can't do simple tasks themselves.  ""Rough round the edges"", but for the discounted price, it's a steal.  Dialogue has clearly been recorded at different studio sittings rather than sequentially and often doesn't flow smoothly, or share environmental reverb effects, or even mesh sensibly.There's some minor humour in this dry game when Mud joins the team, but only because he's an annoying pest and a hindrance.  All integrity leaves the game if and when you choose to become a ""Voodoo Pirate"", that's just silliness, but alas it may be necessary to progress the levels if you can't make headway joining the mages.  Some quests won't resolve -- bugs in the code -- so don't expect to rattle through this one on autopilot.They've back-pedaled in gameplay processes to Risen 1, which it resembles a bit too much.  Worth investing in Risen 1 if you haven't got it, as it's the stand-out of the 3 games so far.			"

												It's a Pyranna Bytes open world RPG. It's got factions, day an night cycles and FLYING. (albeit as a Parrot). I went through my first run through as a Voodoo Pirate due to having the unlimited flying spell. This was one of my favorite features of the Might and Magic series and they included it in Risen 3. I hope PB keeps it for its upcoming games.The game does have its issues however. The number one being an over relience on arcadey sequences with its boss monsters. While not as bad as the Risen 1, they are still annoying having them in my RPGs. Why did they feel their games would be improved with that addtion. The game also had some irratating video sequences. They use the same brutal combat sequence for killing baddies as they do challanging an ally. It makes no sense for an ally to get up after you slit his throat . . .It make me ask the question, If your original template is the superior Gothic, what direction would you take to make the game better?The game world is fairly large but needed a wider diversity of monsters. And it needed more regular human monsters/bad guys. (Remember the bandit caves in Gothic 2)  The bullet shield was wortlhess becasue there simply aren't many baddies with guns. The cities needed more people and way way way more women. And while the game was mostly set in a carribean setting, I would have preferred a couple different climates. ( I admit a preference to snow)The UI is horrible. It needs more tabs. Some of the screen inforamation has to be scrolled when there is no need to such a thing. And some of the Voodoo Pirate magic is stored as a weapon and not as a spell. Those items should have been sold as wands not spells.Powergamers can easily have godly avatars by the mid game if they smartly allocate but since my avatars are usually well rounded (I allocate dumbly) I didn't achieve the near invulnerable status until the end game. Many powergames who achieved that early power, looked at the game as super easy. However that is ""never"" a problem with me because my main enjoyment of open world RPGS is exploration.  And this game does have it. And couple open world exploration with flying and this game many times had me in RPG nirvana.The moronic video combat sequences, the horrible UI and the far too many arcade sequences knock this game down a few notches. But the nicely implemented open world, the over all great voice acting, superior music all coupled with flying take away many of the flaws. I would rate this game 7.8 to 8.5.			"

												I'm not sure if I would like to recommend this game. Although I don't have very much playtime I believe that this game will be very repetitive. The combat is always the same. Dodge, block, and then attack. And as far as I can tell I only get a small window to allow a single attack. I have gotten two attacks in a row like 3 times. But again, I haven't played very much of the game. Hopefully as it goes on I will begin to enjoy it more. So far I'm just hoping I didn't waste $50. The game doesn't really grab my attention like I was hoping it would and from that I don't play. For all I know, this game will sit in my library from now until forever and not be played a second time.If you are thinking of getting it, DO NOT buy it right now even if you have the money to spare. I believe it is a hefty price to be asking for right now. Wait until it goes on sale because it definitely will. Not sure when but you'll most likely see a 33% discount off the game within 2014.			"

												I have not played through all areas of the game, but for the majority that I have seen:  Human NPCs have are either white or black (native), with a single type of seemingly cretinous gnome-like nonhuman speaking only in broken english.  Women are (aside from Patty, the protagonist's sister) extremely scarce, but what few there are seem to fall cleanly into 'witch' 'housewife' and [loose woman] stereotypes (the filter system does not let one use the normal english word for this.)  NPC and protagonist dialog includes numerous misogynistic remarks and 'jokes', with a few racist and homophobic ones thrown in as well.  This is a change from previous games, so I can only assume the the developers made a conscious effort to be more negative towards women and other minorities.  As this is a high-fantasy game with monsters, powerful mages, etc... any 'historical accuracy' excuse is mooted without consideration.  As a developer I find this sort of behaviour from a game designer unprofessional, cowardly, offensive, incompetent and embarrassing - at best. Because this is a change for the developers from previous games,  I cannot help but wonder if they have not made some serious internal errors in management allowing angry feelings in their staff develop into such such near-hateful content.  Development is hard - sometimes one ships a buggy, incomplete, and/or less than fun turd.  This is different as it was intentional; they published text, quests and, dialog, etc... expressing these sentiments. Ultimately the senior management of the firm is responsible for the sentiments expressed in their software, and holding them to this responsibitly for me requires not supporting the firm with my purchases again.

												Don't let the metacritic rating fool you, but don't expect BioWare quality either.Risen 3 is a solid and competent roleplaying game.  Featuring a decent magic and combat system, interesting variations on ""classess"" (factions within the game), interesting and attractive environments, a good looting and gear system and a good chunk of play time, its a game that can be easily enjoyed with a little patience and forgiveness.  The leveling system is complex and interesting, asking you to increase stats to be able to learn perks and improvements to your combat abilities, which can be bought from trainers scattered all over the world.What is wrong with the game are niggles and annoyances more than bugs or bad concepts, and even then are only highlighted because we, as consumers, have come to expect things that aren't provided here.  For example, the story told in the game is threadbare and confusing, never coherently explaining what's going on or why we should care.  This is only exacerbated by the  dubious voice acting, particularly by your own character who speaks in a constant gruff monotone.  There are allusions to the past games that can make it even more confusing, such as a cameo by the past two games protagonist that should be foreshadowing and cool but is instead just strange.The dialogue options are not the range you would expect for an RPG, giving you little choice and little chance to actually roleplay, being limited to gruff piratey responses rather than varied.  The combat system takes some getting use to, and requires a combination of attack, dodge, parry and riposte, and enemies have a tendency to mob you even when there are other characters attacking them, resulting in a lot of constant dodging and pot shots until their ranks are thinned and you're back in control.  This can sometimes be exacerbated by clipping problems, or the mobile camera being blocked by scenery.Overall, Risen 3 is worth playing and enjoyable if your expectations aren't too high, and I would recommend playing it when the price drops to a level that is better value for money.

It feels bit cheap and plays like it also. Game looks rough yes but to counter it has pretty color palette going on through game. And VA's I'd grade somewhere between Witcher 1(bad) and Witcher 2(pretty decent)Personally I paid 28€~ and feel like I got my moneys worth out of it.It is good snack while waiting for bigger rpg releases.

												Love it, Brings the great memories of the Gothic series before it went down the drain. Don't get me wrong I love Gothic 1 to 3 but the 4th disappointed. Anyways.. I hope that they don't change on how this game is made much. Graphics I love the way they are and I don't think much is needed to changed. I will suggest making is a multiplayer game in the future. Not a MMO. Kinda like a GTA where you can join in to different servers with a number amount of players...Love it and I will play it again and again different styles and paths love it.			"

												To the RPG fans out there this a great game with outstanding graphics. If you like the first 2 Risen's then you will love this game they impoved on many things this time around. The game runs smooth on ultra at 4K with my Crossfire Radeon setup.			"

												Forget Risen 2. Let it not bias you. Risen 3 is all you'd want from the Risens and the Gothics, too.GraphicsThe game is gorgeous. Sunlight/Godrays crash through the canopies of the trees; distant mountains cast their shadow on distant land realistically; fire never looked as good; water makes you want to jump right in; distant ruins beckon you to explore them; higher tier armour -- the cloth properly dancing as you move, the steel reflecting the light -- makes you drool as you stare at your hero. The physics engine is also fluid and realistic, enemies falling back after having received their killing blow will tumble over objects or droop down from them.GameplayIt's still what you expect from any Risen or Gothic game: The HUD is simple, and that's perfectly fine. In fact, I wouldn't have it any other way. You can now also change into a parrot with scrolls that you'll find everywhere -- specifically in high places! -- the devs silently begging you to use them as turning into a parrot makes you glide however long you want. There's a little energybar nonetheless which will slowly empty whenever you want to fly upward. It's fun! And as for the combat...CombatIt has improved SO MUCH! If you time your attacks properly, you can swing with heavy attacks almost as fast as you would with normal attacks. This needs some practise, but once you get a feel for it, it becomes easy. For some too easy, though many players still think combat is hard. As you gain enough experience (or Glory) you'll be able to gain the Riposte skill, which, if you time it right, your parry will execute a sweet animation of your hero evading a strike and counter-attacking with a strike of his own. You can also still dodge, which is an ability that can be exploited since there's no stamina bar. I say exploited, because during a dodge you're practically invincible. A fantastic addition to the combat is the finishing move on humanoids. When you kill the last enemy in an encounter, you watch your character execute him. There are multiple finishers. Your hero pushes an enemy against a wall, rams his weapon's hilt into the face multiple times before running him through; your hero turns the enemy around and slits his throat, etc. etc. etc. My most favorite finisher is where the enemy runs toward the hero and the hero steps aside at the last moment, leaving his weapon stretched horizontally in the enemy's path... the enemy runs into the blade, stumbles past the hero and eventually drops on the ground a few strides further, quite dead. Imagine stuff like this with a perfect physics engine. Yes, if there's a ledge a few strides behind your hero in said finisher, the enemy will stumble and drop down the edge instead. Deader than dead. So awesome.ExplorationThere's so much to see and do and find in this game! Almost every NPC with a name (which is almost every NPC) has a quest or more quests. When you climb up a mountain and see these mysterious places in the far, far distance... well, that telltale feeling rushes through every RPG player -- the feeling that says: I NEED to go there and explore every nook and cranny! And I can guarantee: You WILL be rewarded for it.Final verdictI love this game. I am not kidding. It's the best thing in the gaming world that has happened to me in YEARS. And that's coming from a guy who fell in LOVE with Gothic 1 & 2, Risen 1 and very much disliked Risen 2. I catch myself playing this game with a content smile on my face. It's crazy. This game is phenomenal!			"

												Risen 3 Titan Lords is in fact, a great game, there are a few things that makes the game better and that it is not like a Risen 2.5. - Jumping finally has animations, jumping forward in risen two was just bending one of your knees and that's it. -You can swim again in this game, which is pretty useful. -you have a new ability, called Astral Vision, and if you upgrade it you will be able to find hidden chests, gold, plants etc. -you can use magic in each faction, I always loved using magic in a PB game so for me it's a plus. -More flora and fauna, parrots flying around. -You can turn into an evil person (shadow) or a human, depending if you're nice to people or not, which makes dialogue more interesting and you should be careful of what you say. and a few more things, but can't think of it now, like I said 10/10, a score of 5.2 is not what this game really deserves, you just didn't play it too much, or you only played the beginning saying that it's a pirate game.

												I am really enjoying this game. Despite the mostly poor reviews of Risen 2, I really enjoyed that game, too. This game is similar to Risen 2, but they have GREATLY expanded the world, amount of quests, and added the open world element. Is this game perfect? No. However, if you enjoyed the second Risen: Dark Waters, this one has all the fun and more. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good adventure/rpg that doesn't hold your hand. It treats you like a veteran gamer, yet instructs enough for the first timer.			"

												The picture shows a badass warrior slashing something fantasy-style; I started the game and found myself in a pirate setting. Combat is harsh and difficult, and survivability is that of a chicken wing in a buffet hosted for morbidly obese. Even with adventure garb that came with my pre-purchase, I had to kick the wall in pure frustration every time I had my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cut off by a crab (no, there are no levels, apparently, you meet a monster and you D.I.E.). At least the Quicksave and Quickload buttons finally got dusted off. Also, the dialog, hillarious in some places, is full of swear words and overuse of the ""f""-word. I'm no expert, but I'll bet this much swearing would make a real-life pirate die of shame. Even when your hero does something nice, like rejecting a reward (""Keep your ♥♥♥♥ing <item>"") or saving a girl (""You're ♥♥♥♥ing safe now"") or dispatching hellhounds (""I ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ed up the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥mutts in the ♥♥♥♥ing courtyard""), he does so with a speech that makes me want to knock his teeth out. Recommended if resistant to ♥♥♥♥ing overuse of the ♥♥♥♥ing word ""♥♥♥♥"" and dieng of crabs, or, rather, getting killed by crabs			"

												Piranha Bytes has done it again! They are behind the Gothic franchise - in my oponion - simply the best Action RPG ever made. Now they've completed Risen with a 3. installment and i have to say, what a game! Ever since Gothic (expect Gothic 4, which wasnt made by Piranha Bytes, explains the failure..) I've never felt the same atmosphere in another RPG. Never the feel, the sense of detail and intriguement... But oh boy, have they made a huge succes with Risen 3! From the combat system, crafting, the thirst for exploring, to combat magic and fun characters! Everywhere you go everything has a purpose and nothing is random. I love it. Risen 3 is difenitly the best of the 3 games, its like they have found the perfect balance from the other games and made it awesome. Try it, if you love a good Action RPG and you find the other blockbuster RPG tedious, lack of feel and soul - buy Risen 3, you wont regret it. Support Piranha, so they will keep on making awesome Action RPG's. Long live Piranha Bytes - and im not even german! :)			"

												  If you liked the last 2 then you will like this one it is pretty much the same exact game.   Honestly I don't see much of any improvments if their are any they are not noticeable.  Voice acting is even worse if that is possible. It is like their are multiple conversations being spliced together at random.  Did your voice actors even listen to the clip of what they are responding to? They really make it hard to play the game It was like it was a joke or a bother to them or something text would have been better.   Combat still garbage exactly the same pistols and all but now you have the animation sometimes when you kill them.  But the combat here I think is somethign you just deal with right, been the same nonsense since Gothic 2, no real improvements. I enjoyed Gothic 2 back then you have to make improvements though...    I force myself to make it to the islands to try to get the crystal magic but I just cannot keep punishing myself like this.  Might give it another shot sometime if I am extremely bored and decide to get drunk one night. Not saying it is terrible it is playable and if your standards are still in the Gothic 2 range and can deal with the above mentioned, you will absolutley love it.  Should have been labeled an expansion, certainly not worth more than $15.00 sorry.			"

												So I finally end this game at second time, and can write my fresh impressions.I started play it immediately after I finished with Risen 2, and at that moment - I think that this game is a total fail. I'm not finised it, and take a huge time for a rest. But after a long time - my opinion turned to the better side)Of course the fighting system is poor. Of course you have immortal allies.Of course you have that sacred arrows that shows where you can find damned rock cristals for those mages.Of course sea battles is or other mini games are drustraitingOf course final island makes me cry because I expected final battle already, but get some f*cknig marathon to proove it.And this was the easiest gothic/risen game I've ever played. I don't talk about bugs.But I played it with pleasure, even ignoring my sleeping time.  Quests were intesting, dialog looked like alive, game is full of sarcasm.+ 1 point for the story of parrot at your ship(Don't know how this creature appeared there). Vudu magic give intersting quest, and, ip ip, I was in a body of f*ckin gnume)So it is a good game for a one time. Any next finishing - only for risen fans(Of cousre I must end it for a mage)			"

												Having played 14 hours of ther game, I've had to revise my opinion downwards.  Still a recommended deal if you can get it 75% off, but it's not worth full whack. It's a few steps improved over Risen 2, but sadly still suffers from jerky movement and scrolling control -- easy enough for the programmers to fix by upping the screen refresh, but they don't seem to take such suggestions on board, despite just about every review of earlier games going on about it.  As you progress through the learning curve, and get used to the awkward klunky combat control, you wait in constant expectation of the game getting better -- but it doesn't.  It's island hopping and running chores for NPCs who can't do simple tasks themselves.  ""Rough round the edges"", but for the discounted price, it's a steal.  Dialogue has clearly been recorded at different studio sittings rather than sequentially and often doesn't flow smoothly, or share environmental reverb effects, or even mesh sensibly.There's some minor humour in this dry game when Mud joins the team, but only because he's an annoying pest and a hindrance.  All integrity leaves the game if and when you choose to become a ""Voodoo Pirate"", that's just silliness, but alas it may be necessary to progress the levels if you can't make headway joining the mages.  Some quests won't resolve -- bugs in the code -- so don't expect to rattle through this one on autopilot.They've back-pedaled in gameplay processes to Risen 1, which it resembles a bit too much.  Worth investing in Risen 1 if you haven't got it, as it's the stand-out of the 3 games so far.			"

												It's a Pyranna Bytes open world RPG. It's got factions, day an night cycles and FLYING. (albeit as a Parrot). I went through my first run through as a Voodoo Pirate due to having the unlimited flying spell. This was one of my favorite features of the Might and Magic series and they included it in Risen 3. I hope PB keeps it for its upcoming games.The game does have its issues however. The number one being an over relience on arcadey sequences with its boss monsters. While not as bad as the Risen 1, they are still annoying having them in my RPGs. Why did they feel their games would be improved with that addtion. The game also had some irratating video sequences. They use the same brutal combat sequence for killing baddies as they do challanging an ally. It makes no sense for an ally to get up after you slit his throat . . .It make me ask the question, If your original template is the superior Gothic, what direction would you take to make the game better?The game world is fairly large but needed a wider diversity of monsters. And it needed more regular human monsters/bad guys. (Remember the bandit caves in Gothic 2)  The bullet shield was wortlhess becasue there simply aren't many baddies with guns. The cities needed more people and way way way more women. And while the game was mostly set in a carribean setting, I would have preferred a couple different climates. ( I admit a preference to snow)The UI is horrible. It needs more tabs. Some of the screen inforamation has to be scrolled when there is no need to such a thing. And some of the Voodoo Pirate magic is stored as a weapon and not as a spell. Those items should have been sold as wands not spells.Powergamers can easily have godly avatars by the mid game if they smartly allocate but since my avatars are usually well rounded (I allocate dumbly) I didn't achieve the near invulnerable status until the end game. Many powergames who achieved that early power, looked at the game as super easy. However that is ""never"" a problem with me because my main enjoyment of open world RPGS is exploration.  And this game does have it. And couple open world exploration with flying and this game many times had me in RPG nirvana.The moronic video combat sequences, the horrible UI and the far too many arcade sequences knock this game down a few notches. But the nicely implemented open world, the over all great voice acting, superior music all coupled with flying take away many of the flaws. I would rate this game 7.8 to 8.5.			"

												Fantastic game! I will admit, I am a sucker for fantasy rpgs and pirate games but I loved it. I was a fan from the Risen series from the get go and I enjoyed this game thoroughly. I know, It is easy, way easy, super easy. For me, that didn't detract from the game. So the gameplay was easy, the rest of the game is amazing. I love how beautiful and big the islands are to explore, I liked the story and the game content involved. The character's batman voice was a bit hard at first but you grow on it. I have so many hours in this game, you can't believe it, I really enjoy long games. I love the risen series and this one was great. If you like rpgs with amazing worlds and tons to do then this is for you even if it is easy. I can't wait to see what Piranha byte does next and I might play their old stuff in Gothica. RPG's are my thing, and this series was everything I like from RPGs and more. Risen 1 was a good world and very hard. The second one was a great pirate game with a good story and something I could get behind. Risen 3 had beautiful world, funny characters, and a perfect length. I think you would all enjoy the Risen series, and I'm sad to see it end.			"

If you like the charm of all the Gothic/Risen games, this is a great RPG for under $10-15There are some bugs and minor unpolished, but hey, that is part of the charm this series provides in my opinion. Textures, shaders and the level design are great quality as always - but of course, the animations are awkward like all games in the series. The story is meh, but the exploration is simply amazing. Nice free-roam options compared to past games.I started back in the day with Gothic I+ and this game hits the right spot. FYI. Just never play Arcania: Gothic 4.			"

												Made an awful first impression on me (maybe because I haven't played Risen), but then turned out to be pretty good.It took me a while to figure out the combat system, but once I've bought myself a better sword and added some skill points, it became quite decent (although dodging all day long seems to be the way).All in all, misjudged the game terribly at first, and now, a few months later, I'm actually enjoying it. If you decide to get it, brace yourself for the cringeworthy first 15 minutes, and keep in mind that what you're experiencing is by far the worst part of an otherwise decent RPG.			"

												First of all, let me emphasize that this is a Piranha Game in all aspects. Which is good for me, but apparently does not fit well with some people.I started playing Piranha Games with Gothic 1 and played every game since, so I knew what to expect and am happy to report that the NPCs talk at length about trivial things and have to be forced to get to the point, you only get a fixed set of useful Armor that is restricted to your Group etc.A lot of people apparently don't like this, but for me that's a Piranha Game. If you liked the first two Gothics, this game is for you.Warning: From here on there might be SpoilersAs a long-time fan, here's what I think about Risen 3 compared to the Gothic series and the other two Risens:I loved it. It reminded my why I fell in love with Gothic and I am going to play it again to see the way the game goes if you choose to be something else then a Voodoo-Pirate.In comparison to Risen 2 I think it's much better. Which is great, as I thought Risen 2 was way better then Risen 1, so this seems to be a trend. Even the usually sucking Piranha Final Boss Battle was bearable. As a reminder, in Risen 1 the final Boss Battle neglected all your ""life choices"" and stuck you into magic Armor and Weaponry that made you a great fighter, even if you had gone the Mage way and put you into some kind of Arcade-Battle against a Big-Boss. Ugh.Risen 2 had Mara, but I only remember from that fight that I didn't like it.This time, it had sucking moments, sure. But I could play to my strengths I acquired during the game and at one point Bones jumped in to save the day, which I assume was a bug, but I liked it.Compared to the Gothic Series I dare say this is the game I was hoping for when Gothic 3 came out. It had all the charm, wits and anecdotes that made the first two Gothic Parts great and none of the empty world and hastily crafted Quests. Playing Risen 3 I couldn't but think of how great a game Gothic 3 could have been if it came out a year later. Even half a year. So all good? Of cause not. There are a lot of things they can do better and I hope they will for Risen 4. But none of the following ""bad stuff"" really impacted my great experience, so read them as ""minor issues"".The Bad stuff- I love the Kila, but hate the Post-Imperialistic, ""noble savage"", ""half naked exotic beauty that speaks in Umpa-Lumpa"" stile. You can do better than just throwing together all the cliche to mix up a ""tribe"". - Whatever happened to Patty? Why does she look like some Pirate-Porn Star? Honestly, this kind of ""Fan Service"" makes me feel treated like a 14 year old with a puberty issue. I see what you thought I would like and feel dirty. - Where's my Marvin Mode? One of the really cool things about Piranha Games was the ""and now I will change everything to how I like it"" Marvin Mode. Missed it greatly. Reduces replay-value. Basically, give me back my Marvin Mode. - If I have to hear Bones say ""Aus deiner Haut mache ich mir eine Mütze!"" one more time...- I would have liked a way to solve the Noise behind Paula's house without killing the armadillo.- Light. I know this does not happen to everyone, but every time I entered a cave darkness took me like a black flood that even torches could not dispense. Looting caves without telekinesis was basically impossible as I could not see anything smaller then a sword. - Story-restriction to Voodoo body-snatching. I get that this could be a story breaker, but there have to be better ways to restrict this then simply allowing it only if it fits the narrative. The ""meh"" StuffThese things I could go without* Astral View. Never used it. No idea why I would or should have. The Great Stuff+ The World. I liked to just hang out with the Pirates on Kila or the Kila on Kila (Reaaallly smooth...) or...+ The Characters. There are no Diegos, but a lot of likeable NPCs and taking some of them along was great fun.+ The Story. It was easy to follow without being too predictable. Yeah, there was obviously some arch-nemesis going to be there for the surprisingly minor-sucking End Battle, but other then that I liked it. Quests were mostly fun too.+ Easy mode that means ""easy fights"" for people like me who take fighting as a ""have to do that"" in RPGs+ Mud. Yeah, really. Loved it. Even took him along after he left on his own free will. That's how it goes with old “friends”...++ Parrot-Flight. You'll know it when you get it. I've spend hours flying around.			"

												The game starts off with a great opening.  A good way to introduce the basic movement and controls, easing into the free reign exploration without making the player go through long tedious tutorials.  The story premise and foreshadowing was at first engaging and did well to draw the player (or at least myself) into the story.  After the prologue however things  quickly nose diive.The sheer amount of recycled content was insulting.  From repeat fgihts with slightly skinned differences to outright repetition (dream vs actually happening ship battles) most of the game felt as if there was no creative mind behind it.  The story ended up rushed and in the end it seemed as if the game designers wanted it to be done even more than the players.  The ""boss"" fight at the end was also an extreme let down.  Frankly, I had a lot more fun fighting Mara in the previous game. The story sucked, outright.  Great premise, great idea, but a horrible execution.  All of that could be forgiven if it  was at least fun to play, but sadly, it was just boring.  Even an old school hack and slash game is more entertaining than this.  Character developement is also extremely limited.  There is very little if any real reason to upgrade more than one stat, based entirely upon your playing preference of course.  The varying skills all cap out at a flat 100 rating (105 with items).  The level up is handled very poorly with various permanent effect potions affecting the total amount of points needed to upgrade.  (bascially it costs x points at level 50 to go to 55, but use a +5 potion and you won't have enough points.. free level sorta, but now it costs more to keep going.  This creates a sort of optimum level barrier that depends on the number of potions you can find/craft.  I won't say it's detrimental, but it's certainly annoying.) Minor detrimental points also abound, from dialog errors, to quests that jump ahead before you get them, to the wonderous fall damage that can occur if you go off the beaten path (I mean falling through objects).  Give me the first Risen over this anyday.  I whole heartedly cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I would say avoid. If you're a fan of the mechanics or the ""story"" of the Risen world, give it a shot.. but othewise, avoid. Sadly, there's really nothing for most people in the game.** Last note: Risen 2 introduced a foul mouthed gnome.  Sadly, he seemed to have tempered his tongue a bit in Risen 3, limiting his swearing, but he's still the only good point in the whole game.			"

												Overall a decent, but not great, game.If you played and enjoyed Risen or Risen 2 (or any of the Gothic games, for that matter), this game will feel immediately familiar. It continues with the pirate-y themes from the second, which I wasn't crazy about, but it didn't take away from the game too much for me.The gameplay mechanics are solid enough, and the graphics are decent. The voice acting and dialogue is almost all hilariously terrible, and the story is pretty poor, but I still found myself enjoying playing it.Honestly, there are better games out there. There are better games trying to do this exact same thing that you could play instead. I tend to have a soft spot for wonky European RPG games though, so take this recommendation with that in mind.In the end, should you play this? Maybe. Did you play and like the other ones, and did you want more of that? If yes, get this. You know what you're getting in to. Do you just want an open world RPG and haven't played one before? You can probably find better options. If you're looking for deep character customization or a great story, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.Still, not bad. I enjoyed it and it's lengthy enough.			"

												I feel like they aimed to make a worse game every time they made a Risen game.  Risen 1 was very good and wasn't fantastic but it wasn't garbage.  Risen 2 was really trashy but kept my attention and I was able to get through it and enjoy the story.  But this game.  Oh my god I have never had a worse combat experience ever.  Game says you can chain 3 hits.  No you can not at all.  2 hits fairly easily but the 3rd will always be interupted by an enemy attack and even power attacking enemy block will just cause them to hit you first or roll away instead.  Combat ends up being this really slow boring grind of slash roll slash roll.  Theres no real strat as you get frames when you roll even if the attack hits you.  It feels like it tried to be a budget darksouls combat system and ended up just being trash.  Story is meh.  Not much to say but pirates and feels like a recycled plot from the second game but much more watered down.  Only play if your fan of the games already otherwise the completely garbage combat system will upset you.			"

												Avid Gothic series fan here - wanted to give Risen 3 a try thinking that it would be the culmination of the respective series. This game lacks souls. It is linear, with poor voice acting and a slugish gothic-esque remake of a combat system. You are honestly better off trying old school RPGs and/or modding them.			"

Go buy it, it's worth full price.			"

												I have played risen 1 which I loved then risen 2 which wasn't as much... it went much more linear and felt forced to move along.. Risen 3 seems to be more of a retreat back to what I loved about the original, take your time and move along at your leisure.Comabt early on is very clunky... and isn't much fun... you spend more time retreating/healing than actual fighting.. However once you join a faction it gets easier.. I joined the guardians and range spells are the way to go.			"

												Risen 3 is a game that I found disapointing and fustrating. The main reaons I didn't like this game is because it isn't anything like Risen and a lot like Risen 2.There isn't anything about Risen 3 that I could say was great and at the same time there isn't anything about Risen 3 that I could say was awful. Risen 3 is this average game, annoyingly so because you often see moments of greatness, but it's never quite there. After thirteen hours play time I've been unable to find a reason to continue with the game.  It feels like Piranha bytes are happy with okay and that pushing to make something great isn't quite within their grasp. Piranha bytes can make amazing games, Gothic 1 and 2, Risen 1, but for some reason prequels are not quite their domain. The game seems to still suffer from crashing, on a newly built pc with a new OS, which is above the recommend settings. If it's in the sale and you liked Risen 2, buy, if not, stay away!			"

												This is one of my first reviews for a game on steam, so I will try my best to cover the pros and cons of Risen 3. I will bring the conclusion at first, so that people searching for an indicator may find my judgment without reading the whole text. IMPORTANT: This games has problems with some CPUs or system configurations! - It won't work in some cases!! - Therefore, consult the PB forum for more information!Conclusion: This game is not worth 50 €/$. Let me be me ore specific: For fans of Risen it may be a must have, but for all others that are looking for a good/excellent rpg game which provides you with tons of quests, variety, a good combat system, polished gameplay and game engine, Risen 3 should not be your choice. The graphics engine is really old, textures are not provided in a high resolution, and even the world design (even if it is really good) cannot hide the shortcomings of the really old engine. The designers tried their best but the engine does not provide enough features to create a fully living world and this is experienced in the very first moments you enter the jungle in Risen 3. This fact is reflected if you take a closer look at the scene. The models are, how shall I say, really really bad; no (face) gestures at all, animations are choppy.  Another very important aspect of an RPG is the combat system. This is the biggest shortcoming of Risen 3. First, it is completely unbalanced. In the early stages of the game each creatures might be your death, later on you feel like god and nothing can really kill (except you head for a coffee and it takes you 5 minutes until you come back ...). Second, the factions are more or less a nice to have but after you have learned the most ""skills"" the spells earned by the factions are just for fun and do not seriously influence the combat.Detailed Review:Impressions/Opinion:I have to admit, I am a very big fan of Gothic 1 & 2. One reason that I bought the game were the reviews that are provided by computer magazines. In fact it was the ""open world"" which disappointed me already in the beginning of the game. I felt somehow cheated because the game has not the freedom as a Gothic 1 or 2. It still fells like Risen 2. NO, there is no ""open world"" or freedom in the game, except the selection of the so-called factions. The game follows a strict chapter system and islands are quite linear. The world does not feel like its living. If you have cleared/killed all creatures on an island, you are done, there is nothing left to kill and there will nothing respawn (that’s it). Sure, there are a lot of side quests but there is no real difference between the main story and the side quests. I have played many RPGs but I seldom come across such a bad story telling. The ""quests"" are very generic like, ""kill x"", ""bring me xyz"". It feels like playing an really old RPG in 2014. If you have seen the 5 (including the first one where you start and are brought back to ""life"") main islands, which are not that big as it looks like in the beginning, there won't come any more (SPOILER: a sixth island at the end for the very last fight/quests). The combat system is useless at its best. In the early game it feels like every creature may be the last creature you will face and after the first 4 hours you get so strong that fights become just a necessity and does not feel like an epic fight. I won't talk about boss fights because they are not really any better but writing about them may spoiler one or two things. But, bosses are just like events, nice to watch. A real challenge is the gameplay and that you do not fall off some shores or edges if you are hunting for hidden places...Technical discussion:There is not much positive to say. As already mentioned in the conclusion the engine is old and the models are far from state-of-the-art, such as in Witcher 2 or BioShock Infinite. The models are definitely missing vertices, such as the terrain and everything in this game. The textures have a really low resolution and sometimes they look awkward and misplaced. Furthermore, the game crashes from time to time (if it even decides to run on your system).  The animations of the models are really choppy and are not that smooth as someone may expect for a game that was released mid 2014. Last words:I am just curious why this game got such good review from computer magazines. This game is just a refresh of Risen 2 with some really MINOR improvements. In fact, its more like a joke for 2014. PB you could have done way better and you know it!Fans will buy it anyway, but all the others should think twice!			"

Posted: August 16, 2014
												So ive beaten the game. My end cutscene went to play and the character starts walking to the camp on skull island. It looked like Bones was going to say something but before he could it cut to the ship sailing out of the island. So if i want that end sequence ive got to kill the end boss again which is ok i never got anything from the story in this game so I will wait for someone to upload it on youtube. So complaints.1) Combat starts off very slow, this is the only game ive ever played where you absolutely rely on your companion to kill things when you first start. 2) Combat requires no skill. You can cheese almost every fight effortlessly there is little to no reward to killing anything except for the 3rd Kraken which is the only truely frustrating part of the game.3) Glitches, Oh my god glitches i felt like I was playing an Alpha of Risen 3 mind you none of these glitches caused a blue screen, full system crash, or crash of game. 4) Guidance at times is at an absolute bare minimum. I consider myself an Intelligent person and I found myself frustrated more then a few times even after listening to all dialog options. My most annoyed moment would be the Books of Evil quest from the Demon hunters for your first promotion.5) Dialog was often incredibly annoying and no I am not talking about the Gnomes their dialog was intended to be absolutely annoying. Thankfully right clicking cured this for me just dont do it during a quest giver.6) Cutscenes throughtout the game are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo excessive and not in a good way like Metal Gear Solid 4's 7 or 8 hours of cutscenes, Most cutscenes in this game are clearly rushed everything from key speakers faces blurring out to horrible choices of background music which most of the time sounded incredibly close to the fight music.7) Enemy Diversity is bleh. I also took note of the spiders working with the shadows on skull island. Was mostly confused by that considering the Oracle was using them to attack both humans and shadows from what that whole ♥♥♥♥ty story explained.8) Most points of the game I would complete quests like allying with the Inqusition and it had a moment to do a cutscene or give dialog options and it wouldnt. So when you kill Sebastion it just cutscenes to your boat pulling into its destination and your character saying well they will fight for us. There felt like a lot of information was just skipped over it felt like listening to an average 5th graders explination of their family vacation. There were holes all throughout leaving you wanting much more. I just wanted a ""Hey thanks for saving us from that crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i thought he was going to kill me next."".9) Some skills pop up as weapons in your equipment page whereas some skills like Monkey Trainer pop up as an Item in your inventory so you have to dig and find them. I for instance forgot I had monkey trainer which actually would have been helpful much earlier on in the game but when you buy skills theres no hey idiot your skill is right here when its not going to be in the normal place.So in closure I still will not recommend this game until it goes on sale. This game is like Aliens Collonial Marines half made garbage which is only good for killing time when absolutely bored. Regardless of my complaints I did find myself having fun with Demon Hunter skills stacked with blade dancer and how OP they make you if you are melee built. That build literally makes you 2 shot a Shadow Lord in about 1/8th of a second. The game was waaaaaay too easy. I barely died at all with all of them being in the same spot the 3rd Kraken.This is one of the few games Ive played and gotton bored while playing... I had literally more fun in Aliens Colonial Marines then this and that was a flaming POS with a much better written story.5/10 its very ""Meh""			"

												I was hoping that they would ""go back to roots"" and make it more like gothic 1 and 2... but they didn't.  They should have.  I don't feel immersed in this game world coz of the way it's divided up into islands and even going up a ladder is a fade to black transition.  Every NPC I run into I am constantly skipping the dialog coz its slow and painful to listen to it, I read the subtitles quickly for key info.  But whatever they say, I really dont care, not coz I'm impatient, but the game doesnt give me a reason to care.The list of negatives outweighs the positives.  I wont go into too much details, because there are many other reviews out there that cover it, I just need to vent a little ;)I originally gave this a ""recommendation"" but after sinking a bit more time into it, there was very little to keep me wanting more.  Just more boring NPC's with shallow quests.  There is new land to explore but the way it is set up, even though an open world, still feels linear.. That doesnt make much sense, but imagine a linear piece of string tangled into a big ball.. that's Risen 3.It's not the worst game, but I'm not glued to it as I thought I would be, just half an hour or so between other games.  I probably just had higher expectations since their first couple of games were so immersive (gothic 1 and 2).  I really really tried to like it, and had faith that it would be better, I would recommend it at $20, but would really suggest waiting for it to be 75% off if ur really wanting to pick it up, and hope if PB make another game, they drop the risen series and do another Gothic, away from the pirate theme and more a medival feel with the 2h weapons and bows.. i miss that.. And maybe try it as early access and listen to the feedback from the gamers.			"

												Its not bad. (you could stop there. Medicore but fun would also do. Feels a bit small at times in terms of real estate to explore but still a better job than many similar crossover / ports.  It is also not so heavily burdened by a terrible field of view as you play in third person and the character doesnt take up the whole screen. Somehow, despite having a fair bit of choice in your direction it still feels pretty linear at times.  Mainly because the areas are  path driven channelling you where your probably meant to be.  Calling it a free roam is pushing it as it is actually far smaller than it appears but true enough.  I have to mention the combat.  It feels pretty awful  early on in the game.  However, if you played the Risen series before it will be familiar.  A positive for the combat is that you do need to consider your timing and enemies are a little more unpredictable, on the other hand, until you develop, your personal skill is less important than building up your character.  It can be very frustrating early on but it does improve a bit as you progress. The NPCs are very wooden and tend to be just standing around doing nothing 99% of the time but the voice acting is pretty good. Characters do have a habit of sounding like one another but then again, they probably would when they are supposed to be from the same place. A little corny, a little mediocre but undoutedly fun.   Annoying that it cant fully utilise PC hardware (you have to switch off anymore than 8 threads or cores but to be honest, the graphics while pretty enough are nothing special so its probably not using half of what it could on a good rig anyway.  I am guessing here but this is a fairly typical console style light weight RPG that is beyond the average for a console RPG but cant match with more open PC RPG's or heavily modded crossovers such as Skyrim.  All things considered  it is worth a bit of a romp through. Is it worth buying?  For me, yes..   It has been a slow year so you on one hand you could say, what else is there?  It does have a fair bit of content and unlike the likes of Witcher 2 will have a little more longevity (I would certainly rate it far higher than TW2 as I like open world games).			"

												Pirahna bytes makes some awesome rpgs, i think they deserve more $$ from the gaming community in general. Im pretty sure this game has been on sale for $1-$3 a few times. Kind of depressing to see companies like this not making that much money. I hope pirahna bytes survives and can keep bringing us exceptional titlesI am currently 60gameplay hours into Gothic 1 (Just found out there is a DX11 overhaul for gothic 1 and 2) and i just love this development team			"

												The game itself isnt too bad but it is let down to the point of wihing that id never bought it because of the combat.Its clunky one sided and flawed, every time you engage in combat you get two or three gang up on you, you havent got enough health, you dont cause enough damage and attacks take ages to initiate and you also end up half way across the map beacuse it lunges forward.In a nutshell, if you iked risen 2 then dont buy this game.

The game controls are clunkier than Assassins Creed the first one.Voice-acting is so garbage it could have been me doing it.I dont recommend this for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unless you just want to see how you should not make a game.I can understand people following the series can relate to this. But as a new player to the Risen franchise, I think this is a step back in video-game design.			"

												I mean I haven't played to long but here is what I've taken from it so far.   The graphics are kinda nice. Yeah ok whatever. The character models are kind of meh. The story might be good?  My main issue with this game is the combat.  It is so terribly boring and unsatisfying when you attack something with your sword.  If you land a blow thats not blocked you knock the enemy an unreasonable distance backwards.  When you do that three hit combo or killing an enemy (I can't remember which one) you do this ridiculous ""finishing move"" where your character just kinda stabs the enemy or does some unnecessary flourish.  Meanwhile, if you have a companion they just kind of sit there while you do this flourish and look at your like you are a complete doofus.  Overall I bet the game has a good story but I just really can't get past the snooze-fest that is the combat system.			"

												Recommended! The best Risen game of three. Not as good as 'Gothic 2', but much better than 'Risen 2' - something in the same league with 'Gothic 3' or 'Gothic 4' ('Arcania' - yes, I liked that game a lot!). Pros:+ A bug-free game from 'Piranha Bytes'?! Now it became a reality. Even all the achievements are working from the very beginning.+ 'Gothic' atmosphere and rather good (albeit banal) story - everything you need to keep playing - and forget about it the next minute after completing the game.+ Mini-games are fun now! And there is quite a nice variety of them - not only 'drinking' and 'arm wrestling', but throwing knives and fighting sea battles.+ No less than 33 hours of play (to say nothing of the two DLC islands).Cons:- The setting is virtually the same as in 'Risen 2'. So it should be called ""Risen 2.5"" or rather ""Risen 2 if the developers could take all the time they need to polish it"". Still, it is fun even for those who played the previous game.- New playing character. No explanations as to his lore...- There are no achievements for DLC on Steam (in difference from the consoles). Why?- Combat could often be irritating. Too many small monsters running around - fighting them could quickly tire you out.			"

												not as good as the previous 2 games, this one starts you in a cutscene-filled tutorial, then kills you by cutscene, as a way to then drop your stats and gear to a 'starting' point. i had to drop my screen resolution to get it to run smoothly, it has a very bad habit of taking control away from the player repeatadely. while previous games did this as well on occasion, it is more pronounced and annoying with this one. patty (from games 1 and 2) and bones(from game 2) make an early appearance. the voice acting quality feels worse overall.

Posted: December 27, 2014
												The only reason I am not recommending this game is it's price tag... the quality of this game is NOT up to par with other titles in the $49.99 price range. I purchased the game during the Holiday sale when it was $24.99, and personally, I believe that's about what this game is worth. I'll list off some things that bothered me and, yes, I understand I've only played the game for about an hour... but that hour alone gave me enough ""feel"" for the game to know that I simply do not enjoy playing it and I probably will not boot it up again. 1. The intro was rushed, and it felt cheap and plagurized.A. You start off on a boat sailing to who knows where, from who knows where (possibly this information is known if you've played Risen 2, which I haven't, but I still had no idea what was going on in the beginning of the game), and seemingly out of no-where, you're attacked by pirate sea creatures STRAIGHT out of Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't have the slightest doubt in my mind that the artists had pictures from PotC up on google as they designed these guys. B. During this intro, the game briefly shows you how to move and look around, jump, attack, unsheath your weapon, shoot your gun, dodge, etc. The controls just feel off to me. If this makes sense, which I hope it does to some of you out there; there are just some games out there with controls so fine-tuned that you could do an obsticle course, jump from object to object, avoid things swinging at you, etc, with ease (think TF2, CS:GO, CoD, Skyrim). In this game there is no way in hell I would be able to jump from object to object or dodge ANYTHING, the controls feel that lousy and unsynced. A side note added onto that... when I hold down the sprint key... I want to sprint NOW, not after a delay of 1 second.2. The story. (FIRST HOUR SPOILER)From what I understood, you're a pirate on a jouney with your sister who, by coincidence, has huge jugs, The intro lets you play through getting attacked by a ship of sea creature pirates captained by a ""Ghost pirate""... who, after losing all of his men onboard to your sword, summons Gyarados which ♥♥♥♥s your♥♥♥♥♥♥up and you're stranded on an Island straight out of the TV series ""Lost"". It then seems your objective is to find or chase down the pirate ghost... at least for the beginning part of the game. I didn't get that far.  3. Voice acting.Imagine the worst home made movie you've ever seen, then imagine paying those people each $1,000 to actually try to act. That's about what the voice acting is like.4. Looting, ""Open world"", other RPG elements.A. The looting system is very off from traditional RPGs. Yes, I get games can be different from others, etc, and that's cool, that's awesome, but not having a menu pop up when you go to loot a creature and instead having it auto loot everything and spam the side of your screen RECIEVED SPIRIT MUSHROOM x 1 !RECIEVED RAW MEAT x 1 !RECIEVED CLAM x 1 !RECIEVED GOLD x 1000!GLORY + 200can get annoying. Strangely enough, however, if you go to loot a container, you ARE given a menu and the choice to loot whatever's in the container. B. Despite claiming to be open world, the game is still very linear. To put into perspective, Skyrim is the obvious king of open world games, you can literally go ANYWHERE. The Witcher 2, on the other hand, is pretty linear, and isn't necessarily open world. This game isn't remotely close to The Witcher 2, and is about as linear as a CoD campaign. C. Other RPG elements such as how the inventory is managed, quests, maps, etc... it all works, but it all feels cheap and rushed. In conclusion, the Risen fanboys will hate me and my review, but crossing over from other RPG's like the Elder Scrolls series, the Diablo series, the Borderlands series, etc, I was not prepared for the incredibly, insultingly, low quality of the game. TL;DR: If you're coming from Skyrim, Borderlands, Diablo, Mass Effect, The Witcher... (all high quality and finely tuned RPGs), and looking for something new whilst staying in the RPG scene, stay away from Risen 3.			"

												Just to say a few words for Gothic fans (and those who read somewhere Gothic is better series).I'm also Gothic series #1 fan.Risen 3 is not Gothic but a completely different setting. If you wanted Gothic 5 (and we all want it), don't buy Risen 3 thinking that's it. It's not.Risen 3 is a different openworld from Gothic games. Here you can go just about anywhere since the start. In Gothics... Well... You can't or if you try, you'll die miserably. In Gothics you have to build your character before trying to survive the desert or mountains part. Sadly, because of Risen 2 reviews, mobs got too easy to kill in Risen 3.Risen 3, apart from nasty CPU cores problem, has almost no bug at all. Gothic 3 had more bugs than patched Skyrim which sounds like a lie but it's not (Skyrim final version still has more than 500 bugs unpatched, Gothic 3 when released had just a few more).In Gothics no mobs respawn endlessly (except wild dogs in desert). In Risen 3, some mobs seem to respawn (wildbirds, bigrats).Risen 3 is the best exploration game out there. You don't know what's behind a corner and you want to know it. If you're adventurous type of a person, buy this game, it's worth every penny.			"

												Risen 3 is a game that I'm comflicted on.It has some pretty nice visuals and nice, original monster design which I really like.Unfortunately it also has awful voice acting and some really clunky combat. I found that over the time I played it the combat felt a little better but it was still awkward. Worst is that the moment when you most feel how clunky the combat is is during the introduction of the game; I came pretty close to dropping it in the first five minutes because of it and the other aspects of the introduction did little to hold it up.My final problem with Risen 3 is just a lack of polish. Little things like:* speaking to someone and having no option to end the conversation among the multiple choices when its super easy to accidentally talk to someone* speaking to people accidentally because loot and speak are the same buttonIn conclusion Risen 3 is a pretty good example of the old saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". Because the cover looks lovely. But the game sucks.(Think my conflict must be because some people rated it well so it might get better later...don't think I'll ever try to find out after the bit I played though).			"

												I have been waiting for good Gothic since Gothic 3. I wouldn't say that first and second Risen's were bad, however they were lacking something. I'm not much in to the Pirates but i enjoyed playing Risen 3. It's a great game and out of all the Gothic i think this one have the best optimization and bugs are very rare. What i liked the most is how they modified some location from previous Risen. However there should be more villages with NPCs that would share interesting stories and quests. The islands fell quiet empty most of the time and there should be more conflict and fights involved with NPCs and I miss the arenas, where are they? I used to love to challenge opponents in each place in previous Gothics to fight me.			"

												I find Risen 3 to be a very atmospheric experience. Pirahna Bytes seem to have a knack with created well thought out land masses that you can remember and recall, long after leaving.I have played Gothic, Gothic II, Risen and Risen 2 to completion multiple times. The Gothic series is one of those gems that just never gets old, no matter how long time goes by.But, to Risen 3.10 hours in, Risen 3 is definitely the best of the Risen franchise. Combining multiple islands and quests seamlessly, without much interuption. Including the old Faction based quests and pursuits. Creating the well known atmosphere of past PB games.I was scepticle, once I saw the piratey beginning. Felt exactly like Risen 2, which I did like, but not as much as I wanted to. Then after a short introduction on an island, things change and open up incredibly. Like, choose anywhere, and go. And you can swim between many points on each island, yes!  Each island holds a different feel and attitude. With different characters and ideologies. Characters have there own agendas and ideas, which I am enjoying. They have added many dialogue sequences dependant on the character that is following you, or location you have entered, or who you're talking to. I have replayed dialogues with diffferent characters, with some interesting dialogue responses, that can change the way the charater interacts with you. Makes them feel more believable. Combat has it's flaws, but is ultimately enjoyable. Some (me) may find it easier then traditional Gothic combat, but animations and cues are properly executed this time around. No more countering, and finding nothing happens, even though you were perfectly timing the counter. It just works. And crystal magic. GREAT. Really fun stuff.Although fetch quests are prominent, I enjoyed walking between points, as to me, the game looks great.I have read many reviews stating that this game looks like a PS2 game, or that it is downright horrible. I think it has a very unique style and artistic flow, that combines many new systems that enhance the overall aesthetic. Also, the lighting, looks incredible. Some scenes are truly breathtaking. Yes, there is certain instances, where the game looks kind of funky, but to base the entire graphical experience on these minor flaws is downright stupid.Anyway, I feel this game is a step in the right direction for Pirahna Bytes.Though, I would love to see a brand new series, more akin to the Gothic series pop up. Anyway, great job team! Thank you! :D "

												The game is okay, but I still would not recommend it (maybe during a sale)Pro:+ The atmosphere of the game is quite good. The pirate/island setting is authentic.+ The graphics are good enough for me.+ Many locations to explore and a lot of secrets to discover.+ The music was okay.+ Many customization options (melee, range or magic skills. accessoires, armor and weapons.)+ The combat is a bit more interesting than the combat in the second game.+ No bugs discovered+ You can choose one of three different factions. You can choose to be good or evil.+ I liked the references to the Gothic series.Con:- The main reason why i cannot recommend the game is because IT IS BORING! The actual main quest that should keep me playing took me about 3 hours. Doing all side quests and explore all the unimportant stuff took me about 48 hours (DLCs included). I have to say that I was not entertained by all this useless exploring and sidequesting.- It is better than the second risen game but it is still a bad sequel to the first game. I have no idea why in the world this game takes place in the southern sea while the actual action takes place on the mainland. The story has no real direction and is totally disappointing. I would expect something magnificent from the third part of a storyline. Until now I am not even sure who or what Titan Lords/Ladies are. - I finished the game 5 days ago and I cannot remember 99% of the characters. They are all faceless, boring and unimportant.- The boss battles are boring and some take a lot of patience because they hide often. (Minor spoiler now: The final boss battle is frustrating as hell if you do not own an AOE attack.)- The overall voice acting is terrible. The main character sounds like he has lung cancer.- The jokes are mediocre.- All choices you make have no real effect on the story or anything else. - The game is too easy (even on hard) and monotonous. I became a melee warrior and was just bashing the left mouse button and killed everthing.			"

												I just finished this game on Medium difficulty today. The story is good. There are some tedius things in the game but they are forgivable. The combat isn't nearly as bad as people are trying to make it out to be. I couldn't even finish getting all my skills. paying and learning skills is supposed to make an improvement in combat and other things in the game. If you started with all your skills or even most of them there would be nothing to strive for. You get a skill you feel accomplished. Slow accomplishments at first but then much greater and greater accomplishments depending on how advanced you get in each category.			"

												I picked this game up at the price of 5.99 since I had it on my wishlist. I'm glad I didn't buy it at full price. The game has a jump in difficulty from the prologue into the actual gameplay. None of the starting islands are easy enough at low level to get anywhere. The enemies move and attack far quicker than the character does. I'm not going to spend a minute rolling around between attacks just to swing and miss because my opponent jumps backwards. It's infuriating.I do not recommend this game.			"

Draw your own conclusions.I try to get a refund instead.Steam refuses refund because I have already played for 14 hours.Never going to touch a title with these publishers again.Going to start buying games from GOG's and elsewhere now.

Large places, a frustrated pirate with flat-jokes, so many places, treasures and people to know, to investigate and ... this ambient, lovely-designed gfx.

												If you liked Risen, and disliked Risen 2, you will definitely dislike Risen 3.I loved the Combat Mechanics in Risen, and that's still entirely gone in Risen 3.All manners of skills you can learn are simply stat increases, or improve certain foods (although there is alchemy and the sort), instead of giving you new ways to fight, so all combat comes down to ""click to attack, and roll to evade"".If you like it, be glad, but if you want a Combat Mechanic like in Risen 1, this is not it.I can't say much about Story etc, because I gave up on the game, however the terrible writing at the beginning of the game, ""dearest brother"" etc, let me expect the worst.

												This is one of the worst RPGs I ever played with the most infuriating combat system ever.  I'm glad I got this on the sale as I would be extremely annoyed had I paid the full RRP for this trash.  First off the voice acting on the main character is the worst I have ever heard on any game, let alone an RPG.  It is truly dreadful and the writing is just as bad, it is like some 12 year old who just learnt the F word had written the script.  Within only an hour or 2 of playing the bad voice acting and writing had already started to grate one me.Then there is the truly awful combat system.  The tutorial shows you how to parry and do combos and is set up so you can do that in the tutuorial but good luck actually trying to do that in the game.  For a start parrying seems to have no effect on beasts like rock spiders and scavengers so the combat ends up with constant dodging and then hitting the LMB to get a quick slash of the sword in which takes precious little health off whatever you are fighting in the beginning before you are dodging again.  This isn't challenging, it is extremely tedious when it seems to take near enough 20 hits to take out various creatures at the start of the game.  It doesn't lend itself well when you are outnumbered either as sooner or later you end up rolling into a strike from 1 of the 3 enemies you end up being surrounded by frequently.  Then of course if you happen to dodge in to vegetation you can't see what is going on resulting in being struck again.  Your character is also slow to respond to the LMB and often gets hit before completing the strike and yet your enemies seem to be able to jump backwards at alarming speed so many of your strikes don't hit home.  This makes one on one tedious enough but being outnumbered even more so and I quickly found myself going through provisions and rum, even on the easy setting just because I don't have the patience to spending an hour on each fight constantly dodging and rolling around the place. I don't get the reviews complaining how OP your character gets - I found him hideously underpowered at the start just trying to do the tedious quest of going to all the mines in order to join the guardians when having to go through seemingly undending rock spiders, shadow warriors and hellhounds.  After just 4 hours playing I have had enough of the game already with the immensely repetitive dodge/strike nonsense.The only positive is that the game does look nice but with the dreadful combat system and equally bad voice acting (at least from the main character) I can't recommend this game, in fact I would save time and money and don't buy it in the first place.

												I really tried to like this game. I lôike the thrre Gothic games and the frst Risen (the second one ws garbage) and I thought this one would be OK. It is not.In some games, you arrive at a point where tyou don't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about the story anymore, you just want to finish for the sake of finishig. Here I had that moment after leaving the first island. The second island I went to felt empty - almost noone there and it was supposed to be a living town. I found a few locked chests, but one single frickin' lockpick. And the battle system is completely lousy. Your character takes ages between sword swings, so much that a few Scavengers (pretty much the weekest foe) can be hard to kill. A fencing duel against a human(oid) with a weapon is a matter of more luck than skill. And there is nothing really driving you to keep going.Leave this one and play the first Risen or Gothic III. Much, much better choices than this.			"

												DO NOT LISTEN TO PROFESSIONAL REVIEWS, IGN and Gamespot both gave this game deceptively bad reviews. I will say that I watched some reviews whining and complaining on how bad this is or how ""average"" this is but I recommend you get the game on sale if you're uneasy about it. I received it as a gift and I personally think it's been unjustly panned by reviewers. The combat has a learning curve but when you get used to the timing, it can be pretty fun. The story is kinda crazy, most of the characters are nicely voiced with unique attitudes (The shaman is really weird though), but there are moments when you will see a characters face that resembles a previous character you have encountered. Some voices seem off in how the dialog is delivered and the shaman, though funny at times, can get repetitive with his one liners during combat. There is a ton of content in this game and surpirsingly the graphics look quite nice though not mindblowing as this is also on PS3. Thankfully the PC version looks and performs much better (Duh). For those who want fluid smooth animations though, you may not like the attack animations, though it's not as bad as demonicons slo-mo loaded combat. Some may also be put off by the need for gold to learn skills, but you can find places in this game where they basically throw gold at you, if you take on a lot of side quests. The story has a sort of pirate theme but it's overall a means to an end. If you want a blockbuster story, you won't find it here. You may find great gameplay and hours of quests to kill time, but not much hand holding. The map is a very appreciated addition over Risen 2, I found it frustrating that Risen 2 lacked a map, making pathfinding really tedious.You also have 3 factions to choose from, each with unique abilities and gameplay. Overall, there are a lot of reasons to give Risen 3 a try, save for the so-so story.Gameplay:8Graphics:8Story:7.5Sound/Voice:7Replayability:8Overall:8 "

												If there is one game that does not deserve the bad critics its gotten, it is this one! A cannot for the life of me understand why people bash it so much.I have spent 50+ hours so far and I keep comming back for more. For fans of the old Piranha Bytes games this is a must buy!Don't believe the bad hype about bad combat system and reuse of content from Risen 2! It's simply not true... People that claim that this is Risen 2.5 are lying!Granted the combat system could have been better, but it is functional and a big improvement compared to the abysmal combat system in Risen 2. Regarding reuse of contant... Yes some of the islands from Risen 2 is still there, but they have been redone from scratch and there are also 2 islands that are completly new and those are more medieval in apperance.The story is cliche, and the voice acting are typical Piranha as is the case with all of their games. But after the total miss that was Risen 2 I am glad to see that they once again deliver an entertaining and fun game that will keep your interest for weeks.			"

The story and overall content was superb even if some people didn't appreciate it...  I applaud Piranha Bytes on another amazing classic!  Everything came together well in the end story and the climax was short but worthy...  The combat may seem clunky but you once you get used to it, the simpleness isn't bad .. Magic on any level is fun whether it is mage, voodoo or demon hunter...  I chose Demon Hunter and loved it...  Was it worth my investment and time?  Definately!			"

												After the very mediocre Risen 2, I was wary if Risen 3 was worth a look. And I am happy to say that it really is. If you liked Risen 1 and the Gothic series, then you will probably like this one too. The mostly very pretty world feels as lived in and gritty as ever, the combat system has improved greatly and exploring the different islands is fun. Quest design could be more interesting though - almost every one is a variation of ""fetch x and murder y on the way"".A lot of the atmosphere comes from the rough and quirky voice acting, which is excellent in German, but truly miserable in the English version. If you know German, that's the way you should play it.			"

												I'm a big fan of the original Gothic Series, and I quite enjoyed Risen 1 & 2, but this last installment was mostly disappointing.pro:- Nicely build world with O.K. graphics and good atmosphere- PB-style dialogues and story, if you are into itcons:- REALLY ANNOYING combat system. I appreciate that they tried something new other than the mindless ""click-to-death""-system of earlier games, but this time they just failed. Instead of attack-spamming you have to keep spamming evasion rolls, the combat often feels random and parrying is a game of chance, even the most basic critters attack really fast and without a telltale sign. The melee targeting system does'nt work out at all: When you fight more than two enemies simultaneously, it is almost impossible to target a specific individual, so that it is just a random chaotic beating in all directions. Often you hit in a direction where there is no enemy at all, or the focus stays on a recently killed enemy.- Balancing is crap. Some boss fights are extremely unfair if you do not posess certain skills or magic spells (the Margoloth fight for example).Although I love the general PB-retro-charme of the game, I can not recommend it.

 Risen 3 - Titand Lords(Scroll down for a tl;dr version.)As a fan of the classic Gothic series I was really looking forward for this game, since I heard that Piranha Bytes got back the rights of the Gothic series. And also, when I started playing this game, I was not disappointed regarding this aspect; I was amazed by all the elements and jokes that I knew from Gothic. Finally, I could fight some Scavengers again. But this is not what makes it a good game. Actually, I was uncertain about liking or disliking the game.Pros: + Level/map design: There are caribbean-like islands in the south, and ""not-so-sunny"" islands, like an island with swamp, a somehow big forest or partially wasteland (with lava and burnt down trees) + Very much related to the previous point: Exploration. I am pretty sure that I did all possible quests, that I collected every piece of loot, and I did not even get tired of it. And still there was room for more, because it did not use the parrot a lot. + Incredible high amount of quests + The fractions: I liked the division of the voodoo pirates, the wardens and the demon hunters. Not only stupid bad guys from king's army and good guys from the rebels. + They finally gave me some Gothic-feeling again:  E.g. you can screw around with some peasants or Jack who was kicked out of his light-house, like in Gothic II. + Something that I found out too late: The evil dialog options are really funny. I really laughed when I was mad at some of the gnomes. (E.g. the one that is enslaved, where you could go and tell him ""Sorry, but I needed the money."" After you got paid for not telling anybody that he is enslaved.)Cons: - The so called ""story"": Like in Risen 1, the end of the game feels artificially stretched. Risen 2 did this far better. Not only this, the story is just weak in total. - Combat system - Difficulty level far too low( - Despite the environment's variety, there is no snow level :'( )Risen 3 is, in my opinion, not a milestone in the history of RPGs. But it does quite a good job. Also, I would not have thought about thumbs down, if there wasn't this horrible last island. Why did the developers think like ""For the end of the story, let's build the f***ing largest island, tell the hero that time is running out so bad, but still there is time to run from one side of the island to the other, just to find some camps, that aren't even useful."" Seriously Piranha Bytes, what the f**k? Moreover, you (the developers) could have just let Eldric and the other two die. I really would have prefered it in this way. But no, even in the hardest fight in the history of humans, no ""important"" characters dies (excluding Horas). That is a childish story. But I was able to spend around 70 hours of fun with that game, which I pretty much like (Until now I spend 80h playing this game. So 10h of ""not-fun"".)Sorry, if you expected more Gothic related information. In the draft I had much of this stuff, but I decided to remove these things more or less completely. I think I would have to replay Gothic I and II, to being capable of giving a fair review.TL;DRDid you enjoy playing Risen and Risen 2? Then you will most likely also enjoy this game. Because Risen 3 feels like a good extension to the pirate setting of Risen 2. If you don't like becoming a pirate or a voodoo priest, just become a mage or demon hunter, which I think are like the dragon hunters from Gothic II.			"

												DO NOT LISTEN TO PROFESSIONAL REVIEWS, IGN and Gamespot both gave this game deceptively bad reviews. I will say that I watched some reviews whining and complaining on how bad this is or how ""average"" this is but I recommend you get the game on sale if you're uneasy about it. I received it as a gift and I personally think it's been unjustly panned by reviewers. The combat has a learning curve but when you get used to the timing, it can be pretty fun. The story is kinda crazy, most of the characters are nicely voiced with unique attitudes (The shaman is really weird though), but there are moments when you will see a characters face that resembles a previous character you have encountered. Some voices seem off in how the dialog is delivered and the shaman, though funny at times, can get repetitive with his one liners during combat. There is a ton of content in this game and surpirsingly the graphics look quite nice though not mindblowing as this is also on PS3. Thankfully the PC version looks and performs much better (Duh). For those who want fluid smooth animations though, you may not like the attack animations, though it's not as bad as demonicons slo-mo loaded combat. Some may also be put off by the need for gold to learn skills, but you can find places in this game where they basically throw gold at you, if you take on a lot of side quests. The story has a sort of pirate theme but it's overall a means to an end. If you want a blockbuster story, you won't find it here. You may find great gameplay and hours of quests to kill time, but not much hand holding. The map is a very appreciated addition over Risen 2, I found it frustrating that Risen 2 lacked a map, making pathfinding really tedious.You also have 3 factions to choose from, each with unique abilities and gameplay. Overall, there are a lot of reasons to give Risen 3 a try, save for the so-so story.Gameplay:8Graphics:8Story:7.5Sound/Voice:7Replayability:8Overall:8 "

												If there is one game that does not deserve the bad critics its gotten, it is this one! A cannot for the life of me understand why people bash it so much.I have spent 50+ hours so far and I keep comming back for more. For fans of the old Piranha Bytes games this is a must buy!Don't believe the bad hype about bad combat system and reuse of content from Risen 2! It's simply not true... People that claim that this is Risen 2.5 are lying!Granted the combat system could have been better, but it is functional and a big improvement compared to the abysmal combat system in Risen 2. Regarding reuse of contant... Yes some of the islands from Risen 2 is still there, but they have been redone from scratch and there are also 2 islands that are completly new and those are more medieval in apperance.The story is cliche, and the voice acting are typical Piranha as is the case with all of their games. But after the total miss that was Risen 2 I am glad to see that they once again deliver an entertaining and fun game that will keep your interest for weeks.			"

The story and overall content was superb even if some people didn't appreciate it...  I applaud Piranha Bytes on another amazing classic!  Everything came together well in the end story and the climax was short but worthy...  The combat may seem clunky but you once you get used to it, the simpleness isn't bad ..

												After the very mediocre Risen 2, I was wary if Risen 3 was worth a look. And I am happy to say that it really is. If you liked Risen 1 and the Gothic series, then you will probably like this one too. The mostly very pretty world feels as lived in and gritty as ever, the combat system has improved greatly and exploring the different islands is fun. Quest design could be more interesting though - almost every one is a variation of ""fetch x and murder y on the way"".A lot of the atmosphere comes from the rough and quirky voice acting, which is excellent in German, but truly miserable in the English version. If you know German, that's the way you should play it.			"

												Got this during a sale so didn't have to pay too much for it. Combat is boring, animations are terrible and after a recent update, my character and a few of my companions no longer have heads which makes it quite amusing watching people not be bothered by the headless warriors. I joined the tribals and lost my torso, still had arms, legs and a head. Demon hunters lost heads and mages lost their arms. The reason I love this game is because of the story, I like long stories and games which take a long time to finish, nothing worse than playing for 3 hours and either becoming bored or finishing the game. Other than my amusing graphical bugs, I definitely recommend the game. Also, boring combat can be good if you don't want it overly complex. Two buttons and a trigger for attack and parry, one button to roll away and then you are almost invincible.			"

												Risen 3 is laughably bad. For a few minutes I thought it might be a parody game, a Sharknado of gaming where the developers were intentionally trying to make things as laughbaly awful as possible. Terrible voice acting, stilted animations, laggy and boring combat and a generally unprofessional polish and feel. The graphics are bizarre; the game came out in 2014 yet somehow looks much, much older. The environments are passable, but the character models are stilted and poorly put together. The interaction with my ""companion"", an entity that a 13 year-old boy would find over-sexualized, was, like the rest of the game, stilted and awkward. She spent much of her time pointing out glaringly obvious gameplay mechanics. I lasted a half-hour. I cannot imagine the game improved even marginally after that. If this was a game made by a couple of college students for a senior-level games programming class, then I have been overly harsh. Otherwise, this effort is an embarrassment and to date the only Steam game where I have asked for a refund.			"

The dialogue is so bland and artificial you might as well have skipped the talking graphics and just shown the voice actors in the studio talking into a microphone. The game play seems to be more or less exactly the same as the previous game.I was hooked on the story line in the last game and coming back to this makes me cringe. They were NOT brother and sister. He was NOT steelbeards son. There was a romance between them in the last game.New: I was bored and thought I'd give the game another try. Can I give it another bad recommendation?

												A marked improvement over Risen 2, however there are still some areas that need work on. Combat animations are way too long, making it that most enemies can stun lock you without you being able to break out of it. Most of the quests are fetch/kill X amount quests and I'm pretty sure the main character has throat cancer (Although this might be a positive since it means Piranha Bytes give jobs to cancer vicitms) The exploration is still rock solid and fun, movement is fluid, the story is really good and the magic system is back and better than ever. I got this game for $5.99 and I didnt regret until the update gave me all the dlc's then brok my save's by removing them. Hopefully deep silvr and PB fix this so i can change my rating to positive, since i like this game.Edit: The problem has finally been fixed. PB has given everyone with the issue the dlc for free and now I can go back to enjoying the game.			"

												This is a really fun game. The begining is a little tedious with a really slow progression system. However once you get passed the first few hours it becomes a very fun full game. I enjoyed it massively. The combat will take a little time getting used to but trust me its worth it. The story is fun the diversity of classes and camps is decent.Overall a solid game with lots of good ideas a 9/10 imo.			"

												A brilliant follow-up to Risen 1 and 2. Those are the same guys who produced the classic Gothic series, and this game should be seriously taken into consideration.Pros:- Nice graphics, despite the age- nice way of putting together the fantasy background of Risen 1 and the pirate theme of Risen 2- the story does not make much sense, but it is captivating nonetheless- different factions mean completely different sets of abilities- great atmosphere, beautiful design of the locations, each one with specific traitsCons:- a bit unbalanced: challenging at the beginning, too easy at the end- weak A.I.: it seems like both the enemies and the NPCs do not exist unless you stare at them; as soon as they enter your field of view they start moving, before then they sort of hang around awkwardly. Your companions are also kind of useless.Give it a try!			"

												As a huge fan of Gothic 1 and 2: After Risen 2 I didn't have any expectations for Risen 3 and I only picked it up after it was dirt cheap. And boy, was I surprised! Ok, start is rough, but let's be honest - which PB game's start isn't. After that the game does pick up and if you go for the crystal magic path, you can perform some pretty fun magic moves. Beats those dull Skyrim spells by a mile!I would suggest playing the game with German audio if possible. PB was never renowned for their English versions and after first 10 minutes, I switched from eng to deu and never looked back.If you're a PB games fan, I can only recommend giving this game a try. Especially if you can get your hands on it during a sale. It's no masterpiece, but quests are fun, most characters are just enough cheezy to still be enjoyable and you get used to combat eventually. Just use your companions until then. And if you like weird remarks, I suggest Bones.Overall, an enjoyable, decent RPG. Worth the money, just don't expect the next Gothic masterpiece. Let's just accept the fact that we'll never get one and move on.			"

												I liked the game very much. I think it was the best of the Risen series. Mostly I play magicians, but in Risen 1 and 2 it wasn't possible. In Part 1 you could just miss the opportunity to join the Wizards, in Part 2 there was only the weak Voodoo for completing quests without fighting.But in Part 3 there was the good, old fashioned fireball and healing spell (without consuming mana potions).

												First of all i have played and enjoyed risen 1, and played about 20mins of the demo for risen 2 (hated it, just couldnt get into it,) but risen 3 on the other hand is amazing. I highly reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpg's or open world games. I pre ordered this game because it looked quite promising and it highly exceeded my expectations. There are tons of areas to explore. The game is broken up into islands, all which have a good variety of enviornments, enemies, people, ect. There are different factions which you choose to join in the game and each gives you a unique playstyle, and quests so there is need for replayability. The game is filled with tons of quests, and many which are quite enjoyable, not the typical oh go here and collect 10 tree roots and get a reward kind of quests. There is tons of dialoge in this game and the voice acting isnt perfect but its quite acceptable in my opinion, they throw in humor sometimes too which is great. This game has a really good atmosphere to it, someting which i enjoyed about risen 1. Soundtrack in this game is also superb. A neat twist to this game as well, you use a ship to travel from island to island, and sometimes there are random encounters and you'll have to fight off enemy ships or sea monsters. The combat in the game is a little clunky, but it just took some time getting used to. Once you build your strength abit it becomes much more enjoyable, its just a little tough in the beginning. I usually dont take the time to write reviews, but i am enjoying this game very much, and since its an rpg theyre automatically competing with the big companies that make skyrim, dragon age, ect. So im happy to voice my opinion of the game for others to see and hopefully they will give it a try.			"

												Phiranna Bytes may not be earning awards for stability, but they delivered again on a game that explains why they have produced three of my favorite RPGs.  In the spirit of the original two Gothic's, and the original Risen is an open-ended and rather buggy adventure for RPG enthusiasts, with a layer of modern polish and features that really brings it to life.  The game is rough around the edges, but has more personality and charm than you'll get out of the latest Dragon Age.  It harkens back to a time when people were more concerned with what they could do than how it looked to be doing it.Once you get through the fairly standard 'tutorial' and intro sequence, the game opens up.  You are free to make mistakes and follow the story at your own leisure and choosing.  This means you can go places you shouldn't be and do things that make your life harder.  This isn't a point-and-click follow the dotted line adventure, this time you are in charge with nothing more than your sense of adventure and desire to explore to fuel you.  Thanks PB!  After Risen 2 I was skeptical, but you've put those fears to rest.			"

												Its a good game for somebody who is in between a casual player and hard-core player, and has not a lot of time, but still wants a game that you could finish in more than one sitting.As a first timer in the series, I did enjoy how stress free the quests are. Unlike other games, eg Skyrim, Fall-out, etc., I do not to have an extensive reasearch to just finish a quest in my liking. Other than that, many areas of the game could be imporved.If you want to play this game, either wait for a sale, like 40% and above, to buy it. Didn't bought the game in steam, and didn't pay the total of $62 to get the game and its dlc. So its a good game, not in par with the ones that I have stated above, but still a good one.			"

												People complain about the characters being boring, the dialogs and voice acting being bad, I don't mind that. I don't mind a mediocre 3rd person RPG, I enjoy them anyway.What really ticks me off is the extremely unbalanced melee combat of this game. I mean, what the hell? Every enemy attacks faster than the hero. The hero first has to swing his blade for even a standard attack. This gives the enemys plenty of time to attack themselves. Basically, the hero needs about one second to commence a standard attack, while an enemy needs half the time. Thus you can expect the enemy to hit you during your attack, interrupting it.Enemies do combo attacks, meaning they will knock you back and onto the ground without you being able to do anything. Even on the starting island, I spent more time laying on the ground than actually doing anything. Feels strongly reminescent of the boars from Gothic 3. Only in Risen 3, pretty much every enemy is a boar.Now imagine fighting enemies in groups.As long as there isn't some proper balancing here, I can't recommend this game.			"

												Risen 3 shows some improvement in the interface over Risen 2, but still far more overburdening than the interface in Risen. Again, I had hoped that becaue it is a series bearing the same name, that it was more of a seqeul to the previous versions. Risen 3 was a bit more related to Risen 2, but still only related to the first by name and style, not story. Too much time was spent navigating the interface, detracting from gameplay, though it was easier to use than in Risen 2. As has been the case in the previous two Risen games, a little more dialogue for the storyline than I like. The storyline itself was interesting and engaging. The quests had a little better flow than Risen 2...the flow was brought back closer to the quality I found in the first Risen, but not quite there. I wish there was a 'sort of' button when the review asks if I would recommend. I don't want to give it a no, but cannot give it a solid 'Yes'. I simply did not enjoy it enough myself, though with some of the clean up to the interface and a little more flow to the quests, could recommend it to those I know don't mind a busy interface and lots of dialogue.

												Really enjoyed Risen 1 and 2 and was looking forward to playing 3, but I was terribly disappointed right away. This feels like a huge step down. I will admit that I would have tried to give it more of a chance if not for the fact that there is a 2 hour limit before steam refuses to refund you so I only have a little bit to say.If you are sensitive to motion sickness, reconsider buying this game. The frame rate is terrible and I was feeling sick in under an hour. Another reason why I did not give this game a 2nd chance. This was not an issue for me in the other Risen games. Game play early on just feels clunky and the voice acting isn't the worst, but it's still pretty bad. The story starts off pretty bland too, though I think they try to make you forget that tiny little fact by having what is essentially a stripper following you around at the start. Yeah, that's not gonna work on me... and after reading more reviews, I'm glad I got this refunded.			"

												Here I was about to give another good review to a Gothic/Risen game...First, this is actually a pretty fun game with good level design, character development choices, varied quests and decent visials. they even finally got over their ridiculous need for niche super twitch combat.But, and with this company there is always a but, it totally fails in progression/scaling because, frankly, there isn't any. In a vain effort to keep both ""open world"" and no ""bethesda style monster scaling"" they made a game where after you complete a third of it, there is no longer any challenge at all from even the most powerful opponents. As soon as you have finished a major island or two you have all the xp, gear and magic potency to stomp any and all opposition, with your only recourse to be cranking up the difficulty which just makes monsters one shot you if you fail to stun lock them.

												The Visuals have improved over its predecessors. But that is pretty much the only thing.Dialogue is a major issue, it is so badly written that it is hard to believe Piranha is serious about it.Underlying is exactly the same Game as always. There are attempts here and there to spice it up with something new, utility Spells, scripted events and so on. But none of that is executed good enough to actually be an improvement. Opposite, actually.After the already mediocre second Risen, this is just another step down the drain. Sorry Piranha, this doesn't work anymore, i'm out.			"

												If you really liked Risen 1 & 2 and/or the Gothic series, try it. But don't go in there with somewhat high expectations.The story is something between AC4 and Pirates of the Caribbean. Not deep, not shallow, not very original. The phrasing of Quests didn't impress me positively. I'm sure there would've been another way than ""Next Quest: Pull on the lever"". ""Open the temple door"" could've sounded a little tiny bit better.I'm playing with a controller (don't give me♥♥♥♥♥♥for that, it's easier to handle than a mouse with a wrist beyond repair), and it's just frustrating.Controls are clunky and it's responding late or not at all sometimes. Press the block button - get hit - block. Dodging in the direction you want? Eeeh, I'll try my best and- whoops got hit. I ended up spamming the Dodge button in every fight.Have your weapon drawn and want to open a door or pick up loot? No. Away with your weapon, manually. In a painfully slow animation. Something attacks you and is already in your face? Press B. Then A. Got hit? Too bad. Kind of like the chinese blackmarket rip-off of Assassin's Creed's combat.The camera's jerking around making it almost impossible to adjust it to your likings: A slight tilt to the left with the joystick results in a complete turn around-up-down-left-right making it stupidly hard to see or hit any enemy. Even without your doing, it'll just zoom in or out at the worst times. Fighting in a tight spot and dodging, against a wall because you can't really control the direction, and you're done for. It's no help to have a close up on that stone behind me, really.Lots of unneccesary small cut scenes. Opening a chest is fine, but I do not need to see the same kneeling down-opening chest-looking inside every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. They tried to make a kill cam as well, but it only takes time and isn't anything special. I'd rather do without. Accidentally facing Patty and pressing A results in yet another short cut scene whereas she tells you 'Not now, later' most of the time. Voice acting makes it all the worse. First look, the world looks like it's been modelled with lots of love. Second look, not so much. The screenshots are deceiving in my opinion - I just recently built this PC. The best of the best, because I like nice looking games, and i certainly want them to run smoothly.This however, I could play on my Mothers Laptop and it would still look the same. The highest settings are a joke. It's atmospheric, don't get me wrong, But not aesthetic. If you told me that this game came out in 2008, I'd believe you.And OH MY GOD how slow do you have to walk. That is ridiculous. Running ain't better.			"

Definition of clunkyIs this the worst RPG ever? Well, maybe it‘s not the worst. I heard about Raven‘s cry and it‘s re-release Vendetta which now is taken from steam too, but because of awful user feedback i did not even consider to support that scam of a game. This one on the other hand has plenty of good reviews and feedback. But how? Probably from the people who only played Piranha Bytes  games?Since the Gothic 3 Piranha Bytes are making horrible games. I remember Gothic 3, it was beautiful looking game at the time, but it had worst combat ever and messed up quest system, i just stopped playing that crap after a few hours.I did not play Risen and only tried Risen 2 for an hour or so and uninstalled it. Risen 3 titan lords is a very strong contender for the worst combat in an RPG game. It‘s like Piranha Bytes do this intentionally, just to irritate people.The combat makes this game unplayable. It‘s absolutely broken. Your moves are so slow that you just can‘t hit anything, you slowly swing your sword and get interrupted by the enemies attack. If you try to block them and attack after blocking, the enemy just jumps away in a speed of lightning and you miss, then immediately you get attacked again. Blocking does not always work, i‘d say you can‘t block 1/3 of attacks. You/enemies getting stuck on a rock, or camera rotating randomly to the angle where you can‘t see anything is nothing compared to awful combat. The controls are unresponsive and clunky, your character is very slow. In addition to the sword you can shoot a gun which again is so slow that you get attacked by an enemy which moves and react too fast before you shoot the gun. And if you get lucky to use your gun without interruption it misses most of the time even if the enemy is 2 meters away. But there are things which will make you laugh instead of being angry. The voice acting, it‘s hilarious, i don‘t know if it‘s intentional but it‘s so bad that it‘s making you laugh. Generic NPC‘s have better voice acting than main characters.Dialogues are boring and uninteresting. Same as quests. It is generic as it can be. Also quest tracking doesn‘t work most of the time. The map is pointless, NPC's or shops aren't marked on it, but gladly you don‘t need to search for shops long in those cities with 3 traders and other 2 random people giving you generic quests.Game imitates the feeling of open world. Similar to Age of reckoning. But Risen 3 does it much worse. The locations are much much smaller. It‘s not an open world game!The graphics probably is the best thing in this game. It‘s average but at least it‘s not ugly. Character models is another thing, they‘re ugly and generic, with poor animations and almost no face animations.Avoid this game. Avoid it even if on sale at 75%. I regret my decision buying it for that price. It‘s not worth your time, unless you feel obliged to play it because you paid for it, there‘s no reason to play it. Just stay away and stop supporting Piranha Bytes.Pros:PattyCons:GraphicsVoice actingGeneric questsPoor combatSmall generic mapsClunky unresponsive controls			"

												this game has the worst combat system in a game that I have ever played. There is no way in hell that I could sit through this entire game with a combat system like this. Its slow, unresponsive and just stupid. You literally stop mid swing when using your sword allowing the enemy to hit you 2 or 3 times during that time. The short time I played this I never felt like even fighting because it was so bad, hell I think I ran from a freakin duck or 2. Some people may have patience with stuff like this but I dont especially if the rest of the game is not great either. Such as voice acting etc. I hated the game though and recommend you never buy it.			"

												Risen 3 isn't what I expected it to be. When looking at its features and trailers I got quite excited about it, but when I got my hands on, I felt like this was just another poorly designed Fable game. Fighting mechanics are awfull, whether it is by magic or sword, movement is ridiculous and clumsy, and I am not going to spend another minute playing this.			"

												Oh how i love Risen, i'm that one in minority who likes whole series. Risen 1 was my favourite but Dark Waters was great too, i'm thinking about finishing it again now. If you love Gothic/Witcher type of games you'll enjoy Risen 3, it's pretty hardcore specially in the beginning but as soon as you rank up your stats and get better armor/weapons it's waay easier. Most people don't like this game because of ""AngryJoe"" or judging by first 2 hours of game - that sucks 'cause the more you play it the better it is, everytime i play Risen or Gothic series i find myself loosing all day playing it, it really grows on you. Last chapter is very well written and explains everything (when i found main hero from Risen 1 & 2 by randomly exploring wilderness i was so happy i don't know why :D). Graphics are improved since August 2015 so it's really good looking game in it's own way. Humor is perfect even in the middle of credits there's special thanks to ""Captain Obvious 2013. who is thanking his parents for his existence""...I rate it: ""I'm gonna make an hat out of your skin""/10			"

												EDIT:I've made a review before finishing the game, and now I'm going to review again.This game isn't the best RPG I ever played, but I garantee you, it'll be one of the most funny and enjoyable since Skyrim.+ Good story, but with some clichés+ Great improvement in voice acting (still, the main character's is aweful) comparing to the previous games in the series+Despite the game's engine being old, the shadow and lightning effect is one of the best out there, providing beautiful and colorful scenarios+ Cool artwork+ Most of the quests are original and they don't repeat a lot.+ Tons of secret treasures and chambers to be discovered+ It give's you that Gothic series feeling, which is really nice+ Combat system is captivating...-... if you get through the first hours frustration- Soundtrack is just decent, it could be much better- Face expressions are pratically nonexistent- There could be more to loot in the maps- The ship battles are cool, but it gets old real quick- Some missions are just tedious- Some bugs here and there- IA is mediocre, companions get lost frequently and after some hours in the game, the enemies are just dead meat-Dialogues are too lengthy- If you played Risen 2, you'll recognize most of the scenarios, since they are basically the sameFinal: If you can get through the frustration of the first hours, you will discover a magnificent and original RPG, that gives a perfect balance between a pirates and a common RPG theme. There's a discover here, the scenarios are incredibly rich, there's secrets everywhere, and the story is compelling. Of course, you can see that the budget wasn't very high: The combat system suffered great improvements, but it lacks some adjustments; the voice acting could be a lot better; the game engine is recycled (still, huge improvements!), some bugs are just really annoying. But still, this game is a must have in every RPG-lover collection. Specially the Gothic fans. Seriously, it's the first time in a decade that a game gives me a Gothic game feeling.Final Score: 8/10			"

												I am approximately four hours into this game and I have to admit that I am very hooked. The excellent voice-acting, combined with the yes, cliched, yet still somehow comelling quests work well, and there have been several occassions so far that I have just stepped back as if while watching a Kubrick fil and admired the stunning graphics. Taken for what it is, a rollicking, somewhat predictible yet highly polished effort, this is well worth the money. My only major quibble is the inability to turn off the HUD, especially that inventory bar at the bottom of the screen. This really detracts from the overall experience. 8.6 out of 10. I've kept this long after I've put Skyrim away, and the Witcher, while clearly superior in every aspect, is a  bit too serious after two vodka tonics. Relax and have fun after a hard days work. Play Risen 3!			"

												A pretty good game for sure!  I got about 60 hours of fun with it using both DLCs.On the plus sideGreat exploration!  They don't limit you so don't be surprised when you finish a quest you didn't even know about yet.Graphics are quite nice.  There's an ""enhanced"" edition rumored but the stock graphics are really quite nice.Good quests.  Organization of the quest log can be a bit dicey (was that an island quest or a crew quest??) but having so many quests that they can be a bit hard to track is a great problem to have.A nice sprinkling of good humor.Mostly bug-free.  There are a few bugs here and there but nothing that really hurt my fun.Good autosave PLUS quick save PLUS named save system.  Why can't all games do this?On the minus sideManual level scaling (see below).Too few monster types.Sea battles start interesting but get tedious.  (Luckily, there's only a few.)Inventory gets too huge to find things.The game is open world and is intent on letting you go wherever you want, with only a few areas locked off.  Unfortunatly, that means that at least half of each island is full of stuff you can defeat with your starting character!  (The fog island DLC is an exception to this.)  So, once you finish a bunch of the first island you go to, the second will be a bit easy and the others will be a LOT easy.  To counter that, you'll need to up the difficulty level as you go along - essentially doing your own level scaling.The game has lots of crafting.  You can craft potions, rum, spell scrolls/stones/dolls, and so on.  I collected TONS of crafting ingredients but I barely used any.  Why?  See the previous paragraph.  Why bother making yourself stronger when the game isn't difficult?While the game has major balance issues as the game goes on, don't let that throw you.  The game is fun!  Just don't make yourself too powerful and keep pushing the difficulty up.  There's much to see and many, many people to chat with!			"

												The best looking game in the series but the laziest and weakest overall.Except for the visuals there really isn't anything that's improved since Risen 2 and much has gotten worse. The Good:I like the visuals, the enhanced edition really looks good.  The models, the colors, and the overall look and feel of the environments are well done.  There are are few small anomalies here and there but nothing horrible or overly distracting.  Weather effects could be a bit better, but it doens't really take away anything.I like the magic.  While I haven't used all the systems if the others are similay to the way voodoo works then that's pretty good.  While magic isn't a very in depth process it's interesting and diverse enough to be fun to use.I have always liked the quest system, where you can complete the goals of a quest even before you get assigned the quest.  So if you kill all the creatures in some corner and then come across a guy who gives you the quest to go kill the creatures in that corner, you can complete it right then and there.Some minor (and major) rewards for exploring.  I like being able to look up at some rocks and ask ""What's up there?"" and much of the time I am able to clime up there and find something there; a dead body, some gold or food, or whatever.  Very rarely have I been disappointed from randomly exploring the areas.The BadSo mcuh of in this game is left over from the previous games.  Very little is completely new.  You'll interact with just about everyone you met before in the previous games, many of these meetings are forced and add absolutely noting to the plot. Especially the ones you meet in your very short stints into the underworld which are forced upon you at various times when you go to sleep.  Boring and a complete waste of time.Combat still sucks♥♥♥♥♥  You pretty much have the same moves you did in Risen 2 and most of the enemies still use the same tired old attack routines.  Save for a couple of the newer mini bosses and bosses every creature uses the same attack pattern that existed in previous game.  It truly boggles my mind that an alligator has teh exact same attack pattern as the wild beaked birds. Combat adds almost nothing new in installment.  Even my voodoo combat is the same as my melee combat save that it will hit multiple creatures rather than just one.  Not to mention even on hard this game is easy save for the random times the AI just goes ballistic and starts throwing up a stream of attacks there is no way you can defend against.  Also, some monsters, despite how powerful your armor is, will kill in one hit if you fail to dodge.  Combat is an annoying chore instead of a fun activity.Auto saves:  Autosaves are nice, but they are very strangely activated.  Most are okay, but there are times where they should be used when they're not.  An autosave should activate right a fast travel and tehy aren't.  If you forget to save after a fast trave to your ship and then travel to another island and then get killed by something on the beach, when you reload you'll be way back on that other island.  Also, I have encounterd puzzles where once you solve them you get ambushed and if you don't save and get killed you have to solve the puzzle again.  One took me 10 minutes to solve and I got ambushed, die almost instantly, and had to redo the god damn puzzle.  That's a horrible flaw.  Autosave on complete puzzles is a must.Vague quest resolution:  A few quests are completely vague in how they are supposed to be resolved.  One in particular I have done every single quest on the isle of mages and all I get is ""I still have soem things to do before we can start"" with absolutely no clue what I need to do or am waiting for.Companions:  Kinda hand for combat, though they're really slow to start fighting (I can fimish most foes before the companion even makes one attack) they are almost always in your way when you wanna loot the corpses.  You have to specifically make sure the corpse is highlighted because you companion will usually be right here in your face when trying to loot.  This is annoying as hell.The underworld:  Often times when you sleep you're whisked away into a stint in the underworld which serves one of two purposes.  So you can have a brief chat with someone you killed in Risen 2 which adds nothing to the game in the least and another to collect ""soul dust"" which can help elevate your soul rank, but they always end abruptly as you collect one or two and then a creature appears and kicks you out of the underworld.The UglyThe main character is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  This guy is absolute o fun to play unless you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Even if you follow the ""good"" path everything that comes out of this guys mouth is pure garbage.  Even when you select the nice dialoge option the character sounds like he's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that he even has to talk to someone else.  He has set a new standard for me as most unlikable video game protagonist ever.This game is a disjointed mess.  All of its parts do not equal up to its whole.  Most of its parts are average at best, a few are good, more are bad, and a lot just doesn't make any sense.  All in all, I'm just not really enjoying this game.  Risen 2 was so much better.			"

While magic isn't a very in depth process it's interesting and diverse enough to be fun to use.I have always liked the quest system, where you can complete the goals of a quest even before you get assigned the quest.  So if you kill all the creatures in some corner and then come across a guy who gives you the quest to go kill the creatures in that corner, you can complete it right then and there.Some minor (and major) rewards for exploring.  I like being able to look up at some rocks and ask ""What's up there?"" and much of the time I am able to clime up there and find something there; a dead body, some gold or food, or whatever.  Very rarely have I been disappointed from randomly exploring the areas.The BadSo mcuh of in this game is left over from the previous games.  Very little is completely new.  You'll interact with just about everyone you met before in the previous games, many of these meetings are forced and add absolutely noting to the plot. Especially the ones you meet in your very short stints into the underworld which are forced upon you at various times when you go to sleep.  Boring and a complete waste of time.Combat still sucks♥♥♥♥♥  You pretty much have the same moves you did in Risen 2 and most of the enemies still use the same tired old attack routines.  Save for a couple of the newer mini bosses and bosses every creature uses the same attack pattern that existed in previous game.  It truly boggles my mind that an alligator has teh exact same attack pattern as the wild beaked birds. Combat adds almost nothing new in installment.  Even my voodoo combat is the same as my melee combat save that it will hit multiple creatures rather than just one.  Not to mention even on hard this game is easy save for the random times the AI just goes ballistic and starts throwing up a stream of attacks there is no way you can defend against.  Also, some monsters, despite how powerful your armor is, will kill in one hit if you fail to dodge.  Combat is an annoying chore instead of a fun activity.Auto saves:  Autosaves are nice, but they are very strangely activated.  Most are okay, but there are times where they should be used when they're not.  An autosave should activate right a fast travel and tehy aren't.  If you forget to save after a fast trave to your ship and then travel to another island and then get killed by something on the beach, when you reload you'll be way back on that other island.  Also, I have encounterd puzzles where once you solve them you get ambushed and if you don't save and get killed you have to solve the puzzle again.  One took me 10 minutes to solve and I got ambushed, die almost instantly, and had to redo the god damn puzzle.  That's a horrible flaw.  Autosave on complete puzzles is a must.Vague quest resolution:  A few quests are completely vague in how they are supposed to be resolved.  One in particular I have done every single quest on the isle of mages and all I get is ""I still have soem things to do before we can start"" with absolutely no clue what I need to do or am waiting for.Companions:  Kinda hand for combat, though they're really slow to start fighting (I can fimish most foes before the companion even makes one attack) they are almost always in your way when you wanna loot the corpses.  You have to specifically make sure the corpse is highlighted because you companion will usually be right here in your face when trying to loot.  This is annoying as hell.The underworld:  Often times when you sleep you're whisked away into a stint in the underworld which serves one of two purposes.  So you can have a brief chat with someone you killed in Risen 2 which adds nothing to the game in the least and another to collect ""soul dust"" which can help elevate your soul rank, but they always end abruptly as you collect one or two and then a creature appears and kicks you out of the underworld.The UglyThe main character is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  This guy is absolute o fun to play unless you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Even if you follow the ""good"" path everything that comes out of this guys mouth is pure garbage.  Even when you select the nice dialoge option the character sounds like he's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that he even has to talk to someone else.  He has set a new standard for me as most unlikable video game protagonist ever.This game is a disjointed mess.  All of its parts do not equal up to its whole.  Most of its parts are average at best, a few are good, more are bad, and a lot just doesn't make any sense.  All in all, I'm just not really enjoying this game.  Risen 2 was so much better.			"

												My negative rating is based purely on my own opinion, so will differ from that of others. I think conceptually, the game has a lot going for it; the levels are nice, it is graphically pleasing, the characters (despite the very VERY poor voice acting) are unique and interesting, and the pirate setting is fun - but that's all.The voice acting is very tedious. I'm not one to get hung up on such details, but when a game relies so heavily on conversing with NPC's, it can/has ruin/ed a/this game.The story is so diffuse I struggled to know what was going on, and i'm very much a narrative junkie. Where to to go, why you're going there, and what to do next were questions that for me were left unanswered. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy running about 'just because', but after the story is done. I struggled through these ~4 hours of gameplay, and, unfortunately, didn't enjoy much of it. I have Risen 2 and 1, so I will give those a go. The game holds promise, but falls flat. For those looking for a fun RPG, look elsewhere. For those who have exhausted all possible RPG's, go play a FPS.  "

Played risen 2 loved it, loved the characters and storyline and therefore excited to play risen 3. but the speech delay in the cutscenes and the lag in the combat just make it one big chore.

												Having put a lot of time and effort into the first two titles (and the Gothic trilogy, of course), I figured I'd review this final title.The ability to sprint is a welcome improvement from the sluggish movement in the first two titles, with the second game's fast-travel making it more bearable than the first game. I don't think the music keeps in line very well with the themes of the earlier games (risen 2 all the way back to the first Gothic title), though it has its moments. I found the interface clunkier than the second game's, which is very unfortunate.The main character's (English) voice is terrible; I really wish this horrible voice was allotted to a minor character that dies off very early in the game rather than the one person you have to endure through its entirety. While the voices on the other characters are nice enough, with some, like Bones', improving a bit in my opinion, I find the characters less interesting than in the earlier games. I thought the combat in Risen was too plain, I thought the combat in Risen 2 was *excellent*, and I think the combat in Risen 3 is...not very good, though not necessarily a step backward. I was hesitant to try Risen 2 after my pleasant experiences with the Gothic titles and the first Risen, but after getting it on sale I was extremely impressed and thought it kept the spirit of the earlier games alive. As a consequence, I approached Risen 3 with very high expectations, none of which were really met. I don't think anyone stands to *lose* from trying it, but I can't recommend it.			"

												Ok so i got quite a bit a gameplay in now. Now i will say this Melee I dont like it However When u unlock spell casting As a Guardian♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan in terms of combat. I will admit the magic is a safe and highly affective combat style. Sword fights are risky as hell in this game. Over all its a good game. Now one thing i want to make clear untill u join  a faction ur combat skills are♥♥♥♥♥♥only when ur a member oft he guardians or one of the other factions. Will they teach u their secrets. However u can not join another. But i do Highly recomend the gaurdians. Im only a cadet Fresh new faction member. I single handedly taken down 3 Shadow Lords.  And its not with melee thats not smart in my openion. Magic in Risen 3 Titan Lords is vary valuble weapon one spell can get u a long long way.  This Game world is not One big level but Bunch Of Medium sized open world maps u travel to by boat. There are Sea monster attacks in witch u fight monsters at sea. And Pirat attacks. Now This is not a sail across the ocean manualy. U head to ur ship. Go to the stearing mekanisum. It will Bring up a map of sevrul islands and 2 mainlands. click one a loading screen apears with the chance for the travel to be interuped by a sea monster or pirat attack at sea. Its a 3person its prity difficult alot like Gothic 3. Atleast when it comes to difficulty and controls.			"

												I've played and finished all Gothic game titles and Risen 1 & 2, but I can't say the same for Risen 3. I started playing it, and the first few hours definitely were fun, but it just felt like the game was artificially slowing you down. Dialogs are slow, you spent a lot of time walking around with nothing happening, and the main story line is just not that exciting. It basically feels like watching a youtube video on 50% speed. At some point in the middle of this game I realized that I wasn't really enjoying playing it, but only continued to play for the sake of finishing it. Better spend your time one something more enjoyable :)			"

												What is and what isn't Risen 3 - A guide for buyers and playersI decided to write this guide/review after all the hate that's been spreading through the forum from people who were expecting something different I think, so here it goesWhat is Risen 3?-It's a Piranha Bytes game, which means you'll be thrown into a world with little to none knowledge of how you're supposed to play, fight and deal with stuff and you'll have to learn by yourself by experimenting tactics and fighting styles-It's an exploration RPG, which means you'll be spending a big amount of time just roaming through the place to find stuff, people, quests and places, some of what you find will be rewarded, some will just be for your own personal curiosity and pleasure, you'll find yourself saying ""Hey I wonder what's in there, let's have a look"" a lot.-It's a piratesque/fantasy mesh game, which means you'll find a mix of both genres in it, you'll have pirates, mages, warriors, musketeers, demons, sea creatures, big ships, big castles, ruins, treasures, etc...- It's not a game about combat, which mean you'll often find yourself presented with the option to avoid fights by talking, running away, sneaking past enemies, etc. Or, if you so desire, you could smack everyone's teeth inside their skulls, the choice is yours.- It's a living world, which means NPCs have routines, interact with eachother and have lifes and monsters aren't all out to get you, sometimes you might happen to stumble upon a guy too busy to care about your problems or a dragon snappers killing worthogs to eat them.-It's a game where you choose your difficulty, which means the game won't get harder the more you progress, but you'll have to shape your character the way you like in order to fit the game, you want fights to be hard but you want every possible shiny coin in the world? Spend all your glory points into dexterity and influence, you want to stomp everything with powerful blows? Focus on melee combat. You want to survive everything and just run through hordes of enemies unscathed? Max out your toughness.What Risen 3 isn't?-It's not Gothic, which means that you won't relive your days gone by getting mauled by orcs and wargs, it has some nostalgia easter eggs and it's still a Piranha bytes game which means there are some strong points of connection and if you liked Gothic 1/2/3 you'll most likely like Risen 3 too, but don't expect to play another Gothic because it isn't such.-It's not Risen 2, which means if you played Risen 2 and didn't like it you should tell so in Risen 2's forum, not here.-It's not a combat driven action RPG, which means that if you care for insane combos with stunning animations and insanely big numbers flying all over the place you'll have to look elsewhere, fights in Risen 3 are milder and more realistic, you won't launch your enemy in the air and slash him 400 times in 3 seconds before he hits the ground.-It's not a Sandbox game, which also means it's not Skyrim, you won't have heavy modding, you won't have a world that answer to your bidding, you won't have an immense amount of general sidequests that all look the same and have no soul.-It's not a game you can understand in a few hours, which means that you'll have to put a bit of time into the game before you start to grasp all the details and untold gimmicks of the game's mechanics.And last but not least, it's not a game for everyone, which means you shouldn't get mad because people buy it and enjoy it and you shouldn't feel offended if others don't like it, it's a game so peculiar that it can only appeal to a core group of people, just like all PB games so far.All in all it's a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs and isn't afraid of a bit of thinking instead of buttonmashing all over the place.

												What is and what isn't Risen 3 - A guide for buyers and playersI decided to write this guide/review after all the hate that's been spreading through the forum from people who were expecting something different I think, so here it goesWhat is Risen 3?-It's a Piranha Bytes game, which means you'll be thrown into a world with little to none knowledge of how you're supposed to play, fight and deal with stuff and you'll have to learn by yourself by experimenting tactics and fighting styles-It's an exploration RPG, which means you'll be spending a big amount of time just roaming through the place to find stuff, people, quests and places, some of what you find will be rewarded, some will just be for your own personal curiosity and pleasure, you'll find yourself saying ""Hey I wonder what's in there, let's have a look"" a lot.-It's a piratesque/fantasy mesh game, which means you'll find a mix of both genres in it, you'll have pirates, mages, warriors, musketeers, demons, sea creatures, big ships, big castles, ruins, treasures, etc...- It's not a game about combat, which mean you'll often find yourself presented with the option to avoid fights by talking, running away, sneaking past enemies, etc. Or, if you so desire, you could smack everyone's teeth inside their skulls, the choice is yours.- It's a living world, which means NPCs have routines, interact with eachother and have lifes and monsters aren't all out to get you, sometimes you might happen to stumble upon a guy too busy to care about your problems or a dragon snappers killing worthogs to eat them.-It's a game where you choose your difficulty, which means the game won't get harder the more you progress, but you'll have to shape your character the way you like in order to fit the game, you want fights to be hard but you want every possible shiny coin in the world? Spend all your glory points into dexterity and influence, you want to stomp everything with powerful blows? Focus on melee combat. You want to survive everything and just run through hordes of enemies unscathed? Max out your toughness.What Risen 3 isn't?-It's not Gothic, which means that you won't relive your days gone by getting mauled by orcs and wargs, it has some nostalgia easter eggs and it's still a Piranha bytes game which means there are some strong points of connection and if you liked Gothic 1/2/3 you'll most likely like Risen 3 too, but don't expect to play another Gothic because it isn't such.-It's not Risen 2, which means if you played Risen 2 and didn't like it you should tell so in Risen 2's forum, not here.-It's not a combat driven action RPG, which means that if you care for insane combos with stunning animations and insanely big numbers flying all over the place you'll have to look elsewhere, fights in Risen 3 are milder and more realistic, you won't launch your enemy in the air and slash him 400 times in 3 seconds before he hits the ground.-It's not a Sandbox game, which also means it's not Skyrim, you won't have heavy modding, you won't have a world that answer to your bidding, you won't have an immense amount of general sidequests that all look the same and have no soul.-It's not a game you can understand in a few hours, which means that you'll have to put a bit of time into the game before you start to grasp all the details and untold gimmicks of the game's mechanics.And last but not least, it's not a game for everyone, which means you shouldn't get mad because people buy it and enjoy it and you shouldn't feel offended if others don't like it, it's a game so peculiar that it can only appeal to a core group of people, just like all PB games so far.All in all it's a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs and isn't afraid of a bit of thinking instead of buttonmashing all over the place.

												I've played and finished all Gothic game titles and Risen 1 & 2, but I can't say the same for Risen 3. I started playing it, and the first few hours definitely were fun, but it just felt like the game was artificially slowing you down. Dialogs are slow, you spent a lot of time walking around with nothing happening, and the main story line is just not that exciting. It basically feels like watching a youtube video on 50% speed. At some point in the middle of this game I realized that I wasn't really enjoying playing it, but only continued to play for the sake of finishing it. Better spend your time one something more enjoyable :)			"

												A pretty solid game. Combat is difficult, but not overly so.  Tons of quests.  I chose guardian and the class feels a bit Overpowered.  To keep the review short I believe it is a bit overpriced.  I was gifted this game and i believe it should be in the 19.99-24.99 range.  If you can pick it up on sale go for it and enjoy the ride.

												Risen 3 delivers on just about everything Risen 2 was missing. It ties together the worlds of Risen 1 and Risen 2 beautifully and adds a ton of new content.It has its flaws, but for people who enjoyed Risen 1 and 2 this is definitely a worthwhile addition to the series.			"

												A nice game in a different settings: a pirate world. No elves and such stuff. Well, there are some walking skeletons. But guess they are common all over the game world.Although a bit repetitive at times, the sceneries are nice and the quests makes it easy to continue. I did feel a real urge to finish the game, took me almost 60 hours (that with finishing all the side quests).The battles can be slash, parry, dodge, shoot. But some also require some tactics: at first the final boss killed me each time after a 20 minute struggle. But with the correct setup it was over in two minutes (on normal). This finished the game, I don't feel the need to play all over again although I didn't do anything with a lot off stuff I collected. So I guess I didn't do all there was to do in the game.On the global achievement page I can see that about 1 in 4 of the players completed this game. I think that's a good score. If you like a good RPG: give it a try.My PC can't handle Witcher 3, but had no problem with this game.Pro's:* Patty & Patty (yes, both of them)* the women of Kila* lots of quests to do* unlimited collecting of stuff. Lots to pick up* beautiful graphics in an open world. Lots to discover* adult humorCon's:* quests are a tad too easy, the goals are shown on the map* conversations can get a bit long wided, especially when the NPC is making the same gestures over and over* no nice party after beating the enemies* no stealth needed: often NPC's don't object when you steal all their stuff* unlimited carrying of stuff makes it difficult to find the one thing you needMy personal score: 8/10.

												If you are looking for an action packed, gore-filled game...then look elsewhere. Piranha Bytes' games have never been about mindless slaughter, but rather deep and careful exploration of the rich environment, carefully crafted quests, interesting characters and total immersion. Risen 2 may have strayed away a bit from some of these factors, but I can confidently say that Risen 3 has certainly improved greatly over it, and the feeling and atmosphere of the game is much more reminiscent of the original Gothic games and the first Risen.One of the biggest complaints of the previous game in the Risen series was the combat system. This time, however, not only is the magic system back, adding greater variety, but melee combat feels much more satisfying, and it's certainly NOT a left click fest - if you want to defeat a strong enemy, you must dodge, block, riposte and time your hits.Risen 3: Titan Lords is a game for all the players who loved Piranha Bytes' classical works. Perhaps the plot isn't up to par with Gothic 1's, but nevertheless, as the final game in the series, it has certainly lived up to its promise to go back to the roots - the more observant fans will even notice some very pleasant surprises involving familiar characters from times gone by.

												Okey, so i've played for 24 hours and I have to say, the game is dammned good. With a few skills and more importantly magic, the combat does not feel half as bad, depending on the faction there are several nice combos to do with magic. i'm loving the demon hunters. Graphics look awsoome, especially distant structures and lightning. Shadows look awsome and very realistic. Story is as great as you can expect from such a developer, leveling is fairly balanced and not too hard. I mostly love the fact that you get magic with every faction, unlike prequals where you had to choose a specific one for it, while every faction still has it's own magic to make a difference between them. I also like how there are faction specific skills. Humor is grately present witch also gives the game even more charm. So in conclusion for anyone that likes a good story, rpg-s, adventures or open world games this is a must have. Great game.			"

												Never played a Risen title before in my life and I can honestly say that I am loving this game so far. Graphics aren't the best and combat is a little bit of a pain (am aware that the combat has been pretty crap in older titles so I wasn't expecting much from this one) but the world is absolutely beautiful and sometimes I have to just stop to admire the view.

												Perfekt Game! beside some crashes while using rifles, its very satisfying. Risen 3 got a amazing grafic, great ambience and lots of details. first time since gothic 3 ( include the crappy Arcania parts ) that it feels like Gothic! The map is really big, at least most of the islands. the style connect to Risen 2, but sadly the story is a bit diffrent. Petty which was our Girlfriend in Risen 2 is now our sister. You can even find NPC's of Gothic 2/3 and Risen 1/2 which play the old roll. IMO the releaseprice is worth it and if you liked Gothic & Risen, you should get it!9,5/10 ( i dont mind the rifle bug since there are other bugs i was able to figure). Just the Storyline should compare more to the Risen 2 story. Good luck everyone ;)			"

												I think many people thought I gave this a recommendation by mistake because I criticize a lot in the first part of my review. Read the review before thinking about rating it!I thought about writing a review after 2 hours ingame because I was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It feels like this game was broken down to basic content because PB feared that games like Gothic or the first Risen would be to bulky. There are some animations missing (climbing a latter, drinking, eating). I think it's because they want to make the game more easy and available for everyone, even for young people. As a huge fan of the first three Gothic games this really hurts me as well as the black screen that you have when you open your inventory, crafting, looting and trading...Then I thought ""give it a chance"" and I played 3 more hours. It is good that I waited. Risen 3 is a solid RPG with a breathtaking designed world filled with hundreds of quests. It is a living world with day/night cycle and great atmosphere. The combat makes fun as well (yes I know many hate it, I did as well but I changed my opinion). If you can ignore the fact that this game is no Gothic then you can have a lot of fun.			"

												PB came into this title promising that they'd returned to their roots and had learned from their past mistakes, but have they? Yes and no. The bad: -The story drags a bit in the middle. They do things to improve this and try to keep it interesting, but it's easy to do things in an order which can feel like a slog and not a fun progression of events. -Companions are tanks. This isn't as much of a problem on the hardest difficulty, but on medium it feels like they are more powerful than you for far too long and are neigh unkillable. If you're spending glory on skills you don't have until you join a faction, like magic or voodoo, this is especially true.-Voice acting is hit-and-miss. Sometimes your main character can sound like a badass that you'd never want to mess with, other times he has a mouth full of gravel for no reason. Also, there are too many times where you'll hear that the voice actors didn't have good direction and say lines with the wrong inflection.-Combat can be clunky. I actually put this in both the good and the bad because they improved some aspects, but from friends I know who've played the game on a console the controls can be a pain without a mouse and keyboard. This is where you'll really feel the ""companions are tanks"", because you can often just roll circles around enemies while your friend rips them apart. Seeing enemies get stuck behind a fence or rock and glitch out during can also break immersion.-Day one DLC. This is more a knock on the publisher and not the developer, but for ♥♥♥♥ sake stop making Devs do this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It only hurts the customer. The neutral:-Reused areas. I put this in neutral because PB has done this before to great affect, like in Gothic II. Seeing how areas change over time is fun and they are disimillar enough that I didn't feel it detracted from my experience, but it annoys enough people that it can be a negative.-Ship combat under utilized. This was one of the most fun parts of the game, but like Assassin's creed 3 it just leaves you wanting more. The Good:-Magic system is a blast. Anyone who played Risen 2 can tell you that the voodoo magic left a lot to be desired with a few cool tricks but damage spells that came much too late. Now you have three different schools of magic to play with (rune, crystal, and voodoo) all with fun and unique spells. Instead of a mana pool that gives out over time you have different elements that you can wield like weapons at melee and range supplemented by timed spells with effects like fire rain or summoning. Enemies also have vulnerabilities to elements that you can discover with experimentation. -Exploration. This has always been a strongpoint of PB games and this iteration is no different. A bevy of secret caves, islands, and treasure to find will keep you wanting to see what is around every corner for hours if you're anything like me. -Arcane Vision. For anyone who likes collecting every ounce of junk as a metagame this upgradable ability highlights objects so you don't have to worry about missing anything and squinting at every corner. It reminds me of the wisp ability from Gothic II, but much more efficient. -Huge number of interesting quests. Many may knock this game for having quite a few 'fetch' quests, but it's what you can do within these quests that lets them shine and wash away any tedium. Asked to hand out some crystals to your compatriates? Scam them instead and make them pay for the privelage. Conclusion: It's a solid 7/10 RPG, 8/10 if you like the PB style of exploration and questing. For any fan of PB's previous Gothic series I'd recommend buying now, but if you're just a general lover of open world RPGs you might want to wait for a sale. The day one DLC added a lot of content but the it will leave a sour taste in your mouth if you buy full price.   "

												The game has its ups and downs but over all it isa fun game. There is lots to do and it does not really hold your hand and explain things for crafting and that sort to you or maybe I just have not found the npc yet. First chest I had to pick it said something to the affect of dont hit the wrong tumbler or you have to start over... I spent way longer than I should trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ I needed to do for the minigame. I then cleared my first real island of all the plants and mobs, wonder wtf do I do with all this stuff? I just wanna make a bottle of rum! Or how the ♥♥♥♥ do I sneak? When I lost my soul did I magically forget how to crouch and move slowly? I like that the game doesn't tell me everything I need to know, I rather figure that out on my own. The combat is probably my only real complaint and it is mainly you can't roll off things in combat. I have been on a rock many times about 1 inch off the ground and I go to dodge an enemy and stopped by an invisible wall. Would I rather it be like Elder Scroll where I can really steal anything that isn't nailed down and have hidden caves with bad guys in it for me to kill? Of course I would. Would I rather have the combat more hardcore as in DS? YES! But the game isn't from those devs and it is what it is so I have to ask myself do you have fun? are you even a little be curious to see what happens at the end? I do so I think the game is a success. I read some people saying the game isnt worth 50$ more like 30$ and I almost agree. The graphics, clunky combat is totes a 30$ game but the game has so many quests, places to explore, and frankly I have played to close to 33hrs and I still have 3 more islands and havent picked a faction... and the game seems like i havent even come to the climax of the game yet... I think it is worth the other 20$ for that alone.			"

If you dont mind getting frustrated as 3 mobs attack you at once and your stuck blocking and running away, and  if you like taking forever to kill mobs, then this game is for you.

												Although only a few hours in (and if my opinion changes ill follow up this post), but the combat in this game is extremely attrocious.  Its the same technique over and over again; attack attack, block, block block, attack, etc..   If you dont mind getting frustrated as 3 mobs attack you at once and your stuck blocking and running away, and  if you like taking forever to kill mobs, then this game is for you.  Im hoping this changes as the game progresses but the starting hurdle is a bit rough in my opinion.			"

												If you have liked Risen 1 - DO NOT BUY THIS! It is not a fantasy game but a stupid, boring pirate game! You are not a hero anymore but a criminal with a dumb appearance and ridiculous voice. Petty -who was a pretty cool girl in the original game- is a dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here with ugly graphics...			"

												I'll try to keep this short. I didn't really enjoy the 5 hours I've played, so I probably won't play it more, even though I've heard it gets better. I was so frustrated from the combat that it wasn't fun. I didn't want to play the game, I wanted to STOP playing the game. Judging from what I saw, I was expecting the game to be more like a Medieval fantasy RPG, not about pirates, and I saw absolutely nothing about Titans. Not that that's a bad thing, it just didn't meet my expectations.Pros:Attractive environmentDecent UIYou can warp to your boatPirates are kinda coolCons:One of the worst combat systems I've used (only better than Dragon Blade: Wrath of Fire, maybe Genji: Days of the Blade)Low-level combat difficulty is not scaled well/at allSome kind of stamina system, but no stamina barUninteresting dialogueMediocre voice acting (protagonist is the worst)Performance issuesCan't change controller keybindingExcessive profanity for the sake of using profanity (yeah we get you're an F-ing pirate)Stealth skill taken away after tutorial without telling the playerThe combat consists of little more than clicking, followed by slow animations, and lots of rolling. Risen 3 requires more rolling than Dark Souls. Blocking is worthless, as you can only block the first hit and then take the rest of the enemy's combos, and almost everything is faster than you. This means they can also break your combos. The only useful tactic I found was to roll after nearly every hit, unless I was lucky enough to fight an enemy that was slow and stuck in a corner I could combo attack. Don't expect to hit anything with your pistol at a low level, especially short enemies like goblins. The combat system is also based on auto-targetting, so you can't choose which enemy to attack. Sometimes when you're just about to kill an enemy, another one walks up and then you have to deal with that for the next couple minutes before finishing the other. I found that it was really easy to accidentally hit NPCs because of not being able to target well, and had to reload my game because I don't know if they ever stop trying to kill you.My main issue with the voice acting is the protagonist. He sounds like he's always in a bad mood, and he talks incredibly slowly. I didn't have the patience to listen through all the dialogue.The opening tutorial battle was awful on my computer because of all the water FX and animations. My computer isn't the best setup, but I can play games like Skyrim decently. The only thing I can say is the game just isn't optimized well.I'm somewhat disappointed now I bought the complete edition and I can't get a refund, but at least I bought it on sale. If you really want to buy the game, don't buy it at full price. I wouldn't even pay half price for it.			"

												I really, really wanted to write a positive review about this game. I've really enjoyed games by Piranha Bytes in the past, and Risen 1 was actually a really enjoyable game. I started but didn't finish Risen 2, because I stopped enjoying it. I was hoping that Risen 3 would have learned from the mistakes of Risen 2, and been better. I was wrong. Risen 3 is worse than Risen 2, and by a large margin.Risen 3 has some good things. The world is lush and pretty. The theme, pirates and magic, can be a lot of fun. Okay, two good things.It also has a lot of things that are not good, and in some cases very bad. The physical mechanics of the game are crap, frankly. You walk like you're on a flat plane that skates across the ground. There are invisi-walls all over the place. More specifically the fighting mechanics, are even worse. All the things that Assassin's Creed IV got right about fighting, such as the pace, the fluidity, and the using of different weapons, are all things that this game gets horribly, horribly wrong. You click to attack, and then there's a pause, and then there is a slow attack. There is no such thing as a fast attack. The enemies, however, do have a fast attack; and it interupts. Meaning there you are, slowly pulling your sword back for an attack, and 'whack' you get hit and have to restart the attack. I could continue on this subject, but there are so many other things wrong that I'm moving on.This is supposed to be an open world style game. It is one, in a sense. You have the open world of the path, and the few trees on either side. But wait! What's that toward the end of a path? It's a temple complex! So you enter the temple complex, and then you have the open world of the corridor! Don't get me wrong, the world is open to you going back and forth within the path or corridor. I admit that I've only played the first area, so maybe the world becomes more open later on.Let's talk about pop-in. Usually, pop-in is a draw distance issue where textures go from either blurry or just not there, to suddenly clear and apparant. In some horror games however, they used the sudden appearance of enemies as a scare tactic. As in, you would be walking along and suddenly BOO! an enemy jumps out at you. In this game you're walking along and enemies will suddenly pop up from the ground. It's not a slow, un-burying of an enemy. It's a quick 'look I can phase through solid matter' jump up. Not only that, but they can go from appearance to attacking instantly. Considering the time it takes for you to be able to attack, even if your reaction time is amazing, you're going to get hit multiple times before being able to land a blow. Also, this game is set on islands. Islands with rivers running across them. There is a lot of water. There are enemies that do the pop-up effect while under the water. The further problem here, is that a lot of the water has a 'foam' effect, making it opaque. That renders these popped-in enemies invisable. So then you get to fight invisiable fast-attacking enemies. I cannot, in any way, describe this as 'fun'.There are more things wrong with this game, but honestly I think this review is long enough. So to sum-up: This game is filled with poor mechanics, has a terrible story line (sorry I didn't write a paragraph about this part), has poor voice acting and scripting (or this part), but occasionally looks pretty. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this game a 3. [3/10]			"

												This game feels like it was originally a DLC for Risen#2 in which you play as Patty's brother that ended up getting turned into a full game.  The map is almost identical to Risen#2, gameplay mechanics, very similar.  Graphics, again, no major evolution. The worst thing about this game though, is the horrendous decision, to move away from the nameless here we played in Risen#1 and Risen#2 and introduce a completely new protagonist, Patty's brother.  WTF ?  Whoever smart guy at game studio made that decision aught to be taken out the back and flogged.  Long-term fans of the franchise like me were looking forward to Patty and the Nameless hero finally getting together in Risen#3.  Totally unfinished plot arc from the first 2 games.Now, to be clear I loved the Risen franchise, up until #3.  I have recommended the original Risen, and also Risen#2 multiple times.  How could the devs be so dumb as to completely change up the protagonist we came to know and love in the first 2 games ?  Not only that, the world is almost the same as that of Risen#2 with the addition of a couple of scorch marks and some fog.I totally cannot recommend this game.  I am bored with it now, I already played Risen#2 and I dont want to play Risen#2.5 which is what this game really aught to have been called.  Game uninstalled, and not completed.So, the major gripes about Risen#3 :- Same maps as Risen#2, just with some minor changes- Different protagonist from the one we spent 60+ hours with if we played the first 2 games- Game feels cheap and definitely not as well done as first 2 gamesSo basically IMHO Risen#3 is a cheap piece of crap and a money-making scheme on the Risen name from the developers.  Avoid.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS LITERALLY UNPLAYABLEFirst of all the combat is clunky as hell, i figured i could get over that, i thought to myself ""Ah, you'll learn it!"" but then i tried to rebind some keys (because for some reason draw weapon is mid mouse) and guess what? I also can't bind keys. Guess what happened when i tried to make dodge any key other than B? ""Dodge has been bound to B"" now, when i tried binding control to anything else (one of the keys i tried to bind to dodge) it thinks the ctl key is B, and won't let me bind anything else to ctl, the only way i found to fix this is by starting over again because that's right, reseting the controls doesn't help.

												No, Just No Pros: I used to like pirates when i used to dress up as them with the extremely colourful parot andthe weird priate hat and the huge waistcoat with the wonky sword, now you look like this in the gameMain Character: has a bit which as that going for it.The Graphics: i wont lie does look pretty beautiful and enemies do look quite menacing and intimidating like they should beCons:Voice Acting: was terrible and extremely annoying, *sees a lever near a door in plainsight*, ""OH LOOK A LEVER I WONDER WHAT IT'LL OPEN???""Combat system: was absolute rubish and the ""heavy"" attack is just you and only you slowly charging a hit up. and having to dodge and light attack every single time. and dont even get me started when your fighting more than one enemyStory: seems ""alright"" so far but is extremely cliche and very predictable whilst every character is as dumb as a bat.OVERALL: seeing as ive only played 2 hours of this game and don't plan on playing any more in the future, i can say this game is my top 10 worst games ive ever played, the screenshots and reviews are what drove me to buy this game. but i can you should not buy this game and i would say this game is a2/10 tops "

												I purchased, installed and attempted to play Risen 3 - Titan Lords today.Playing a game is as far as I'm concerned a way to enjoy yourself. Just finished four hours playing Risen 3, and it was not fun. The graphics are nice, and the audio is fine. My source of irritation was with the 'combat' system. My apologies for the single quotes, but that was what it felt like.First my gaming background. I've played (and enjoyed) Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Kingdoms of Amalur, Fallout:New Vegas, Dishonored, Fable: The Lost Chapters, The Witcher. All on PC.  Each with a slightly varying combat system, showing that I can adjust to different systems.Please remember that I'm giving my experience with the game; these are not criticisms, just reasons why someone who thinks and plays like myself may want to give this game a pass.My expectation in playing any game where combat is involved is that the combat is straightforward. That is, the laws of physics apply (I press 'Hit', my character attempts to swing), not the laws of combos (you can only swing at the right time as decided by the game).  And this is my reason for writing this review: Risen 3's combat system is not straightforward as far as I can tell.Here are the things I observed:- in a number of instances (during combat) when I click the left mouse button to attack, my character just stands there.- during combat, my character decides to sheath his sword (I believe I can say with confidence that I did not click the middle mouse button by mistake when this occurred).- more that 50% of the time, a standard attack from any creature resulted in my character taking damage, even while parrying/blocking.- my character would strike a creature, then perform a 180 degree pivot and strike the person behind me. I only clicked the left mouse button once. Force of habit with games like Kingdom of Amalur meant my left hand was firmly pressing the 'W' key to keep moving forward ... didn't work apparently.- the creatures at level 1 are incredibly fast. I like a challenge, but the lapse in response time by my character just meant many cycles of: Kill a creature, save, get killed. restore, kill another creature, save, get killed ... you get the idea.- in most of the games I mentioned above, there was always 'wiggle' room; you could choose which encounters you wanted, when you were prepared for them. In Risen 3, encounters are about every 50 feet, no getting around them. This would seem that the developers were more focused on combat than anything else. In the one quest where I was escorting Balbor, there were a minimum of 15 different creatures all within a 150 foot radius. (the distace is a guess, it's just to show it felt close) And when attempting to follow him away from the water source, you had no choice (not even sneaking worked, even though it is an available skill) but to engage the animals. I partially blame Balbor, as he went out of his way to 'pull' them towards me.Altogether not enjoyable. I've read a few comments by some folks in the community here, and some have expressed the thought that this would be solved by 'training harder'. I believe that can be interpreted to mean 'learn how the combat system works and you'll be fine'. My response would be 'but I have'. I know how to attack by pressing the left mouse button. I know how to parry/block by pressing the right mouse button. However, the actions I see on the screen are not consistent with what I want my character to do.Let me explain myself a bit, using Skyrim as an example (it's still one of my favorite games). If I meet an NPC whose skill level with his chosen weapon is higher than my skill level with my chosen weapon, it's quite likely I'll lose the battle. But I'll lose it because the NPC is better skilled than I am. I can still swing a sword at him, it just won't do as much damage due to my lower skill level. I can still fight and block, until he gets the better of me and overwhelms me. I don't mind losing to a superior foe, as long as I put up a good fight.But when ALL of the creatures are superior foes, and my character is effectively incapacitated during combat, it's no longer a challenge, it's a chore. And perhaps some might think me lazy, but the 'click the attack button, wait two seconds then click it again, wait three seconds and then press the Ctrl key as you click the attack button again  to perform the Super/Ultra combo' formula doesn't mean that you've mastered the game as I see it. It means it's mastered you.I read the description of the game, and viewed all of the videos available on Steam for Risen 3, spending a few days to think about purchasing it. I gave it a chance because it seemed like the character interactions would be interesting and I thought it was along the lines of other RPG games I enjoyed in the past. Except for the combat, unfortunately a crucial part of the game, it was. It would have been a great game to play otherwise. "

After 24 minutes I got sick of the clunky camera and crappy voice acting. Didn't really know what I was expecting seeing as I didn't like the other two, but if you can get over the game being broken and want a good story. Sure you should get this game.			"

Risen 3 - Titan LordsYou either love it or you hate it.If you enjoyed the previous titles you will like this game - a lot.If you did not enjoy them you will not enjoy this game either.The advertisments in form of the the game trailers are kind of misleading.There you are basically promised that you get a "" Gothic "" experience.Instead you get a Risen 2 with slight improvements.GRAPHICSThe graphics are solid but unimpressive, they look outdated but still fit the game in a strange way.The game will probably run on less powerful machines as smooth as on high end rigs.Some animations look incredibly clunky and wooden ( like drawing your weapon ), others look organic and fluent ( agitated animals ).SOUNDThe Music of the game is beautiful and immersive, it has both a pirate and fantasy vibe.The ambient sounds are well done as well and add to the immersion.The Voice acting seems to be a matter of conflict to many people.Personally I thought it was fine, the voice acting has the typical Gothic / Risen characteristics which I personally enjoyed.The language is rude and direct most of the time, with its own kind of dark humor.Lips of the characters are usually out of sync with what they are saying, but I just noticed that because I actively looked for it.[b}COMBAT[/b]Combat is a mixed bag.At the beginning it is frustrating and feels unfair as well as clunky.Every enemy you encounter appears to be able to attack twice or thrice as fast as you can, constantly interrupting your attacks.This changes later, once you get a feel for the enemies attack patterns.The majority of the enemies utilizes a combo of 3 attacks in a row. Which become quite predictable after a short while.This is later mixed up with enemies that can block your attacks, instead of dodging it, or throwing the occasional stone or fireball at you.Later in the game you are able to improve your combat skills significantly, you will be able to learn to attack faster, add more attacks to your combos, riposte and interrupt enemies attacks.Combat feels harsh and unfair at first but quickly becomes menial as you progress in your skills.This continues to the point where you are basically a demi-god, an almost indestructible force of mayhem.Some people like it some hate it.I personally enjoyed it because it instills a feeling of gratification, like you worked hard to get there and now you are able to enjoy the fruits of your labor.One thing about combat however seems quite annoying, almost all types of enemies are able to knock you on your♥♥♥♥♥Sending you flying through the air.It makes sense with certain type of enemies such as big rhinos or Golemts.However I fail to see how a small spider, a lake lizardman ( which is basically a water-ghoul ) or an over sized chicken ( scavanger ) can constantly send you flying.Magic seems powerful and satisfying, there is no mana just cooldown rates which you can decrease by unlocking various perks.There is a good amount of spell variety. COMBAT AT SEAThe game offers some mini games to liven things up a little.You will have to combat other ships and Sea-Monsters.Combating other ships is very scripted you basically just have to fight some pirates on deck and beat their Leader.This is accompanied by some shooting the board cannon, which feels quite underwhelming in terms of power and destructive force.The Sea monster combat allows you to steer your mighty vessel and give the sea monster some broad-sides.This battles with Sea monsters become progressively more difficult, the last encounter is frustratingly difficult.Everything about it feels wrong, the monster seems overly powerful and have homing shots.After I beat it I felt more like it was a stroke of luck than skill.Many people seem to complain about it, especially since its a "" mini game "" that you can´t skip.If you reached that point it basically blocks your progress until you beat it.There seem 2 ways around this issue :1. Lower the difficulty, which makes the battle mind numbingly dull and underwhelming2. Prepare yourself to try it 10-20 times in a row.Maybe there are some very good players who found a pattern or strategy to use, I personally could not find it.ITEMSAny good RPG like game needs vast amounts of Weapons and Armor and othe trinkets to make you feel like a truly mighty Warrior.The game offers a variety of Armors consting of hats, chests pieces, pants, boots.Depending on the faction youi will join you get access to 3 exclusive types of Armor.As you progress in the ranks of your faction you will advance from light armor to medium to heavy.Armors look good and characeristic for their faction.You can also get some general pirate themed armor from vendors or as special rewards from quests.These all look nice but are utterly inferior to your faction armor.With the exception of something just labeled "" Heavy Armor "" that you can find on your adventures.Which is slightly better than your tier 3 Faction armor.If you own the Adventurer Garb DLC you get a set of armor that is slightly better than your first faction armor.Which makes quite a bit of a difference at the start of the game.The armor just looks kind of whacky.There are various accessoirs to choose from, such as rings, earrings and amulets.Those basically boost your stats and allow you to specialize your skill sets.Weapons, there are plenty of weapons to be found.Swords, Axes and Maces, sabres and fencing weapons.I personally could not see a big difference between the weapon types.You get perks for each class, and all seem to do the same amount of damage.There are slight variations but they make no difference in actual combat.Wether your weapon does 95, 100 or 110 damage does not matter, you still need at least 2-3 hits to kill an enemy in the end game.So it just is a matter of taste.There also is a Musket type of weapon, allowing you ranged combat.If you choose to use this combat will change slightly but soon falls into the same patterns as meele combat.Last but not least you are able to utilize dirty tricks, which basically are secondary weapons.You will be able to throw daggers, fire a pistol or crossbow in the heat of battle.If you have enough ammunition this can change your combat style a bit.However it is quite tedious to use in the beginning.Without proper training your will miss a lot, this has nothing to do with your personal skill however.It is purely stat based, an enemy can stand point blank and you still will miss with your scatter pistol ( which is like a pumpgun in pistol form ).There are only 2 components that matter : skill level with your desired dirty trick weapon and range.CRAFTINGThe game offers an extensive crafting system.You can Craft new weapons, repair broken legendary weapons which you can find in your adventures, craft rings and amulets, brew booze ( yay ) and alchemical tinktures.You also can create your own spell-scrolls / rune stones.You gather resources by picking them up ( herbs and so on ), ripping them out of defeated enemies ( requires hunting perks ), finding them in chests, or buying them at vendors.OVERALL GAMEPLAYThe game plays smooth, you can reach about everything you can see, there are few invisible walls that block you from reaching zones that you are not supposed to reach yet.I only got stuck once in the environment but could rescue myself with the parrot spell.Combat becomes boring fast, since its very basic. The old Gothic Combat system is far superior.Quest / Quest logs are sometimes confusing, leaving you wondering what to do next.The game does not hold your hand much, which is nice.You can get additional mini rewards by talking to people that had a part in a quest you completed "

												Played 11 hours, not have reason to recommend it yet. After Risen 2 this game look a little worse. Not because it's extremely difficult, but because combat mechanics much worse than Dark Waters. For god sake, i'm playing with controller and it's worst key binding ever (after Watch_Dogs)! Why you so hate players with controllers, PB?I am really disappointed of this game, not sure i can endure with this to the end. Today this game ruined my mood.Except combat game is amazing! Worth full price and as RPG obviously better than Fallout 4 (as RPG of course). In one line with Witcher, for some may be better.***Played 23 hours, not have reason to recommend it without DLC for now. Fog island is brilliant! Uprising of the Little Guys is funny, gnomes are nice guys. Feels better myself already. But my♥♥♥♥♥still burning off this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat gameplay. Muskets and shotguns saving my mood.***Played 30 hours, game is glitchy. Risen 1/2 is still much better than 3rd. Not see any reason why is Pluto 13 do develope this game... They making own games worse when trying to built something big. Remeber Gothic 3? That's it.***Reached final in 57 hours. Not have reason to recommend it to anyone, who not a fan of Piranha Bytes games. Three flaws for me here:- Combat is very specific. And if i've said specific, i mean it's like a Gothic 1. And if you remember Gothic 3/Risen 1 boars, be sure, here every beast is boar.- Brother of Patty and everything between Risen 2 and 3. Where is he came from? Why nameless hero left Patty and why she have so big♥♥♥♥♥♥now? In Dark Waters he has honest B size. Not this is some kind of D size. And how much years passed after Risen 2?- Level design look worse, i miss of open spaces of Gothic 3. All islands is big multilevel corridors.Boss fights is much difficult than in Dark Waters, and that's good finally. But why do golems are less dangerous than rock spiders or fire birds, is unexplainably.This is the big game, big good Piranha Bytes game. Worth full price, but not for everyone.			"

												Don't be fooled by the overall positivity, this game in almost all of its aspects is atrocious.The first and most standout aspect of this game should be the combat; fast paced, exciting, fluid, and interesting combat should be a staple for any game of this type to make up for the long sequences of talking and looting.  Unfortunetly, this game is none of that.  The combat is separated into light and heavy attacks that look no different from each other, (Don't even get me started on the hilariously terrible idea of ""heavy attack"" in swordplay, but I'll spare you my historical rant).  Your light attacks feature a spinning flourish for every single attack except for one that leaves you completely open for counter attack from the VASTLY quicker and deadlier enemies that you face (even the pitifully tiny fish monsters at the start of the game).  Should you choose to string together attacks in a combo your strikes will become progressivly slower until the final strike where the enemy would sooner die from boredom while it waits for the attack. Dodgeing is neccissary but commically utilized, and the ""parry"" system is downright useless when compared to rolling around like an idiot with invincibility frames.  Secondary weapons are consumable and boring in excecution.Bottom line for combat is that it's unintuitive, boring, and most importantly just not fun in any way.Then we have the story.  The plot takes after ""video game trope A-4"" in the fact that it does almost nothing new in its excecution.  Demon overloard was woken up from a nap and now he's cranky, as the player character only you can stop him because why not?  I will say that the distinction between reality and the spirit realm was entertaining for a momment before I realized it had no impact whatsoever on how I played the game.Bottom line for plot is that it's only a background for tearing into new land for looting, no real significance to how you play the game.Sound track isn't noteworthy, while it does serve as an adequate filler.Animations are stiff and cringeworthy. Seems like they poured all of their budget into the spinny dance techniques the character employs in his swordplay.The only reason I would ever have to want to play this game is the hear the protagonist swear at NPC's more.  It's actually really fun to  have a pirate as the protagonist because he has no obligation towards manners, which creates the  exceedingly rare vaguely pleasant momments in the game.Final margin: the game is simply bad.  It's based around systems that are honestly not fun at all.  I bought this game when it was 75% off and only 8 or so Canadian Dollars, and I feel guilty for my idiocy.  I could have just bought a toy cutlass from the dollar store and had ten times the fun this sopping mess of a game gave me.  Please, do not buy this game for any ammount of money.			"

The combat is separated into light and heavy attacks that look no different from each other, (Don't even get me started on the hilariously terrible idea of ""heavy attack"" in swordplay, but I'll spare you my historical rant).  Your light attacks feature a spinning flourish for every single attack except for one that leaves you completely open for counter attack from the VASTLY quicker and deadlier enemies that you face (even the pitifully tiny fish monsters at the start of the game).  Should you choose to string together attacks in a combo your strikes will become progressivly slower until the final strike where the enemy would sooner die from boredom while it waits for the attack. Dodgeing is neccissary but commically utilized, and the ""parry"" system is downright useless when compared to rolling around like an idiot with invincibility frames.  Secondary weapons are consumable and boring in excecution.Bottom line for combat is that it's unintuitive, boring, and most importantly just not fun in any way.Then we have the story.  The plot takes after ""video game trope A-4"" in the fact that it does almost nothing new in its excecution.  Demon overloard was woken up from a nap and now he's cranky, as the player character only you can stop him because why not?  I will say that the distinction between reality and the spirit realm was entertaining for a momment before I realized it had no impact whatsoever on how I played the game.Bottom line for plot is that it's only a background for tearing into new land for looting, no real significance to how you play the game.Sound track isn't noteworthy, while it does serve as an adequate filler.Animations are stiff and cringeworthy. Seems like they poured all of their budget into the spinny dance techniques the character employs in his swordplay.The only reason I would ever have to want to play this game is the hear the protagonist swear at NPC's more.  It's actually really fun to  have a pirate as the protagonist because he has no obligation towards manners, which creates the  exceedingly rare vaguely pleasant momments in the game.Final margin: the game is simply bad.  It's based around systems that are honestly not fun at all.  I bought this game when it was 75% off and only 8 or so Canadian Dollars, and I feel guilty for my idiocy.  I could have just bought a toy cutlass from the dollar store and had ten times the fun this sopping mess of a game gave me.  Please, do not buy this game for any ammount of money.			"

												This game is like my little Brother, it  was full of potential and from a distances looked good, but ended up as a toothless junkie that failed at everything it set out to achieve.Rise 3 is a cheap knockoff of the earlier Risen games, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor attempt at being a Gothic knockoff.This game had so much potential but never seemed to achieve any of it. I really wanted to like this game, I tried so hard, but in the end I could handle the bugs, crappy combat and crappy design.Even on sale I cannot recommend this game, only play this game if you've been given it for free, otherwise grab something else.

												I could write a long list of little things that could have been done better (autosave function that goes off every 30 seconds), but it hardly matters compared to two main ideas:  what they DID do was to include pretty much everything you would expect from a gothic/risen game, and thats good. what they DIDNT do was to know when to stop adding Things that really dont have any place in a ""Gothic"" successor (mini-games, cut-scenes that make decisions for you etc.).  This wasnt a big deal early on in the game, but got MUCH worse as it progressed.  As a result I would only recommend this to people who liked the previous risen's and can put up with some pointless mini-games. "

												Gothic was the first game I ever played on the computer growing up and I have followed this genre ever since.  Unfortunately I do not know if I will evr buy one of these games again.  I really like being able to fight mobs toe to toe and these games do not let you do that anymore.  All you will find yourself doing is letting you ally (thankfully you have one who follws youa round) beat stuff up for you while you roll in circles around your enemies.  Honestly it makes for very boring game play where you get to look at the fight while cartwheeling around and never actually get to take part.  The story is interesting and kind of fun to follow but the game play sucks.  So if you play games for story it isnt bad... If you play them for them for the whole experiance you should save your money for another RPG.I would like to note I had similar disappointments with Risen 2 and should have know better before I bought this.

												I think this is the worst game of the Risen trilogy. There is too much combat with the different monsters from the early beginning - the monsters are almost everywhere.  Also somehow it feels that the combat mechanism is much difficult to control than that of Risen and Risen 2 - parry doesn't seem to work as it should be in my mind. Also graphics look somehow ugly compared to the earlier games in this series, and the voice acting is terrible. The map is mainly the same as in Risen 2, but the area you can explore freely is  less than earlier. However, if you can get this game with 15 € or less, it might be worth of buying.			"

												This is one of the better RPGs I've played in a while it feels like a less goofy more adult themed Fable.  The quests are so numerous you'll always have something to do.  Pro tip tho, hold onto everything in your loot inv window untill you know what you're doing.  as a Guardian you need magic crystals to learn spells and if you sell them all early like my dumbass you're doomed to a bit of a justly punishing slow start.  Overall I'd give it a 7/10 tho I am only 20 hrs into the game.  I only travel with Bones the first companion you meet bc I can't get over his fleshed out quirkyness.			"

												Not a bad game. I'm only 21 hours in and i still have allot to do. So its not a 8-20 hour game. Learning Magic takes a bit of time, as you have to get to the Mage island and do the subquests so you can be a Guardian/Mage. But i have had allot of fun with the game. Was it worth 40 bills? I think its not bad for the price. Over all the game is really immersive and fun to play, the melee side of the game isn't bad but, once i got spells the game became more enjoyable. The crafting was interesting, as well as the health potions were booze. So i thought that was kind of comical. Overall give it two thumbs up. I had so many quests i was busy. Very well done game. Also the game does not support wide screen monitors. But there is a work around in the forums, so not bad.			"

												This game is a gem and you wont find many others like it. It has so much heart and character. The world just feels so deliberately crafted. Everything in the game world is placed with a purpose. This design choice deviates from the random events and occurrences in modern games like Skyrim, but brings to the table a feeling that this world was crafted with care and attention to detail. This, among other things such as the loot, craftable materials, varied jungles, caves, beaches, fortresses and more make exploration a real treat! My favorite location is Calador, a volcanic island with a massive waterfront fortress and green bonfires dotting the coastline. It really is a sight to behold!Ultimately, this game is all about getting lost in the vast world and forging your own destiny! It's about exploring and finding all of the secrets and content packed into the game! it's about side quests, and loot, and character progression, and choice! The choice to pick a direction, any direction, and be confident that there will be something new to discover right around the next corner. It's about all of these things... and while the game certainly isn't perfect, it's definitely a rare gem in a sea of mainstream rpgs that all try to do the same thing over and over.In short, if you're a Gothic/Risen fan, you know what you're getting into, and this is some of PB's finest work. You may love it, you may hate it, but I urge anyone who's on the fence to give it a shot! I hope you can find as much enjoyment in this game as I have so far.			"

												I'm a big fan of the Gothic series and saw this on sale so grabbed itI haven't gotten that far but I am thoroughly disappointed and feel ripped offtl;dr : it feels like a mediocre xbox action gameMovement is slow and choppy as hell. My fps is just fine but there is lag to the input and the movements are too large and clumsy to feel like anything but a clutzCombat is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Partly related to movement and partly mechanics and timing of the attack/combo/parry system. Input is laggy and actions take too much time to have any feeling of fun, it feels like i'm sending orders to a wooden puppet stuck in molasses. Movement and dodging is so slow you can't react to anything you just have to guess if maaaybe the guy is going to attack in 5 seconds so you have enough time to start the animation. The only viable technique seems to be standing around in parry until the enemy finishes their animation so you can start yours.Maps are claustrophobic and feel fairly linear. Again, feels like an old mediocre xbox game that didn't have much memory to load bigger maps or display many polygons. You don't feel like you have much room to move around, and movement is so slow and clumsy it's a chore to run anywhere. The 'side' areas are just tiny branches with a few things on the ground to pick up off and then you are back on your one main path again.Graphics aren't that great. I like the style but the graphics feel dated. I'm running with everything on the highest settings possible and it'd still get beat by games 5 years older than it. C'mon, my computer can handle a few more polygons or foliage that doesn't look like abstract art. Bad ui/controls/ai - Controls are super simple.. again feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port. You pretty much just spam mouse clicks everywhere to do anything.. which includes picking up gold or talking to your annoying ai companion. Just from the start I've already gotten sick of trying to pick up gold or something and constantly going into the short 'talk' action with the companion. Her sass gets old reaaaal quick. Horrible combat/non-combat modes - There are two basic modes.. combat where your controls are all for fighting, and non-combat for things like running around, interacting with the scene, looting and picking up stuff. And the animation to draw your weapon is laggy and slow as hell. What does this mean? You can either run around in non-combat mode so you can look for loot and stuff to interact with, and then when you get ambushed from nowhere on the tiny maps sit there getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥until the monster gives you enough time to finish your draw weapon animation. OR, run around with your weapon drawn unable to loot anything. Awesome choices!Pros: I don't really have any at the moment. I like the pirate/magic crossover. I haven't gotten far enough to experience many different skills so I'm really hoping those help provide a tiny bit of fun for the giant waste of money this has been so far. "

												Although it has some good and entertaining parts......what the **** has happened?example Antigua: town is overrun with monsters, people dead on the floor....so I go to the bar, where everyone is chilling, or talk to the wife of Wilson, who blubbers about some letter to give to her husband, or her helper......A temporary companion is standing around with the hellhounds in the middle of the square....in the warehouse next door, some dude is hung up with magic, guarded by hellhounds. NOONE, just NOONE is doing anything. It just feels that the developer wanted to put a few npc in for the joke of it, but anyone being afraid? Not really.Generally speaking, tons of useless dialogue to skip only, the main character talks as if he swallowed a pack of cigarettes, NPCs, even quest related ones, are underdeveloped to say the least.....The fighting system might be ok, but always making three turns, before hammering down the sword (while the monsters are watching you in awe).....nothing to add to this. Well yes, you can roll away, no matter the ground, and then you wait for your companion to kill anything, even if it is 20 crabs, 3 dragon snappers, a hellhound gang, 5 titan lords.....I know that this is more a raging runt about the game, than a review, but after enjoying all the gothic parts, and risen 1 and 2, what exactly is the developer trying to achieve here? I played less than 2 hours now and cannot continue, because the game is just unbelivably infuriating and dumbed down, no effort can be felt that should have gone into the game*s development. After finishing Risen 2, I really liked that there would be a possibility to continue the storyline of Risen, because I like it. Right now though, I enjoyed the unpatched Gothic 3 a lot more.			"

												Seems unfinished or rushed.  Lacks final product polish.  Combat has very little depth.  Things like auto parry and blocking just by holding the mouse down are rediculous.  Monsters seem very easy to defeat.  The combat is essentially a bad version of Assassin's Creed series (which I dislike as well... but still).  All these combine to make a game that probably shouldn't be on the top sellers list but is anyways.They even boast that their's no weight limit on your character - loot is meaningless if you can just carry everything.

												Avoid this game.Some people will claim I dont have sufficient time in the game to give it a negative review. But it does not take very long to know that the fundamental mechanics of a game are flawed beyond repair. Voice acting is terrible. The first companion foisted on you is crass, annoying and being rid of her is a blessing. The second companion could not be a worse match for his voice actor if the developers had tried. Its really, really bad. And so is his acting. The combat is...bad. I dont know why Block/Parry exists. Its useless against, well...everything. Literally, everything. A Chimp-sized monkey will break your block. On the first or second attack. Dodging is, well...time it right. Which is hard, since your character first has to throw his arms into the air theatrically in order to announce his dodge roll. And weapon strikes...I'm guessing the sword he is swinging weighs between 40 pounds and one metric ton, based on the speed with which he swings it. Some people will claim has the 'usual quirks' of a Risen title. And this is true, if those quirks are poor production values, terrible voice actors, horrid combat, shoddy camera and game play that is nowhere near in alignment with the price they are charging for the game.$50 wasted.

												I dont want to tell you a big story so here the pro and cons.Pro:- RPG With many options like you had in similar games from this developer. - The Graphic Artist made a good job, the game looks good.Cons- Bad combat system, remember those boars in Gothic 3? I dont know how could they implement such monsters again. Enemy will jump in your back from a distance. - Monsters everywhere! You cant even walk 3 meters without a fight, if you try to avoid it the enemy will simply rush you. yes they are faster and stronger than you.-The difficulty is bad balanced. You can pick between easy medium and hard. Difference is just less enemy damage and less enemy hp. They will still charge you and knock you down, over and over again.- The dialogs, it really feels like that the voice actors didnt do their job, but i actually know that many of them where in other games from this developer before. So i guess thats not their fault. My clue is that they simply didnt had have enough time to get into their roles. - Inventory..... Didnt they learn enything? I mean come on.... One row, for all items. Scoll down scroll up.... Not even a search function.Acutally all things that could be fixed. Game is fun at some points but the worst is the combat system. "

												Risen 3 is simply superb in my opinion, it has just about everything that a great RPG should have. The graphics are beautiful maxed-out in 1080p and it runs silky smooth.  The exploration is sublime and the combat, while a bit tricky sometimes, is a blast against pretty darn good ai.  Remember to dodge a lot or you will die repeatedly			"

												My initial day one release review. Nice Game so far..voice acting and script are not the greatest, but that can be overlooked. Lighting and shadows are fantastic. Textures could stand to be improved. Combat is the core gem of this game. Movement is ciritical to survival.  Plenty to explore and treasures to be found.  I will post further as I play the game more.			"

												I enjoyed the Gothic series games, but I couldn't stomach the lacking combat system.  After playing Dark Souls / Demon Soulss, the combat in this game feels so static / limited / amateur.  Perhaps, my level of standards has become too lofty.  I may try to get into it later on, but for now this is not a chef recommend from me.			"

If Elex will be same i will Refund aswell. I think everybody should! They seem like sold their gamer soul for money..			"

												This game is absolute garbage in terms of balance, combat, and ease of play. And i don't mean it's hard for n00bs... I mean this game is neither fun, nor enjoyable, the combat is way too simple, way too rigid, has horrible animations, and trying to do any damage to any enemy is impossible when one attack takes 3 seconds to pull off and an enemy can counter in .05 seconds. Parrying is useless, combos are useless, and shooting enemies right in their face, can miss. You can't target an enemy, you can't lock the camera, enemies can circle around you faster than you can respond. They can stun lock you, and even PAST all this, the gameplay is boring and slow as hell. Absolute garbage. I will not keep this game, and i don't recommend you buy it at ANY price, let alone at full.			"

												+Various followers, with tons of dialog (their in-fight dialog is limited, but they all have different things to say when you're exlporing different parts of the world), and great voice acting. Great graphic art style. NPCs as usual leave a little to be desired (repeated skins), but they have been getting better every game. Lots of different areas to explore on each island. Think exploration in Risen 1 times ten.Game length is pretty decent. First playthrough was about 35 hours, not including dlc. Lots of quests ranging from simple fetch quests to posessing a Kila to convince various members into joining a war. Varied enough to keep it interesting. Combat is flexible and allows a combination of melee/magic/ranged options.Sea monsters and monkeys.-FIre/Ice/Shock glove felt kind of samey. I miss magic bullets. Fleet/boat battles are pretty weak and last less time than the cutscenes setting them up. Major boss battles are turned into a race against the enemies' regeneration.

												I loved Riften 1, but hated Riften 2, alot.  I decided to give this game a shot, however.  From the start, this game hit me in the mouth with a useless tutorial and console tard feel.  This game is a Riften 2 clone, and even more so catered to XBOX.  The story continues the timeline of the previous game, and pretty much copies the combat and magic system of its predecessor.  Which are terrible in my opinion.  The graphics and stability are much improved over Riften 2, however.  Which is a huge bonus because Riften 2 ran like crap on my NVidia 750TI on low resolution and low graphic settings.  This game runs on medium graphics and 1080p with no problem on my rig.  Even with the improved graphics, I found myself looking at identical user interfaces, level up system, and item system of Riften 2.  This, like the second Riften, is a Pirates of the Carribean, mash buttons until enemies die, waste of time.			"

												A lot of you may wonder if you should buy Risen 3 Titan Lords. I will say yes you will want to know why well Grandpa DragonSamurai360 will show you the way to glorious knowledge on such an Awesome game. Pros:1. - Amazing Graphics maxed out with 35-40 fps, 1600 X 900 Resolution, on a GT 755M, yes that means a laptop dedicated graphics card.2. - So far story is Awesome I may have played not very much but I am extremly familar with the Risen serious as I played it far before I started playing PC games on XBOX 360.3. - It is not an easy game to play it requires some skill but with practice nay gamer can become a pro at this AWESOME title!4. - From what I have seen so far it looks like this game has a massive combo of features used from Risen 2 Dark Waters & Risen 1.5. - My suggestion don't listen to reviews buy the game, try it, and if you love it continue playing, if you don't like it uninstall and don't play until you wish to do so again.Cons: - = None So Far.

Ive got around five hours in gameplay right now and i love it. lots of optimizations and fixes bring this title to where it should be. Its easily an 80 out of 100 for me. Reminds me so much of risen one but with huge updates/ changes/ story. if you are on the fence -and you loved Risen, liked Risen 2, you will love Risen 3 do not wait buy it now.			"

												PB games are NOT for everyone, the stories won't blow you away, the graphics are usually not up to par with current tech, the camera usually sucks and animations are some of the worst you will come across. Yet there is alot I enjoy with the games PB has made (Gothic 1-3 and Risen 1-3). Risen 3 is here and in my opinion it is the best of the series, Magic is back, melee combat is improved (you still have to go to trainers and learn new moves, improvements,etc.. Some of the series long lasting issues rear there head such as what I mentioned above with the terrible animations and a story that could be alot better). Risen 3 won't win Game Of The Year awards and probably not many RPG of the year awards either with games like Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland, Dragon Age and Pillars of Eternity out or coming out this year, it does have a good amount of issues but for me the good outweighs the bad and overall is my favorite PB game since the wonderful Gothic 2.The overall combat is a nice improvement from Risen 1/2, you have the option to put points into skills with glory points you have gotten (from doing missions and killing enemies) and also training with trainers in towns for new moves like Parry, Pickpocket,etc.. These improvements help big time for things like combat,etc... Hit a trainer up for Parry, Speed and what ever type of sword you use (Slash, Sword or another) and you will be kicking♥♥♥♥♥in no time. This game does not hold you're hand, it is a very nice challenge, although not quite as hard as Risen 2. Combat is not perfect though, there are still some issues but bringing Magic back and improving the Melee abit has gone a long way. Far from a flawless game but a nice step in the right direction for PB, hopefully they can improve even more in this department for the next game.The start of the game is a bit slow and can also be very tough, especially for new players. You're character has not leveled up and doesn't have any moves really other than a normal and a heavy attack. Get past the first little bit and things start to pick up quickly. You have lots of trainers to pick from and also a bunch of factions to pick from so make sure to use them. These games don't hold you're hand and you will feel overwhelmed at the start, just make sure to visit trainers and save often and you should be good.The graphics are improved from Risen 1 and Risen 2, but its still inconsistent. Some of the landscapes, character faces and colors look gorgeous, while other things like buildings up close and animations are laughable. Although for me I dont expect top of the line graphics or animations from PB games, they are much more than just fancy graphics or animations. Sure I would love a Risen game on a Witcher engine or something (speaking of witcher, the devs said they have taken inspiration from the old Gothic games also made by PB, for there upcoming open world game Witcher 3), but this is a smaller dev team and atleast for me animations and graphics are last on my list. Still there are some spots where I was in awe of some of the beauty in the game, come over a mountain at night with you're torch and you will witness a beautiful scene.The leveling up is very good and you have many options with how you want you're character to go. Want to do some thief aspects? Put tons of points into the categories that support pickpocketing and locksmithy when you level up and also go to some trainers and improve that way to. Also depending on what faction you join you will have access to unique things and missions (I joined the mages, which I am liking alot, especially there island, looks like Risen 1/Gothic style.The audio and music overall is pretty good, the soundtrack is very good that really kicks in when you are exploring these wonderful levels. The voice acting for the most part is good, it ranges from poor to fantastic, but most are good I will say. The game also has the usual PB humor which I love (Divinity Original Sin also had some good humor to), and the dialogue in general is well done (few cheesy parts but would it be a PB game without a little bit of comedy?).One of my favorite aspects of PB games is the exploration and scavaging and Risen 3 does these with flying colors. Each island is different from the last and while some of them are frmo Risen 2, they look completely different, this is the game Risen 2 should have been imo. Also the characters are great and interesting once again, where ever I go in the game I always meet characters that I enjoy talking to, some are funny, some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and some are in the middle. In that sense the writing of the dialogue and characters is good but the writing of the story is not very good impressive.It really comes down to what you think of PB games in general, yes it is an improvement over the first two games but it still has some of its long lasting issues that might throw some people off. But for me I am 30 hours in and having a blast, findng some new areas have me saying ""Just another hour Kozzy"". Risen 3 has been fun as all get out so far, but I don't expect everyone to enjoy this game. The level design is also very well made, each Island I want to explore EVERY INCH. This is something alot of open world rpg devs need to take note of from PB. Sure there is alot of things they can do better, but they have exploring, level design and characters NAILED. What is next for PB? I would love another Gothic game with the improvements made in Risen 3 and hopefully even more improvements down the road. Weither its a new game on a new engine or another Risen or Gothic game I look forward to playing there next game.Sure I wish we could have a new Risen game on a new engine with the best new tech, a better story and for them to keep improving the combat, but in the end I have had a blast and while it won't be my GOTY from a technical standpoint, it has given me some of the most fun ive had in all of 2014. Sort of like indie foreign flicks in the sense that they might not be the best from a technical standpoint as they don't have as much money or people working on the games as some of the big wigs, but they end up doing some aspects better, while some aspects are not as good.In the end Risen 3 is a flawed gem that I recomend to anyone who enjoyed Risen 1, Gothic 1-3 to play, it is a nice mix of the old gothic games and Risen 1/2. Will I say it is better made than say Skyrim? From a design perspective, Hell no. What I will say though is that I have had much more fun on this game in 30 hours than I did playing Skyrim 80 hours. For me the characters are much more enjoyable, the exploration is much mroe rewarding, it is much more challening, I have had more FUN and I like the gameworld design better. If you can put up with a slow start, some terrible animations and a meh story, pick this up with the quickness, it is quite enjoyable.For me this is the best overall PB game since Gothic 2, it is not as open as Gothic 3 and while Risen 1 was a blast, if we are talking best overall package I have to say this is my second favorite PB game. It definatly has its issues and it seems impossible for PB to nail everything perfectly, but I would be lying if I said I havn't been hooked to my computer since I got this game and that a few things have been a nice pleasent surprise. No its not GOTY material or better than the wonderful Divinity Original Sin that we got this year, but I have had a very fun time with Risen 3 so far, a flawed gem indeed. Not quite the masterpeice it could have been, but still my overall experience has been good to great.			"

												I understand some of the negative comments on here, Piranha Bytes games never have been for everyone. I personally wish that combat was back to the original Gothic 2/Risen mechanics where it is difficult but eventually very rewarding.I love exploring the environments and finding a cave hidden behind the brush and having that sense of wonder and appreciating the open world. The world seems more alive to me than Skyrim for example.I played the game using an Xbox controller for a while and that worked pretty well, every ability/feature is easily accessible once you figure things out.Graphics are a little disappointing, especially compared to Risen 1 but are very serviceable.Overall, a great open world experience with a lot of story content and different ways to build your character. I definitely had more of a Gothic 2/Risen 1 feeling with this one vs. Risen 2.  "

												I'm sorry, I wanted to like this game but I just can't. The opening scene and gameplay are just downright terrible. I played through that and got to skull island or whatever they called it. I saw one creature and it was just so horribly executed that I just quit out. It isn't that I experienced any game breaking issues or playability issues, it was just completely uninspired. One would assume that the quality of games would get better as the creators make more but in this case it hasn't. The sister character looks like a bad cliche of a sexy pirate. The animations are uninspired. I actually liked the first game and I felt the series had room to grow and get better. Unfortunately in this case it hasn't. Now I hope there is a way I can trade this game or get some credit I can put toward another.			"

As i told my reviewer  friends There are no-name developers that I just wont buy games from until they are as close to free as they can get, and the Under $10 rack is close enough. I got what I paid for, a good game ruined by the developers lack of skills to fix the bugs, and a good game that doesnt have any support. The way it looks to me on forums is that its Abandonware from developers looking to con their next buck from willing gamers.			"

												***Updated*** I was asked to be less vague about the combat issues.Maybe worth $20-$30, graphics and animations are sub par. Not terrible, but nothing special to look at even on max settings.Combat is clunky and boring, I'm one for diffuiculty, but this is just frustrating. The game is unclear to areas you should be going too. Dailogue is so bad an uninteresting, they try to spice it up with curse words. It's not about them holding my hand, I went to the begining island after the intro chapter. I fooled around with getting some new gear at the shop and upgrading some skills. Even with these upgrades I would be 2-3 shot by an enemy.You get a light attack, a medium attack, a cheap shot (your pistol), a parry and a dodge.Light attack- everything is faster than you, the chance of attacking and not getting hit at least a few times is slim. Wouldn't be a problem if I didn't die in a couple of hits. (Yes there are potions, but excessive prices and the amount of damage you take eats up your money fairly quickly)Heavy attack- needs to charge and is slow, 75% of the time the monster just jumps away from you and you miss.Cheap Shot- This is kind of cool, but damage is weak and you only have a finite amount of ammo or throwing knifes.Parry- this is useless most of the time, even an enemies light attack can break your guard and since most enemies double attack you get hit anyway. A parry is supposed to break the momentum of enemies opening them for an attack. This is a crappy block function at best.Dodge- My least favorite mechanic, your recovery time almost always leads to you getting hit by a follow up attack or another enemy.You end up just blocking and dodging waiting for your companion to kill things. I don't need to be the god of war, but I don't appreciate being a punching bag either.The real draw back to the dialogue is the horrible animations, making it almost unbearable to sit through even a 30 second engagement. I'm sure the game gets better, but almost 2 hours in and I can't even stand to look at it anymore. Reminds me of two worlds, if you remember what that was like I would steer clear of this title.In short I would not recomend buying this until it goes on sale and only if you are an older style rpg fan, or you really enjoy the series.

												I am used to get a little motion sickness when playing FPS for a long time, but Risen 3 was my worst experience ever (by far). Just a few minutes into the game and i cant stand it anymore though i really wanted to play it.This camera movement can't be handled with in the options, there is simply no way to play it for me even with sensitivity tweaked down.If you ever got a slight motion sickness from some FPS, then you may feel my pain with Risen 3.I feel sorry for me, cause of being sick and for the developers, cause i can't recommend it though it may be a decent game if you do not get sick... but i feel like i have to to this:WARNING --- MOTION SICKNESS!!!;) "

												I Played Gothic 1+2, Risen 1+2 and thought: Hey lets play Risen 3 now as the games before were good.I honestly can not say if Risen 3 is a good game or not in the long run, as i did not play it very far.Why didn't i, you may ask?It comes down to 3 things:1) The games graphics make my eyes hurt and give me a headache. The colors are much too bright and saturated and none of the graphic options change that! And changing my whole monitor settings for just a game is very wrong (My monitor is calibrated nearly perfect, as i work as an illustrator). At the same time the dark flair was gone and i thought i would run around in a child tales fairykingdom...2) I was annoyed by the beginning very much. The pseudo-tutorialstyle, The companion constantly saying: wrong way, you should not go there and so on. This series was always about exploring (a bit like Zelda) and the ""you-are-a-noob-are-you-sure-what-you-are-doing-thing"" is really destroying that part3) Combat felt like slow-mo compared to the former games.Where 2+3 could have been ok, 1 was a nogo. I normally do not care much about graphics, as long as the game itself is good. But if graphics hurt you physically it is really bad.			"

												The combat system is laughable, its honestly kind of amusing to watch my character slide 10 feet across the ground when I attack just because what I had targetted was that far away.  Combat in general is really clunky, and attacking is extremely slow.  The old combat system Risen 1, and the Gothic games had was significantly better (should give you an idea if you didn't even like those) - I can't imagine why it was changed to what it is.The voice acting...wow, that's all I can say, its THAT bad.This game might have been good about 5-6 years ago, but the standard that has been set by basically every RPG to come out since then makes it just look really bad.  Its like they just pushed it through because they needed the money or something, I know this company knows how to make quality games, but they've been on a downhill streak for a while now and this is the last game I will be buying from them unless they pull off something truly incredible if they make another game.  If you REALLY need a new game to play go ahead and buy this like I did, but you will be disappointed.  Honestly its sad to see how far this company has fallen, I dont know anyone who liked Risen 2 and this game really isnt any better.			"

												Loved the original Risen, Complete suprise Gem of a game at the time.Risen 2 was, well, so-so.Risen 3 had my hopes up, positive reviews, my own experience with Risen, and i was a bit Game-hungry for something as cool as Risen was.Unfortunately this is a Prime example of how consoles killed games.Controlling this game is crap, near to impossible.It laggs and is unresponsive, and is build towards the crappiest invention since the PC came to be: the ""controller"".----Digressing but important note:----You can not and will never ever play a game with any sense off fullfillment (or with any finesse) using a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ invention like the ""controller"". That piece of totally obsolete plastic was maybe an improvement in the 1980's but not now. And the way some mogul-based bad computer systems (Xbox / PS / etc) try to convince you is bordering, no, totally beyond the line into Indoctrination. (Look up the PCvsConsole discussions of Xbox Halo and Sony's Planetside and read yourself how much ""cheats"" they had to give Controller players to stand a chance against KB/mouse gamers)----------------------------------------I think this is a nice game, with a cool story and cool graphics,but due to the fact that the controls are so unplayable, i'll never know...***updated to correct typo's***			"

												Risen 1 was not that good of a game. There were few objectives other than just wondering around and not dying. The landscape didn't really change. The quests were repetitive.  And you played 99% of the game by yourself with no help from NPCs.   Risen 2 made huge strides.  Suddenly you had objectives and travelling companions.  The NPCs were unique and interesting. I saw many of the elements that made KOTR, DAO Baldurs Gate and even Mass Effect great:  The concept of having a ship/stronghold and seeking out and finding NPCs to form a crew/party capable of taking on some monumental task.  In the process you visit different lands that showcase very different environments, keeping the game from getting boring.  At the end of the day, I can say that I would replay Risen 2 a second time, and that says a lot for a game. So when I saw Risen 3, I bought it hoping for something at least as good and hopefully better than Risen 2. Sadly I was disappointed.  You are no longer playing as the same nameless protagonist that you played in Risen 1 and 2.  Instead you are playing as the brother of the protagonists love interest.  And instead of being educated and well spoken, like someone who could just as easily be a mage or a pirate, the protagonist is a typical pirate thug. One of the games themes is overcoming your thuggish nature...You still have a ship. You still have to gather NPCs and you still get to visit different lands, but it is not fun playing a jerk. I figured there would be a reason why they forced this on me. A plot twist or something special about being related to Steelbeard that was key to the plot.  But it never happens. At the end of the game, I said to myself, ""There is no reason I could not have been the protagonist from Risen 1 and 2"". Regardless of the plot twists or other RPG elements they incorporate, this is one choice they take away from you is simply unforgivable. And since the love interest from game 2 is your sister, there is zero romance and flirting. An element that made most of the other big hit titles I mentioned so successful.So no, I can't recommend this to people. Even if it was free, you are looking at wasting 40+ hours of your life that you will never get back.			"

If you are one of the lucky few able to get past the starting load screen problem (most players can't even play the game right now, awaiting a patch), what awaits you on the other side is nothing you haven't seen before, just not as well done as games previous. Its like they are charging you to relive your least favorite moments from previous RPGs, but in a mediocre, unstable game engine.			"

												★★☆☆☆A hack-n-slash pirate adventure, which functions as an unintentional parody of bad games.  The game opens with my non-customizable character, looking through an invisible spyglass, 10/10 RPG GOTY.  + Monsters+- Combat helpers, but can't be customized- Bad graphics- Bland voice acting- Story starts in a dream- Mindless masher combat- Stamina, invisible stamina- No character customization- Meaningless dialogue system- Meaningless finisher animations- Magic based on single use scrolls- Loading screens every few seconds- Hard toggle between combat and explore mode- Awful interaction/looting, based on character position- Hitting Esc in a submenu drops you out of the entire menu- Ridiculous bugs and design flaws.  The opening cutscene, my character was looking through an invisible spyglass.  There's a missable quest in the first hour of the game.  Corpses glitch through terrain and off cliffs.  Dialogue happens based on character position, so half the time the camera will be behind something, leaving you blind.* This review is only based on the first hour or so of the game, but it was a mess.

 The Death of NostalgiaI think the nostalgia force might be a bit too strong with this one, young padiwan.I myself am exempt from such forces - the first time I played Gothic 1 and 2 notr was Xmas 2011. Make no mistake, I get it. I get why they are such great games. Rewarding combat, memorable soundtrack, brilliant world design etc. but for me Gothic 3 Community Patched with Alternative AI and Balancing trumps the first two, and so does Risen 1. Risen 1's combat is probably the best combat in any similar RPG. The fact that it is possible (though very difficult) to beat the hardest enemies and NPCs with just your starting hero and a wooden stick, is a testament to its greatness. Memorising the enemy's tendencies and combat behaviour is very rewarding, and does not make the game too tedious later on even, as I doubt people will always remember the AI patterns perfectly and perfectly counter them. Dungeons, baby. Dungeons. Brilliantly designed, extremely rewarding dungeons. Of course not too challenging, but you were always under the illusion that you were doing something fairly clever when levitating across lava to morph into a snail to use telekinesis on a lever. The illusion of being a gaming genius and treasure hunter, tomb raider.The voice acting is brilliant too - Lena Headey as Patty was sublime and I wanted to have sex with her animated body. I couldn't have been the only one. Also, memorable music from none other than KaiRo seals the deal. I could go on about Risen 1 and how underrated that game truly is, but alas we need to deal not only with the hits of Piranha Bytes, but also with the misses. In comes Risen 2. ...What were they thinking? How...on earth could they have destroyed the combat so utterly. So profoundly. In the beginning there was no dodge either so to occassionally back away you resorted to this very awkward bunnyhopping. Eventually you realised how OP firearms were and just said ♥♥♥♥ it, let this game be over and done with. Moments of brilliance were seen with the rare use of Voodoo magic to complete some quests, and the beautiful world design. But the voiceacting was atrocious, in addition to the animations, music was forgettable and there were severe vegetation morphing issues (granted fixed by the community later on).I was very very disappointed.In comes Risen 3. Combat still not as good as Risen 1, or even indeed the older Gothics, but it is passable. Music is almost memorable. World design is PB at its finest yet again, with so many levels intricately, hand-designed, with loot sparingly thrown into nooks and crannies waiting to be discovered. But the point is that it is good *enough*, it scratches that Gothic itch. The combat, though a lot more forgiving, will still punish you if you are lulled into a false sense of security due to your stats and weapons and magic. The graphics are gorgeous, especially when tweaked, looks better than many dx11 games, though art design plays an important part in this.What was my point? Enjoy Risen 3 for what it is - it is not Gothic 5, it is not the nameless hero (we know his name is Steelbeard after all), it is not surrounded by KaiRo's music, it is cross platform therefore dumbed down for console peasants, it is Piranha Bytes giving us the best they can whilst trying to earn a living (PC sales are usually a fraction of console sales), it is fun.Oh, and remove those rosetinted nostalgia glasses once in a while and smell the coffee. It's time to move past decade old games.			"

												Exploration is fun and story is cool. Be prepared for some of the most frustrating boss battles though, you know the kind where you enter battle right from a cut scene, the battle requires a game mechanic that is present no where else in the game, and to kill the boss you need to be skilled in ranged. Switching between melee and ranged is time-consuming and ship combat is horrendous.			"

												Hey everyone! Pedro here from the Angry Joe Army!I bought this game with the express intention to review it, and to give advice to other Angry Joe Army supporters!Remember when writing a review to mention the 6 flagship reasons as to why the game is of low quality:- It doesn't let you kill all the monsters as soon as you start (What the hell PB?)- It's story is bad! (Remember not to list specifics)- It's humor is not to your liking! - The graphics are disgusting! (It's like this game was low budget or something? This is CLEARLY a triple A title.)- The voice acting is attrocious! (Couldn't they just get Danny DeVito to voice all the characters in the game?)- The animations are terrible! (They should of hired out Bethesda to do the animations for them)Remember to put all of these in your review, and you'll be representing the good fight in no time! Also remember to like, favourite, subscribe, comment, sign up to four different patreons, facebook, tweet, and buy Angry Joe Shirts to support your favourite Army. The Angry Joe Army! Peace out, Dudes!			"

												**UPDATE** Apparently this bug only affects CPU's with more than 8 virtual cores, not 4 like I originally reported. There is a workaround detailed in that forum but it involves disabling some of your cores and rebooting the machine. You would need a further reboot to re-enable them.BUYER BEWARE: This game is -broken- for anyone that has a CPU with more than 4 cores. Discussion and analysis is here : http://steamcommunity.com/app/249230/discussions/0/35220315959560960/ .... Official comment from the publisher is that they are all out at some show this week so probably wont be able to help for a while. Hope they are having fun. I would like to review it further, however I can't because I can't get past the loading screen and I do not wish to hamstring my computer to do so. When they patch it I'll consider changing this review.			"

												EDIT: To address the whole, ""You haven't played this game enough to judge it"" thing, the reason I haven't played this game that much is because i saw the core mechanics of the game, and they were very flawed, so much so that it made it clear to me that i would not have an enjoyable experience playing this game.   ALSO, there are no pros because this game did not impress me in any way; therefore, i did not find it important for me to say something like, ""Yeah, this part wasn't totally bad"", or ""I guess they did this part okay-ish"".  I found this game to be a waste of $50.  I mean, the game looks and feels like a game i played back in 2003, and it's not even as good as that one.  Now, let me elaborate a bit on what i found to be bad about different parts of the game. First and foremost, the combat system. Absolutely awful combat; it feels like you're playing an RTS game(They attack, you block, you attack, they block or don't).  Not to mention the fact that it's nearly impossible to kill more than one enemy if you don't have a follower.  To sum this one up, the combat is, like i said earlier, an annoying RTS game.  Next let's talk about the voice acting.  It's horrendous.  I mean, the way people talk makes it impossible for you to be immersed.  To sum this one up, you'd be better off using JUST the subtitles. And last, let's talk about the graphics.  Well, there isn't much to say about the graphics, seeing as they are pretty non-existent(that's an exaggeration, of course). But really, they are pretty awful-even on max to near max settings.To sum this one up, the graphics are similar to that of a game made back in around 2010(Just an estimate)Now, to sum everything up, i would avoid this game unless you are a hardcore Risen fan that doesn't mind poor game development, or you just don't mind poor game development and think this game is fun.

												Risen 3 is probably the best game you've ever hated. While it's far from perfect, I dare say it's still one of the most enjoyable open-world action RPG I've played in quite a while. If open-world action RPGs is your bag, you absolutely owe it to yourself to give Risen 3 a go. Just don't let the opening hours discourage you too much; the writing, characters, voice acting and even visuals improve tremendously once you visit some of the more interesting islands (I'd personally recommend starting with Taranis or Calador for your first main island after the tutorial).

												Combat system sucks. The enemy attacks you before you can even attack them. The way the characters interact with each other is pretty bad for a 2014 game. Graphics are not that great either for a 2014 game. Map seems to be somewhat small. Story seems to be a bit lame, too.			"

												So I just bought this useless product made by probably bounch of monkeys. I dont even know where to start because as you can see Ive spend just 23 minuts in this abomination. So 21:9 is not supported but this is just the beginning. Full screen mode is not working as well and you always see your mouse cursor! If you are still willing to play this 'thing' consider that: there is no separate 'use' button! You only have action which is either attack or loot, or open the chest whatsoever so if you are in the fighting mode you cant actually loot! Guys I dont know how about you but I am uninstalling this abomination and for steam: this time I will not want refund so you are lucky guys.			"

												This game has painfully slow combat but the enemies do not and the voice acting in this game is so bad it just makes you want to skip cutscenes and i'm talking about 90s voice acting the graphics are not anywhere near as good as they are showen in the photos even on the highest of settings but it still looks ok a lot the stuff does look blended togather but thats just because the game has very little color to it kinda like how gears of war did this game takes a very bad approach at using magic and when ever something moves on one the characters it looks like it's not supposed to because it stretches  instead of moving and there is definitely no facial expressions no matter what they only have one look the game just feels slow over all i could'nt tell you anything about the story because i skiped all the my cutscenes because of how bad the voices are if the combat was faster and better i could have push more into the game but at this point i just can't the game is definitely not worth full price i'd say buy it on sale			"

												Hello, ist my king of view to the game Risen 3 - Titan Lords. Please dont missunderstand the game is very good made and make a lot of fun. About the gameplay itself you will find many reviews here that better explain the game, so i dont want to write about it. The game has a heavy problem i think. The Problem with the dlcs. I love the dlcs they should add some more ingame stuff that the plaeyer missing at the begin of the game. If the dlcs was inside the game from the beginn you have to pay for them also in the price from the beginn. I had many ""good ? "" games, and also expensive that i have started, saw that i dont like it and never used them again. But for the games i loved i have bougt mostly all dlcs that was availible for it. It allows me dont to pay much from the beginn and adds the extra gameplay stuff that i wanted when i wanted them.Why i have explained this. I have enjoyed the gameplay of the game and bought at the beginn only the regular version of the game. After a while i have bought the first armor dlc (Risen 3: The Adventure Garb), but the armor appears only at the beginn of the new game in you inventory. Ok i have missed it, but i cant change the time it will be add to the game. Now i have finisched the game and  wanted to play it a little bit more so bought the Risen 3 - Titan Lords (First Edition) and again the two new islands are availible to visit only if you start a new game, and loose all you have made in in. That shouldnt happens. (and the place you will visit is fast similar to them in the first parts of the game.DONT BUY ANY DLCS FOR THE GAME IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE GAME AND DONT WANT TO START FROM THE GAME FROM THE BEGINN.

												What a truly disappointing game. Having never played any of the Risen games before I thought this would be similar to The Witcher, or I hoped it would be anyway. The graphics are weak, gameplay is increasingly dull, fight sequences are just plain horrible. I played 5 minutes and just had to stop and take a break because it was so bad.Deffinitely not worth the money I paid, if there was a refund choice I would be asking for one right now.Teaches me not to pre-order a game I haven't played the franchise of before and not wait for the reviews on it.

												One of the worst games out there. Graphics look very nice for a 2014 game but performs terrible . I have screen tears and frame drops everywhere. I have a gtx970 and an i5 4590. The game performs the same on ultra and low. I only paid 2eur for it but still think it's not worth it. I could not play for more than 15 minutes. The voice acting is TERRBILE! Also the gameplay is one of the worst i've seen in my life. I just finished Mafia 2 today, a game released in 2010 and i have to say i expected a lot more from Risen 3. It's best to avoid it.			"

												Despite the game's description of an Elder Scrolls style adventure, you actually play as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pirate captain Shia LaBeouf. Best known for his busty sister, they both excel at pointing out the obvious with less than decent voice acting. While the main enemy appears to be the evil ghost captain, Paully D, it's actually the gameplay. This game plays like you smashed together Skyrim, Fable, and Dark Souls, and includes none of the good aspects of the combat. No ability to lock onto an enemy and a wonky♥♥♥♥♥""parry"" system made the combat frustrating, and I resorted to wasting all of my musket rounds trying to shoot a ♥♥♥♥ing gorilla.Overall, this game gets 2/10, because his sister has big♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE GAMECOMBAT:  is horrible. They added combo's into the game where you can attack more than 1 time for a 3 hit combo. Like most games with this design the monster will hit you before you can even get your 2nd swing off. You have to parry all the time and just attack once or risk getting hit alot for a weak follow up attack.Movement is clunky and the overall feel is bad.Voice acting/acting in general is bad. Final thoughts....this games overall design is like going back in time. I take a swim in the ocean and guess what. I come out completely Dry. No water effects on armor/etc. this game was def not worth the price tag. Wait till it goes on sale if you really want to check it out.			"

												So...What can i say about this game?It's different, it's not a normal rpg, or better a what we were accostumed in a modern RPG.The combat is challenging at first, probably too much for some people, but the quests are good, and you really feel good when you start to get better itens and when you increase your skills. It's like you start as a homeless man and ends as a bilionaire. Yeah, at the end of the game you barelly lose health and deal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage, it's nice to feel like that.Still , what more you have in this game? Nice quests, sometimes very interesting ones, very nice maps, and you are very rewarded when you explore, and theres loads of place to explore in this game. Also is nice to play a pirate rpg.

												Having actually enjoyed Gothic 3, and then Risen 1 and 2, I was quite surprised by how tedious I found this game, to the point where I stopped playing and unistalled it after about 10 hours. I thought for sure it would be an improvement over the previous two Risen games, or at least as good.  How long should you play a game that is boring and frustrating before throwing in the towel?Since I played a 30 hour game for about 10 hours, take that into consideration when reading this. I was not able to finish, nor would I ever want to. But I paid for it and did not really get my money worth. The first Risen game was pretty straight forward, with a simple plot and simple combat with a small yet interesting island to explore. Risen 2 gave you a pirate ship and a crew and added some more complexity. I guess Risen 3 had to get more complicated, giving you too much to do, too many ways to do it, and too many places to go. The combat was sloppy in the first two games, but you were able to endure it and it didn't really get in the way of progress. In this game, the combat should have been cleaned up, but instead it is still clunky and it now gets in the way of progress. The low level enemies surround you and overwhelm you with interupting attacks. After 10 hours, I still felt like a weakling. The game starts off by taking all of your abilities away from you and leaving you with a crappy raft. You have to really work to get it back and it felt like a chore. I never did get my ship back, and I didn't want to grind my life away to get it. I never felt any sense of improvement from gaining experience and abilities. I basically felt like a helpless idiot wandering around an island getting killed by every single enemy I would encounter, doing fetch quests for the locals with little payoff. The game really is a chore. It should pay you to play it.			"

												After a slow, confusing and boring start the game slowly starts to speed up to the point it turns into a good Piranha Bytes game. Not perfect, not like Gothic or Risen 1 but still a decent game. The main issue to my humble opinion : too many characters, side stories, and useless branches of the plot that at the end I feel not attached to almost anything in the game, being it a character , goal, or a quest. While it does sound a bit negative, the game is a solid RPG, still faithful to the legacy of PB. Recommended for Gothic fans!			"

Thumbs up for this game and if you are a fan of Risen then you must play this one aswell... even some say that is crappy or other remarks about it :)Sure it still has some annoying things and it doesn't pass 5-10 minutes without yelling like a madman in front of the screen like : -Come on ... that AIN'T FAIR !!! , - MOVE IT YOU LITTLE SH*T , GET LOST YOU F*CKING PIECE OF SH*T , or the most common for me is LEAVE ME THE F*CK ALONE ( .. i play on hard .. so most of my game consist in running around like a retard :x ) Or when some mobs start attacking you and you can't DO SH*T ........ because the hero attacks like he has been smoking for a week and it's like chill chill ..............................And yes it has some problems with the graphics... but trust me IT'S WORTH IT.BUY IT NOW ON SALES , you won't regret it :)			"

												Being the third installment of the series its always nice to see returning faces. Yes the combat is repetitive, yes the dialogue could be so much more intuitive but I still had to play it until I completed it all.I did 1,2,3 off the bat so maybe it was just doing the same thing over 3 games got repetitve but hey I couldn't just stop the game/series is addictive and I found the environments ppleasant and full of many surprises. There is so much more they could of done with the game if you compare to similar games but all in all I would recommend the trilogy so far and think that deepSilver could really axpand on this and maybe they will bring a new IP soon.I'd give the overall trilogy about 7/10 as there is plenty of room for improvement but i enjoyed the game enough to see through all 3.

												To be honest, I don't know why I bought this game. The two previous installments in the Risen series were terrible and Risen 3 certainly doesn't disappoint if you want more of what you've had in the previous games. ProsVery buggy so you won't have to play it for very long before force-closingCons Terrible voice acting Poor graphics Sloppy and uninteresting combat Frustratingly long loading times Full of bugsThis game is about as fun as being repeatedly slapped around the face by the genitals of an unwashed tramp			"

												As I haven't played Risen and Risen 2 before purchasing the game I did not really know what to expect, but as an RPG fan I quite enjoyed the game. Starting with the visuals, I must say they are absolutely stunning. If you like taking beautiful screenshots, Risen 3 is definitely for you!About the story line: good but not great. There are plenty of side quests to choose from though. I really enjoyed having companions throughout the quests, they were useful and some of them had an awesome sense of humour. You simply cannot get enough of Bones' remarks. There are some pretty cool skills as well, like the Monkey. You can actually train a monkey to steal for you. Mini games are a good source of extra coins, you can choose knife-throwing, arm-wrestling and drinking.Sea battles are also very enjoyable.I have played over 50 hrs without buying the DLCs, but I definitely could have played another 50.

												Here's the thing about Risen 3Even though I've pressed the ""I recommend this game"" button, I don't think it fits for all situations.The graphics are decent, the writing and voice over have their moments but are overall mediocre, the story is... meh and  the game play is tough.This should not be confused with Dark Soul's tough but fair, as in if you die, YOU screwed this up, nope, it's more like, if you died , yeah you may have done something to prevent this, but probably your character isn't really good enough at this moment, so run away and level up.In fact the game play is a classic zero-to-hero deal, like in the gothic series and the other risen games, if you enjoy being beaten mercilessly at the beginning only to come back 10 hours later to BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF THOSE STUPID DODO BIRDS THAT STUNLOCK THE CRAP OUT OF YOU....... yes you will enjoy this.While exploring, you get stat points or skill points or whatever they're called, and you can spend them to raise your stats. If your stats are high enough you can buy skills, this is what in effect counts as leveling, and many of the skills make a huge difference in your character's fighting ability, and if you will be able to kill a monster or not.You will at some point get to pick one of three factions, which will give you magic, doing it sooner rather than later will make the game easier.The only problem (yes I know there are a number of problems, this is the only one that I cared about)  I've had with this game is that , even though I like the zero-to-hero model, towards the end it becomes very easy, in fact boringly so, I powered through it just to say that I have finished it. I guess they could have done a better job at keeping the difficulty a bit higher towards the end.Overall I liked it, maybe my opinion is a bit biased for personal reasons, or because I played this right after the shipwreck that was sacred 3, which made me appreciate things a bit more.Bottom Line:If you liked the gothic games or the previous risen games, or if you like games that start out frustrating (no , not hard, there's a difference) , then this game is probably for you			"

The gameplay is typical for this series but the protaginist and his sister are a bit annoying voice acting wise.

												Piranha Bytes have finally implemented proper physics into their game and by doing so making the game a lot more responsive and enjoyable. They also balanced the game to make it more accessible to everyone since previous ones were more of an hardcore role-playing experience.The story is really lackluster and feels pointless. The hero that you play is very annoying and got a god awful voice. However the gameplay is really fun and the atmosphere and exploration makes up for the story.			"

												Fun game. Good game world. It is basically the same world as Risen 2. The story is pretty decent, the combat is fine, and the quests aren't repetitive. Considering RPGs, the quests are pretty unique and never felt stale. It took me 30 hours to play through doing almost all of the side quests, so it is a nice size.There would be decent replay value if you wanted to try a mage, a swordsman, or a rifleman. The different factions offer replay value too. I don't think the game world is compelling enough to warrant a second go at the story, but I can see some reasons one might.I'd recommend it mainly because I heard a lot of negativity surrounding it, and I found it to be solid. It's not a great game, but it is a good game. Well worth your money if you have played others in the series.			"

												So...What can i say about this game?It's different, it's not a normal rpg, or better a what we were accostumed in a modern RPG.The combat is challenging at first, probably too much for some people, but the quests are good, and you really feel good when you start to get better itens and when you increase your skills. It's like you start as a homeless man and ends as a bilionaire. Yeah, at the end of the game you barelly lose health and deal a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of damage, it's nice to feel like that.Still , what more you have in this game? Nice quests, sometimes very interesting ones, very nice maps, and you are very rewarded when you explore, and theres loads of place to explore in this game. Also is nice to play a pirate rpg. What is not so nice or downright bad? Well, i like a nice story, and this aspect of the game is quite bad, the plot is bad... the protagonist is quite uninteresting, also the combat, it's good and bad at the same time, the enemies can stun lock you eating away your health crazily fast.So... if you still reading this, you probably is a bit confused, it's a love or hate game, i hated some parts, still i think it's worth playing, it's nice to not be a viking , or a medieval warrior sometimes, and you'll be rewarded by getting good at the combat of this game. I had the same experience with Risen 2, and it feels weird, but also nice, and don't give up, it's much more hardcore than most games nowadays. I don't want to be an elitist, but having to earn something after working hard for it feel pretty damn good, and sometimes those old school games are right.tl/dr: just buy it in a sale and try, you'll learn a different kind of gaming.

												The combat in this game feels a little ... incomplete. Early game, after I had gotten over the mistake of spam-clicking attacks, I found enemys who guarded (like skeletons or goblins) impossible to manage, I had little time to distance myself for a power attack, and I ran out of ammunition quickly, after obtaining the riposte skill they became more tolarable.The true source of my discomfort with the combat would be battles with multiple creatures (3+) Whenever I entered larger battles I would constantly get angry as my companion would just stay back circling around an enemy occasionly taking a swing, I would get inturupted during swings, the auto-lock was infuriating switching to another foe whenever I repositioned myself and my dodge roll would not move me away from the battle, always getting stuck on foes or small ledges, making it worthless in any closed-in or rocky area.Thankfully the exploring of the landscape at the interacting of NPC's leaves a nice cooldown between combat.

												Good:- Return of three factions increases replayability.- Diverse and effective spells/skills, many of which are unique to each faction.- Characters and dialogue still have the old PB charm.- Islands are large and interesting to explore.- Expanded combat mechanics.- You can turn into a parrot.- You can talk to a parrot.- Your parrot has his own questline.- You can still deploy monkeys.- Treasure hunting is still fun.- DLC is way more substantial and compelling than Risen 2's.Bad:- Enemies only attack one at a time, making groups of enemies far less threatening than they used to be.- Morality system encourages metagaming rather than making choices you genuinely believe in.- Patty looks like a stripper.- Chani is more white.- You play as a new protagonist with a silly voice.- Combat still has the old PB jank.- Skill checks rarely offer alternative quest solutions.- Naval boss battles are annoying.- Lots of recycled content from Risen 2.- Lockpicking minigames are still tedious (though this is true of minigames in general).Conclusion: If you enjoyed the previous Risen games, you will very likely enjoy Risen 3. If you didn't enjoy them, Risen 3 won't change your mind.			"

												Overall the game is ok, fairly long playing time with good RPG elements.Positive:+  Graphically it is pretty good, with latest patch they've improved texture resolutions. FPS does drop when everything is maxed out.+ Story is fine. At least I didn't forget what I was supposed to do, when playing this game only 1-2 times a week+ Minigames. Although simple, some of them are pretty fun to play.+ Exploration. The game always encourages you to look for something special that is hidden near by. It is a very rewarding experience+ Map design, overall pretty good and with a nice variety.Negative:- Combat. The most frustrating combat experience ever. I couldn't find any other game where combat experience was that bad. Controls have a lot of delay, some keys don't register so you have to mash the buttons multiple times to make sure it will. The overall dodge mechanic is just annoying and doesn't make the combat fun in any way. In fact, while you are dodging you are complete invulnerable to damage ? Batman Arkham series have shown what a good fun and fluit combat should be like, take notice Piranha Bytes ! - AI. I don't even know if there is an AI in this game. Pretty much all the enemies just charge straight towards you, and go into attack/dodge cycle. Funny thing almost every single monster in the game behaves pretty much the same way, shouldn't there be a better variation of enemy AI, maybe ? Companions pretty much the same thing, while they do follow you, sometimes they just get stuck and become missing, or they go and run away from you, just to hit a monster. And why enemy AI always targets me first ? The fact that I have companions doesn't seem to matter to them.- Glitchy and buggy, for some reason the game kept crashing on me, I occasionally get stuck in the walls, enemies don't care and just go through them. Many other minor issues as well.- Difficulty spikes. In the beginning when you are going with melee, you are going to be destroyed a lot. In the end when you go with magic you are going to destroy everything so easily that game becomes extremely easy. Shouldn't there be a different difficulty curve, like easy in the beginning and harder in the end instead ?			"

												Really great game. It is not just like the old gothic games or first risen, but it is fun to play, except the slow combat, they are really slow but if you learn how to use it it is ok, but not ok as it was in gothic so, if you dont know what to play right now, go for it :)Pros: Graphic, story, voice, magicCons: Combat			"

												Risen series surely aren't as amazing as Gothic, but Piranha Bytes just know how to make good RPGs. Good old characters from the previous games, Patty as hot as always, although this time you play as her brother, so meh, incest is not my thing. I was kinda hoping for a closer, clearer connection with the Gothic universe, but sadly, nothing like that happens. Gotta criticize some things tho. The combat finish animations are really annoying after a while. Dunno what they thought, implementing those. And also the lackluster ending (I mean, the boss battle was amazing, maybe the best I've seen from PB, but the ending itself, meh). Otherwise, certainly worth the buy :)			"

												The dialogue in this game is so absolutely, hilariously, cheesy. The voicing of our ""Hero"" was probably supposed to be along the lines of Captain Jack Sparrow, but actually sounds more like Jason Stratham (Transporter) doing an impression of Mel Gibson playing Jack Sparrow. ;o) And the general character animations during dialogues were usually restricted to swaying back and forth and a few complimentary waves of the hand. Oh, and Patty, looks like a strip-a-gram in a naughty pirate costume, which MAY be very distracting for some players.But, you know what? None of that's, by any means, a deal-breaker. I did groan a few times during the first hour or two, but once I got used to it, I actually started to accept it as ""just the style of the game"" and began to find it quite funny.As for questing, well it takes a little while to get yourself up and running to a level where you can at least deal with stuff. Spending a good few hours on the same island at the start (your chosen faction) will serve you well. After that, it's off to explore the map, and do all the usual ""Questy"" stuff...which was really quite fun, and only minimally ""back & forth, back & forth"".The graphics/environment were pretty good, and the free-to-roam aspect was fun. Especially once you've figure out how to get to the seemingly impossible to reach places.If you like this type of game, it's pretty good fun, and does not take itself seriously AT ALL! It does for RPG-questing games, what Spinal Tap did for Rockumentaries.70 hrs of fun, no regrets...8/10 "

												This is great game. The best from all Risen games, it is like Risen 2 combined with Risen 1. Take the pirate atmosphere and whole world from Risen 2 and combine it with difficullty level and fractions from Risen 1. Mix it. Shake it. And Pooof! You have Risen 3. I think it is good combination. Finaly you have some difficulty back, because Risen 2 was too easy. Fighting system is good I dont think it is too hard or something. It is about moving, parrying and dodging by yourself you must get used to it. I found myself pressing WSAD keys like crazy because the hero will not do it by himself automatically. There is some chance that he dodge attack of enemy by himself but it happens only ocasionaly. So you must prepare yourself for every fight, the game will does not do it for you.Graphically the game looks good. Llittle above awerage. There are some nice moments when you stop in game just to watch sunset, or sea. Sometimes you just want to stop and watch the graphics. The environment is really nice there are sun rays, blur is not that much annoying, and everithing you can change in settings. Models and animations are good. There is nothing that will make you feel sick or something.If you have played Gothic and or Risen games and you liked it, this is game for you. It have some difficulty, tons of quests, big world, pirates. Dont push yourself to play it. You must be in the right mood for challenge. Then you will like this game.Keep up good work Piranha Bytes!			"

												Ive been a fan of both risen games, risen is, in my opinion, one of the best old-school-rpgs out there. And risen 2 is one of the few good pirate themed rpgs in existence.This game however.. kinda sucks. Instead of fixing the problems the previous games had, it puts them on steroids.The combat in risen always had a few problems, the players windup has always been a little to long but in this game it takes AGES to throw a punch, that on its own wouldnt be to bad if the enemys had any windup at all (which they dont) they throw a barrage of attacks at you (each of them stunning you and canceling any attack youre trying to do) which leaves you two options:1. Be totally at the mercy of the enmeies AI, hoping that you get enough hits out before the lock you in place.2. Go ranged and run and jump around like a cat hoping they dont get to youThe voiceacting is beyond terrible, which is a shame considering that they got a lot of the voiceactors from the previous games back, who are even playing the same characters. They didnt do so bad back then (gruanted the dialouge was pretty cheesy at times but always beliveable) which leads me to belive they just werent given any directions or at least pretty terrible ones.The world itself is designed pretty well, they took old maps from risen 2 and modified them so it would fit the needs of this game but never to a point were you couldnt recognize them anymore, you can always remeber back how it looked ""back then"", they even have characters from the previous games who you dealt with on your journey in risen 2, thats cool, right? Not really, since youre not the same character as from the previous games, you cant really talk with them about anything from the past, which makes having them there kinda pointless.I never would hav e thought that this would be the closing statement of my review to a risen game but:DONT BUY IT!

												Fun game. Good game world. It is basically the same world as Risen 2. The story is pretty decent, the combat is fine, and the quests aren't repetitive. Considering RPGs, the quests are pretty unique and never felt stale. It took me 30 hours to play through doing almost all of the side quests, so it is a nice size.There would be decent replay value if you wanted to try a mage, a swordsman, or a rifleman. The different factions offer replay value too. I don't think the game world is compelling enough to warrant a second go at the story, but I can see some reasons one might.I'd recommend it mainly because I heard a lot of negativity surrounding it, and I found it to be solid. It's not a great game, but it is a good game. Well worth your money if you have played others in the series.			"

												What can i say... Thumbs up for this game and if you are a fan of Risen then you must play this one aswell... even some say that is crappy or other remarks about it :)Sure it still has some annoying things and it doesn't pass 5-10 minutes without yelling like a madman in front of the screen like : -Come on ... that AIN'T FAIR !!! , - MOVE IT YOU LITTLE SH*T , GET LOST YOU F*CKING PIECE OF SH*T , or the most common for me is LEAVE ME THE F*CK ALONE ( .. i play on hard .. so most of my game consist in running around like a retard :x ) Or when some mobs start attacking you and you can't DO SH*T ........ because the hero attacks like he has been smoking for a week and it's like chill chill ..............................And yes it has some problems with the graphics... but trust me IT'S WORTH IT.BUY IT NOW ON SALES , you won't regret it :)			"

												The combat in this game feels a little ... incomplete. Early game, after I had gotten over the mistake of spam-clicking attacks, I found enemys who guarded (like skeletons or goblins) impossible to manage, I had little time to distance myself for a power attack, and I ran out of ammunition quickly, after obtaining the riposte skill they became more tolarable.The true source of my discomfort with the combat would be battles with multiple creatures (3+) Whenever I entered larger battles I would constantly get angry as my companion would just stay back circling around an enemy occasionly taking a swing, I would get inturupted during swings, the auto-lock was infuriating switching to another foe whenever I repositioned myself and my dodge roll would not move me away from the battle, always getting stuck on foes or small ledges, making it worthless in any closed-in or rocky area.Thankfully the exploring of the landscape at the interacting of NPC's leaves a nice cooldown between combat.

												After a slow, confusing and boring start the game slowly starts to speed up to the point it turns into a good Piranha Bytes game. Not perfect, not like Gothic or Risen 1 but still a decent game. The main issue to my humble opinion : too many characters, side stories, and useless branches of the plot that at the end I feel not attached to almost anything in the game, being it a character , goal, or a quest. While it does sound a bit negative, the game is a solid RPG, still faithful to the legacy of PB. Recommended for Gothic fans!			"

												Well, this game might not be for everyone. But if you liked Risen 2, and want more this is definately going to give you that. From your main characters voice change, to battles unbalanced and watered down to where you will almost never have to reload if you have essentially any companion in your party. It gets a lot of negative press, but really its not  a bad game, most people score it bad because it had the possibility of being a great game. Great graphics, environments familar but still fun to explore and a game that kept me into it for over 50hrs, expansions plus acheivements. I find it hard to not recommend to anyone looking for a gothic style adventure, and has the time and money to spend on it. But if your time is limited look to games like Witcher. I dont regret the 150+ hrs i spent on the risen trilogy, even with the dozens of other viable options.			"

												Being the third installment of the series its always nice to see returning faces. Yes the combat is repetitive, yes the dialogue could be so much more intuitive but I still had to play it until I completed it all.I did 1,2,3 off the bat so maybe it was just doing the same thing over 3 games got repetitve but hey I couldn't just stop the game/series is addictive and I found the environments ppleasant and full of many surprises. There is so much more they could of done with the game if you compare to similar games but all in all I would recommend the trilogy so far and think that deepSilver could really axpand on this and maybe they will bring a new IP soon.I'd give the overall trilogy about 7/10 as there is plenty of room for improvement but i enjoyed the game enough to see through all 3.

												For all Gothic or Risen fans, I can highly recommend this game, especially for the German speaking gamers, 8.5/10. You get the RPG which are you are expecting from Risen 3, I actually really liked the story, the setting with the 3 main islands (and smaller islands) which had a distinct setting, the huge open World to explore, fight monsters, gain XP, increase your talents with trainers, hunt for treasure chests, win in Mini games, recruit companions... a lot to do.  What really makes this a typical Risen/Gothic game is the athmosphere, and the ""dirty rough"" dialogs, which work really well in German (likely not as good in English). The voice actors are excellent, and together with some really crazy and funny quests, they made me smile several times, and thats what I wanted to get.So why not an even higher grade? Well first, the story is almost completely dissociated from the Risen 1+2, which is particularly wierd as you start with the ""Girlfriend"" from Risen2 as companion, but in Risen 3 she is your sister... the 2nd reason is the difficulty... its a bit too easy... and the monsters are not so different in strength anymore... in previous games, stronger monsters like Snappers can kill you in 2 attacks, and you have no chance to kill them... here, you can kill them from the start... which does not make you feel so much that you get stronger with time... and from ca. half-2/3 of the game, you kill everything without much fear of death...In conclusion, Risen 3 is well suited for both veterans who want more of the same formula, but is also good for newcomers, as you dont need knowledge of previous games to enjoy this one.

												Titan Lords is my first game of the series, a game that took a little bit of play through before I really started to enjoy it.  At first glance the game swallowed me with its active environment.  You have the moving oceans, moving trees and grass, animals/vermin/creatures and colorful settings.  While the graphics of the environment was very good in my opinion, the character models did not feel on the same level. Titan Lords gave me a chance to play as a pirate.  With this comes the accent, sea monsters, ship battles and a lot of booty.  (The loot because as far as I know no other booty was obtainable.)The games main characters voice annoyed me in every dialog.  Titan Lords is an easy game to play.  The combat felt over simplified.  Most of the beginning combat consists of parry/dodge and clicking one button to swing the weapon.  You do have a secondary weapon which is a ranged weapon.  From early on one of your goals is to join a faction.  This basically outlines what type of weapons and magic you will be learning.  Titan Lords have several quests for you to check out.  By end game with all of my skills even though the game is easy, I felt like my character went from some lame pirate to the ultimate badass.  I had a lot of fun gathering alliances to overcome the shadow.  Get this game on sale if you love rpgs.			"

												This game is a wonderfully retro rpg that I truly appreciate still having baldur's gate 1 & 2 and other simarly retro games.  I purchased this game recently and I am really enjoying it.  I am not the type to disregard the possible fun and exciting game play simply because the graphics aren't up to snuff by todays or even the standards of 5 years ago.  To be honest I think the games today are focused way too much on graphical appearance and feel and not enough on story and plot development, or character development.  A good backstory can`t be overlooked simply because a game requires a quad-core i7 processor.  The UI is well done in my opinion and has just about everything one could hope for, and the companions or crew don`t require any micro managing.  I think the idea of massing a crew for a big ship is a splendid plot device though i`m slightly disappointed in only having one companion at a time.  I thoroughly recommend this game to anyone looking for a change from current rpg game types, and most definitely for old time gamers such as myself who appreciate games like this and still play the oldies but goodies.

												Titan Lords is my first game of the series, a game that took a little bit of play through before I really started to enjoy it.  At first glance the game swallowed me with its active environment.  You have the moving oceans, moving trees and grass, animals/vermin/creatures and colorful settings.  While the graphics of the environment was very good in my opinion, the character models did not feel on the same level. Titan Lords gave me a chance to play as a pirate.  With this comes the accent, sea monsters, ship battles and a lot of booty.  (The loot because as far as I know no other booty was obtainable.)The games main characters voice annoyed me in every dialog.  Titan Lords is an easy game to play.  The combat felt over simplified.  Most of the beginning combat consists of parry/dodge and clicking one button to swing the weapon.  You do have a secondary weapon which is a ranged weapon.  From early on one of your goals is to join a faction.  This basically outlines what type of weapons and magic you will be learning.  Titan Lords have several quests for you to check out.  By end game with all of my skills even though the game is easy, I felt like my character went from some lame pirate to the ultimate badass.  I had a lot of fun gathering alliances to overcome the shadow.  Get this game on sale if you love rpgs.			"

												If you don't have a third mouse button don't buy this.. or you will spend 20 minutes remapping your keys using third party programs in Windows before being allowed the gracius ability to access the inventory to quick item a sword to access.  I was REALLY excited about the game and payed a good price for it.. then boom.. 10 minutes in your rediscover motion sickness and struggle to pull a lever for 10 minutes because you can't have your sword drawn and act as a functional human being.  I feel like a pirate on disability because you run into heat of battle against a rabit and struggle like a dog.  To strike down this epic creature you have to raise your sword high above your head, stand on one foot, close on one and bring it crashing down on the nearest rock because by the time you get a swing out the creature will either (a) already eaten you alive or (b) moved over one inch which made the 3-5 seconds of sword wielding above your head useless.  Blocking is even worse or nonexistance depending how you look at it.  So while your buying running around like a 4 year old yielding a paper roll tube trying to beat up monkeys and playing the 'put your sword away to pickup a coin.. o wait there is another monkey.. get it out, and put it away, but lets look at this so put it away.. o that might be a monkey pull it out crap you will quickly get frustrated with this par-looking game to start with and wonder why you waste your time with developers like this one who can't master the art of smooth game play.

												Quite a fun game.his game is built on the foundation laid out by Risen 2, and it is a much better game than Risen 2. The story is nice, just like most of the drivel shoved out iin other RPG. But damn, does this game has nice environment and the exploration is really fun. Combat is a bit janky in the beginning, but it becomes much better once you trained in new combat skills.  Ship combat is a bit weird at first, but it is OK once you get the hang of it.I bought the game at full price,  and it is worth it.			"

												From a fan of Gothic games and Risen 1 (I didn't play Risen 2) Risen 3 is a great game.  I was a bit worried due to the negative reviews of Risen 2 and 3, but decided to give it a go. Very glad to have done this, I have many fond memories of ""Gothic"" games - and some more thanks to Risen 3. Makes me wont to play Risen 1 again.Though I'd rather not be negative - I wish that the games returned to the ""one big world"" versus islands (a symptom of consoles I believe), and it would be more ""medieval"" style versus pirate (though I do like the inclusion of firearms) - but those are overall minor issues.

												After reading some reviews, I was reluctant to buy the game, but hey, it's Risen right? So I checked the system requirements and it said i5 so I decided to give it a go since I saw it on 50% sale.Pros:-IT'S RISEN 3!!! LONG AWAITED-Risen 3 people!!!-Did I mention Risen?-Improvement over the other series (although haven't played 2)-Gold and leveling is harsh but enjoyable-Hilarious dialogues-Decent graphics, even my 1.7 GHz i5 HD Graphics 4000 can run it in 20+ fps almost all to low-The fires were amazing, makes me feel warm just staring at them-Open-world, damn where do I start?Cons:-Combat, needs target-locking, I don't want to switch targets when my original target is one slash to death-Voice acting, decent, but it could be better-Not really immersive-----Minor spoilers-----They say first impression lasts and that is what happened; the game didn't catch me at first, but after I left the first island, I was surprised with the potential of the game. I was also surprised I had a lot of quests already at my logbook haha. Damn, those fires were beautiful, and the combat was really unpredictable; you just can't rage and spam left clicking or just parry your battles, but rather wait for an advantage.Although, I'm really put off by simply chugging down a bottle of rum and regaining health in an instant, which really breaks the immersion. I also hated the slow movesets in combat, it goes out at random, and even the combat is about who strikes first, so you're in a disadvantage if your first move is that piroutte against a sand devil or a scavenger.Overall, the game is decent, it has both it's positives and negatives. Don't expect a Witcher game or something dark and macabre, but expect something more of a simple, magical and piratey theme. "

												One of the best RPGs in recent years. Honestly I'm not sure to which game should I compare it, each Piranha Bytes game is its own experience, and I love them for that.I loved all games in Gothic series and I love all games in Risen series. From the Risen series, I would say that Risen 3 is probably the best one of them, even comparable to the golden Gothic 2.The story of this game is solid, it is not the best, not the worst. I've been quite used to bad stereotype-like stories in RPGs (especially open world ones), like TES series, Two Worlds series, or Dragon Age series (in case of more linear ones). Each of these games suffer from black-and-white storyline (from the named ones I consider the plot one of the better ones).The gameplay is typical for Piranha Bytes games. The combat system is something different, and very good (unless you just left-click all day long, which is a bad way to play this game and it can ruin your experience). It is better than in TES games, way better compared to Dragon Age series, but a lot worse compared to Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.In this game you can actually dodge hits (which is very common in medeival fencing schools), but well, don't expect realistic fight simulator. But it is action enough, you won't get bored. Plus, guns are very good addition into the game.Dialogue lines are well done, audio for them is also quite good. As for the quests, there is a whole lot of them, but I'd like more impact on game in general, and longer side quest lines. Music is one of the best, it perfectly suits the game.Visuals are also very good, very nice fire particles, water splashes and particle effects in general. The authors did quite a job on light and shadows, each single island is in a bit different stylized art set and it works perfectly. The graphics quality can compete with any other AAA game.Of course there are few things that look bad. One of them is, that after performing major actions to close gates to underworld, the islands look unchanged. For me, if green grass would return to that areas it would be perfect. I would see that I did some major impact on game world and it would made me even more happy.Second thing is, I don't really see further lore connection with Risen series, yes it is in the same world, there are some of the characters that were in previous games, but the lore connection is weak. I'm comparing mainly to Gothic 1 - Gothic 2 games here, where the lore connection between those game was really strong and good.Anyways, this game is worth it. I know it seems average, it isn't. Don't believe metacritic, as some fans of older Piranha Bytes games are downvoting, without even playing it, sadly...			"

												I think this game is brilliant :) It's got a Fable/Skyrim/Assassins Creed feel to it and personally I'm loving the combat system. I read a lot of reviews saying it was a Con and not a Pro and that scared me a bit but since it was half off I bought it anyway, and I couldn't be happier with it. The combat system is just a timing based system which requires that you read your opponent when battling them. I think that's cool and realistic really. You can riposte others attacks (turn their attack around on them) even to large monsters like golems n stuff which I think is cool, they're coming in with some massive smash attack and ur just like, NOPE *slap*. Great game. Sure I'm only 30 hours in but I think it's lovely. I'm currently a fire wizard dressed up all cool like, runnin around like prince Zuco, burning like 3-4 enemies at once, raining fire down upon my enemies! >:D and when fire doesn't work, LIGHTNING!! Anyway, if you're up for a fun single player RPG, this is a good pick. My only Con: I wish games like these could be Co-op. (Divinity: OS and Dying light for example, also great games that are Co-op.)			"

												Recomended mostly for the rock-solid fans of Gothic / Risen series.Piranha bytes classics. People blame it for not developing with this gen RPG´s. No way, this is no Skyrim when you are born a hero, this is no Assasin´s creed where you are born with skills to fight 10 enemies at once and crush them. You can reach such status in this game, but it takes time. Simply said you have to EARN your glory step by step, making it a hard work, but a rewarding one, offering a challenge on every difficulty, making the victories against every monsters count early on in the game. I personaly didn´t like the sea battles, they were... odd. Exploring the world is fun, if you´re an eager quest hunter you find yourself in this game, just as in every series made by PB. According to my time played i´m roughly beyond 20% of the world exploration, not mentioning hundreds of pending quests and main storyline not even properly started.			"

												Great console game. there are some bugs and weird things to it. I like the monkey island style hopping islands freely and adventures and quests. Like this is the best monkey island I have ever played. WTF are those little troll things with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voices?! were they in the other risen games? I don't remember them from the first one. Seriously WTF is that?! It's like if they threw Jar Jar in Monkey island. Were these old lucasarts devs? Also gameplay wise. Quest order is totally getting mixed up all over the place. I think I went to an expansion island first. there should be a better guide that knows more about where you should be going, cuz me just from guessing I am doing things in no order and it seems like i will never finish this game. Which is cool until you get to an island full of those little trolls and WTF the trolls and the goblins ughhhh... I just wanted to be a pirate and marry the guvna! Alright, it's the gothic universe. There are dinosaurs and other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's a little too weird. Too unsubtle. It's alright. Though i have found traveling to and from islands will trip out the game and also characters get lost on your quest progress and you can walk on water sometimes and walk 10 feet above the water on occassion. Anyhow. It's gonna be a long one. Don't expect me to beat it any time soon, but I do plan on playing it quite a bit more.			"

												It felt like a worthy successor to Gothic and Risen franchises to me. I loved the exploring part the most, there're a lot of unique items to collect, nice weapons or collectables that improve some stats significantly, it felt really rewarding. Music and atmosphere were to my taste too. Some locations are very memorable, like goblins village with colored lanterns at night or windy rocks of dragon hunters island. Combat system is just a traditional Gothic skill-based one one, takes some time to get used to, but is very rewarding.Cons are: tradicionally for PB games weak story, first 30 minutes of game are just bad and buggy. Sound design and voice acting are amateurish at times. Ending is an evil in lava place, that has to go away really.But i didn't care about those things much, this game gave me a great sence of adventure. I'd absolutely recommend it if you liked Gothic or Risen games, and don't listen to people that didn't even make it through first 30 minutes.			"

												Having just finished Risen 3, thought this would be a good moment to put down my thoughts..I have been a longtime fan of Piranha Bytes.  From their earliest releases such as Gothic & Gothic 2, to their jump over to the Risen series, I have always found their games to be enjoyable, but always needing more polish.  Risen 3 is no exception to this.  I stopped and started the game several times before I really sat down and played through it.  And, in the end, I'm glad I did.  It felt very much like putting back on a good pair of shoes again, just comfortable to be able to play the game, and in the end I pushed through it quickly because I wanted to get to the end.  Much like the last 2 games in the series, the ending was a little disappointing, but I did enjoy the experience of getting there.There are bugs, there are wonky issues with inventory and resolution and other items.  But, look up a few FAQs and whatnot and you can get past most of it.  From a programming side of things, the game was.. competent.  It always feels like they need just a few more months, or just some extra money, and they could pull off what would be considered to be a AAA game.I would recommend this to others, and while it is nice to have the previous experience of Risen 1 and 2, it isn't entirely necessary to have played those to enjoy this one.

												Ive been a fan of both risen games, risen is, in my opinion, one of the best old-school-rpgs out there. And risen 2 is one of the few good pirate themed rpgs in existence.This game however.. kinda sucks. Instead of fixing the problems the previous games had, it puts them on steroids.The combat in risen always had a few problems, the players windup has always been a little to long but in this game it takes AGES to throw a punch, that on its own wouldnt be to bad if the enemys had any windup at all (which they dont) they throw a barrage of attacks at you (each of them stunning you and canceling any attack youre trying to do) which leaves you two options:1. Be totally at the mercy of the enmeies AI, hoping that you get enough hits out before the lock you in place.2. Go ranged and run and jump around like a cat hoping they dont get to youThe voiceacting is beyond terrible, which is a shame considering that they got a lot of the voiceactors from the previous games back, who are even playing the same characters. They didnt do so bad back then (gruanted the dialouge was pretty cheesy at times but always beliveable) which leads me to belive they just werent given any directions or at least pretty terrible ones.The world itself is designed pretty well, they took old maps from risen 2 and modified them so it would fit the needs of this game but never to a point were you couldnt recognize them anymore, you can always remeber back how it looked ""back then"", they even have characters from the previous games who you dealt with on your journey in risen 2, thats cool, right? Not really, since youre not the same character as from the previous games, you cant really talk with them about anything from the past, which makes having them there kinda pointless.I never would hav e thought that this would be the closing statement of my review to a risen game but:DONT BUY IT!

												The only Risen game I haven't finished. It's not a particularly bad RPG, but it's too streamlined for new players while failing to hold onto old ones. The combat is simplistic compared to previous games (or even Gothic), the story is boring, the islands aren't that fun to explore, and the environment isn't that interesting (despite how beautiful the game is).I recommend picking up Risen or Risen 2 over this title, or maybe even any game within the Divinity series; all are far superior.
